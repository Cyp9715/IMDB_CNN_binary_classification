i really really liked and you know what i didnt expect to seriously i was never a fan of the character in the sense that i hardly knew anything about him and the humor as well as the violence seemed forced and overdone in the trailers still i remained interested in the film i just never expected it to actually be good  until the reviews arrived after most critics unexpectedly showered this newest superhero movie with praise i went in cautiously optimistic but still fully prepared to hate the filmthe first thing i noticed was how inventive the storytelling is the film throws you into the action from the first moment literally the very first moment and then it goes back and forth in brilliant and unexpected ways to slowly unspool the story of this insane  but oddly charming  antihero flashbacks and fastforwards can be annoying as hell but when done right they can help render even a somewhat simple story fresh and exciting and thats exactly how felt to me right from the start like a fresh if somewhat dirty jolt of energythe action itself is beautifully designed employing playful visuals and using pretty much every camera technique available it never feels repetitive and the pacing is close to perfection but and that was probably the key to me liking the film so much theres a beating heart underneath all the action and carnage and that has a lot to do with how brilliantly ryan reynolds portrays the character and the great chemistry he has with costar morena baccarin what came as a complete surprise to me was how unabashedly romantic is the love story in this film is probably the most sincere ive ever seen in a superhero movie and it gives the film the strong emotional core which so many of these movies lackthe humor which i initially feared would just be nonstop juvenile wisecracks and soon become distracting also works surprisingly well not every line or every joke lands  but thats the beauty of this character they dont really need to cant help himself as long as hes able to breathe hell crack wise and make fun of himself and those around him its a clinical condition hes not a standup comedian whose jokes need to land hes a madman albeit a very entertaining one and the comedy in his case is born out of tragedydespite all my praise its not a perfect film the villain in this revenge tale could be more memorable and the story itself is a bit too derivative to really do its highly unconventional protagonist he insists hes not a hero justice but its a damn good first entry in a franchise that will hopefully explore the character and his world to a much larger extent in the sequels and its actually a very important film for another reason if is a financial success  which at this point is already clear it will be  this could play a vital role in how studios henceforth view the financial prospects of rrated superhero films and well hopefully see more of them in the futuremany people might feel different  and i respect their opinion  but ive grown tired of the entirely bloodless cgi overkill in all those 200 million productions where even the most terrible villains talk like mormon schoolgirls i mean theres a gigantic audience out there that is over the age of 18 loves to read comic books and can absolutely handle realworld language realworld sex and realworld violence in superhero movies this genre is so diverse its ridiculous to believe just because comic books have pictures in them all film adaptations  regardless of the material  must automatically be made for kids in order to be successfulas it is i think  a dirty funny sexy and violent film which is decidedly not for kids  just proved my point perfectly 8 stars out of 10favorite films imdbcomlistmkjokvqlsbslesserknown masterpieces imdbcomlistls070242495favorite lowbudget and bmovies imdbcomlistls054808375favorite tvshows reviewed imdbcomlistls075552387,comedy
is a triumph of artistic vision over studio interference little credit should be given to 20th century fox as they had zero faith in the success of a movie to put things into perspective ryan reynolds fought for this film back in 2004 when blade trinity was released reynolds and co went to shoot test footage that was then leaked online by reynolds because fox had no intentions to release it to the public finally after years and years of begging to the studio and the overwhelming positive responses of the test footage from the public fox didnt even tell reynolds and co that the film was greenlit they had to find out online like the rest of us plebeians if that sounds bad fox even cut their budget by 7 million at the last minute which caused the writers to scratch some action sequences that im sure wouldve been great to seenow has the biggest opening weekend in the month of february surpassing fifty shades of grey the biggest opening weekend for 20th century fox surpassing all the xmen films and the biggest opening weekend for an r rated film ever surpassing the matrix reloaded with all that being said is a hilariously entertaining film that works mainly because of reynolds himself his comedic skills pay off gloriously as the titular character who gives so many quips in one instance that some jokes will be missed of course credit should be given to the writers too aka the real heroes here and its impressive that this is tim millers directorial debut the action sequences and pacing are so good that youd think this came from a veteran directorfrom the ingenious opening credits to the subversive ending constantly upends clichs and tropes youre used to seeing in superhero flicks in the past few years whats great here is the filmmakers had something weird and perverse and just went with it jokes about pedophilia pegging and sex run rampant but its never really dark despite the mature subject matter on top of that its also very refreshing to see a pansexual superhero in such a big studio film its unheard of these days fox and other studios learn from this success its not the fact that a hard rrated film can do well its that also happens to be very good most likely because you fox actually gave the filmmakers the creative freedom to do whatever the hell they wanted,comedy
at first glance seems like a typical superhero movie due to it being made by marvel but once those hilarious intro credits show up you know you are in for one of the most creative films in recent years the first thing that is unique about this film is the characters in typical superhero films the characters are stiff and super serious in the characters are filled with personality and can range from the serious francis to the silly giving this a parody like feel in a good wayalso what is different is that this is a story of revenge rather then saving the cityworlduniverse that is seen in every single superhero film also the tone of film is more comic then dark thanks to the fantastic humor of all kinds from slapstick to dirty to just plain silly this film just does not stop the laughs i laughed 20 30 times in my second watch as for being an origin story i can say that the backstory placements were well done equally as funny and explains only what is important in understanding the story final rating 1010 this is a great nominee for movie of the year and one of the greatest comedies ever made,comedy
if anyone else could be cast to play he certainly doesnt exist in this universe after ryan reynoldss dramatic failure in the green lantern film he has returned to the comic book world reynolds is absolutely phenomenal as the foul mouthed and witty anti hero i mean he is just superb he completely owns the role and gives a fantastic performance if robert downey jr is iron man then ryan reynolds is he is also such a liveable character and by the end of the film i genuinely cared about i never thought id say that all of the performances are great no one holds a candle to reynolds but i will say not one person was miscast hereis a unique film and a huge gamble both marvel and the studios bringing us this film took a major risk this is a beloved character and his world is very different than other marvel films right off the bat this film is consciously selfaware it knows its a comic book film with comic book characters and it actually exploits it many times turns to the audience and tells us what were all thinking it was so different and it worked so very well the narrative itself is also different its very nonlinear the events of the film dont play out in a normal straight narrativeone of the trademarks nay the trademark of is his sense of humour this film is by far one of the most hysterical films i have seen in some time the writing is so perfect so sharp and so full of witty banter and thankfully it all works not one joke that i remember fell flat the film had me laughing constantly from the opening credits all the way to the after credits sceneas for the action its also very satisfying many action films today are butchered by terrible camera work for whatever reason many modern action films are using shaky cam instead of clear steady shots the dp will go hand held and shake the camera violently the worst example in recent memory of this is taken 3 thankfully there are films like this and others that know exactly how to do a good action scene director tim miller and cinematographer ken seng do a brilliant job creating slick good looking action not only is the action brutal and extremely bloody its just co clear and well handled the fights are really great here i couldnt help but be reminded of tarantinos kill bill films while watching they are incredibly similar in their style of fight scenessitting in the cinema the inner critic in me struggled internally i kept thinking afterwards about the film what were the flaws i dont often see a film without pointing out the negatives even films i really like or even love have flaws im certain that if one sits and picks this apart you will eventually find some flaws perhaps the overall story is paper thin perhaps the villain wasnt very compelling as character then again ajax was honestly serviceable ed skrein gave a great performance and by the end you really hate the bastard hes a generic or a dick british villain and the film makes fun of thatand guardians of the galaxy were both huge risks that ultimately paid off big time as a film its nearly perfect the film does exactly what it needed to do and more it introduces sets up his character and gets you to like him if you didnt already the non linear narrative was refreshing to see in a superhero film everything about this film was different and unique its self awareness and breaking of the fourth wall work well really well the direction is great ryan reynolds is phenomenal and the script is fantastic,comedy
firstly i would like to state that it is completely hilarious reading reviews with one star because the movie had foul language and sex scenes or that someone had no idea that the movie was inappropriate for their 9 year old kid is rated r and with 3 minutes of research you could have determined if this movie was for you or not with that being said i will not delve into the plot but the acting and writing were fantastic ryan reynolds nailed this role if you are easily offended by violence language or nudity this is not the movie for you but if you have a sense of humor and want to be entertained for 2 straight hours you will love this movie,comedy
i am aware that to many people especially those unfamiliar with comic or marvel comics at all this movie would seem too gory unnecessary brutal and excessively violent but this movie is a comedy where its main protagonist should be perceived as a comedian and ryan reynolds did an excellent job representing this characterthe story of isnt complex or profound  and it wasnt meant to be this movie is all about fun and entertainment abundant with action jokes blood and foul language therefore it is not suitable for children i grew tired of people thinking that movies based on comics are intended for children onlyrelated to that i believe that many marvel movies could have been far more successful if they didnt refrain from gory scenes i am sorry but if you want to make a serious combatbased movie and you make it without blood than that movie will be all but seriousthat is why i see as a refreshment nowadays many writers and directors are too worried about political correctness in their movies that really stifles creativity and that is why today we have so many movies with great ideas but poor realizationthus to me was a very pleasant surprise i had fun watching it and i intend to watch it again some time soon,comedy

let me say at the very beginning of this review i loathe super hero movies i can not stress that point enough for me watching anyone of the countless driveling movies which have been pumped out by studios in the name of entertainment over the past decade is for me akin to having teeth pulled painful to say the least my friends however are addicted to every single bombastic franchise and through sufferance ive endured countless hours of mind numbing boredom watching yet more lycraclad numpties saving the earth from ridiculous threat there are of course exceptions to the above the dark knight the original xmeni was once again convinced that spending an evening with chums watching would be an excellent waste of my time i envisaged 15 minutes of feigned interest followed by an hour 45 of updating my email and some cheeky online shopping well that new morphy richards kettle and toaster are still waiting for me to purchase as low and behold shock of all shocks this film is bloody marvellous bloody hold your knickers cause they are about to get blown off marvellousthe dialogue is witty sincere and delivered by every single actor with a naturalism which seems more like improvised off the cuff genius than drab scripted nonsensethe pacing of the movie is excellent it held my interest through its entiretythe actions scenes directed with the skill of a more seasoned directori was so pleased that for once i was being forced to watch a movie that treated me like an adult with adult humour and themes made for adults not for grown children masquerading as adultsthis film is a perfect storm just everything is right i look forward to my great surprise to any squeals,comedy
the long awaited is finally and with its much talked about hard r rating starring ryan reynolds as a quick taking fourth wall breaking insult throwing masked superhero we hear about how became told in flashback sequences while simultaneously following a present day plot as well the question for the average movie goer is is this film really as good and as raunchy as everyone says no it isnt i dont mean to ramble much so ill start with the good this film does have some humorous moments and most of the supporting characters are very entertaining to watch and yes this film also does have some good action sequencessadly that is where the good ends this films tries very hard to be edgy and raunchy as well as claiming to not be your average marvel film because of those following reasons but let me assure you this film is most definitely very similar to all of the other marvel films by saying fuck a few times showing breasts at a strip club and throwing childish insults such as dicktits is not smart filmmaking or screen writing it is easy adolescent humor this film has a simple plot that is easy to follow and is spoonfed to you i have seen good comedies and i have seen good superhero films and this excels in neither in this films defense it may not try to be anything other than feel goodfunturnyourbrainoff type film but that within itself is lazy filmmaking i shouldnt have to turn my brain off to have enjoy a film,comedy
ive said it in other reviews that no movie is perfect there arent any movies that actually deserve a perfect score but what if you were a fan and you heard that an actor that was a huge fan too and had already played the character once with horrible results wished for redemption what if you wanted a comic book movie that would rise above the whole pg13 cesspool far too many movies are thrown into these days what character would be completely drowned in such a pool wolverine somehow treads that water even with a metal skeleton though he did finally get unleashed with an r rated send off film possibly partly thanks to this movie but could never have been done right in a pg13 movie the merc with the mouth had to have his lips sowed shut the first go round and after that well most fans would say he was never truly including the man who played himryan reynolds deserves significant praise for his persistent pursuit of playing a real and boy does he the r rating took the comic book genre to a sparkly place i wish it would have gone to years ago oh yeah is this movie satisfying for that alone and reynolds nails it possibly thanks to the fact that he actually caredbut how good is it as a movie aside from all that well i gave it a ten it might be more of a nine out of ten movie if it wasnt so special it was the first r rated movie of its kind and it proved to the people and the studios that it could be extremely successful even with that rating thank you you deserve an extra star for that alone,comedy
one word describes this movie  pointlesswow this film was incredibly boring people are hyping this movie over nothing the story is so simple and boring it didnt even feel like i was watching a thoughtprovoking movie more like a short and simple tv series with an unfunny forced and pointless main character on his pointless adventure to fight forgettable and pointless villains the xmen were pointless as well they didnt add anything to the story they only assisted with fighting the villains when their original goal was to have work for them they happily accepted as a murderer and wished a murderer to join them the only okay point in this movie was the action however the action still could have been better as it felt very rushed at times and at other times very short and at times it lacked in good choreography it didnt feel intense at all more like you know the villains are going to fail very easilyi also hated the use of childish words being used quite a bit to explain the purpose of the weapon x program eg superheroes superslaves etc what are these villains even doing there was nothing deep and meaningful behind the program and these villains the story was lacking in too many ways the world felt very empty and hollowlooks like people are very cheap and easy nowadays that they would enjoy anything just because it is rrated that is the truth that is the only reason this movie has such a high rating because of the use of f words and other vulgar words it has sex and nude scenes and it is gory and violent none of this is new again the story and characters are terrible,comedy
in a world where superhero movies are often unnecessarily dark and gritty comes along and shows you how its done its the perfect combo of action comedy and rrating that really dont give two shts about your sensitivity do you remember that warm blueberry pie that your grandma made for you when you were younger or the time you saw that girl youve been crushing on during chemistry class in high school well you can throw those memories out the window now and make way for deadpoolryan reynolds plays a skilled special forces operative turned mercenary wade wilson morena baccarin plays his hotass girlfriend vanessa this woman is the embodiment of sexy they are a match made in marvel comics heaven but their dream is crushed upon discovering that wilson has cancer all over a situation that forces him to sign up to a rogue experiment that subjects him to accelerated healing powers the lab is run by francisajax ed skrein who himself is a bit of a mutant the brutal experiments turn wade wilson into an ugly dude but an indestructible one hes now bent on revenge especially after ajax kidnaps vanessa meanwhile colossus and negasonic teenage warhead from the xmen try their best to convince to join their team and become one of the good guys but lets face it that aint style the first people we have to thank of course would be the original comic book writerscreators fabian nicieza and rob liefeld who brilliantly gave us this very unique superhero unlike any other the next people in line to thank are screenwriters rhett reese and paul wernick who remind us why we loved zombieland back in 2009 they inject the same brand of humor into and keep the character faithful to the comic books yes by that i mean none of that crap version of wade wilson in xmen origins wolverine anymore applause goes to tim miller as well what a helluva feature directorial debut clearly when you give a superhero project to a geek who loves the material and knows it inside out if you just let him run with it its like giving gi joe toys to a kid who can name them all by heart great things can happenfor those of you who are not familiar with just a heads up this movie just like the comics is extremely over the top graphic in terms of sex violence and humor and thats exactly how we like it wade wilson is a chatterbox he talks a lot to some this can get annoying while to the rest its music to our ears mainly because of the sht he says and he breaks fourth wall meaning hell talk to you the audience but whats even more epic than that is the fact that he is aware of the universe that hes in and the universe that youre in and those two collide in the most epic way possible so ryan reynolds character wade wilson makes fun of ryan reynolds the actor and also mocks ryan reynolds previous poor decisions like green lantern and people magazines sexiest man alive this movie is a dream come true for those of you hardcore fans it even has what i think is one of the greatest most hilarious opening credit scenes in the history of cinema for a while i heard that the studio wanted the film to include more mutants but im glad the filmmakers kept things to just a few characters for this first installment aka origin story so its simple enough for the new fans to follow i love how the humor is so brash and unapologetic its like insult comedy or one of them roast shows everybody is fair game the fights are rock em sock em and the vfx is impressive and i cant be happier for ryan reynolds im sure he had been wanting to redeem himself since green lantern and whatever the hell that was in xmen origins wolverine so with this movie he finally got it right you can tell he desperately wanted to be part of this superhero genre and so now hes really part of the gang he was born for this role he was destined to play this in many ways is kinda like van wilder on crack and actress morena baccarin as vanessa well lets just say that after watching this movie every guy on earth will wonder why cant my girlfriend be more like that if youre looking for a date movie is it if youre looking for an actionpacked movie is definitely most certainly it,comedy
if you enjoy sitting in on conversations that are typical of young and foolish teenage boys this is the movie for you every other line contains the f word and for some reason the director thought penis jokes are the funniest aroundthe story is about as hollow as the humor its a cheap and bland story about revenge and invincibility painted with a veneer of love that is as misguided as the characters personalitythe movie is littered with sarcasm and cynicism that just becomes depressing after a whileryan reynolds acts like a 13 year old boy throughout the movie cursing and making penis jokes and then talking to the audience thinking he is very funny this is the most overrated movie ive seen most of these reviews on imdb had to have been paid for hollywood had to have paid for this hype or people these days have really low standards this is a low brow film like no othersave 2 hours of your life and do not watch this movie,comedy
first off i do not read comics so i do not know the source material i am not a fanboy of marvel or dc i just want to see entertaining movies i may be in the minority at least during its first week of being in theaters but i wanted to write a review to warn others what is likethe movie is honestly a nonstop exercise in profanity with a lot of sex jokes and masturbation jokes especially i am fine with low brow humor when it is funny the writers just seem to have reynolds throw out as many wisecracks as possible and hope that some are funny i think anyone over 30 will be bored with the jokes there is nothing that offends me from hearing all these jokes but rather bores me because the lack of humor it is very much like having to listen to some teen kids try to show off by using non stop profanity only to realize they are just making themselves look dumbthe plot is nothing more than a simple background origins story and it is run of the mill the movie has a lot of violence but nothing creative the movie is very similar to super and the kick ass movies however those movies were superior to on every level imo the movie also reminds me of the vacation remake the 2015 remake of vacation was pretty much one raunchy joke after another but they are not funnythis movie may just be better for younger audiences but i still feel the 30 and up demographics are not going to find this to be a very good movies unless they are a fan of the source materiali give it a 2 out of 10 it gets an 2 instead of 1 only because morena baccarin was a side character she did the best she could with the limited materialdean,comedy
poor childish jokes hundreds of sexual assault scenes where it was supposed to be empowering and quite frankly idiotic levels of feminist nonsense where you knew the female villains were going to beat up the male ones regardless of realismits one of those films that if you are 11 years old you might enjoy but considering the rest of the content you would never let your 11 year old watch it thus it massively missed its markpunching people in the groin is not funny it stopped being funny back in 1990 when i was 11 when will hollywood realise that and if you are going to do things like that at least have some gender balance and have it happen to women as well,comedy
the film is made out of ryan reynolds throwing lame jokes to the camera in between there are bullets and knifes no surprises no ideas the story is simple and silly and boring man sleeps with woman long in different scenes teens hello better watch porn there are more details man gos to basement to become special teens like to be special man becomes special and kills all bad guys around him the endthe jokes are not only lame they are old for example the joke with the red shirt and brown trousers i heard from my grandpadont waste your time with this film marvell tries to squeeze out last cents out of the theme bad films will follow,comedy
this movie is a huge disappointment and a waste of money and time the jokes are stupid and i realize that is not what it was cracked up to be too bad as i usually love the marvel movies it seems forced and the jokes actually become tedious and not really with any sophistication at any level more adolescent bathroom style humor the story and plot is also dull and tedious which goes along with the dull and tedious jokes at times i thought to walk out but kept hoping that there would be a redeeming aspect as many of the reviews were positive i kept hoping this movie is more about moneymaking hype with its non existent storyplot and childish humor with no depth a huge disappointment,comedy
if ive to keep it short  the movie is really really badthere are plenty of jokes plenty even when yo dont want one these jokes are true to but thats it they are the jokes would crack but most of the time they missed the mark and were not even remotely funnytheres absolutely no story in the movie none at all on top of that if youve watched all the trailers watching movie is worthless the entire story is  ajax converted wade into searched him to fix his face and once its cleared that ajax is not going to do that killed him yeah entire 10 minutes stretched into a almost 2 hour movie on top of that for some reason ajax kidnaps pools girlfriend and sets target on his back it makes no senseapart from jokes also has inner voice but not in this movie hes most of the time blabbering to himself because of that making it much more unfunnythere cannot be much said about the movie as its just extended trailer done badly,comedy
out of all marvel movies made was the worst the main character talks too much it became very annoying after 5 minutes the jokes were not funny the scene transition between flashbacks and present conditions were not well donethey tried to put in 2 xmen character in the worst possible way it really shows that the studio had no budget for many characters but instead they invested a lot in the slowmotion special effect which was coolin terms of storyline theres no story theres no character building as well for about 2 hours all you can do is endure the horrible blabber mouth of the main character not funny and irritate the eari wonder how many people did the studio pay to write in good reviews in this websiteworst marvel movie ever,comedy
barney the dinosaur is more entertaining than this movie yeah sure when he cracks one or two jokes its funny but my gosh he would go on and on  regarding the sexual scenes of the movie if one wants to watch porn theyd watch porn i dont know which woman enjoys a man that talks from beginning to end  even during sex he is cracking lame jokes cant get any more ridiculous than that  as for the storyline  couldnt they add a little more detail its like they thought making him blabber throughout the movie will allow them to cut some finer details out one of the worst movies ever made in the last century ,comedy
we live in a time where super hero movies are all the rage who doesnt love a good super hero throw down cool origin stories and awesome villains while decent hero flicks are easy enough to find occasionally a masterpiece like the dark knight will come along and in the process wow the critics and audiences alikeand then we get where to start with this one to give it some comparison it makes batman and robin look like an academy awardwinner by comparison how is that quite simply put the movie is terrible in every sense of the wordis untrue to its source material and to the very character himself the character is known for his violence and humor throughout his comic book tv show and video game appearances the filmmakers in their apparent efforts to make the character more edgy and appeal more to adults have stripped him of this instead replacing the comedy and fun with crude dialogue sex sex more sex and more foul words than possibly all of eminem and lil waynes albums combined and all of this without any of the substance that have made wade wilsons adventures and misadventures alike over the years so memorable exciting and laughoutloud funny no wit and no soul it insults the intelligence of its audience and then expects them to pay weve come a long way in terms of the quality of super hero films to call this a step back could potentially be the biggest understatement of the yearfor those who have been waiting for a good film this unfortunately is not it perhaps the best onscreen appearance to date can be found in the animated short hulk vs wolverine but for the time being were still going to have to wait for our favorite merc with the mouth to get the bigscreen sensation that he deserves,comedy
based on the marvel comics character of the same name it is the eighth installment in the xmen film series it follows wade wilson who after being subjected to an experiment that leaves him with new abilities hunts down the man who nearly destroyed his lifefrom the studio that inexplicably sewed his beep mouth shut the first time comes it may not have been the superhero that hollywood wanted but hes certainly the one they deserve after years of speculation as to whether or not everyones favourite antisuperhero would actually get made into a standalone picture tim millers has arrived do not let the february release date fool you this is very much the film that both fans of the character and ryan reynolds have been waiting for full of comedic snark and constant fourth wall breaks and inception style fourth wall breaks within those it delivers every bit upon its promise a truly entertaining ride from start to finish minutes into opening credits you are gracefully dropped into the selfaware world of the film with notable credits such as directed by an overpaid tool and produced by beephats if that does not sell you on what kind of comedy brings to the table then you can always catch a screening of zoolander 2 next door when it comes down to it is one part vendetta film one part romantic tale a la beauty and the beast style this is the role that ryan reynolds were born to play its been a passion project for the actor for many years and it shows he is to the franchise the sequel were already planned ahead of its release what robert downey jr is to iron man you cannot imagine anyone else possibly playing the role erased from memory is the xmen origins wolverine version that reynolds played in 2009 what a relief the tiein to the world of xmen is somewhat limited aside from the inclusion of colossus and negasonic teenage warhead i will not saying more at the end of the day rewatch factor is sky high possibly the most important success of them all im touching myself tonight,comedy
ryan reynolds is the embodiment of the character he did an absolutely awesome job and made the movie as epic as it is in my opinion his sense of humour perfectly matches that of the original character before watching the movie i was a bit afraid the story of wade would slowdown the rollercoaster ride bit it is nicely scattered throughout the movie not so much to lose track of the original storyline and not too little to be oblivious of where the superhero comes from i think i would have enjoyed it a bit more if more of the marvel universe was pulled into the story but im not completely sure of it  the fourth wall being broken here and there is very refreshing and very deadpool,comedy
a sharptongued mercenary wade wilson ryan reynolds loves the girl of easy virtue vanessa morena baccarin and is going to marry her idylls come to an end when doctors diagnose wades incurable stage of cancer in the hope of remaining alive he agrees to participate in an experimental program whose creators promise not only to cure wilson but also to endow him with superpowers wade becomes immortal but his face is disfigured and in this form he is not going to return to his beloved  wearing a mask and taking the name the new mutant must find the one who turned it into a monster and make it return its former beautyeven if until recently you have not heard anything about the creators of the project about the talkative nonperperable have done everything to correct this oversight the promo campaign of the project was unprecedented then positioning it as a romantic comedy for valentines day then advertising billboards with emoji over the past months it has been decidedly impossible to get away from and it worked perfectly given that wilson is one of the few comic book heroes who constantly interacts with the audience and knows that they are being watched by the partiesthis chip is 100 used in the debutant tim millers film which the oscar nominee in the category of animated shorts hopes to punch his way to hollywood the new unlike the silent assassin who appeared in wolverine is exactly what his fans wanted to see he does not stop he jokes with a joke and severely annihilates his enemies while being able to regularly remind him that he is very pleased with the company of spectatorsdestruction of the notorious fourth wall is the highlight of which seems to make it closer to the public like this guy is talking to you hes in the board he listens to the same music as you watches the same films and jokes the same way in terms of humor the film of course tries to please everyone and everything stebut film adaptation of the xmen hugh jackman and liam neeson but at the same time very often hochma is not of the most intellectual kind which would have done the honor of writing a sorting comedy and between the gags of different categories it is not possible to establish even a shaky balance  the scales bow inexorably to the side where they laugh at everything below the belt is it less than that lets make a discount on the specifics of the main character  after all he does not have everything in order and as practice shows all the same it is much easier to attract a mass audience with a vulgar joke beyond the foul rather than trying to humor subtly and intellectuallyif you can argue about the comic component  it eventually turns out all the same to an amateur  then visually problems do not arise the introductory actionscene is so ingenious that it raises the bar very high  its hard to reach it later but its rather a script problem that does not offer the protagonist really serious trials and with ordinary problems in the face of armed scoundrels and even the main boss copes easily and more than spectacularly  the benefit of the studio has agreed to an adult rating which allows without hesitation to dismember bodies and splash blood in all directionsdo not expect from the swirling drama  this story is simple and trivial and in it there is really little heroic but a lot of romance because the main engine of the plot is the desire of a man to look good and like his woman primitivism with a touch of nostalgia which plays great in contrast to the profound modern films about superheroes where questions of a far more global character are being solved is different and it can not be bad or good  its just that way,comedy
hooo boy the year has barely started and already we have shots fired in the battle to earn your comic book movie love and dollars marvel has come charging out of the gate after a dearth of comic book films last year comes out swinging giving us a reason to love the summer again and it aint even march the film begins with an ambitious opening scene the credits of which perfectly set the tone of the movie from the getgo funny irreverent and selfaware marvel appears to have adopted a doctrine of making their films be entertaining imagine that above any other concerns and seems to be a culmination of that philosophy it is a testament to the skill and commitment of marvel and the makers that they can get so much mileage out of one second tier character and half the budget than other companies can with four first rate ones fantastic or otherwise way to redeem yourself 20th century fox not bad for a character that was a created as a joke for the noninitiated started life as a blatant clone of deathstroke a character from dc comics marvels main competitorin all this the film is aided in great part by a crackling script that never lets up whereas too many action movies treat the scenes between set pieces as filler packed with exposition and the occasional comic relief deftly weaves between wise cracking slapstick violent acrobatics and scenes of serious peril with effortless ease the result of all of this is a movie that is engaging throughout whether featuring profane brilliant banter or graphical bloody shootouts for the film wears that r rating proudly with enough sex and violent to make paul verhoeven get all mistyeyed it is not surprise there is already a sequel in the worksanother revelation here is reynolds himself who in seems to have found his iron man a character so indelibly linked to the actor that plays him that you cannot imagine anyone else playing him and his work here acts as vindication of that whole wolverine debacle which we wont mention ever again but the secret ingredient in the stew is geek heroine morena baccarin who besides being cute as a button brings the acting chops honed in fan favorites like gotham and firefly or even as the darnest adorable reptilian alien ever in the shortlived v reboot baccarin has the perfect easygoing confidence to match reynolds sardonic bravado and their superb and convincing onscreen chemistry provides the impetus for heroic arcfor despite all the foul language gore and masturbation jokes this is a story that is surprisingly tender it turns out it wasnt just a marketing gimmick and really is a love story to be sure one with more severed body parts than your average love yarn but a love story nonetheless starting a new franchise is always risky and studios hate taking risks whatever your stance on comic books is the fact remains this movie should not have been this good the writers and director have shown what can be achieved with bold writing and an unapologetic attitude and more importantly that comic book movies need not be made for kids to be enjoyable or indeed successful heres to hoping that trend will continue hopefully hollywood will take noticeparents briefrated r running time 108 minutes on sex and violence plenty of both there is graphic violence of the gratuitous kind people get shot in all kinds of places and i mean their bodies not exotic locations limbs get bloodily cut off a lot of foul language which i dont mind but im not here to judge and his love interest get into some vigorous love making and elsewhere there is some brief frontal nudity boobies boobies are shown so yeah dont take the kids,comedy
id never heard of this film the only reason i sat through it all was because i was on a long distance flight and it was part of the inflight entertainment entertained i was not now there are two kinds of bad films ones that are so bad they are funny and the others that are just bad unfortunately this falls into the latter category it would not be possible to put a plot spoiler in this review since the film has no plot basically someone decided to make a film with the usual explosions car crashes and gun fire and put a really camp guy in a red suit and give him as many awful unfunny one liners as possible to perfect the badness of the awful script they found a really bad actor to deliver unfunny lines although granted even al pacino could not make this script goodthe only thing fascinating about this film is the fact that somebody made it edited it and released it not noticing how truly awful this film is if i were an actor i would be so embarrassed to be associated this film this really could go down as one of the worst films ever made but not in a good way i would not have believed with a budget of 58000000somebody could make such a truly terrible film its just incredibly bad,comedy
i enjoyed every minute in this movie this will become an instant classic and one of the best movies marvel has made from the first scene i was blown away if you are 12 or older i highly recommend you watch this movie i cant say more without spoiling the movie so go see it i was at the cinema with my girlfriend and she is not a fan but after she saw the movie she wanted to buy the comics to learn more about him this is how good the movie was the first 15 20 minutes of the movie are probably the best intro to a movie i have ever seen and here is a tip stay after the ending credits you will not regret it,comedy
wanna know what reading a comic is like its like waking up pantsless ferociously hung over and covered in a variety of cuts bruises and condiments but then getting to eat a big stack of pancakes off the back of the hooker still sleeping next to you or it infects your brain enough that those are the sort of similes youre liable to cough up and yet for the reigning king of contemporary nerd humour who plays like a cross between kickass and a canadian guardians of the galaxy smaller scale and more belligerent its been surprisingly agonizing bringing everyones favourite chimichangachomping merc with the mouth to the big screen and youd better be wearing the brown pants if you bring up that xmen origins garbage thankfully foxs common sense was tingling so fans think long and hard snicker about the uncompromising mostly amoral fullon bonkers movie youd lacerate any limb for your wishes have finally been granted debut director tim miller manages the impossible a film quintessentially built on fan service that doesnt suck its appropriate that has borrowed dmx as his theme tune at least until the george michael kicks in because this crudely charitable spirit ebbs throughout the flick want some deliciously profane sex and hyperviolencestuffed whimsy replete with a guardianscalibre hilariously onpoint soundtrack and the comics fourth wallshattering snark integrated in a way thats actually funny how about daring to dream even bigger a big studio production that mercilessly pokes fun at its skittish budget cuts the former cinematic bungling of the titular antihero and even the requisite hugh jackman appearance in every xmen spin off  even the magical jizzing unicorn of a superhero origin story without waiting an hour for the lead to appear in costume want all of that wade gon give it to ya but dont make the mistake of dismissing the film as a featurelength meme miller is savvy enough to understand theres more to than quips and dismemberment sure the plot is about as flimsy and insubstantial as anything but like a messier crunchier guardians thats not the point the point lies in the emotional and character beats where miller delivers in wadeser spades like most of cinemas funniest psychotic humour roots in real pain and miller doesnt shy away lingering on the physical and emotional pain of wilsons cancer and his multifaceted torture in attempting to cure it through forcible scientific mutation to a genuinely uncomfortable extent to ensure that neither plays as gratuitous but lest you be feeling goth enough to slink off to the premiere of blade iii the films real surprise is yet in store for all the gleeful irony of its valentines day release is a surprisingly heartfelt hilarious and tragic romance at its core yes really only the most poolschooled readers would recognize that peeling away the irreverence pancakes and phallic samurai swords reveals a hugely selfconscious sentimental sap within but miller is clearly one of the initiated appropriately some of the films most charming hilarious and devastating scenes involve wilson daring to let his guard down enough to fall in love and like a redditrattling phantom of the opera too crushingly ashamed to reconnect after his superpowered facelift leaves him looking like as tj millers weasel puts it an avocado had sex with an older avocado this is about as profound as the character ever really gets but theres poignancy and pathos to be gleaned from wilsons grubby fumbling at sentiment and miller and reynolds nail it here but dont worry  were still miles away from the doom n gloom of the average contemporary superhero austerity and their generic all the cgi sets crumble climaxes sure being pared down to three action sequences does draw attention to its comparatively tiny budget but in this age of bloated superhero excess seeing fights kept this lean is a godsend in itself even if it werent clinched by a notsosubtle hysterical recurring gag justifying their sparsity still were hardly left wanting the fights are short snappy creatively ultraviolent count the bullets being the most meta and thrilling and stylish as hell just as they should be while fellow x folk colossus flawlessly animated and finally russian a hilariously pofaced foil and brianna hildebrands amiably sulky negasonic teenage warhead allow for some buddy banter and help keep the action beats bumping all the while theres no secret that is the ryan reynolds show though and his burning passion for the character fuels a now careerdefining performance imbued with the divine gift to make even the crudest riffing gleam with cheery sparky charisma reynolds nails each beat of wacky humour springy physicality and seething volcanic rage and hurt so effortlessly theres the uncanny feeling of him dripping ink from being lifted off the pages of a comic despite having to combat a disappointingly underwritten part morena baccarin matches reynolds in adorable damaged snappiness steering just shy of sultry manicpixiedreamgirl stereotype by keeping the right amount of crazy in her eyes tj miller is consistently hilarious and uncompromisingly unsentimental as wilsons buddy weasel while ed skrein as that british villain brings enough pompous brawny sadism to make his francisahem ajax only feel slightly generic the underused leslie uggams is perfectly salty as crusty roommate blind al not an abductee here making a recurring ikea joke surprisingly sweet meanwhile keep your eyes peeled for half of vancouver in the background were all in there somewhere id waste time with more adjectives but you get the idea and can use a thesaurus as well as me basically miller and reynolds have delivered the most cathartically satisfying cinematic imaginable sure to capture the hearts or slice off the heads of diehards or inductees alike dead2l soon please wham9510,comedy
this movie is awful and is only liked by 10 years old its pointless and half the movie doesnt make sense dont waste your money or time only fan boys and people who dont take movies seriously enjoy these type of dumb movies i guess it takes no plot terrible acting and a few funny jokes to make a movie the fact this movie made so much money is beyond me there was no effort involved the director  the producer and actors should be ashamed theyre robbing you of your money and times they just make a few funny jokes and its rated a high 8 rating like is that all you need a few funny jokes and no plot whats so ever to make a good movie i can go on and on but just dont waste your time  sucks,comedy
i expected an epic out of this but i rather got boring and juvenile storythis movie is full of unparliamentary dialougues and nothing inspiring aboutis this what we give to our friends and family to watch  btw ryan renolds did excellent job in the moviei didnt get why wolverine was in the movieis he there to get kicked by deadpoolthe films biggest weakness if it has one is in its supporting characters  theres just not a lot for them to do fellow superpowered beings  colossus stefan kapicic negasonic teenage warhead brianna hildebrand and angel dust gina carano  mostly just stay out of his way though colossus and negasonic each have their moments tj miller is effective as deadpoolwade wilsons bff weasel but he feels like he was just ported over from hbos silicon valley where he plays a startup bro ajax the movies main villain is sinister and goodlooking but his mutant ability  not being able to feel pain  doesnt make him feel like much of a threat,comedy
with a brilliant script visceral action and a oscarworthy performance by lead ryan reynolds 2016s takes superhero and comedy films into a new direction and proves that comic book movies still have a lot more to offerproof of the benefits of filmmakers taking risks rather than following the working formula takes the superhero genre and heightens it with its unapologetic offensive humor bloody and intense violence as well as a excellent cast and script is an example to not only based ones characters and stories off of the original material but to embrace the heart and soul of the comic book medium as a whole,comedy
too overrated i think the jokes that are included in the movie are interesting but to be honest the plot is kinda boring and made me bored while im watching thisfor me the plot is the vital point of movies if this movie were more focused on the plot than the jokes i think itll be better and more exciting this movie was like bunch of jokes with some plot not a plot filled with bunch of jokes id give this movie high rating if they built more plotthis movie are overrated and i dont want to watch a sequel as boring as this,comedy
this has become my 21 yo sons new favorite movie my 16 yo daughter loves it too they both love comicbook movies but my wife who like me can take them batman or leave them lots to list here also liked iti dont get it i have a pretty high tolerance for profanity i made it thru straight outta compton without flinching and am willing to get past excessive violence if theres something left when you get past all that the matrix is one of my top 5 i loved city of god  but when you strip away the sometimes clever profanity and wellstaged violence theres literally nothing left herei dont get it,comedy
this movie marketing is much better than the movie itself i expected it would be great welldirected and wellwritten but the fact is its just kickass with marvel package violence comedy romance violence comedy romance violence comedy romance pointless meaningless bad script bad directed so many movies have better romance story the raid has better action scenes and the jokes in this movie are crude dumb and dirty with a bunch of pop references that will get outdated fast not even understood by people outside america this movie tries so hard to entertain but its boring its absolutely cheap this movie just tries to make you laugh thats all theres no good stroy mark wahlberg should be in it most overhyped movie so far,comedy
its an overrated movie with curses written by some 12 year old no story no real plot the film could have done without the villain this film deserves a 5 or 6 stars at the highest the reason i am giving it a 1 is due to its over rating the film mainly attract audiences of 1625 years just a cash grab film simply marvels worst and theres the feminism there the heroine always has to save the hero now ryans acting was good in this movie it suited him the cgi wasnt bad but if this movie were to come out before the iron man then it wouldve got 45 stars there are some marvel films which deserve higher rating instead of this movie ,comedy
predictable story with no twists not funny at all very very conservative boring plot all movie goers appr 35 yesterday evening were disappointed i wonder how is it possible that got such a high rating on imdb even adolescent kids in the movie were bored after 20 minutes of pseudoaction without any sense the plot seems to have been written by unimaginative conservative men who wanted to make business by trying to give the main character an anarchic behavior didnt work out is a simple conservative guy who is not interesting at all not what he is doing not what he is suffering not what he is loving an empty character nobody will feel for him or with him out of the cinema i cannot even remember why he was part of that  ergh  movie,comedy
i knew that new flicks tend to get unrealistically high scores on imdb from all the fans and still just bought the tix when i saw 87 rating for this hoping for a guardians of the galaxylike gem should always read what people are saying first this is just a bad movie for about a quarter of it i expected it to turn into a kickassstyle trashcomedy but it did not it was a just a badly written badly scripted movie with good fx budgeti think you will only like it if you are a diehard fan or a 1214 year oldotherwise waste of time and money,comedy
the first question i want to give to everyone here how this got more than three colors grand hotel budapest or more than english patient here is no any directors work here is no actor play it is just extremely boring and defective movie for kids not for an adult personi can get that many people like comics films ok but so huge amount of toilet humor so huge amount of vulgar in bad sense of this word it is not really comics film it is just some kind of mix cheap comedy thriller and a superhero film i literally felt myself ashamed during watching this like someone can see me watching this and get bad opinion about meif my review will be publicated person who a reading this and deciding to watch or no please spend youre time during watching one of those films that i listed before not watching this,comedy
i think it is too bad that they are warping the super hero genre with all of the stupid juvenile sex jokes its like they wanted to mix the humor of the movie superbad which is aimed at that kind of purulent dung how many f bombs nudity and references to masturbation can your movie contain they even included a scene of cartoon characters humping supposedly ryan reynolds visited sick kids dressed up like warping sick kids minds one child at a time gee mom and dad can i see the movie my new hero is as one who grew up reading marvel comics this is very depressing im sure this will be only the beginning of perverting the franchise the box office count was so very successful this world is getting sicker and sicker,comedy
i was really looking forward to as im a ryan reynolds fan and its rated rhowever the humor is toilet humor its about farts jerking off and comments about actors including reynolds himself and other moviesthe plot is that wade wilson gets terminal cancer and in order to save his life he agrees to undergo an experiment that will give him the power to heal however ajax the man that turn people into mutants and sometimes just kill them cant be trusted and ajax who is the villain is played by the awful ed skrein from the awful reboot of transporter ajax tortures wade and the lab explodes i cant remember why and wade has become scarred and takes the new identity as he starts to kill a lot of people looking for ajax but even though the movie is rated r some scenes where he tortures badguys are actually not shown ajax in a desperate attempt to stop wade kidnaps wades boney girlfriend and wade has to get help from the two most annoying xmen characters i have ever seen some lesbian looking teenage girl with a shaved head and a cgirussian guy made out of metalthe violence is awesome and a welcome change from the bloodless marvel violence however all the violence can be seen in the red band trailer and the rest is crap so if youve seen the trailer i recommend not watching the movie as you will be really disappointedbringing xmen into the movie is annoying as hell as ive always hated the xmen and wade talking to the camera gets really annoying after a whileon top of that the action itself is disappointing as this is clearly a low budget movieavoid this and watch the first kickass movie not the second one if you like violent superhero movies,comedy
this the most smartass smug and arrogant film i have ever seen it is like an annoying teenager who wont stop shouting and swearing to get your attention before saying i dont care what you think when you know very well they do care what you think it wants to seem fresh and clever but panders to its unpleasant teenage audience by including mediocre violence a linear super hero origin movie plot limited fourth wall breaks that are not creative and constant swearing the narrative structure is irritating as it constantly flips back and forth in time which stops you becoming engrossed in the action the main character is very unlikeable he comes across as an aged school bully and the other characters are not memorable at all particularly the bland villain and the protagonists girlfriend who is a stripper thats not sexist at all he only breaks the fourth wall by talking to the audience which so many other films do already and the satire doesnt work as it seems just like the films its satirising just with more swearing the only clever joke i recall is the opening credits that i wont spoil if you actually want to watch this film from then on it is boring unpleasant rubbish i probably wouldnt hate it so much if it wasnt so smug,comedy
marvel usually doesnt disappoint me like ever but let me down 1st of all he seems a bit feminine he talks about being molested and even takes a strap on up the ass i couldnt believe this was actually a marvel movie theres action but its not as impressive as id hope itd be this seemed more like a dark comedy than a marvel movie dont believe the hype this movie is not worth your money not that the money matters but if youre a true marvel fan youll feel cheated his love interest had great dark humor  also had a few jokes here and there but no gut busting comedy i dont know why colossus was in the movie his role was minor  he was treated as the voice of reason the story completely changes from how he became in wolverine its been rewritten to be more sentimental im guessing because the release date so close to valentines day i could write about the negatives of this movie all day but ill stop here but not before i say ant man was way better ,comedy
i really regretted spending money on this wanted to leave the cinema after first 15 mins chosed it as the ratings were high and was described as a comedy i did not laugh once the movie shows detailed violence  not sure who enjoys watching heads to be shot through or cut off total disrespect towards human life there was lots of unnecessary swearing and pathetic predictable jokes ie penis jokes saying fing in every sentence etc unless you enjoy watching violence and think swearing is funny you wont enjoy this movie maybe its suitable for someone with low iq or a teenager the plot is also pointless and some nudity and sex scenes are included too as a predictable part of the movie dont waste your money,comedy
im so glad to see that there are actually other people on the planet who think this film was terrible everyone is losing their minds over the film on social media billing it as the best film theyve ever seen ever i think its got something to do with breaking the fourth wall something malcolm in the middle did expertly making jokes only funny in a 13 yearold boys changing rooms unnecessary graphic violence and nudity which is absolutely unnecessary that is until you realise that this film has been written byfor people who still think farts are funny the humour in this film isnt even as sophisticated as white chicks or scary movie its not a parody either as an example the guy behind the bar delivers his lines like hes reading them for the first time no comic timing no life no urgency that may be his character but whatever comedy is supposed to be in his dialogue goes missing immediately they also take jokes too far sometimes just leading a viewer into the realm of a joke is fine leave them there let them get it themselves  not its like they knew people with the sense of humour of a 9 year old would be relishing every pointlessly gory banal second and they not only explain the joke but they keep talking a good minute after the joke has been gone and not been laughed at still telling the same joke in short  no this is not the best film youve ever seen ever for that in a comic book adaptation go watch the dark knight or the avengers this films storyline jokes and content have all been either written by or for adolescent boys who still think boobies are things to snigger behind your hand at at the back of a biology lesson everyone involved in this film needs to grow up and so do the people leaving 10 star reviews im sure if they watched postman pat the movie and he swore theyd give that 10 stars too,comedy
the movie was an amazingly astonishingly stunning  pile of crap i would have walked out after twenty minutes like the gentleman to my right in the theater did but then i wouldnt have remained true to my conviction of watching an entire film before rating it reading mostly positive reviews for the picture here on imdb and many of them glowing tributes i can only surmise that cultural rot has deeply permeated and affected the minds of many of the current generation of film goers i say all this quite sadly because ive seen and enjoyed most of the marvel comic movie product out there as well as dc but with this venture the film makers have hit a new low in entertainmentso why the glum for starters im not a prude but theres a limit to the number of times i need to hear the f word in a picture i can deal with it in bad santa and gangster pictures because joe pesci and billy bob thornton have a demeanor that allows them to pull it off with some semblance of artistry by comparison i just watched straight outta compton and the thugs in that film have nothing on punctuated by anatomical references to ones backside this films vulgarity sets a bar in the wrong directionthen theres the sex and nudity is this the direction the superhero genre is going to next now granted ive never read a comic so i dont know if this is par for the course on the printed page but if it is its pretty much bordering on pornographic as far as the violence goes well thats pretty much a given in these pictureswith most of the picture nearly complete i was beginning to feel better about not having marvel comic creator stan lee appear in one of his regular cameo spots but then he shows up as a dj at a strip bar i want to assume that he filmed his spot without knowing how the rest of the picture was going to play out otherwise my respect for the man would be severely diminishedlest this all sounds like a total downer there were three elements of the picture i enjoyed well enough first was the opening credits that were done quite cleverly and with spot on humor second i got a kick out of wade wilsons ryan reynolds statement about not making his super suit too green and finally there was the moment when wade announced the moment we had all been waiting for  the closing credits as for the rest of the entire movie to me it resembled a dead pool,comedy
the most misogynistic of all of marvels characters i can see why fox never wanted to film it the script is loaded with sexist borderline racist pseudointellectual drivel obscure pop cultural references are stupid not smart why the hell would a middleaged disabled african american woman put up with ryan reynolds arrogant white frat boy stupidity my first reaction to seeing him lean on big als shoulder was to punch his head in world there are two types of women the first is like his real life wife blake livelythe good womanthin anxious insecure helpless religiously adheres to the trappings of traditional womanhood and lives only to make sure her boyfriendhusband doesnt leave her by crowning him the center of her universe then there are all the other womenthe lesbian the unfeminine the older woman the strongviolent woman the woman that has other priorities than to run around pleasing men like its the sole purpose of her existence reality check most women have a heckuvalot more problems and responsibilities in life than to run in circles trying to make some guy happyits adolescent male arrogance to assume otherwise these are the inappropriate women and their silence is in stark contrast to endless prattle no smart alec retorts will ever come from them because only and his white male friends are allowed to be vocal and witty in world white male privilege reigns supreme neither women nor people of color are permitted to have a personality strong opinions or an attitudei am a huge science fiction and fantasy genre fan if fox and marvel are going to keep churning out sexist racially insensitive crap like this ill be voting with my dollar and watch something less insulting at the movies,comedy
this was the most cringing film seen it had such promise with the humorous credits introduction and the funky cartoon type it started well with a few wise cracks but they sadly did not stop it was one constant barrage of supposedly witty chat and streams of consciousness from the main character the action was impressive with an incredible amount of violence blood and scenes of a sexual nature very questionable rating which i would not recommend for below adult viewing the problem with this film was the lack of connectivity or sense of empathy generated for the super hero it may have been the aim to have such a frustratingly grating protagonist however it detracted from a potentially very good film i have never felt so dissatisfied with the sense that i have wasted my time watching this sadly not kickass film,comedy
im seriously considering ranking this movie a 1 out of 10 just because how of pornographic it seemed honestly the movie is very fun and could have been a great time for everyone if the producers of the film didnt decide to cater to the manchild virgins out there without all the raunchy crap i would rank the movie around an 8 or 9 a few people did walk out with their children during the film for understandable reasons and that is what pisses me off the most the people who made this movie know inside and out so it stands to reason that they should know what demographic reads comics just thinking about it pisses me off fk it im giving this film a one out of ten the filmmakers should know better there was literally no reason why they had to put out a hard r film they could have even made the movie pg13 if they wanted i dont mind a graphic movie but i do mind a graphic movie targeted at children if the sequel does the same thing im not going to spend a penny on it,comedy
why did i waste time in order to see this movie that i dont get1 desperate ryans effort to be funny made me bored2 mix of humorirony  a little bit of romance and sex  a little bit of blood and broken ribs are not always the recipe to hollywood success 3 girls attempt to be sweet and leave the underworld couldnt make you feel sympathy i will not even refer to his friend and the rest superheroes who seemed to get bored with the movie the way i didoverall another failure for marvel who wanted to produce something easy to digest,comedy
truly awful rendition of a marvel superhero turgid adolescent and inane routine cgi effects and a plot you could write on the back of a postage stamp the socalled comedy lines are expelled as if from a failing gattling gun interspersed with fantasy fillers including masturbation soft toys and sex in christmas sweaters if this is youre thing  i suppose go for it everyone else stay well clear had this been counterbalanced in any way by a genuine malevolence from our hero there may have been some redemption but the violence is all just meaningless cartoonish and blahincredible that the back story involves attempt to win back the girl when he and everything else in this waste of money movie is so overwhelmingly camp right up to the end credits when our hero as a cartoon jerks off a unicorns horn to produce an ejaculate made of rainbows and fairydust truly this is the very stuff this risible movie is made from,comedy
when a movie has to rip off ideas from other movies such as ferris buellers day off guardians of the galaxy hancock three kings natural born killers and a few others you know something is desperately wrong but unfortunately doesnt even possess any of the originality or charm of the aforementioned flicks and to think that those movies had any charm requires a stretch of imagination and personal taste did i mention that the title also rips off clint eastwoods fifth dirty harry installment what fans see as original and innovative i see an amalgum rip off it borrows ideas from many movies and tries to mask itself under innovationim not going to rehash this crazy plot because it would just lend unearned value to this cinematic drekk but has uneven and inappropriate tonal problems that just jar against what movies have done before and what made them work well this genre and the way they execute it doesnt work ultra slow motion violence in the opening credits is a lousy way to start a movie it looks retarded ugly and doesnt prepare the viewer for any buildup or suspense instead i was dreading ninetyeight minutes of offensive dialogue and nonstop cartoon violence which i predicted accuratelymy biggest peeve about this cinematic waste of time is the ryan reynolds character watching a wisecracking effeminate and sadistic superhero spewing out metaphors popculture references and caustic remarks at a rapid fire rate is about as appealing as watching torture porn i understand he is supposed to be an antihero you love to hate but this ostensible intention misfires im not sure exactly the class distinction or persuasion of the category of people who gravitate to this type of art but i know it doesnt include me i can find solace in this case for being left outinserting humor with corny love songs for violent and repugnant scenes prompts me to wonder if the film maker knows what hes doing nothing seems appropriate here and leaves me shaking my head and rolling my eyes do not look for any subtlety intriguing plot twists or thoughtful messages in this because they dont exist herei havent paid much attention to ryan reynolds and i dont think he possesses enough leading man qualities to remain as such despite how hollywood is using him i find him very plain and unappealinganother curious and disappointing part of this work was morena baccarin she looks too dignified classy and sophisticted to partake in such juvenile smut hopefully she can rise above this to where she can be regarded as a creditable actress in years to come and not some cheap eye candy for trashy films ive read some blogs about how hollywood has been churning out movies that distort the sensibilities of impressionable minds who dont know any better some even believe its a conspiracy to destroy our youth i can understand their concerns but i try not to ponder such doom and gloom prophecy i think humanity can survive if movies like will cease and desist all future projects,comedy
hollywood has a ton of problems these days an irrational reliance on big loud cgi filled blockbusters a fixation with tv style digital cinematography and a compulsion to make movies that are memefriendly selfcongratulatory and above all trendy this describes the downright depressing point hollywood has fallen to in the past decade or so it also describes to a tee this subversive superhero movie is a personification of everything todays sardonic millennial moviegoers cherish its vulgar violent ugly devious ironic and hip its one big meme comic book nerds and teenage boys love it fine i hated every secondthe problem right away is that is a terrible character hes a joke but one that is only funny to those who drool over spandexclad musclemen and collect kids toys in their free time im talking about nerds is what nerds think cool is played with infuriatingly selfsatisfied panache by nerd god ryan reynolds is an impeccably sculpted overtly confident wisecracking nerd himself he can win any selfrespecting geek over with a quick reference and hardy fourth wall breaking high five for those who get it for those in the know is a naughty wish fulfillment character the asshole they always wished they could be to the rest of us hes just an assholeis among the most unpleasant movies i have ever sat through i could go a step further and say it is the most unpleasant two hours it could possibly be serves as a shining example of every single thing i hate about movies today for starters its another superhero movie for all director tim millers insistence that this is a different kind of superhero story its really just a typical origin story peppered with enough fbombs and sex jokes to make something superficially unique secondly the movie looks dreadful digital and grey just like literally every other movie that has been released since 2010 is it the current tvmania sweeping through the younger generation that is convincing filmmakers to replicate the cheap washed out look of low budget television why else are movies getting worse and worse to look at third and most egregiously is relentlessly full of itself the script really isnt a script so much as it is a list of jokes gags and winks meant only to placate the fans who practically bullied the movie into existence knows its audience will go gaga for its star and his dumb schtick in fact they are so confident of their dominion over geekdom that the whole thing reeks of the kind of selfsatisfied arrogance of a hack comedian making a dumb crowd go wildis a movie that will make you lose faith in movies hell it made me lose faith in humanity if this is the kind of thing people will praise as the new gospel then we as a race are in serious trouble is a bland superhero movie a vulgar comedy and a cynical corporate exercise rolled into a rotten chimichanga of the worst impulses of modern hollywood its not technically the worst movie ive ever seen but it is in its relentless nastiness one of the most thoroughly depressing i got no enjoyment from and it made me question whether i will ever like a movie again07100,comedy
here is a list of people this movie is meant for12 year olds that just discovered cursing and pornpeople that thought freddy got fingered was funnypeople that enjoyed borat and give it an 8 or higherpeople that only think something is funny if its loud and vulgar no subtlety allowedpeople that are too dumb to understand clever humour and witpeople that get bored if there isnt an explosion every 2 secondsbasement dwelling middle aged menpimplefaced comic book dork shutinsyes i know its harsh but its the truth dont waste your time on this heap of trash,comedy
we went to this film not knowing anything about the character but after seeing the positive reviews this film had received we thought we would give it a try we had similarly known little about other marvel characters xmen avengers and since we had enjoyed these other films we thought would be a funny and entertaining experiencewe didnt walk in expecting it to be anything like the former mentioned films and we knew this was an antihero movie we arent particularly turned off by violent movies if theres a purpose to the story but nothing prepared us for this the constant onscreen assault we experienced was humorless pointless convoluted and cringeworthyit was after half an hour of constant swearing graphic violence smutty innuendo and jokes about cancer before the faint hope that the film would improve disappeared and we walked outdont think for a second you can take your kids to this movie it isnt anything id ever want my kids to see im already dreading the fact that a sequel is apparently in the works needless to say i wont be spending my money,comedy
maybe its the fact that i never read any of the comicsor that im simply too old to find dck and frt jokes funny whatever it isjust dont do it for methe fact that it works to break the fourth wall in comicsdoesnt mean it work well translated to the big screen i found the characters boring and unimaginative but since the diehard fans claim the movie is very close to the comics ill take their word for itand guess i wont like the comic either but i think wouldve worked better as a cartoon they portray colossus as the stereotype russian from the cold warbut to give it some positive words some of the fights scenes was pretty goodthough a bit too much wire stunts for my likingall in allthis may be a really good movie for somebut for me it was just boring,comedy
3 points for bacarin i laughed once during the film  and that was during the last 20 seconds after the credits the tone of the film was only slightly like the trailer that i had viewed with enjoyment this adds nothing to the marvel universe save that which reality hands your psyche when you are betrayed by a close friendhigh school kids will enjoy this  or at least the boys will  unless they value heroes truth selfsacrifice and altruismavoid,comedy
of a movie that tries to be clich at one point i had to ask myself if the dialogue and jokes were written by a ten year old the movie tries so hard to stay true to that edgy annoying shtick that was laid out and ends up looking tryhard in the process of trying to be tryhard if you catch my drift the humor was extremely predictable the plot was extremely predictable you have to be simpleminded to enjoy this tripe i love dark sarcastic and dry humor but this movie was a terrible attempt that this movie has a 7 rating shows you how simpletons easily fall victim to the hive mind hype carried out primarily by comicdorks who struggled with aspergers in high school and their social life in general,comedy
this was one of the worst films i have viewed in years and appropriately it should have been named dread poolin reality this film made absolutely no sense whatsoever a batman like character uses profanity as if it is going out of style and to gain sympathy of the viewers we are informed of his terminal cancer diagnosiswhat was this movie essentially about who was that old blind woman carrying heathow the golden globes could even consider ryan reynolds for best actor in a musical or comedy for this farce is shockingthank the lord he didnt win the awardthere is enough violence is this miserable film to last for a lifetime,comedy
this is the basest type of entertainment and has all the marks of a bad movie crude jokes explicit sexual material unnecessary swearing and extreme violence without a story to justify it all this appeals to certain people granted but for the rest of us why debase yourself by this filthother reviewers have stated that the movie follows the the xmen story to some extent and it appeals to their fan base this is true and is a good selling point for the movie but why did they make it as silly as it was this could have been a good movie but instead ended up being trash save yourself the time and skip this movie,comedy
let me just say off the bat that i liked this movie overall the action and the humor were both very good and ryan reynolds nailed the role of deadpoolwith that said the infamous antihero known for constantly breaking the 4th wall and just overall being unconventional is stuck in a way too conventional movie that doesnt take enough risks in this film is very much himself and theres plenty of rrated humor the usual pg13 marvel film tries to avoid but in the end the film gets bogged down by a typical 3rd act finale the weakest point of the film another forgettable marvel villain in ajax possibly the worstplus the typical supporting characters like the love interest and goofy sidekick its all a little too conventional for such an unconventional character in and the movie suffers,comedy
this movie is by far the most exciting super hero movie yetplease be warned this movie is extremely inappropriate but an absolute thrill ride ryan reynolds as is the perfect fit just when you think he could not get any more clever with his words he would say the most off the wall comments possiblethe fighting sequences in this were incredibly jaw dropping really is one of the most innovative fighters i have seen his techniques are totally unorthodox and cannot be matched nor mimicked by any other who daresthe only thing that was not satisfying is the length of the movie it was much shorter than expected the backstory to wade wilson before becoming is short lived despite that it still was an excellent movie and i cannot wait for more,comedy
this is probably the worst movie i have ever seen it is nothing but language and gratuity with very little worth watching yes it was a good plot and i enjoyed it but the senseless language and sex put into it ruined it for me if marvel does this to another movie i may very well stop following marvel movies altogether also if i could rate this lower than 1 i would do so this is completely unsuitable for any movie and as marvel movies have been geared mostly for family viewing this is entirely unsuitable it would be like walt disney producing cartoon pornography  just wrong save your money and your brain cells  this is not worth the time it would take to steal it let alone pay for it,comedy
i was a fan who enjoyed reading the joe kelly run of comics and i knew right off that this was going to be one of those leave your brain at the entrance stupidtype brainless movies i dont mind such movies as long as they are enjoyable enough but this movies stupidity level is so high i couldnt bring myself to enjoy it much the script is so horrible i stopped listening at various points throughout the movie because i couldnt stand how stupid some of the lines are here are some examples you dont have to be a superhero to get the girl you just need the girl to bring the hero out in you my reaction geez mr pool you sound like a 13 year old hardcore superhero comic book collecting nerd who thinks superheroes are the be all end all and have just noticed girls for the first time in your lifedid i say that this is a love story i did huh well its not its a horror movie and im like wow  you just reminded me of my 6 year old niece who couldnt decide what the creature in her drawing was if it is a cat or a mousesome of you may say that is character he is crazy and stupid but not this stupid and no his best characterizations doesnt contain the immaturity that is so on display in this movie also in this movie i dont really find him witty at all and witty is part of characterryan reynolds does fit the role of well enough but he didnt do a very good job of it this is due to the horrible script horrible direction as such i dont really blame him like when he gets angry and kicks the door and says fk several times you dont feel any of his anger at all hes more like a one of those pukes who says fk all the time and whos not really angry and is just throwing a fake tantrum to seek attentioni hate that this movie does such a hard job of trying to constantly reminding you that this is a superhero movie what with the green lantern wolverinehugh jackman xmen jokes even worse bringing in two xmen characters who fight with their flashy costumes complete with prominent x logo and and their flashy cg super powers if i want to watch a flashy superhero movie or movie with x men characters ill watch a flashy superhero movie or xmen movieand i hate the superhero origin story again this one is done in media res you see in a big action scene first and then flashback back to his origin ive seen almost every single superhero movie and this might be the first time or few times its done this way i can imagine the script meeting going something like this no we must have a superhero origin story must its gonna flop if it dont i know its in a million other superhero movies people are sick of them but still so do any of you bright folks have any ideas i do yes how about we do it in media res wow genius freaking genius lets do it well i hated it and couldnt wait for the boringly executed origin story to be over and get back to the action scene that we were in the middle of before this movie gave me such a huge case of superhero fatigue that i finally completely understood what emma thompson said when she said she loves spiderman and all but she was gonna shoot herself or something if she sees another spider man movie of all the superhero movies to make me feel this way it just had to be deadpoolthe best part of this movie is related to a superhero joke though about the ridiculous rule that superheroes can never ever kill no matter what i find this rule so inane and cannot believe it when fans actually really flip out when this rule is broken coughman of steelcough its almost as bad as when playstation and xbox fans troll each otheri wish i could erase my memory of this movie to get rid of superhero movie fatigue because batman v superman is coming up next and no matter how good that is i going to be reminded of it and feel it sighs,comedy
i go to lots of movies this is only the second time i have ever walked out on onethe previews looked intriguing and it has such high user ratings the concept could have been a home run my gosh in the preview trailer where he is upside down in the car and time slows down as he turns and talks to the camerabrilliant but the creativity and novelty were absolutely destroyed by the strong vulgarity and crassness of this movie i had a couple of laughs but this film is just too offensive unfortunately i wasted 30 minutes of my life before escaping this dung hill my wife wanted to leave sooner but i suggested we wait a bit to see if it would get betterit did not,comedy
okay if you like lots of sexual innuendoand more than innuendo and if you like hearing the fbomb splayed blatantly throughout and if you appreciate hearing the name of god and jesus profaned gratuitously and if you delight in scenes of bloody violence laced with snide remarksif you like your movies with these traits and others of equal inanity then you will like i dont like these things and i hated this movie just so you know that im not a total prude i can accept all of these in story lines where they make sense in context however in they are the context and there is really only one story line the one barely redeeming quality is the lesson about seeing through the tragedy of ugly wounds to the human that lies beyond but in this case that human is as ugly as his wounds,comedy
bad acting stupid dialogue bad script and worst of all is the use of obscenity and sexual references trying to fix the hole idea i understand and known all my life that the character from the comic is similar but in the movie the deeper exploring of this resources instead of trying to tell a better story or even the writing seems to me a lack of creativity and poor ethics the only character creation was done in vanessa interpreted by morena baccain who deserves a 910 in her role for this movie woudnt go tho the theater if there is a sequel and would recommend to start fresh from scrap if theres still interest in delivering any other movie this beloved antihero deserves more,comedy
where will i get a hundred words to describe this movie the story of this movie is basically a revenge story in a superhero movie clich the reason for the success of this film is the type of character which most male audience in the age range between 16 and 25 will enjoy coupled with spontaneous humor and the jokes with the fourth wall of course the character may be a snort of fresh air for the sub genre super heroes i do not know there was a subgenre socalled super hero comic movie genre but for the movies in general this here is nothing new to see do fans of this kind of movies feel down when we talk about superhero movies and why do they have to separate them from the other types of movies just because they do not to offend sensitivities or they do not want the audience to consider them a inferior movie so many questions no answerof course here we have all the ingredients that anyone in this range will like meaningless violence even more so with super heroes seriously how to create tension in a film of this type where the main character has regeneration and if he is cut into pieces it will regenerate the action scenes the most basic element of this type of film completely lose their impact and tension i like scenes of action and violence but the filmmakers have to show the effects of violence on the bodies of characters and its consequences in characters lives creating violence just to show that it is cool only creates more violent people even focusing solely on this aspect of the film the film is too stupid with senseless action scenes this film even its most primary purpose can not perform with quality in addition to the humorous mindless action scenes generic plot the main character fun but limited what does this movie have to offerscenes of nudity spare me do not waste your time with this tripe,comedy
only reason i am not giving 1 star is because it is just a bit above awful seriously people who hyper liked this should have to take an iq test immediately please guys write some genuine reviews for the sake of not so witty people like mefinally for people who liked this film one word cheat others you may stand to gain something but dont cheat yourselvesby saying i liked this movie nothing can be gainedand people who want to see this moviei would strongly advice againstdont fall into the trap of good ratings either they are paid or are desperate about super hero movies,comedy
first time in a theater since 2005walked out 27 minutes in this is not my seems they were more concerned with the 4th wall and sales instead of continuity this hurts i had conversations with people about how i felt dc was winning against marvel because of realism versus being campy my argument remains and most likely will stay the same after march 25 this film is a poor attempt to take the greatness and diversity of a character such as dp and make him an everyman you can take some characters and make them relateablespell check but dp is not that guy i never saw gritinstead i saw ryan reynoldsi never saw insanityinstead i saw childish humori never saw a movable characterinstead i saw a meme unfortunately this is the worst of the marvel films ever to me and it was made not for us comic lovers and the people that see our passion and can only relate through film but for the sheeople who like the sensation of hypethank you,comedy
i wish i could have those 108 minutes back this was just bad written by two terrible writers directed by an animationtitles guy acted by a grown man pretending to be 12 costarring a female him how is this considered entertaining everyone sounds exactly the same tons of time jumps to dress up the bad storyline its like a cross between van wilder kill bill and striptease if this is at all a reflection of what comic book fans want to see im truly disappointed how this possibly made over 10 to 1 in box office is unreal is this the end result of the internet vs reading real books zero imagination zero delivery zero quality worse than thor 2,comedy
not a professional blogger here an honest opinion from a huge comic book fan this movie was flat out terrible a 5 year old could have written a better script i read comics quite frequently and i understand was a smart alec but the sexual graphic content was abit much i dont care if the movie was ratedr the cursing was a laugh or two at first but it got a bit old then when it got to showing quick scenes of playing with himself i just thought it went too far really come on wtf the overall script was boring i just thought it dragged on and on and the whole point to the story was wanted revenge on a guy who gave him superpowers but the whole story line of giving super powers was not well thought out by the writers directors or producers of this movie as compared to wolverine series it was dragged on way too long in fact the only bright spots in the movie was colossus and negasonic teenage warhead characters this was an absolute disaster in fight scenes i mean my goodness i know that is a violent comic book antihero or villain all he did was kill kill kill there was cgi effects but it was nothing newconsent foul language jokes just got old yep he was always yapping however i think this movie took the foul language and sexual content to the extreme all i can say is it should have been rated xxx for a porni dont understand how comic fans are raving about the movie other than the fact they just wanted to see any movie good or bad on the movie screen about quality or quantity i was surprised to see disney or even stan lee produce a crappy movie like this this is the worst out of all of the marvel movies for those that say this is the best movie of all time need to get out of their cave more often shame on the people who created this movieand there going to be a 2 movie dang what a waste of money and time,comedy
c class movie that have only cheap jokes it have same plot which we already watched 100 times nothing special but the wastage of time i think there will be no squeal of this and if there is i m not going to watch that crap again and i dont understand why they were talking about  after every 34 scene they were trying to convince the people that we are not any less then a class movie  or any other marvels comic characters people who saw that movie can sue them and they have to ask there money back as the worst movie of the decade  so much f words i ever see in a single movie best for those who are so frustrated never saw any movie that have this much over exaggeration,comedy
i enjoyed the xmen movies this did not live up to any of them one crude moronic joke after another trashy sex scene after about a half hour i was ready to bang my head against pavement if youve got an iq over 100 do not see this movie watch this movie and i promise youll walk out stupider than you went in huge disappointment the whole script is a mix of dry one liners i didnt laugh once walked out of theatre about half way through the only good thing about it are the effects perhaps if watched on mute it would be tolerable it just amazes me that anyone could say this movie was good a true reflection of the pitiful state of our society today,comedy
is the movie equivalent of the parents going out of town for the weekend while the high school throws a party gets drunk has sex in the backseat of the car and then pukes in the driveway and in a good way it appears as though fox has turned a blind eye while director tim miller star ryan reynolds and screenwriters rhett reese and paul wernick run amok having the time of their lives and thankfully bringing us along for the ridestars reynolds as the mentally unhinged hitman wade wilson this is not a story where the upstanding protagonist is flung into the throes of an extraordinary situation no this superhero tale about an unstable bad guy who gets superpowers and its refreshing as hell without getting into spoiler territory this is a revenge movie masquerading as a superhero origin storyfollowing what may be the most creative opening credits sequence in the history of film we are flung mercilessly into the maelstrom of once the light turns green all bets are off as takes us through his journey explaining his origin his revenge mission and even his unconventional if at times endearing relationship with his girlfriend vanessa who may be as or more damaged than wade himself there really isnt anything bad i can say about the movie except that i was sad when it ended but they were able to cram just enough crazy into this 107 minutes that it just works perfectlyi plan on watching movie at least three more times,comedy
first i hope the filmmakers and the actors involved in this stupidity lose their respect and credentials for participating in making a film that was ten times as trashy as bridesmaids and was only advertised in the trailers as being slightly more trashy in terms of how sick you can push a films disgusting aspics of its plot i really think that ryan r is slightly a sick  for being involved in the movie at all i definitely hold it against his entire career for being involved in the utterly disgusting plot of this hell hole whats worse i saw this with my uncle in the theater and he is fine with nasty violent movies but was so disgusted with this film that he actually wanted to talk about how the world is going to hell after seeing the movie itself i felt bad i took a tired old man to this action hero movie because he likes boxing and arnold movies and then he looked nearly green by the time we walked out of the sick  after we decided to leave an hour and twenty minutes into this basket of vomit we asked the ticket management office at the theater if we could see another movie instead as they saw we were leaving and asked if everything was okay with our experience i suppose because the audience might have been reputed to be a one full of screaming and inane laughing pieces of  we said the movie was terrible and they felt bad enough to give us tickets to a different movie that we both were not very interested in going to but decided to take their ticket offer and see the next available movie worth watching in any respect and went to see ride along i thought that movie was about thirty times as professionally written and directed than the garbage of i am very serious that the actors who made this movie are now to full of  for me to ever appreciate seeing again in a film please note i do feel that i rarely rarely walk out of any movie at all out of hundreds of movies i have seen in a movie theater i have only walked out of 2 others than this and would have gladly sat through another nearly nc17 movie if it was somehow redeeming in any way or matter at all i am so glad people give up their us citizenship if this is what anyone enjoys watching for any reason at all after i saw it at least i got to see a comedy i did not have a high opinion of to see without being disgusted with something like this i would like to add that i took many classes on human rights through my college career and have actually watched many documentaries on human torture and mass genocide i would gladly cry through a movie about human tragedy that actually exists than watch this ignorant crap i believe that there are many people who saw this movie who would have paid to not see it and i certainly witnessed a family member feel sick for a few days after watching this garbage please be aware it would be best to get a flat tire on the road to the movie theater to skip this movie instead of going to see it at all and i think you have good luck if that happens i actually think i have never seen a more disappointing movie at all as this one was being advertised as an action flick to give you a perspective of how unspeakably bad the plot and jokes are the entire crew and the management makes cheap jokes about who they are in the opening credits they dont name themselves as they expect anyone with a brain may walk out of it they instead say produced by literally it says something this insulting worthless a and then directed by a loser so its basically a flagrant trumpeting of who the directors and producers feel they have become either before or after sitting through the film set of this trash fest i know i am trying to give fair reasonable comparisons by how much watching this movie really hurt and after fencing for four years in my high school i would rather essentially be beaten up in a fencing uniform by someone who weighs a hundred pounds more than i was and get covered with bruises than listen to this utter garbage so please destroy yourself very thoughtfully in another way if you are thinking of going to see this movie in any amount of your thinking time as an adult,comedy
very disappointed with the film one of the lousiest marvel series production the movie wasnt funny at all a lot of violence in it bloody scene dirty jokes cgi effects is all that can be found the story line isnt strong enough as well this is one of those movies that i will forget what it is about in 1 week timei dont understand why people said it was good perhaps you need to have a twisted sense of humor to appreciate this movie 1 star out of 10ant man was much better,comedy
shall i spend much of your time pointing out the degree to which visual values influence the contemporary mood of jaded selfmocking materialism blank indifference and the delusion that cynicism and naivete are mutually exclusive  david foster wallace sappier than a maple tree at a bukkake party tim millers charts the life of wade wilson ryan reynolds a young man who is diagnosed with liver lung and brain cancer seeking a cure wade is left permanently disfigured not wishing to be rejected by the woman he loves morena baccarin wade confines himself to isolation dons a mask becomes a superhero called and uses his spare time to beat up villainsif teenage stoners directed a ripoff of sam raimis darkman it would probably look like millers most of the films running time is dedicated to sexy white dudes fighting sniffing crotches swearing doing funny stuff trading clever wisecracks and hurling incessant nonsequiturs sometimes they also take prosthetic penises up the butt like most postmodern art the films tone is relentlessly ironic snarky and by extension nihilistic nothing matters other than the moment and the moment exists only to short circuit and titillate the most basic expectations of long atrophied nerveendings man punches other man in crotch man breaks hand audience laughs repeatwhen our heroes arent hurling oneliners theyre doing slowmotion flips rocking out to cool music shooting people in the head punching blurry cgi ragdolls and rescuing women tiedup by evil villains none of these sequences are done with style or have any sense of tension importance pacing or weight all rely on the cutaway  to random dialogue or random physical acts  to generate affect this is all presented as being edgy and alternative a lie which not only ignores every other superhero movie from r rated fare like kickass defendor and super to the wisecracking heroes of spiderman and iron man but the entire landscape of postmodernity itselfmost action movies become cheesy camp and homoerotic with time this is largely because conventional masculinity constantly defines itself in opposition to a femininity it deems to be weak an act of opposition which is itself an admittance of weakness and insecurity and so the conventional action hero is de facto effeminate and the more it tries to assert its toughness the more ridiculous it looks think the muscle men of 1980s action movies or how homoerotic most martial arts movies look today in these insecurities take on schizophrenic dimensions wade wilson is sexy and invincible but also impotent and ugly hes ridiculously hypermasculinised even sociopathic but is constantly cracking homoerotic jokes having anal sex and salivating over rent wham and the prospect of fondling balls this has led to some fans claiming that the character represents pansexuality when in reality like everything does or postmodernity as a whole does such jokes only exist to anticipate and shortcircuit sincerity bro humour mocks masculinity to stop you from mocking it first in this way it inscribes a new type of 21st century masculinity open to all contradictions so long as it still gets to be the herois based on a marvel comics character like most marvel films it is strictly irreverence by committee like watching a nike sponsored livestream of six addinflicted kids dissing each others mothers under a youtube video walkthrough of the sixth level of call of duty 14 it is currently the highest grossing r rated film of all time its sequel is in the works perhaps also a prequel and also a spinoff it contains a character called negasonic teenage warhead510  worth one viewing,comedy
when i saw the trailer for the first time i thought that is gonna be a real piece of crap then i found out that the movie has got 88 out of ten and get the feeling that it might not be as stupid as i thought in the first place as it turned out it was even worse the jokes are too simple or only about sex script lacks any point and the biggest plot twist was that there is no plot twist maybe except for really unexpectable revelation that there is no cure for such problem as is ugliness to sum up i regret the money i spent on this movie and i am not even talking about time ps when the opening titles said created by bunch of idiots they really meant it,comedy
throughout the entire movie cracked jokes about superheroes from origins movies to their selfrighteous lectures etc so lol your making fun of other movies some people actually love very funny and original its not live we havent seen vampires suck so if you found the comedy over the top is the rest of it good no its terrible even though it jokes about all cheesy clichs in superhero movies the rest of the movie still checked all the items on the list for a origin storyspoilers ahead feels alone at first  check meets beautiful girl  check falls in love  check cant be with her  check experimental something to give him powers  check side effects  check wants revenge  check bad guy kidnaps woman he loves  check he need to save her and get revenge  checkthe only thing about this movie that was different is that it is r rated sex cursing violence and joking about almost anything and a lack of morals so it gives the illusion of new and refreshing but the content is very basic as a origins filmalmost every person i spoke to said they loved it but i cant say the same to be honest i was bored especially by the jokes you no that kid in class who never would stop with the jokes even if they werent funny thats its exhausting where is the off buttonanyway i am very opinionated about the movieif comedy is your type of movie try this one out if not move on,comedy
just watched it and would say it is a bit overrated and definitely should not be in top 250 it is a good one time watch but sorry to say i cant give it a repeat view nowadays it has become a trend that any marvel superhero movie starts with high ratings marvel should say thanks to the fanboys at first i liked the humor but it was repetitive and turned boring to me looks like marvel has got the key mantra of success after iron man and godg just add some humor some cheeky action some sarcastic abuses and here you get a blockbuster in the end i would say it is not a bad movie but not something to be in top list i will give it 7 stars out of 10,comedy
story  a former special forces operative who works as a mercenary in new york city is subjected to a rogue experiment that grants him healing powersi liked very much due to its unique character and funny dialogues along with some fabulous action sceneshonestly i didnt expected much from this movie and i thought that this would be a disasterbut this movie proved me wrong and i am happy about itthe thing which i like the most is humour in the movieryan reynolds is the perfect choice for the role of and he has shown us that he can also make you laughthis movie will be remembered due to its comic scenes and dialoguesdebut director tim miller has done a great job in his first movie and it seems that movie has been directed by an experienced directorcharacter reminds of spiderman sometimes as both of them talk too much to villainsbut this movie could have been much better if there would have been a stronger villain and a good storymovie is a must watch for marvel fansoverall i give this movie 910,comedy
if youre a fan of the comics i think youll be pleased with this longawaited film it is the marvel comic faithfully adapted to the big screen just with a lot more profanity and nudity few superhero movies are as faithful to the original source material as is from the chats with the audience through the fourth wall to the cartoon character hijinks director tim miller really nails it and even if youre not a fan of the comic this is an entertaining addition to the superhero film genre if you combined the mask with watchmenyou start to get a sense of what to expect its a raunchy comedy mixed with a superhero movie yet somehow the two work well together and are unlike anything weve seen on the screen before,comedy

how the hell do you review a film like its almost in a category of its ownryan reynolds is no stranger to superhero pics he played the disappointingly limp green lantern in 2011 and before that he played this character  wade wilson  in wolverine origins with hugh jackman who is the butt of one of the many injokes in this film reynolds as heir to bradley cooper as the pretty boy of hollywood has never really found a breakout role but here hiding behind a face that looks like an avocado had sex with another older avocado he achieves true stardom a franchise that looks like it could run and run and he is very good in it tooin this origins story told partially in flashback wade wilson a fairly unpleasant mercenary bad guy who gets paid to f over worse guys has some bad news from his doctor he tries to do the honorable thing by up and leaving tartwithaheart morena baccarin brodys wife from the first series of homeland to go in search of a way forward the superhero cure is offered by semisuper ajax ed skrein but comes at a price cue the guacamole making it difficult for him to return to his lover erm so not a great morale boosting story for any burnvictims then lets start with the script by rhett reese and paul wernick  two of the guys behind the highly entertaining and anarchic zombieland sticks its tongue firmly in its cheek from the spectacular opening titles the director is described as an overpaid tool and the script bounces from great comic line to great comic line almost without a pause as an example ryan says he wants to live until 103 and then die just like detroit lolstan lee cameos aside some of the marvel films can be quite pofaced and serious but this one comes from the more comic antman end of the stables in general the script is highly disrespectful of the marvel world it inhabits with shots being fired at various sacred lambs particularly the xmen as such im not quite sure how some of the true fanboys those who wear spandex under their day clothes might react to this the film makers are pissing on their reality  albeit with love  from a great height here in mood it is like the bastard child of a genetic experiment combining the genes of spiderman xmen kickass and kingsman as a viewing guide if you really didnt care for the anarchic and violencelaced humour of these last two films then in all probability you really wont like deadpooli personally thought it was great fun and a blast from beginning to postcredit end the movie breaks the fourth wall shamelessly  something i often hate in a film  but gets away with it and even has the kahunas to have reynolds address the fourth wall by making a joke about breaking the fourth wall audacious however my positive feelings are tinged with a feeling that we as the audience are all being had to a degree the whole thing is a bit overly smug if blackadder was writing this hed describe it as being directed by smug mcsmuggerson the king of smugland a recurring joke is the low budget afforded the movie and we get hit over the head with that multiple times its all a little bit too knowing the director is actually tim miller and this  extraordinarily  is his feature film debut but the guy clearly has class  this is off the back of him winning an oscar no less for his animated short film gopher brokein summary with curious timing a surprise summer blockbuster while there is still ice scraping of windshield requiredplease visit bobthemoviemancom for the graphical version of this review thanks,comedy
sometimes a movies very first scene perfectly sets the tone  and serves notice that youre about to have a unique cinematic experience allow me to illustrate by describing the opening sequence to the bigscreen adaptation of marvel comics r 148 we see a single moment frozen in time  the inside of an suv as it flips over on a busy highway in slow motion the camera travels through the vehicle documenting the precarious and humorous positions of various bad guys who have gone airborne because of the crash as we journey through this increasingly bizarre montage the only sound we hear is juice newtons 1981 hit song angel of the morning we also see the movies opening credits  not names but tongueincheek references to the actors and filmmakers employing phrases like the british villain the comic relief and overpaid hack wild irreverently funny uniquebefore he was the violent wisecracking antisuperhero wade wilson ryan reynolds was just a violent wisecracking neighborhood tough guy for hire hes the kind of person youd go to if you wanted to intimidate someone else into doing something for you  or just leave you alone wade seems to have only one friend a bartender called weasel tj miller until wade meets hookerwaitress vanessa morena baccarin they each have an acerbic wit an irreverent personality and a messy life in other words theyre perfect together they fall in love start living together and even discuss marriage it seems like theyre each as happy as theyve ever been before until the other shoe drops wade suddenly falls ill and is diagnosed with cancer which has taken hold in different parts of his bodya mysterious recruiter meets wade at weasels bar and tells wade that he can cure that cancer  and make him better than he was before with no other options wade enters a secretive and ominouslooking facility where he is subjected to torturous pseudomedical treatments designed to force his body to mutate wade emerges cancerfree and with impressive strength and athletic abilities as well as the ability to rapidly selfheal but also with a face which weasel says looks like a topographical map of utah among other things to hide his disfigurement wade makes himself a red and black suit and mask and adopts the name after the that weasel runs for the patrons at his barmay look and move like a superhero but the man behind the mask rejects that label hes an antihero on a mission is out to find ajax ed skrein the man who along with his assistant angel dust gina carano ruined wades good looks  and force ajax to fix what he messed up with a decidedly antisuperhero attitude gruesomely kills anyone who comes after him and tries to stop him two other mutants a large metallic man and a teenager who can release powerful bursts of energy from her body try to get to join them and their fellow xmen no dice is a solo act  only interested in getting his complexion fixed so he can reunite with vanessa and besides weasel only associating with his old lady roommate blind al leslie uggamsis not your fathers superhero movie or your sons for that matter as much as we all enjoy a good superhero flick the whole rrated antiherosuperhero thing is a refreshing change of pace the script by rhett reese and paul wernick is witty hilariously selfreferential and the conceit of breaking the fourth wall works surprisingly well under the guidance of visual effects guy  turned director first time feature director   tim miller we get some great action sequences and visuals despite the productions incredible shrinking budget a story thats fairly simple and easy to follow despite its nonlinear presentation and a main character thats faithful to the source materialalthough you may have your doubts just reading through the list of actors in this film its actually perfectly cast skrein and carano make a great villain and henchman henchwoman respectively miller is a terrific weasley friend its wonderful to see uggams back on screen especially since i kinda thought she had died and brianna hildebrand as negasonic teenage warhead as well as stefan kapii  andre tricoteux  greg lasalle who respectively provided the voice body motioncapture performance and facial motioncapture performance for colossus brought a lot to their mutant roles and left me wanting more maybe most surprising of all baccarin made me forget her many famous welldressed smallscreen characters like the stressedout former pows wife in homeland and the devious otherworldly leader anna in v then of course theres our star reynolds plays his character like a combination of bill murray in ghostbusters or groundhog day daniel craig in casino royale and bruce willis not as the incredulous superhero in unbreakable but more like his heroic but mortal somewhat heroic antiheroes in die hard and hudson hawk that all may sound like kind of a mess but the sensibilities of those characters joined with reynolds natural charm make for a winning combinationbut dont just take my word for it let the data be your guide this film started breaking box office records albeit very specific and obscure records as early as its thursday night previews and friday opening day still not convinced heres an idea  see the movie even if you dont like it at least youll know what everyone else is talking about youll also be ready if you get dragged to the sequel which reynoldsannounces in a postcredits scene of course no one can guarantee youll like after all its only a superhero flick and it isnt exactly oscar material but i for one cant remember the last time i had so much fun at a movie and after all isnt that the point a,comedy
is directed by tim miller and stars ryan reynolds morena baccarin tj miller and ed skreinfinally after 11 years of kissing the behinds of 20th century fox and the private area of wolverine reynolds has landed hard which is a bit impractical on the knees yes that was a reference but nevertheless completely and utterly brilliant this is tim millers directional debut and an incredible one at that the pacing is quick and sharp the screenplay by rhett reese  paul wernick is fantastic the explicitly violent and gory sequences are well gory and the onscreen chemistry between characters and we us the audience is genius breaking multiple fourth walls and walls within walls reynolds has given us the merc with a mouth we all deserve this is an origin story but it realises this and drifts completely from the usual formula or story arc used in superhero movies instead it kicks off with wade wilson as in a taxi with a mission to find the guy that messed him up then as the film progresses tells us how he became who he is its very unique and its one of the things i really appreciated about this filmthe original music score by tom holkenborg aka junkie xl is perfect the synthesisers incorporated fit the character of with absolute ease its not used to extremes but you notice its presence more notably the soundtrack is brilliant it has some classic tracks intertwined into the story reminiscent of marvels guardians of the galaxy back in 2014 this just adds to the chaos of on his road of rampage quite literallythe visual effects and set designs are substantial i felt the main cg characters were nicely handled and rendered into the surroundings really well but i felt a lot of the overall cg versions of set pieces could have been worked on a little more just to smoothen it out the opening credits are perfect very fun unique and amusing the animation is spotoni really had a lot of fun with this film and i believe its the best marvel has offered period everyone involved has done a terrific job bringing the beloved to life and it has paid off big time bring on the now confirmed sequelone more thing id like to praise is the editing i feel with a lot of action films these days there are way too many sharp cuts that pull you from whats happening editor julian clarke has handled this outstandingly with longer shots so you can really focus on everything thats progressing onscreen this is a good thing but i really wish the overall cut was longer maybe theyll be a special cut for the home releaseyoure probably wondering if theres the usual marvel postcredits scene and of course there is its a little different as youd expect from but its just as brilliant as the film itself you have to wait until the very end of the credit roll to see it so sit tight its worth it also there is a stan lee cameo and its hilariously planned my verdict is now my favourite onscreen marvel character taking over from antman i believe reynolds and miller will have pleased the many fans that have been wishing this day would come come oh youre naughty910,comedy
i have been a great fan of all the xmen and other marvel movies mostly because they are movies that i could take my kids to and enjoy a good story with action and super heroes i didnt bother to read the reviews or what the r rating was for before i stepped into the theater which was a huge mistake i assumed a that the r was for the action and maybe a few offcolored words no no no sex nudity and every other word was the f bomb we finished the movie because it cost me 50 but it will never be watched again in my house even the story line wasnt that great it was basically an hour and a half of cussing and vulgarity that a mom doesnt want to sit and watch with her sixteen year old son and daughter i have learned my lesson though i will never take my kids to another marvel movie without checking what the rating is there for which makes me sad ,comedy
slow mo action explosion romance explosion again x men more explosions a deep and intense story followed by more explosions so funny go watch it you wont regret the dirty jokes and explosions will keep you entertained until the end of the 2hour movie id never really paid much attention to until now 10 out of 10,comedy
when they shut him up in xmen origins wolverine i was outraged but that movie is what i hoped to get and more i was laughing in the opening credits that takes genius and madnessi suggest that you pay to see it in imax youll see more blood in bigger details and with the added bonus of doing a big fu to the people who denied us this juicy pleasure for years because they thought it wouldnt be profitable so lets prove them wrong to get more they thought that people would be too narrow minded and boring to be able to enjoy crazy originalityi know i did and many others too it became an instant classic i thought that it rated in the best movies released lately but it was in a list of the best movies of all timesi just adore his wtf humor but the vulgarity might be trying to hide a sensitive heart murderers and w can love too you knowryan reynolds thank you for fighting to have this movie come to life and the way it should be this time youre totally awesome even disfiguredim a prude and i totally approve of this f movie even the sex scene was cool for once,comedy
back in 2008 or 2009 who cares we got our first glimpse of on the big screen what we got took away everything decent about the character he is the merc with the mouth yet his mouth was sewn together ryan reynolds seemed perfect for the role how did it all go so wrong well now in 2016 reynolds returns and we get our first official movie in that we get the worlds greatest apology for one of the most abysmal films in the superhero genre and a highly original film that does 100 justice to one of the most lovable douchebags of all timeso here we follow wade wilson a former mercenary who is diagnosed with terminal cancer he undergoes an experimental procedure and is transformed into a badass loudmouth with the ability to heal one problem remains he is now ugly as sin we follow on a revenge story as well as a love story of sorts that really raises the bar for future comic book movies what i absolutely love about this film is that the whole origin is told through flashbacks looking over wades life is a character who is well known for breaking the fourth wall and the way that is addressed in this film is both hilarious and amazingly true to its source it is also easily one of the funniest films for a very long time the opening titles had me laughing out loud alone and if they dont peak your interest right away then im afraid youre in the wrong film i love self aware jokes like that and there are a fair few of them scattered around the supporting cast do amazingly well as well colossus and negasonic teenagewarhead from the xmen are just the greatest additions to this film this is easily the best incarnation of colossus we have ever seen and with such a low budget he looked beautiful of course with them on board there are some very funny xmen jokes to look out for morenna baccarin did i spell that right is the perfect love interest for ryan reynolds her character is a lot better than other 2dimensional females in comic book films when she is introduced and the way that happens shows how much of an impact she makes and it is great as for villains ed skerin was so unlikeable which is great because with a character like it is important to hate our main villain and the inclusion of angel dust was also a good decision and lastly tj miller acts almost as wades second in command weasel he stole quite a few scenes but in the end this is ryan reynolds show and nobody tries to take that from himso do i recommend hell yeah i do its the perfect comic book film for the fact it really sticks to its awesome source material and i could not imagine a better film for stick around for after the credits because we get a great little surprise definitely not for the faint of heart because as well as being very violent in an over the top way there are also some pretty dark and shocking scenes that can even be a little hard to watch but they dont last long anyway go and support because we need more superhero films like this now i have the sudden urge to listen to 80s music and eat chimi changas,comedy
this film tells the story of a man who is diagnosed with cancer who undergoes transformation by a mysterious man to become a man with invincible powers the only catch is that he becomes disfigured from head to toeis really funny because it makes fun of himself and of all superhero films it is almost like a parody of superhero films but in a good way the jokes are super funny i loved the joke about the studio having no money to fill up the house the 300 viewers in the cinema laughed hard and clapped hands on many occasions when the film ended people even clapped which is the first time i see it happening in hong kong people loved it loads and the after credit scenes made people shout with excitement when people exited the cinema it was almost like everyone was under the effect of laughing gas,comedy
i was excited to see this film given the hype over how funny it was irreverent to super hero movies and interestingly adult love story it was it was none of these the characters were annoying the plot was not suspenseful and the dialog was mostly child like potty and sex humor the only love story was between a lustful superhero and a stripper they only reason they loved each other was because no one else would or could since they are despicable some of the scenes were so disrespecting to human life i had to close my eyes and turn my head to stop from getting sick i noticed that some people left the movie perhaps this movie was not made for people like me what i found most disappointing and confusing was how disconnected the story was the super hero and the villains were so powerful at some times and then at other times they were killed with one measly bullet or punch i will give it some credit for the graphics sound effects costumes and animation i kept wanting to like it but in the end i left unsatisfied,comedy
if i didnt have to write 10 lines i fell asleep wouldve been enough so there this isnt very eloquent imdb made me do this i fell asleep many times until i decided to just read a book i want those minutes of my life back why is there such a hype over this i seriously dont get it it wasnt just boring it was also annoying and painful to watch the many blatant shots of ryan reynolds ass do not make up for the torture i endured and i loved magic mike my comedy standards arent that high and this was still disappointing its so bad that im still annoyed obviously if i didnt have to write 10 lines i fell asleep wouldve been enough so there i dont even know what to say anymore,comedy
i cant believe this movie is in the imdb top 250 oh wellcomingto the plot we all have seen it before incurable diseasesecret organization offers a way out experiment gone wrongboom superhero its like all the previous marvel movies with exception of the guardians of the galaxy nothing new on offer avoid it if you have better things to doits just a one time watchmovies which i refer to pop corn moviesyou have a bag of pop corn in your hand the movie is running in front of you and for that duration you forget all your troubles,comedy
is alright as a onetime watch it is different fun for a short while and smart when it wants to be its biggest asset a double entendre for those whove seen the film is ryan reynolds as the role fits him like a glove he is awesome the character rocks and has multiple facets to his personality reynoldss comedic timing is perfect and i guess he saves the film perhaps that was the pointthe humor showcased is what makes different the wit comedic elements breaking the fourth wall being very referential and parodying the xmen all the while being rrated give it an amusing edge my qualms with this film are that they took the term rrated too literally he may be the merc with the mouth but the foul language feels forced as if trying too hard to satisfy the kind of audience appetites that come with such a rating it got annoying eventually as things became very repetitive i am no prude but the language got to a point of overkill in addition humor and language can only so much make up for a lack of story and substance eventually even if it is a parody of an xmen film or an origin story it is still filled with clichs if it was trying to highlight the clichridden origin stories and make fun of them the wolverine films in particular it did so but to its detriment as it fell into the same trap there is practically no story substance or depth even originality in the story to save the film nothing memorable it ultimately is an amusing but empty ride when you watch it the first time the film is quite stylized and that fits the humor they go very well together but sooner or later it becomes a case of style over substance the film becomes too reliant on humor stylized violence and profanity while hilarious and pretty darn good the first time it gets oldthe characters aside from werent given much layering especially characters like negasonic i expected much morei enjoyed the humor the first time but after i watched the film again it didnt have the same impact it becomes a strictly onetime watch with an interesting antihero but nothing else of note the humor doesnt hold up on multiple watches the characters are bland the story nonexistent the action sequences unmemorable and the villains nothing of note even as a parody of an origins film making fun of the clichs it sinks because it doesnt shatter them rather it falls into the same category and embraces themthe nods to ferris bueller were okay for those whove seen the end credits but even that and breaking the fourth wall eventually became stale overkill and banality equal disappointment after all even when paying tribute or parodying im shocked that this film became so big i mean the emperor has no clothes you may enjoy it once it isnt awful but after all the hype dies down it becomes just another mediocre movie that had potential,comedy
the title says everything you need to know about the hero the bad guy and the storyalso it takes 23 of the movie to go forward because of worthless flashbacks and infuriating voiceover breaks seriouslylimp movie with limp acting limp dialogs with limp punchlines and limp fights was that even a fight at the endhow is it even possible to make and release such a dull thing in 2016 even star wars 7 seems to be subtle and intellectual next to this8410 by the time i write this please ignore this movie and the next ones make america great againnb  for the record i didnt check the original comics,comedy
2016 is going to be an insane year for superhero movies yet the only one i was really interested in is this one seriously i am so disinterested now with the big budget superhero films with such convoluted plots excessive and gratuitous use of cgi awful pacing and even being unfaithful to the comicsspeaking of unfaithful i was so looking forward to seeing wade wilson in the 2009 wolverine movie even more when i heard ryan reynolds was playing him thats perfect van wilder can quip like no tomorrow so hes perfect for playing the merc with the mouth sewn shut yea great job there fox and great job with fant4stic toothen the leaked test footage came out and all of us were like do that and the coke snorting corporates at fox listened from the cleverly designed marketing campaign you knew exactly the direction they were going and man did they not disappointthis movie was so much fun they really got the character so right because i was laughing nonstop this was a really funny movie is one of the very few characters in the marvel universe that can break the fourth wall and is self aware and the movie really got because it is rife with metahumour which can be seen in the very beginning with the best opening credits scene ever and yes we see him breaking the fourth wall making pop culture references and slicing up bad guys the film is not tame the humour is nowhere near south park levels but it does give the biggest middle finger to pc culture the action scenes are also a lot of fun from the sword fighting to the shooting to the acrobatics they were all filmed really well it delivers on the violence too which is cartoonish enough but it doesnt go too much into blade territory although with wade wilsons face in the comics it is really boiled and deformed and here he just looks like a prune guess they wanted to use ryan reynolds as much as they couldthe story is quite simple here its a love and revenge story it is well paced though as it is told in a nonlinear style it somewhat slows down for me when it does get to the love story part but thankfully those scenes are mercifully short there are some plot holes but you really dont care because of how fun the movie isthis movie is so refreshing i thought i was too jaded by superhero films but when you pick the right character to adapt you can have so much fun with him or her honestly i really dont care about any of the upcoming avengers films or this new xmen film or the superman vs batman film because theyre all so formulaic brought us something different and it was awesome like a chimichanga,comedy
i never give movie reviews but i just saw and really wish someone had warned me about it or i had some way to pay to unsee it it is definitely not a superhero movie or a love story im extremely disappointed that marvel and ryan reynolds made this it was gratuitously bloody and filled with vulgar bathroom and sex jokes some of the jokes might have been worth laughing at had they been in another movie but i was too disgusted overall to crack a smile im trying to think of a worse possible movie maybe if you remade john wick with jim carrey telling jokes as he shoots people and cuts them up if you have teenagers i would keep them far away from it,comedy
i went to see with high hopes particularly since i like ryan reynolds and had heard several good reviews i was not expecting the kind of juvenile humor that i was subjected to for the next 108 minutes its the kind of garbage you would find in a bad jim carrey movie i only laughed once during the entire show admittedly i appeared to be in the minority since other people laughed throughout the movie i just dont get itive seen and enjoyed most of the super hero movies so i like the genre however i dont see the need for an r rated marvel comics movie i found it especially painful to watch stan lees cameo in a strip club with nude women i would have thought he had better sensefinally as most viewers of marvel comic adaptations are aware there is always a snipit after the credits to give you a hint of whats coming this movie has one but its not like any of the others and definitely not worth sitting through the extensive roll of credits to see save yourself the aggravation and just leave when the main feature is over,comedy
seriously folksi left this movie with a bad taste on my mouth cold blood killing bad language mediocre plot actors acting like they dont give a st and of course highdefinition super slow motion violence but its violence its killing for the fun of it if such a thing does exist i watched the latest mad max also violent but with a story gluing it in a postapocalyptic age is something made to make you feel insensible to violence and torture there is indeed some little fun amongst the ultra violence but its just not worth it the final scenes made me feel i was at the butchery if you go go alone but tell me what type of entertainment is this that wants you to laugh at so much violence any good there,comedy
i dont care about the amount of raunchy jokes and profanity in the movie i do care that the movie is not funny at all you can be both raunchy and funny but this didnt happen in deadpoolryan reynolds performances are usually laughable but here it reaches the level of pity i pity the fact that he accepted to act in such crappy movie it feels like something a dumb teeanger would watch a very dumb oneif you dont wanna waste your time dont watch it its definitely not worth it i guess the overhype around everything about this movie is a circlejerk mess definitely the worst movie of 2016,comedy
i think this movie was one of the best comic book adaptations that ive seen in years im a huge comic book geek and i have to say theres no possible way they couldve made this movie any better its violent funny and actionpacked thats everything people would expect from a movie i loved the fourthwall breaks and the comic relief that was provided by i loved colossus in this movie not only was he really cool looking but he was very funny in many scenes this movie was practically flawless but i do have one complaint it wasnt long enough it wasnt even two hours long and thats pretty unusual for a major comic book movie,comedy
from the studio that inexplicably sewed his beep mouth shut the first time comes yeah that sounds like a beep franchise absolutely amazing movie by marvel now i can say that i forgive marvel for messing avengers 2 is the first r rated movie that i have ever seen in cinema and i enjoyed every second of it thanks to the censor board that they didnt ban it in our country otherwise my weekend wouldve been ruined if i hadnt got to watch is not a typical superhero movie so even if you dont like to watch superhero movies you will love ryan reynolds was a perfect choice for who did a fantastic job in his role and the script was very original funny and well written it has multiple elements including action comedy romance and most of all emotions moreover this is not just a superhero movie this is a love story thats why its being released on valentines day so go on see it enjoy it and have a laugh later especially for single people who do not have any date on vs day is the best gift that they will ever get haha no doubt it is and will be one of the best movies ever produced by marvel along with the avengers id recommend this movie for everyone who is allowed to watch it in their jurisdiction have a great weekend,comedy
for those who are familiar with the character this film does him justice for those new to the character and his story youre in for a treat needless to say i was excited about seeing this movie for the first time as a character is the embodiment of comedy parody and slapstick while still delivering a satisfactory level of gore and mayhem ryan reynolds gave his character a new refreshed life which was much needed after his unfortunate and painfully inaccurate portrayal in xmen origins wolverine if you love the actionpacked marvel universe but also crave a healthy dose of humor and a surprising amount of heart then search no more this film satisfies on so many levels and the laughs will keep you coming for more time and again,comedy
who needs a joke when you have references seriously thats what this movie is packed full of its like the writers only understood that makes a lot of jokes and breaks the fourth wall they didnt put any effort into making those jokes work at all this films goal is to make you laugh but its rated r with half the jokes being what you would hear on a middle school campus and the other half being references there a few clever jokes but thats pretty much itthis film story is completely boring without spoiling anything it relies on the flashback formula but here its so poorly executed also when your main character breaks the fourth wall knows he is in a comic book movie there isnt really anything at stake here,comedy
i went to see this movie and from beginning to end it was just making crude sexual jokes throughout the movie and i couldnt take it seriously i dont know how people found this funny but it wasnt to me it was a waste of time and ridiculously bad i really had high hopes of this movie and it disappointed me really badly i wish that the movie had less jokes and it couldve made it better for me but it was just a movie about endless crude jokes if i could take my time back it would be going to this movie and spent my money for something better there will probably which will be most likely a sequel to the movie but im not going to see it i wanted to like this movie but i didnt it left me speeches in a bad way,comedy
first of all i like marvelsuperhero films bit of mindless escapism for an hour or two but deadpoolhumm left me confusedim a geeknerd albeit a rather big onebut one thing that geeks and nerds cant do is humour big bang gets away with it because its geek humour not trying to be anything but geek humour where falls flat is its geeks trying to be cool which just doesnt workthe only reason i give it 5 out of 10 is because of morena baccarin whos woefully under used in most films the film itself just feels like a procession of adverts spread over nearly 2 hours couple minutes of dialogue then action scene couple of minutes dialogue then action scene rinse repeatif being an anti hero is as simple as just being annoying glib when everything is going to pot then possibly the uk has around 30 million antiheros walking around sarcasm and dry wit is something americans just cant do well with a couple of notable exceptions bill murray being onethe whole thing just stank of laziness possibly a great film for teenagers and emotionallysocially immature people but as for the rest just a silly predictable and pretty unfunny filmnot going to remark too much on the lead actor apart from the fact that he was much more interesting in the film before he actually became when he was just wade,comedy
can symbolize the beginning of a new age in cinema  a global dumbing down of the moviegoers with violence and vulgarism of this socalled satire on superhero filmsthe film received positive reviews both from the critics and the audiences alike what can raise doubts about authenticity of these reviews and about the intellectual level of these socalled criticsone thing i agree with is that the director is an overpaid tool as this is how he was credited in the titlesthis film was supposed to be a parody of the superhero film however the jokes are not funny and needlessly vulgar and is targeted towards the most primitive audiencethe plot is stupid and full of pointless violent scenes there is no aesthetic value of cinematography nothing emotionally gripping and the whole film is reminiscent of a bad joke played at the stupid audience who bought the ticket to such a trashy filmsomehow this film is a classic example of brainwashing of people manipulating the most primitive instincts appealing to the dark subconscious of the young and immature people the film is too juvenile however it has a rrating so it is not really clear what audience it was made forsee more reviews at httpindiecinemacom,comedy
my most anticipated movie of the year i went nuts for it i had a hard time sleeping because i was too excitedso was all the excitement and marketing worth it yes yes yes its so great i had so much fun this movie will be for everyone and has you entertained from start to finish wait not everyone because its a hard r seriously anyone under the age of 17 should not by any means see this because its very violent has bad language graphic nudity drugs has some love scenes and has a lot of overall jokes that kids wont understandfor the ones who dont know who is he is someone from the xmen universe which is made by the comic book company marvel if right now youre thinking so its a superhero movie and i dont like those dont worry it makes fun of superhero movies a lotthe story is about a man called wade wilson who is a mercenary that gets diagnosed with cancer one day the only way he can survive is to make him a mutant so that his body can fight the cancer so when he does become he appears to have made an enemy that goes after his girlfriendthats what you need to know about the movie now everything that is awesome about this movie first off the genre it is everything seriously it has aspects from every genre it has a love story that actually makes a lot of sense so it has romance it also is a superhero movie because it involves the xmen but it also makes fun of all the superhero moviesso it is also a satire but not only a satire on superhero movies but also on popculture today and on movies in general its also definitely a comedy i laughed so hard during this movie that i had issues catching my breath for laughing uncontrollably the jokes are varying and everything in it is so funnyit also of course is an action movie because the action in it is very good and very violent and this movie definitely couldnt be done without an rrating it also has some horror things in it when wade is made into its actually horrifyingthen i will say that every actor portraying a character in the movie works perfectly ryan reynolds is born to be he was exactly what the character of should be a kid in a mans body that breaks the 4th wall and has fun throughout the entire moviealso his girlfriend works perfectly and their relation is totally weird but believable the villain ajax played by ed skrein is a very good villain and you understand why wants to get him and in my personal opinion this is by far the best portrayal of colossus in a movie to date then we have tj miller as the best friend of wade who is hilarious and even the taxidriver dopinder who they also managed to make funnyi have one single issue with the movie and thats that it is too short the movie was so brilliantly put together that when they got to the 3rd act of the movie i thought its almost over but i dont want it to luckily there has already been an announcement for a sequel so im happy also if you havent seen it yet stay in the theater to the end of the credits because there is a great endcredit sceneis the most entertaining experience in a movie theater i had in a very long time and its a brilliant movie go see it if you havent already definitely a 1010 which is my 10th actual 1010 i ever gave,comedy
this movie thinks its a lot cooler funnier  smarter then it actually is i wouldnt say its a bad movie or poorly made but all around pretty flaccid and boringits basically the same old superhero bs but packaged as something new  different by adding strong language more gore sex jokes fart jokes drug jokes pop culture jokes and some obscure references to make it seem like this isnt the equivalent of a modern day boondock saintsits tough enough as it is to give a crap about super hero movies where there arent really any stakes and already you know that there is gonna be sequels and the whole thing takes place in a fantasy world in general by adding on a layer of selfreferential artifice makes it even harder if not nearly impossible to give a crap about anyone or anythingin a lot of ways its like watching pornography for the story im not saying thats bad or not entertaining but its like why bother for both parties,comedy
i was so excited to watch this  i love xmen and all scifi super hero movies however there was way too many gratuitous violent some torture scenes enough already with punching each other 40 times also there was zero character development with no good dialogue just awful quippy sarcastic lines every sentence he utters is a mean sarcastic comment  it was so tiresome i also didnt get the relationship with the prostitute female lead  didnt feel that one at all wanted to fast forward a lot of scenes but stuck it out hoping it would get better  but it never did i actually hated him at the end of the movie and wished he was just killed off,comedy
to be honest i had never heard of before i briefly was introduced to his character in xmen origins wolverine 2009 and save a lot of internet rumours that was going to be made into a movie finally we can fast forward to 2016 and team marvel brings the titular to the big screen with ryan reynolds anointed as the character i was expecting it to be another superhero movie watered down to attract a wide audience however upon viewing the red band trailer on youtube i found myself excited at the prospect that was not going to pander to family friendly audiences theres plenty of graphic violence profanity a strong sex scene and plenty of sex jokes which is certainly not something i was expecting to see kicks all goals as a funny and exciting moviewade wilson ryan reynolds is a former special forces operative turned mercenary who spends his time protecting teenage girls from stalkers upon meeting vanessa morena baccarin his life starts to look very bright until he collapses one night and is later diagnosed with terminal cancer in fear of losing vanessa wade starts to explore alternatives for a cure until he meets a mysterious recruiter jed rees who offers wade to join his organisation as well as enticing him with a cure for his cancer wade reluctantly accepts but later finds himself horrifically mutated at the hands of ajax aka francis freeman ed skrein and angel dust gina carano and later left for dead upon his advice from his friend weasel tj miller wade wilson adopts his new identity as masked vigilante and swears vengeance upon ajax and his organisation along the way the xmen colossus stefan kapicic and negasonic teenage warhead brianna hildebrand join in bringing down ajaxryan reynolds was born to play the comical timing everything is just perfect the rest of the cast also support the movie well but the focus is more on the hilarious jokes and breaking of the fourth wall even during the opening credits was never going to take itself seriously and it does so with style in what could have easily just been an actionpacked adventure turns out to be an adult humoured action comedy with perfectly placed comical moments throughout the movie that did not look out of place one slight bit the soundtrack also has taken a cue from guardians of the galaxy 2014 and has added some old gems from the past in the movie along with composer tom holkenborg aka junkie xl max max fury road ensuring the film is kept at an crackling energetic pace director tim miller has done a superb job bringing to lifethere have been warnings that is certainly not a movie for very young children and i highly concur it is strongly recommended that parents use their discretion when letting their children watch this movie the easily offended wont like anyway its only february and deserves to be one of the biggest movies of 2016 theres plenty of more movies to be released this year but without a doubt deserves to be one of the biggest movies of 2016think of as having your favourite dessert and youre finding yourself in a dilemma when you ask yourself it is healthy or is it bad for you it doesnt really matter you just cant resist it and thats what exactly what feels like when you watch it its violent foul mouthed and lots of sex jokes but you just cant help but like it dont take seriously and just sit back and have an awesome time theres never a dull moment throughout the movieim looking forward to seeing return with a sequel but until then ill be rewatching this movie once it is released on bluray and dvdstay tuned until the end of the credits for a surprise postcredits scene ensure you dont leave early810,comedy
the jokes are trying too hard theres a few decent ones but when every single line of dialogue seems to be some quip it becomes tiring pretty quickly because theres nothing to contrast it with the plot is nonsensical so the untransformed guy was supposed to be a super jaded exmilitary special ops guy and the basic plot is that hes afraid his girlfriend wont like how he looks anymore seriously and the guy can heal complex fractures take a knife to the brain regrow an entire hand close up full bullet holes but cant get his skin to look normal  and that need for plastic surgery seems to be his entire beef with the almost kinda impressive bad guy that gave him immortality who wrote this unlike most superhero movies there was real potential here but it seem to have been wasted on essentially scary movie 8,comedy
i understand its a marvel comic spawning and at marvel almost anything goes however what i dont understand is the obvious discrepancies in the various action sequences which somehow or other allows deadpoolwade to walk free from a whole host of life threatening nay impossible situations just so the story can continue unabated is it thrilling  is it gripping  does it make me want to view the sequence  unfortunately i have to say no to all three questionsif in future the makers want to create a marvel comic film which suspends all belief in the natural world and allows for all manner of ridiculous situations to exist as the hero continues on his merry way then why not try a cartoon film instead ,comedy
when i watched the trailer i thought it was crap but then i thought maybe i should it give it a shot i love xmen and cant wait until may to see it so maybe a little bit of mutant is not a bad idea on a saturday night it turned out really badif xmen is the real project this is where the interns practice and get their coffee money i was shocked that marvel franchised this movie there is no story line no twist no surprise no thinking nothing and the casting is lousy as well characters are dull and they try too hard to be funny yes speaking of funny i dont get why people think this movie is funny my conversation with a starbucks worker over the counter has more funny lines than this movie or the audience these days dont even read that they still laugh at the jokes we laughed at in the 90s if you wanna laugh during this movie better a joint when the trailers are playing,comedy
the title of the film is it is science fiction it is about wade wilson he is transformed into immortal superman it is based on a marvel comicsthe film is set in usa the film is set in these days ryan rodney reynolds stars in the film plays the main role he is my favourite character my friends would like the film,comedy
i heard so much hype was sure it would not live up better better than the hype jfc i want all movies forever to be as good as this ryan reynolds has increased 90000 times in my estimation from the opening credits to the howl thing amazing maybe00maybesags a touch at the end gets a little conventional but this movie is so  good you forgive it,comedy
this movie is totally tasteless and really really badits just fwords and swordsi felt like semiporn movie with some characters from man of steel supermanlow budget movie with superficial routine story i dont know why imdb has locked parental guidance i got headache after watching this movieif you want to save your moneyits best to not to watch this movie i dont like to watch vulgarity and nudity in cinemamovie must be about pleasantness  movie with lots of private stuff like nudity is big turn off one can sit at home and watch nudity or porn in privatewhy to buy a ticket for marvel comic which has same content as bgrade porn movies,comedy
wow this movie really shows what hollywood celebrity a great marketing machine and money can achieve this was the saddest excuse for a movie that i have had the misfortune of watching in a whilewhat a childish load of drivel after all the hype it was a huge disappointment there was nothing really funny about it  the best i can say is there were one or two mildly amusing moments and a couple of semidecent action scenes but for the most part i found it more irritating than anything else i can see what they were going for but it fell way short of the targetit amazes me that this would appeal to the masses at all it is basically an indictment of and an insult to viewers intelligence,comedy
yes you read that right hi im review pool and want to give the casual marvel enthusiast or the curious party wanting to see this movie the skinny heres the thing and forgive me for being so blunt but if you do not know this character you will not understand this movie you probably wont like it itll confuse you more than how the kardashians are still famous more than how the real housewives are still a thing and even more than how the danish word for poop bae became an endearing term for your boo but i digress yes this movie was created for the fans the 4th wall breaking wisecracking ultraviolent and gratuitous dirty mind that makes up this character is completely embodied throughout this film that being said do not take your kids if they are under the age of sixteen and havent been exposed to the internet or the characteristics previously mentioned you will have cps called on you doesnt matter how much they whine how much they beg do not ever ever feed them after midnightoh wait this movie takes a lot of elements through comic history and blends them i together as best as a 1hr and 40 min movie could even for a fan of the character since 92 can appreciate the things that were overlooked and condensed for the sake that it graced the big screen at all i enjoyed the elements from some of the smaller issue comics that were thrown in there pizza boy scene thank you rr i recognized it immediately yes it was raunchy yes it was violent yes it was full of fbombs but thats what makes this character so wonderful is that it doesnt stick to the traditional dogooder rhetoric and fans will not be disappointed with the stan lee cameopay attention to everything in this movie including the opening credits and dont forget to stay through the ending credits,comedy
now i knew i wanted to see this film not because i am one of those fanatic over the top comic hording maniacs but just because i am a sucker for the easy to watch super hero movies my expectations did not exceed the ones i had prior to all of the xmen films or any other film of the same genre for that matter this last week i had some trouble reaching my goals at work so to reset my good mood i asked a friend to go see this film without thoroughly reading reviews i quickly scanned some headlines that already had been written about i seemed promisingi can ensure you with near to definite certainty this will be my first and my last review but this film deserves every misspelled every typo and every sentence which in english does not fully cover that what i am trying to express to you on how much i liked this filmdoes not have loose ends does not have moments which leave you wondering afterwards about how do they not make sense some people may find the abundance of humour confusing in a superhero movie but hey how would you be if nothing could kill youi enjoyed every joke every one liner every reference to other movies the entire audience in the cinema couldnt stop laughing and for your information the dutch are the hardest audience to entertain now the only thing i am not sure off is that female viewers may go home with severe lack of self esteem due to the overload of extreme good looking women and the occasional nudityskip thatloads of tai am also worried about milking the sequel will never be able to top the first so unless the studio is confident they are able to make something better my advice would be please dont bother let this one become an icon this film raised the bar and set the standard for films to come in this genreif i was asked to say something about this film in one sentence than it would be this too much of anything is never a good thing until was made,comedy
i noticed one big mistake in this movie which is the following sentenceim about to do to you what limp bizkit did to music in the late ninetiesto the authorlimp bizkit has actually one of the best atmospheres and energy in their live shows out of all the us bands ive ever seen come over and play here in europeand i have pretty much seen all of the big onesit is also worth noticing that while other formerly good musicians that started in the nineties turned into pop music lb maintained the quality of their sound till this day but of course if you believe todays pop music is good then you will not be able to hear the difference,comedy
went to cinemas expecting to see a good superhero movie and oh boy how wrong was i i didnt watch the trailer maybe i should havethe humor was fun if you like really irritating characters then this movie is totally for youi have seen comedies like shoot em up that do over the top things in a good way you wont get irritated with constant tacky humor like you did with this title of course its good that some movies wanna push the boundaries etc and try out some outrageous things those things can result in really great movies but it certainly wasnt the case with this moviei heard this phrase from a person commenting this movie after the cinema id rather cut my hand off with a spoon than watch this movie so i conclude my review with id rather cut my hand off with a spoon than watch this title again,comedy
im not gonna write a long review for this movie since there are so many of them alreadybut i can tell you this movie is spectacular if not perfect the only reason im not rating it 10 stars is because it had an end you will wish the movie dont come to an end im not a fan and i have never red the comics about but now i am a fan after watching him on the big screen anyway go see it in imax for even a better experience ps i wish one day they will make a movie with spidey and fighting side by side and just nonstop cracking jokes that would be really awesome,comedy
i have to say at first im not a fan of or marvel comics the character was not familiar to me at all beforei just came to watch the movie with a friend because weve seen posters everywhere and it seems the movie is cool came out quite disappointed didnt get their joke and indeed was slightly offended of too much f words obviously their humors didnt come out successfully for international audiences taken for example the night i went to watch theres only a few times the whole cinema broke into laugh it could be that we dont get the american slang although translation in our language is sometimes funny,comedy
this movie is not awesome it is a onetime watch only i dont know why people are so hyped about it this movie just tries to be too funny yet it doesnt succeed always comedy in every 2 seconds in the movie becomes annoying eventually nothing new the editing was nice music was good some scenes were funny but the movie was predictable i predicted what was gonna happen next in the movie and i was right the most foolish line in the movie  did i leave the stove on  doesnt even make senseone last thing the stan lee cameo was okok i dont know why people are saying it is the best cameo but i have seen better stan lee cameo the postcredit scene was nice and i found it funnymust watch if you are having a rough day it will ring a smile to your face if you are already too happy then dont watch because it might disappoint you,comedy
is a perfectly serviceable superhero filmtries hard to be unique with its clever voiceovers and dialogue its flash backs and foreshadowing but the harder it tries to be different the more it is the same there are damsels in distress a revenge tale a face off between the damaged superhero and the deranged supervillain and on and on they even tell you in the credits about all the typical elements of a superhero movie that will be present the credits are to their credit very funny there is an origin story that is quite interesting but there is also the too long courting ritual and the overly long bar scene what the hell directors bars arent that interesting showing us where the hero gets his name while the romantic coupling in the film is extremely unlikely and it is a boring plot device that takes us away from the real action the fight scene at the beginning of the film is very entertaining and well choreographed however they seemed to have run out of ideas by the time of the great and predictable final showdown i know it is hard to come up with new ideas for a superhero movie and does a fairly good job of presenting a different kind of tale however the film gets a case of the box office flu and puts in a lot of standard and unfortunately predictable elements in the film sure origin story is well done if not original and his living situation is unique to say the least but the romance falls flat and is out of place the times when the movie is more entertaining is during the conflict with the cruel villain francis and during the development of powers the bar scene is too long the sex scene it superfluous and not clever and much of the film is filler for the action scenes perhaps i have seen too many superhero films and i am too critical to sit through them and accept the genres failings gives me little hope that this will change the film looks okay but after the original fight scene its visuals are nothing spectacular the acting is average at best and morena baccarin seems out of place in many of the scenes shes not sure how to play the role of the victim or how to be overly sexual and in love to be fair shes not known for nuance and her role is terribly written the writing in general is too clever by fiveeighths its dull and after a while tiresome the films humour and sentimentality dont mix well at all in fact the film is best and most powerful when it eschews sentimentality if the film had ended after thirty minutes i would have given it high marks however it collapsed into a puddle of mediocrity this does not bode well for the upcoming supposedly genre bending superhero film suicide squad a better version of the would have had the hero in a cab all day going from one villains hideout to the next and causing a ruckus ratings matinethere are clever bits interspersed in the film like a sketch comedy show and that kept me entertained for some the show if you really like this genre then by all means see if you dont enjoy superhero films there is nothing in this film to change that stan lees cameo is a bonus however peace tex shelters,comedy
as of now this movie somehow has the same top rating as saving private ryan and raiders of the lost arkhardly think this movie belongs anywhere close merely blown up by comic book fans who think that a guy who wears a mask with crude jokes is the best movie of all timeforced comedy lack of a storyline makes this movie more of a dvd watch on a lazy tuesday evening reynolds is good and this is his perfect role certainly entertaining for college students and comic book junkies but this is a one time watch at best for those who appreciate a quality story and acting,comedy
the highly anticipated movie is finally here and everyone seems to want to be amongst the first people to see it if the number of people who went to see a movie was any indication of how good it is would be awesome unfortunately most of the times those number only indicate how well a product was advertised and may be an example of just thatbecause it is certainly not a very good movie and it certainly doesnt live up to its expectations instead is basically 108 minutes of toilet humour mixed with not particularly well choreographed fighting scenes and an occasional breaking the 4th wallmaybe most disappointing are these 4th wall breakings nowhere does the movie make clear that the titular character is effectively aware of the fact that hes a movie character which would be the case for a movie adaptation of a comicbook character who is comic aware throughout the movie it merely feels like the lead character is just narrating the story about himself rather than a movie about a character that is aware of the fact that he is a movie character even the mandatory stan lee cameo wasnt used and the wisecracking allthough at times funny particularly the joke about the lack of superheros at the x mansion at the camera nowhere surpasses ferris buellercould have been an awesome movie and a completely different kind of superhero movie the trailer had us expacting no less but instead it even falls short to that other superhero movie ryan reynolds starred in that movie never got a green light for a sequel if it were up to me would also receive a red light,comedy
after hearing everyone raving about how funny and awesome this film was i just had to rent it and i couldnt be anymore disappointed the jokes were eh like looking into the camera and trying to crack a joke or hitting someone in the crotch or even taking one up the assyou know what i mean if you seen it as a fan of the xmen film series this colossus bugged me a lot his accent was so annoying and his power isnt to stay full on metal the entire time i did like his other mutant friend she was clich but was decently funny i will say dead pools stunts are awesome and thats great but i felt the movie is no where near as good as the other xmen films yes including the last stand but not including the wolverine origins its okay at best not the best movie of the year but not the worst give it a try but have low expectations,comedy
lame jokes nonsensical writing i couldnt even make it till the end absolutely tasteless garbage funny how its rated 18 when only a 12 year old boy could enjoy itdont look at the rating with that and john wick i now have zero trust in imdb ratings seems to me that theres some major astroturfing going on which would not surprise me considering how hard they marketed this alright lets call it a movie on social mediaso to recap and to get the required 10 lines of text if you enjoy flat jokes mindless violence teenage trying hard to be cool humor then may be this is a movie for you otherwise i would strongly advise not to spend any money on it,comedy
is one of the worst marvel comic book movies ever made and one of the worst films and one of the silliest films ive ever watched it was silly and over the top the action was crazy the language was really bad and it was rude it was a load of crap after an hour of watching the film i gave up on it and 80 minutes into the film i stopped watching the film i completely lost interest in it and i got fed up with it although ryan reynolds really suits the role and was born to play wade wilsonthe character was really annoying and he was a real pain in the ass and a bit of a knob was no better no worst than crank 2 high voltage and iron man 2 and 3 what a waste of 80 minutes i am glad i didnt go and see it on the big screen i give it two thumbs down,comedy
really i would have votes twice higher if this wasnt an adult oriented movie the f swearing is too much and the violence although there arent many scenes is brutal this is no film for kids obviously but what is disappointing is that it could have been a cool funny moviebecause it mixes crude violence with humor it seems like some creepweird moviethe good side is that its well composed and well focused on the main hero while not retaining clichs or annoying lengthy partsif they do a second one i hope they will give up violence and language and give us a nice humorous flick,comedy
this movie was a box office success and i do not understand whyyou know what to expect from the marvel franchise but this was a poorly written script even by their standards i absolutely hate the overly clichd dialogue which has become tiresome no real though went into the plot which is simplistic and fanciful the special effects are good but its loosely held together by a plot that doesnt make sense for example i just found the whole idea that believed he was going to persuade the person who tortured him and destroyed his life to help him completely ridiculous that basically was the ploti know im in the minority here and thats sad there are far better films that flop the directing the acting and the screenplay is nowhere near worthy of the rating on here,comedy
20 century fox finally did something right they not only gave a great character justice but they casted possibly the best person to play him ryan reynolds did to what peanut butter did to jelly yeah that good the movie is made for the fans the comic book but more importantly its made with one thing in mind dont hold any punches literally  figuratively now you may not get all the comic book jokes or puns but you will get satisfied with not only the humor but great action and effects i have waited along time for one of the xmen movies to do my boy colossus justice whoever thought it would be in date movie sure if she likes that kinda of thing family moviekids movie not so much will make waves in this industry with it being a lower budget comic book movie that was a hit in my eyes with a lot of promise for future movies 20th century fox just might have redeemed its self from the fantastic fourwell maybe not but this was definitely a step in the right direction,comedy
even though or  should i say  dead fool was rated as a restricted antihero superhero movie its deadfool story was clearly geared to the mindset of a nonthinking adolescent it really waswhoever made the decision to make such an incessantly annoying chatterer throughout the entire course of the film hohum must have been a total imbecile of the highest orderstarring 40yearold vancouver actor ryan reynolds as the title character  i honestly cant say that i can ever recall seeing such a crappy unconvincing and despicable character portrayal of an antihero hero in an action picture in a mighty longlong timeanyway  from my perspective  with its 50 million budget was absolute bottomofthebarrel moviemaking whose stale and trite storyline brought absolutely nothing fresh or worthwhile to the table,comedy
this was one of the most vulgar ugly and distasteful movies i have ever seen my husband and i got up and walked out early in the film it contained filthy obscene and crude language and actions in every scene it was shockingly dark in humor i cant believe this was a marvel character i am appalled at what the movie industry considers entertaining the character claimed he had a hard childhood and was an antihero so he just chose to kill because he enjoyed it very sad to know many people find this humorous but not so surprising in this day and time warped and twisted character if you want to throw away good money waste your time and be disgusted then this movie is definitely for you not even worth a 1,comedy
maybe im not a ryan reynolds fan but gawd awful movie what the hell were they thinking all the jokes were beyond cheesy and seemed forced not even a good story line eitherthe music was terrible i left to clean my house throughout multiples times in the movie to give it a chance i made it to the end  but it never got better ,comedy
awful just awful the latest in a string of terrible superhero to screen conversions that is immediately forgettable on the plus side if you happen to be a 12 or 13 year old boy then there may well be some hysterical moments in this latest marvelthis should have been sold off to netflix as yet another dreary exclusive sure itll do the rounds and make money at the box office but it really amounts to another nail in an already fairly wellsealed coffinid spend time going through why its so bad but really youll all see it and make up your own mind for me this is sub par even if it was released 10 years ago but here it is right now,comedy
isnt your typical mainstream comic book character he is rude crude violent and not for the kids and this movie encompasses everything that has made wade wilson an unforgettable comic book icon is one part origin story one part love story and whole lot of ass kicking action its humor is unmatched in this genre and it is my belief that after the movies release you wont be able to escape the grip on popular culturewhile the films villains are definitely its weakest parts their is a plethora of things to love in this film so its easy to look past them the highlight are xmen guest stars colossus and negasonic teenage warhead picked solely based on her name interacting with the heroic xmen was definitely my favorite part and really gets you excited for the inevitable sequel is a superhero film we have yet to see grace the big screen and lets hope it starts a new trend of adult orientated superhero films,comedy
everything about this movie was bad im not even angry as i write this im just being honest here everything was distasteful and basically annoying targeted for people probably no better than the obscenities in the movie itself anyone bashing at this review dont worry because if you currently are i already know what type of person you are if you do not change your attitude you wont live very long and if there is a chance that you will ill make sure it doesnt happenplot 610 the plot wasnt that bad but it was still pretty below averagecharacters 110 by far the most retarded characters ive seen in a movie and probably the most retarded of all time the characters in this movie make the jackass cast seem like godshumor 110 the jokes were even worse than insults on a regular basis they were so lame that i couldnt even understand them at some point because it would just start to sound like mumbling when the characters would attempt to say themviolencegore 210 there was way too much of it and its pretty stupid and nasty to have an excessive amount anywaysexnudity 110 wtf i mean seriously i might as well just opened up pornhub and taken care of business the fk was the point of it in this movie i got embarrassed watching these scenes when i was watching this movie with my friends because they were so patheticps i think i lost a lot of brain cells watching this movie therefore my review could have been even better but i think its too late for that anyway i did my best,comedy
i dont understand how this junk got a high rating really if you enjoy this movie you have a bad taste or a mind and age of a 12 year old young dumb and full of cum all you hear is pnis jokes with bad combination of bloody action its a shame how todays youth and movies got no culture as back in the days,comedy
after seeing the trailer a few times and while becoming slightly impatient we had very high expectations however overtook them it is a movie for big children forbidden to children so do leave your 14 at home  a very blunt humour which makes it more realistic awesome special effects and the general idea that all the cast had lots of fun making it ryan reynolds is at his best so much better than the green lantern which was not his fault but this is one of the differences between dc comics and marvel comics we will go see it again especially that it is shown on a 170 square meters macroxe ultra hd screen only for a limited period of time,comedy
best movie ever let me first preface this review by saying the movie was a freaking amazing hilarious action packed shoot em up with super energetic charactersso wtfs up with the 5 stars to put it as bluntly as possible i would say this movie tried way too hard to earn its r rating i love the concept of a smartass merc who cant die and no reservations with killing people i also thought the way they handled gore was very tastefully done and not overboard which brings me to my two base issues nudity and language first off no i am not going to say i think the movie should of had no language i really did not care that everyone swore my issue was the way it was done it felt like literally every sentence had to have as many curse words as time would permit even if they made no sense whatsoever so often things were said that had me scratching my head trying to figure out how any of those words went together dont get me wrong i would of preferred the movie have no curse words and i think it would of been just fine see expendables 2 and how they originally intended to have 100 f words but i wont argue that point because thats not my real issue with the dialog its the incoherent method they went about it trying for some sort of pervasive language award or somethingsecond off was all the nudity seriously people none of the nudity benefited anything the sexual references were also a bit thick but i didnt go to see a movie and not expect to hear a bunch of those but the inconsistency of he nudity really frustrated me some were blink and you would miss it bedroom scene some were strategically hidden except when for no reason they werent building explosion some nudity was specifically not shown and made specifically pointed to as not showing it think colossus scene and others were thrown in our faces for no point nightclub scene no rhyme or reason for how much or little was shown none of it benefited the movie plot or were important for maintaining story integrity just unnecessary gratuitous nudity to further push the r ratingim not a prude when it comes to language gore nudity or references if done tastefully and sparingly i literally watched freaks of nature and the night before just before watching this movie i gave the night before 9 stars it had nudity language and references but it was all done within reason and never just thrust in your face for shock value it was also super hilariousof course i enjoyed this i laughed so hard and so long i will be remembering quotes from the this movie for many years to come but i will not just let hollywood get away with doing whatever the hell they want and assuming people will be fine with it there were 5 of us watching today but if this movie had less crap in it i not only could of brought over 20 more people to see it who now wont i would of probably watched it myself 56 more times however in its current form i will not as always people will disagree with my review but this is the internet you arent really saying anything worth saying if no one is getting mad at you lol,comedy
this movie a pathetic attempt at making a super hero movie with a twist of spoof but it fails at both the supposed hilarious moments in the fights including a scene where ryan gets shot in the butt were repulsive rather than being funny the movie does not have a plot to begin with and the director thinks that showing some violence the blood and gore can fill for the gaps in the story line the movie also fails in portraying the protagonist as a bad guy who is in some ways good but takes on enemies who are worse this movie was like watching the xmen originswolverine breaking bad john wick and kill bill mashed up in 90 minutes and i wasted 90 minutes on a saturday watching this stupid movie,comedy
this movie surprised me i walked into this movie hoping for it to be good and man am i glad to have gone this movie was brutal crude indecent and a hell of a good time the casting for this movie was nothing less than absolute perfection ryan reynolds shines with his secondary characters tj miller weasel brianne hildebrand negasonic teenage warhead and stefan kapicic colossus providing great performances that really worked with character i was taken aback i knew i would laugh at some jokes but not that many jokes this movie although following a bythebook plot line covered up the story with its action and comedy and made it feel brand new this movie may not have reinvented the superhero genre but it surely provides a fun and refreshing good time while it lasts,comedy
i am diehard fan  was expecting even better from tim miller but mate there was just as much action as the trailer contains movies is humorous though but for a point of view a real disappointment the acting  casting is average but no action at all ryan does a good job but plot  story could have been much much better than just a just non stop jokes that mainly fall flatthe plot is nothing more than a simple background origins story and it is run of the mill ryan reynolds thank you for fighting to have this movie come to life  i wish i could erase my memory of this movie to get rid of superhero movie fatigue,comedy
this is the pixie sticks of movies it hits you in the dome and then you wondered why you geekd out so hard i couldnt recite one joke from this mess its not that memorable because hes so clever and so funny and so charming with the references right right this of course will pass for todays theater experience throw it on the wall and hope they like something watching this was equivalent of someone grabbing you by the scruff of your neck and dragging you through a teenagers bedroom circa 19901996 like when you went over to your friends house and their little brother couldnt stop annoying you with their toys the single biggest issue i had with this movie is that there are way too many people cracking wise his bartender friend his girlfriend the blind black woman he inexplicably takes as a roommatefor what reason please tell me so he can crack more jokes this is one big skit and violence in between there are so many questions to his psyche that despite ryan reynolds supposed charm and selfeffacing humorit doesnt cut to the darkness yes there are glimpses of true pain and anguish but its quickly diffused with that humor either you get it or you dont and its hard to imagine any of the teenagers in the theater i saw it in understand why the 20 something hot prostitute girlfriend knows the value of a voltron ring shes really not that cool shes a whore but doesnt look like one act like one feel like one i see that years earlier this wouldve been a great role for someone like gina gershon in this movie this girl doesnt have that broken busted look no matter how much pain in life shes endured number one rule of storytelling show dont tell and theres a ton of tellbackstory upon history upon explanation yes it breaks rules but it also doesnt know when to use the rules they set up they break the fourth wall to talk to the audience then make references to how cheap this movie was made only two xmen characters is this funny yes and no most people dont give a damn about whats outside those walls only that youre entertaining us but that is the point they are dying for you to like them i dont think ive seen a movie try so hard for you to like them and for the most part i do butits exhausting to be around this attention deficit flick for the most part are the stakes really that high not really wade wilson aka voluntarily accepts treatment for cancer that will kill him hes cured except now hes deformed his biggest issue of revenge is ridiculously superficial which they had to explain away in terms of how people find each otherlooks being the sole purpose even though nothing in the history would explain wilson and his girlfriends attraction was due to looks they are kindred spirits by way ofpop culture so similar they might as well be brother and sister thats broken rule number two there is nothing unique about her she is the proverbial hooker with a heart of gold or is she who knows she doesnt seem to be in that much of a hurry to leave the business as shes seen later as a cocktail waitress at a strip club by the way has anyone asked what shes doing at a bar which is frequented by regulars and would just nonchalantly let in a hooker trying to score johns the villain issoplain what is his super power oh one that he gave himself and it overlaps with others and is vague he doesnt feel pain okay so that sword that is jammed through his shoulder and carotid wouldnt you know stop his heart i guess not since in this world youd need to feel pain to bleed out and he heals slower than others so say a hubcap to the face or being thrown through vehicles wouldnt likebreak every bone in his body nope not in this universe also the teenager with the cool name and the ability to apparently nuke the worldhow is it that it didnt incinerate gina caranos clothes off obvious as the big metal russian guy was sparring with her she had nip slip if youre going to go all the way start with that look dont ask too many questions and youll have fun for me it did what it needed to do but i dont think this movie will hold up to the hype its getting a few months from now its a lackluster ice cream with a ton of whip cream itll make you fat and youll regret it down the road however its a good matine watch and worth debating with marvel nerds,comedy
the wacky humor is there thats a plus and thats all that was needed unfortunately  unlike the game  the movie is extremely violent and full of gore and may cause nightmares i like the jokes but find the unnecessary violence  which includes torture  in bad taste and it cancels out all the funi havent read the comics maybe they are equally violent but theres a way to film a violent comedy  even a gory one  without making it real take a lesson from peter jacksons braindeadmissing from this movie is the fragmentation of his personality that pervaded the computer game i wonder if the movie is true enough to the original characteravoid if you have any good taste at all else have fun,comedy
unfortunately fox and marvel are going to need a little more than strippers and ryan reynolds to get out of their slump i understand this movie is an acquired taste but i feel as if it was missing a good story i will admit the comedy did make me grin at some points but did seem a bit inane for most of the movie if youre going to do a comedy film make the jokes witty and clever rather than just having the lead actor cuss every 2 seconds i honestly thought tj millers minor role as weasel was funnier than all of dead pools oneliners combined i also felt the story jumped around too much yes i understand the beginning of the movie mostly consisted of flashbacks but when they returned to the main storyline i almost forgot what all had previously happened the writers wasted a lot of time and ended up focusing more on making the movie funny than making the movie worthy of a sequel i do really hope that fox and marvel will improve in their upcoming ventures but for right now they need to focus on writing a good story making the main protagonist indestructible without any weakness kind of eliminates the drama a little bit cough coughman of steel once again i really do hope that fox and marvel can get back to telling the great stories that they were meant to tell instead of just making every comic book theyve ever written into a movie,comedy
oh my god what was that story rubbishthere is no story there is no character building as well for the whole movie all you can do is to bear along the horrible filthy mouth of the main character full of irritating dialogues which are neither funny nor appropriate plus i dont understand the presence of xmen characters these characters were fitted in a worst possible way wade wilson is an insane cold blooded killer looks like that the killing is done for the fun of it i think it would have been better had the movie makers added a tag line for useless violence lovers onlyi mean to say a rubbish movie a real piece of junk whoever voted higher ranks for this movie can be saluted what else could be done i dont understand how these kind of movies do awesome business,comedy
i never knew of the character until the xmen movies i was skeptical about seeing the movie now that i have watched the movie i am waiting for the sequel the movie was definitely made for adults and i found myself thinkingthe character is actually doing what we secretly wanted super heros to do to the bad guys all along just like the movie the punisher warzonespeak softly and carry a big stick there was a perfect blend of cgi and the chemistry between the actors the one liners between the characters provided a perfect combination of comedy and action stan lees cameo was the icing on the cake the rewatch value for this movie is high when the dvd is released it will be in my collection i can only imagine the deleted scenes,comedy
its an xmen spin off its also an 18orolder film due to the sexual innuendos of the jokes i found the humor annoying after awhile mostly cause i was not expecting a comedy and they insisted on writing corny jokes that stuff wasnt even clever now if it was robert downey jrironman clever then you would have had me at bang but this turkeys hero fails to swoon mei also thought the idea of the stripper getting back with the disfigured protagonist was outside the realm of reality and human nature i did not like mister pool or the metallic russian or the flame on girl but she was cute though i didnt even like the story he was preoccupied with the destiny of my dick lets call itwe dont care whether he gets laid or notbut look if you can sell a talking raccoon in space you can sell this too because the public is officially stupid and well probably wind up with trump and world war iii next year so if it gives you wood buy the dvd it insulted my intelligence more than entertained itmy review contains prohibited words so did this film,comedy
they said it couldnt be done they said will never be made and i as well as others almost agreed after his abysmal performance in xcrement origins wimperine the potential of the merc with a mouth was almost terminated without fanfare good ol wade wilson just couldnt get a breakwell after so many trials and tribulations was finally given the green light and lo and behold he bursts out of the comics and onto the silver screen with spectacular results so vulgar so violent so crude yet so refreshingly simple that it set the bar for rrated comic book movies quite possible for years to come this film proved that violent superheroesactuallymake that antiheroes can be immensely profitable judging be the films juggernaut boxoffice success as an origin story is great showing us a side to the merc with a mouth with a violent vulgar side to the character but also surprisingly with human depth something origins failed to achieve character development and human pathos combine to make a troubled and flawed jerk with a heart of gold a very likable and relatetable jerk with a heart of goldyes the action is bloody yet great with slomo effects and yes the humor is vulgar and narcissistic but it fits the character very well but most importantly is the acting and ryan reynolds nails it perfectly i can think of no other actor that is much suited for the role and he is simply perfect with his manic personality and spot on wisecracks the film simply wouldnt work without a hard r rating thankfully the studio let the filmmakers run wild in high octane adventure and explosive gravitasprops to all involved in its smart stylish and refreshingly original im glad they had the balls to make a rrated marvel comic book movie and they achieved it one of the best films of the year and i cant wait for the inevitable sequel a second and third viewing is definitely not out of the question great film great cast great direction simply put great rrated comic book movie,comedy
i know that perhaps my age may be a factor in my enjoyment or lack thereof of this movie the last marvel movies to be r rated were the blade series it was clear that they were r rated due to the content vampires and killing i thought would be along the same lines an r rating for excessive blood maybe gore or maybe one too many f bombs well milked their r rating for all it was worth plenty of profanity nudity sex and even a masturbation scene that wasnt what i was expectingto me in the lore of the marvel universe is in the periphery he was always a character i knew existed but never took the time to delve into his comics the movie was going to be my first full introduction if first impressions last the longest this one is going to stinkis funny in a crude sophomoric kinda way anyone whos seen ryan reynolds in anything knows that he can talk a mile a minute and can be quite the laugh well imagine ryan reynolds with no limitations a lot of the humor was missed because a ryan reynolds talks too fast b he made references to things obscure to you or me in this case or c it just fell flat i expected humor and got it in spades plus some stuff i didnt care for i expected some nice effects and fight scenes and also got that the fight and gun play scenes were astounding which left me wanting more of it and less of the other stuffthis was the comic book movie for adults which is weird because so many kids were in the theater i dont think parents know what r rating means anymore and not all adults i think the movie could have been better with less profanity less nudity and fewer sexual references when i say sexual references im not talking subtle innuendos im talking inyourface crass sexual humor tone that all down an it is a lot better movie,comedy
i have never written a movie review but felt obliged after being conned by imdb into believing this would be a good filmat over 80 out of 10 this movie is meant to be up there with the greatsthis is one of the worst films i have ever seen i was with a friend who bought the tickets so i stayed but would have left after 20 minutesthe other user reviews will describe the puerile humour the bad jokes the embarrassing attempts at comedy it was a nauseating experience at timesi spent the film on my phone on the imdb website trying to understand how it was so highly rated i noticed that a deluge of 100 ratings were received around february 14 2016 this cant be a coincidencethe studio has obviously paid a bunch of interns to write fake reviews so that the film would be highly rated on imdb and other sites this is fraudulent and i will never trust imdb againimdb should be ashamed of itself for allowing this to happen im so sick of hollywood and the movie industry in generalaside from the above fake reviews the film is littered with the usual political bs beta male sacrificing himself for a woman a whore actually tiny women saving mens lives tiny women beating the crap out of giant men etc etc etc im done with this propaganda,comedy
i still cant believe how many people love this movie it makes me feel left out that i cant love the movie like everyone else well lets go to the positive parts of the film the beginning credit scene is very smart and one of the best i have ever seen not using the real names of the actors and just using what they are playing as is very original and i didnt see it coming some of the comedy is good like the scene where gets angry at colossus and tries to hurt him is very funny but unfortunately there are more non funny then funny and now the negative the love story is stupid and i did not care if would get his girl back the villain was also really dumb and not memorable and the worst part of the movie most of the jokes were not funny like i wanted them to be what a shame what a shame,comedy
this is perhaps the ultimate superhero movie its got so much rewatchability factor its off the scale there is a brief scene of sex and nudity a few swear words but nothing too serious its got lots of killing but even more jokes and jokes that work on every level if the martian can win a comedy award this should take every award at the next golden globes and oscars by miles there is an aftercredit scene and its worth sticking around for from the hilarious opening credits to the references to both xmen and avengers films its perfect colossus is finally given some okay cgi and actual has a decent role in the story its nice to see his character used properly for once the girl has her uses but is best used to bounce jokes off just like the villains but its ll good it will be hard for any film to beat this for best film of 2016,comedy
first the parts i liked the plot and the before story were both great and done just right to show how the protagonist got to where he is at although more time was spent on this than with some other movies i personally did not feel that it was overdonenow for the part that ruined this movie for me i feel that the gross humor and profanity was way overdone which was quite disappointing i think it would have been a much better movie and appealed to a much broader audience if that had been dialed back a few notches pay very close attention to the r rating this is definitely not for the kids or younger teens,comedy
thats not an exaggeration after the first 35 minutes i couldnt watch any more of it so i jumped forward through most of the movie watched part of the final fights then fast fast fast forwarded through the endthe movie is full of rapid fire bad jokes including lots of ball jokes the story is told in a back and forth between the present and flash back with the last few minutes moving forward to the end the action scenes are full of slow motion and freezes constantly talks to the audience its bad movie making 101the story is generic superhero origin  the bad guys give him super powers while at the same time messing him up he gets revengeit might have been watchable if it had less of the bad jokes and a straight line story a decent story may have helped but the story was good enough for an action movieit must be millennials stoners or more likely stoned millennials who watched this movie to make it popular,comedy
based on my local 4k digital theatrical viewing of a severely chopped version with more than 60 of language and perhaps 40 of action sequences excised after the local scissorrunthe same distributor who respected their makers artistic rights when david fincher flatly refused to make cuts to his remake of the girl with the dragon tattoo which caused in that movie being banned here though its global box office was nothing to scream about have this time decided to make money off this particular version anyway and released this in its pg09 form good for the kids who sneak in i guess oh wait thats not gonna be the case since this is rated a supposedly equivalent of the rnc171518 abroad depending on the region to be fair though fincher and another studio did release the chopped version of his gone girl which introduced a new kind of chopping at the time where keys sequences remain intact but the scissorhappy folk try their hand at panning and scanning zooming into a neutral background retaining the soundtrack while eliminating the offending visuals for our safe viewing at the cinema a lot of that in this flick wonders of technology and all thatwell supposed to be the mercwiththemouth in spite of the fact that he wears a mask surprisingly not to protect his identity as such since mutants in the xverse do not have multiple identities but to cover his being burnt mercwithamouth means hes supposed to mouthoff and were supposed to listen reflectweigh in and reactrespond accordingly however in the local market that i luckily happened to watch this in i got little opportunity to do that however the mastersofthescissors do their jobs with their typical inefficiency that few cuss words do slip through and then the audience started playing the game of guesswhatcusswordgotmuted all the way to the end yeah stay beyond the credits  this may be fox but it is marvel i cannot present a fair viewpoint on the version i watched and my rating of this flick reflects the version presented here however assuming i did not miss much in terms of plot there are a few observations that maymaynot recommend this one to you 1 breaking the 4th wall in a mainstream superhero movie is good but it gets old real fast take a cue from leo doing it in wolf of wall street where it shows up in just the right amount so if theyre relying on this alone for the sequel ahemthey just might have to write better jokes also it gets old real fast except for those who do not know the background about the movie or about ryan reynolds at a point it got so i did not know if it was the character breaking down that wall or green lantern or ryan reynolds too much of a good thing gets real old real fast and heh he also breaks down that 4th wall for telling us that he broke that 4th wall down nuts 2 the redband trailers sadly have more content that the final local theatrical version and also does the disservice of spoiling many key sequences for the audience and that might be felt more in regions which have those sequences intact 3 best stan lee cameo ever hint think snl jason sudeikis4 one of the best xmen ever in the form of colossus whose earnestness used almost as comic relief to own devil maycare wisecracking hero this is one character to remember nee treasure 5 negasonic teenage warhead go watch 6 blind al old lady pants wish theyd shown more about how dp and she got together but the one with the growing hand is something most audiencemembers heh missed 7 homelands morena baccharin but no not at a local viewing 8 only 3 action setpieces tight budget apparently and yeah our mouthy hero tells us that thrice after having broken 16 walls per his own admission 9 corny love earnest love mainstream love predictable love cornywait did i just say that earlier oh heckinitially i thought this was counter programming for the usual valentines day fare but if you see the wadevanessa oohaah and remember minus all the good parts over here its just soyawn10 the transporter refueled whats ed skrein doing in this one seriously and whys he the character there doesnt even make for a menacing bad guy almost like the excessively selfreferential fauxcredits at the beginning had to be true and the real heroes just could not be bothered to write better several million drafts and this 11 gina carano with excess baggage had better presence in both haywire and fast  furious 6 disappointing 12 tj miller couldve been utilized more though his character is kinda funny in the scenes hes givennow obviously i cannot recommend this movie for local theatrical viewing unless youre one of those that gets off on all the scissorhappiness thats prevalent this month h8ful 8 got the chops too in case you were wondering and there was precious little left to watch or to listen to at the end of it all in fact this might be my last rrated movie viewing on the local big screen for a long time to come unless i hear of some massive change in the way mature movies are presented to local audiencesand oh enjoy the smoking and alcohol disclaimers littered across the screen throughout,comedy
it contains too much f words i just dont like thatnudity for laughing nooo at least to meand there were too many names magazines movies or whatever that are so unfamiliar with audiences from out of america thats annoying to me the is not an excellent actor sometimes just sometimes he made me feel like hes not for a comedyits also not an educational movie killing people just like theyre trash and love should not be that easy v v v andthis is my feeling only feel free to have yours,comedy
it is funny if you are a silly 13 years old teenager,comedy
like marvel films better than some do have never been and never will be part of this ridiculous mcu vs dcu war and the positive critical reception drew me in to seeing having now seen it finally seeing as audience reaction seemed more divisive especially here where the dislike is unnecessarily vitriolic which did put me off watching it for a while it was a good film if not a great one it was very entertaining and credit is due for trying to take more of a comedic edge to a genre that can be taken seriously sometimes overly so and for taking risks at the same is also uneven for me did have its issues tonally it is not always balanced with too much emphasis on the humour and not enough on the action contrary to what others thought most of the humour was enjoyable but there were jokes and lines that didnt land very well due to taking it too far with the crudeness and childishness some of the superhero clich jokes felt very out of date and stale other minuses are the overlong length some repetition a pretty forgettable villain and a rushed and muddled final act however is very well made visually slick stylish and brooding with typically well crafted effects the music is haunting and rousing and most of the direction is very assured and sharp if at times not always in control of the tonal balances the action is dynamically choreographed and exciting and the romantic and emotional elements just about avoid the mawkish sentimentality trap and instead give its heartmost of the humour is very funny though its extremely black comedic nature has proven to be an acquired taste as said that it tried to incorporate humour into an often taken seriously genre was interesting and refreshing even if there is a try too hard element at times with how its balanced with everything else the story is a pretty lightweight one structurally but the hugely energetic pace and sense of fun elevated it ryan reynolds brings charismatic charisma vulnerability and great comic timing to the title role one he was born to play and he successfully allows one to root for his character all the cast do a more than serviceable job morena baccarin coming over the most confidently in summary good film if not great rough around the edges but not without its charm like the titular character hero himself 710 bethany cox,comedy
is a flick genetically engineered to appeal to imdb spawn redditors with no sense of sophistication who laud meme dialog which supports upvote circlejerk mentality and meme acting with a good movie pandering reddit tier meta superhero entertainment sensibilities and a meme tv movie aesthetic this is a cheap flick at best and will be forgotten in few weeksthe flick itself is nothing fresh other than some cheap shots of ass and boobs and not to forget fartpoop jokes in a superhero flick basic storysame old saving the girlfriend from villain revenge plot ryan reynolds playing himself for 134th time zero interesting characters teammates were a literal walkingtalking cgi and an average tumblr user also one more thing that i didnt notice in the movie was a villain was there an antagonist in this movie i remember two henchmen one male and a female but never remembered seeing a villain i understand their budget restrictions for making this a small scale movie but the ending helicarrier destruction was totally unnecessary waste of their cgi and budget now to things i like about this movie action without too much cgi parts the costume morena baccarin and the scenes where didnt make a dumb jokes references and quips oh wait there wasnt anynow to the audience i had to share the theatre with were 12 year olds and 6 year olds with there parents who laughed whenever appeared flicks like these becoming successful is the reason why movies like mad max and the revenantnot the best examples but anywayswill never be commercially successful tldr this flick is the greatest proof pandering to the lowest common denominator aka low iq manchildren with a sense of humor of an average big bang theory fan and 12 year olds is the best way to make a big r rated blockbuster,comedy
yeah you think he is an anarcho punk with lots of cool jokes well think again the story in the film is quite lame hero gets hurt by villain hero seeks revenge villain takes the girlfriend of the hero hero saves her and the live prosper for the rest of their lives this could come from disney so conservative is the plot and the most funny jokes youve already seen in the trailer and when the hero will heal himself every time there is no place for suspense nor drama the mediocre rap music cant help it eithernot as funny as super or kick ass and highly overrated no good sidekicks or villains boring and slow in the middle expected much more,comedy
this is the movie all fans have been waiting for crude rude and anything but subdued at times plays too much like fan service than a movie but what better character to finally get his moment in the spotlighteveryone behind and in front of the camera did a phenomenal job bringing the merc with a mouth to life tim miller did a great job with origin and the way it is handled is brilliant ryan reynolds is he is perfect in the role no one else could possibly play the cast around him is great as well with morena baccarin playing a very believable love interest and tj miller supplying some nice backandforth scenes colossus and negasonic teenage warhead are also great additions and i hope more xmen characters interact with in the futureas far as pure entertainment goes this is as good as it can get 90 of the jokes hit and the ones that dont were in the trailer the humor is raunchy and juvenile working perfectly with the awesome action scenes there are countless bad ass moments in this film and the r rating allows them to have these moments they dont abuse the r rating but it serves its purposethe only flaw i have with this film is at times it kind of gets lost in its fan service there are a few scenes that are definitely funny but serve no purpose but to please fans of the comics i still enjoyed the moments as a fan of the character and i get why they did it was to make sure hardcore fans were satisfied after the long wait for their character to hit the big screenoverall gives its character the movie he deserves its consistently hilarious and the action scenes will leave you with plenty to discuss with your buddies its more fan service than a complete film but i am definitely ok with that,comedy
i am gonna go straight to the point except ryan reynolds dialogue starting credits and post credit scene there is nothing in this movie there is no story at all thats what happens if you give a bad ass character over to disney no matter how many times the f word is being used it is still a family movie ok maybe a family of children above 15 so i repeat there is no story at all someone scorched his skin he goes after him finds him takes revenge movie is over however being said all this the opening credits kind of warn you about the movie by stating how overly paid director was hired or there is a token comic character and an english villain awful yeah time killed indeed yeah,comedy
im not a huge fan of comic book hero movies when i saw avengers age of ultron last year in downtown la i fell asleep halfway through the thing is that these movies are all pretty much the same film made from exactly the same mold same story same characters same plot devices etc that in itself is not a major crime it shouldnt keep a movie from being entertaining the original the avengers is still a favorite of mine with all of its sharpness and spectacular action set pieces anyway thats where im coming fromi saw today and it really is a mess its a comedy film and while it does have a few funny scenes most jokes fall flat this is a movie that does not take itself too seriously a movie that acknowledges the silliness of the genre but does not have the quality jokes to make that cynicism stand the story the least interesting part of this mess of a whole is typical comic book hero stuff the action set pieces are weak too this is not great film making at all not even for a silly big budget spoof remember silly spoofs can be intelligent and fun to watch too mel brooks proved that decades ago and yeah kickass was much better than this,comedy
who knew when wade wilson first appeared in marvel comics in 1991 created by fabian nicieza and rob liefeld as an answer to dc comics character slade wilson that his wise cracking antics would become media gold the new movie based on the character solidifies the marvel antihero as a big hitter and a money maker able to stand on his own that may not be so surprising with such a longtime fan base eagerly waiting for any and every fourth wall the character will break what is surprising is that along with all the quips and punches that are expected of his movie brings actual weight and story that grounds the crazinessis debauchery the film rides low and dirty on filthy humor and over the top fights guns ablasting and swords at the ready it cashes in on just about every stereotype that comes with the machismo action genre but pokes fun at it and at itself more than that it oddly turns much of it on its head in various circumstances everyone including himself is a sex object here and rightfully so this is a very sexy movie at the same time all of the major women of the movie hold more than their own strength in their own way these are nice rules to breakwhile the film is unrelenting in its oneliners puns and references to pop culture most of which are spot on and hilarious there is actually a lot of heart here the story has a depth that is shocking and the editing helps to balance that flow in and out of the sane and the loony it somehow is a cathartic film not only getting out all that naughtiness and aggression but also finding ways to connect its characters through heart love trust and companionship so thats why it was released valentines day weekend its even a great date movieis a sweetheart and the role that ryan reynolds was born to play for as silly as it is reynolds takes the character seriously able to deliver the most absurd jokes and the most ridiculous lines of dialogue with complete feeling and gravity he also shows the most range that i believe ive ever seen him do this is a flamboyant and spastic character which is hard enough to make believable and not campy on its own but to have to run through everything that this films plot throws at you on top of that is a feat reynolds has really found a great performance in the merc with a mouthyou come to a movie like for the comedy and action but you get swept up in the love the horror and the drama ending up with quite a well rounded flick in fact its one of the heftiest superhero origin stories told on film in recent years this is a dessert with something for everyone to enjoy including nuts and a great big banana topped off with cherry popping childishness but please do not bring your children to see this movie its a great date movie remember but for perverted consenting adults like us,comedy
this movie is by far the worse of anything that anyone can put out the plot was full of holes the characters far from believable and the acting overall is what makes actors in the adult industry believe they can actually cross over in to mainstream hollywood the jokes in this are funny at first but after hearing the same lame topics for awhile it gets tiring unless you are a teenager going through puberty with hormones all out of whack actually they would get tired of the jokes the only people who would not are the really weird people that live in their moms basement at 40 plus years the movie is more violent and has more profanity than other marvel movies which does nothing to help or hinder the movie it is the acting and writing that destroys this movie overall if you have not seen this movie consider yourself lucky if you have like i have and are divorced like me then be thankful for the movie watching it was the worse decision and not my taste in women,comedy
first of all i understand that almost everyone loves this movie with that being said i personally was very disappointed and do not understand the hype i had been excited for years waiting for this movie and it was not what i had hoped for the story or what the writers pretend was a story was terrible i was honestly so uninterested in the protagonists that i did not care who won i know that is a funny character but i was still hoping for grounded storyline the plot was all over the place and not intriguing whatsoever some of the jokes were mildly funny however i found the majority of the jokes too immature and frantic to be of any real comedic value they felt very forced furthermore the humor was overall too childish and crass i got tired of most of the jokes very quickly based on how this movie turned out i would have preferred a pg13 version similar to other xmen movies it is a shame to me that the worst xmen movie in my opinion became the most popular and highest grossing,comedy
or maybe you like it even more for not being part of the other marvel movies even if it refers to some of the characters especially the xmen since this is mostly owned by 20th century fox i never read the comics but did have the pleasure of playing the game on my playstation and i did think it was hilariousthe wink wink humor of it is not everybodys taste of course but if you like movies breaking the fourth wall beginning with the opening titles than is speaking directly to you  kind of literally he also is as offensive as possible and still very likable which is a testament to the lead actor reynolds seems a perfect fit for this leaving behind the shame of being green another superhero he played not as successful if you even can remember thateven if you saw the trailer there are so many jokes in here you will find many things to like unless you are more of straight kind of jokes guygal  no pun intended but then you better steer clear of this anyway ,comedy
this was just a terrible film all together the fact that this film has already been given an 89 is quite frankly disturbing and one of the many reasons god doesnt talk to us anymore the casting is honestly terrible and should have only ever have been played by mark wahlberg the fourth wall is broken too many times and him knowing he is in a film is also one of the other factors ruining the film the scripting is terrible and the jokes are poorly written i feel the film has only been given an 89 as a tribute to the director and the fact that he has ruined his career with this terribly bad film personally i would rather scrape my eyes out with a spoon than watch this poorly made horrible film,comedy
its no different from any superhero movie out there  bombastic sillystupid and generic the plot is essentially what you see in almost every superhero origin movie out there guy gets a superpower then he gets emo about this new superpower then gets girl problems that ultimately becomes the driving force of the climax ryan reynolds essentially plays himself here if you like shrek movies fart jokes and cartoonlike plotting and characterization then this is your movie if you are a fan of film and want to push these kinds of garbage to the nether where they belong please avoid this film theres really nothing redeeming about this film except some humor,comedy
ten out of ten doesnt even do justice ryan reynolds and have torn apart what you expect from a superhero movie and now offer you a comic book franchise that no other studio can they have given you a superhero film for strictly adults only there were 1012 year olds in the theater if you let anyone under 16 see this then you are a horrible parent earns its r rating the hard way lots of brutal violence lots of nudity and excessive language does anyone else miss the old days when our action heroes were in your face brutal unforgiving and not afraid to use bad language take the original blade for example it worked brilliantly now imagine that with five times the language more stylized action and a boatload of laughs i literally laughed from start to finish with this movie but still found our hero incredibly badass what do i mean by this changes everything fox now has the one thing no other studio does an over the top hero not only worthy but demanding of an r rating now warner bros sony and even marvel studios will guarantee follow suit i believe we could now get r rated wolverine maybe r rated batman even point is that it is now proved that you can go true to your comic aim for adults and not just succeed but bring me back im going tomorrow to make twice in 2 days if your over 18 and dont like it then hang yourself cuz youll never be entertained,comedy
to be fair ive never been a fan of as a comic character i find him unoriginal crass and tiring and thats pretty much how his movie turned out on one of the rare occasions when the wife and i got some time away from our daughter we decided to see whatever was on at the local cinema sadly it was deadpoolits not completely terrible there are some cool visuals and a few of the jokes hit the mark its the jokes though that really drag the movie down they are just unending incessantly trying to make you laugh and shock you with their adult content but theyre just not funny in most instances the humour is juvenile in the extreme i find it concerning all these socalled mature reviewers praising the movie for catering to their adult tasteslikewise the violence is so over the top it is neither shocking nor effective it doesnt serve the story in any meaningful way so it is just there for the adult fans to marvel at all the blood and brain splatter overall a pretty disappointing cinema experience but kind of as expected,comedy
full disclosure i have not yet enjoyed any of the many critically acclaimed marvel movies i find the avengers et al to be contrived visual spectacles devoid of any real cinematic merit its hackneyed film making trash i went to see with dampened expectations but i had a bit of hope in me given the r rating and the hints at it being a little more subversive than its sister films unfortunately this wasnt the casethis is just another lifeless hollywood blockbuster albeit with a mask on breaking the fourth wall repeatedly blood guts nudity and all of the crude humour you could ever want sure sounds great right not this time if you put lipstick on a pig its still a pig marvel has been pushing pigs out year after year this one is just wearing a little more makeup than usual its still a generic shell of a film devoid of any substance the plot and comedic devices are all entirely predictablethe jokes were forced and relentless i dig profanity and violence and all things crude but there was no nuance here this film was a struggle to sit through it was just all so lame they could have made something truly subversive and critical of the superhero genre instead they just made another standard marvel film with cursing how disappointing,comedy
for all ive hardly read the comics i did initially find the premise of a movie based on the antihero quite interesting with his wise cracking jibes and sarcastic humour i thought that it could have delivered a fresh take on the wellestablished marvel cinematic universe mcu films of the good guys vs the bad guys perhaps something a bit more daring and mature but still in keeping with the theme of its predecessors oh how i was wrong enter the most overrated and pointless mcu film currently out thereit all seemed to start fairly well with more mature humour and some gory violence with a bit of foul language thrown in everything i expected to be slowly however the jokes became so similar to the point that they seemed to just give three decent ones at the start and then recycled them this continued to the point that it became annoyingly predictable and for jokes that werent greatly funny in the first place i was becoming extremely bored by the end especially when other people at the cinema were laughing so hard at the same crude vulgar stuff over and over again dont get me wrong im no prude but i dont think i laughed again after the first quarter of the filmspoilers below so the film is basically about getting revenge against the villain ajax for disfiguring him completely during an experiment to make super soldiers the experiment however has gifted with accelerated healing factor allowing him to regrow limbs and mend wounds within a matter of hours practically making him invulnerable thats my second problem with this film why did the writers decide to pitch an almost unbeatable protagonist against ajax a second rate villain whos powers basically include enhanced strength and speed combined with an inability to feel pain which fair enough would give him an advantage when fighting normal people but against other super humans he pales in comparison so what happens when an invincible fights a very mortal ajax you guessed it wins thats why the plot is so predictable yes i understand its a comic book film and the protagonist always wins but why not pitch him against an actual threat the mcu has thus far provided good matches for our heroes such as captain america vs red skull or hulk vs abomination having vs ajax was as expected a result as superman vs robin giving it no sense of danger or excitementthis combined with the typical boy meets girl oh wait im disfigured so she can never love me again relationship which isyou guessed it rekindled at the end along with the seemingly stuck on xmen only adds to how terrible the film iswell thats basically all there is to this steaming pile that is the movie its only redeeming quality i thought were the action scenes though again they were dulled by the included jokesso if youre someone who enjoys crude immature humour and a predictable plot then youll enjoy if you like suspense good jokes and a strong well written story then avoid this at all costs,comedy
desperately wants to be cool and funny but it fails on both counts the best way to summarise what this film is all about is the following quote  have you ever heard david beckham speak it sounds like he mouthsexed a can of helium the film is packed full of these type of jokes and the one i quoted is one of the better or less cringeworthy ones most arent funny in the slightesti would usually write something about the plot but unfortunately there isnt one so no spoilers here thats right a movie with no plot has somehow managed a score of 82 on imdb  higher than some classics obviously ive missed a trick here but didnt do anything for me my score of 3 is only because of some of the action and violence which was mildly entertaining otherwise this was a bore,comedy
released in 2016 stars ryan reynolds as a former special forces operative turned mercenary who is permanently scarred after undergoing a dubious operation but is enhanced with accelerated healing powers he adopts the alter ego and armed with his new abilities and a twisted sense of humor hunts down the man who nearly destroyed his life morena baccarin plays his potential babe while stefan kapicic and brianna hildebrand are on hand as colossus and negasonic teenage warheadthis is a creative energetic and often funny parody of marvel superhero movies highlighted by cutie baccarin and an excellent portrayal of colossus of the xmen the xteen is pretty cool too reynolds is outstanding as the protagonist but wadeis the main problem with the movie while there are glimpses of wades potential good side throughout hes so foulmouthed and vulgar its hard to see while consistently amusing the movies also a barrage against ones moral senses i suppose this would be easier to overlook if you grew up in some sheethole where the dirtbag clientele cussed every other word peppered with nasty sexualoriented verbiagedont get me wrong here a couple of my favorite superheroes are radical antiheroes like wolverine and the punisher not to mention my favorite superhero flick is 2009s watchmen which is hardly a goodygoody superhero movie but is just so overthetop foul  vulgar it becomes a turnoff after 15 minutes despite its good humor and innovative filmmaking the movie will no doubt be cited in chronicles on the decline of western civilization that said the message at the end is unexpected and good i dont want to give it away but it has to do with babeunfortunately is so offensive and nasty it overshadows its attributes and i have no desire to see it again in fact i threw the dvd in the trashthe movie runs 108 minutes and was shot in vancouver  victoria british columbiagrade d,comedy
reviewing anything comedy related tends to lead to disgruntled readers and accusative comments comedy as a rule is not supposed to be exceptional or even good by most accounts in roman times humor stemmed from jokes about genitals and bowel movements just as we laugh at the same today theres really no such thing as highbrow humor and so i find it disturbing when people mistake my dislike of humorous movies or cartoons or such as the complaints of someone high and mighty about himself i love a good dick joke as much as the next guy but humor for me comes from execution payoff and unexpectednessfrom a humor perspective has very little of that i chuckled occasionally at marvels latest superhero flick but i never found myself laughing out loud the opening credits roll making jokes of the producers and director set the tone of the films humor stylings blatant crass and occasionally funnyis the tale of a man named wade who contracts a serious form of cancer in order to combat it he accepts a proposal to become a superhero and winds up instead in a miserable situation tortured by a mutant named ajax francis its a revengelove plot that was a surprisingly perfect fit for the valentine releasetells its story in a segmented and awkward way throwing us into the action immediately cutting back to the past then cutting forward again then back again it kind of works at first but the third flashback is long boring and ultimately kills the middle of the film this was the point i was struggling to stay awakei dont mind plot in a movie contrary to what im saying but the origin story of is nothing spectacular and in a film that relishes violence with an almost sexual passion i felt that the pacing was poor and killed the entire experience after you get past the flashbacks and get to the current action youll probably be too bored to care any further what happensand for me even trying to stay attentive of the movie through the final act i was still bored the villains were boring hero companions were dull and the final fight was not epic or welldirected or choreographednothing stood out to me and despite a gory violent opening the ending seemed relatively tameand thats where fails for me its an rrated movie that feels like it doesnt particularly have to be the cursing the gore and the sex are all selfindulgent the entire movie a middle finger to traditional superhero movies and i respect that and went into the film expecting an enticingly adultslanted marvel movie but what i got felt more like something a middle schooler would write the cursing was middleschool level many of the jokes were juvenile there were some decent mature jokes in there tooit just didnt feel organic much of it felt forced and as i looked around the theater at the kids watching their parents irresponsible enough to allow eight and nine year olds entrance i realized that maybe this was meant to be babies first rrated filmthis movie is doing exceptionally well at the box office and im guessing this mature actioncomedy is being talked about in many a schoolyard is a technically poor movie with bad pacing a lackluster set of characters and humor that just wasnt my style relying too much on obscene oneliners than jokes with actual buildup and payoff but i guess its an okay film and probably one marvel fans and fans especially will enjoy but aside from a good opening action sequence and a couple chuckleworthy jokes here and there was a dud for me,comedy
i was not aware over how popular this movie was before i went to see it and i usually do not like being the dissenting opinion on films like these but i really did not like while it might seem daring for movie studios to make an rrated superhero movie that doesnt take anything serious it ends up being completely uninspiring pleasing the teenage memegeneration is easy and basing a movie around their mentality is the same as going for the lowest common denominator  only here it is within this target audience i have heard people calling this movie intelligent because it does not feel it has to explain anything to the audience i would argue that is not the case this movie is targeted at such a specific but large audience that it can easily skip explaining a lot im not saying the movie would have been better if it did but rather that it does not make for a clever moviethe noncaring attitude of the movie is not a flaw by itself but rather the fact that this seem to be the only sort of ambition the movie has in addition to trying to be an entertaining movie which it obviously succeeded in based in the general consensus but the over the top action the juvenile humor and the constant references to popular culture mostly ends up being lazy and cheap there are some good gags and even some great ones but they drown in the rest of it i do like that it makes fun of the superhero genre and that it is not afraid to completely abolish the fourth wall  but it does it while still making the same mistakes other superhero movies are making which kind of invalidates the points it might be trying to make as i seem to be in the minority here i am open to giving it another chance  but most likely its just not a movie for me,comedy
story  310 unrelated incidents sum up  just because they wanted to introduce new guy to their group  logistics  310 action   610 they made villains look like not clever at all  acting  810 direction  710  dialogues  610  not in a comic movie  i understand they wanted to introduce new guy with a new film then get a story that really makes people believe why had to become what he becomes dont just push some uninteresting story to get the result you wanted i am really not interesting into that story i didnt understand lot of things in the story the acting persformances are good but story is a big minus i really really appreciate movies with good stories or even inspirational stories completely covers up the celebrity cast weightagei felt there were fighting scenes not at the right moment but postponed just to align the story,comedy
the hype created for this movie was so high that it totally crashes our expectations towards it if you ever think that this movie will be as good as the other marvel movies my friend you will be disappointed if you still think you have to watch this movie then wait for the ticket prices to get lowered maybe then it would worth spending some money on it some say it has good humour  quite acceptable fight scenes but thats not what you expect from a marvel movie dont fall for the peer pressure your friends will put on you which happened in my case ill say spend the day at home  wait for batman vs superman at least that would be worth the money if you still want to watch ill say go for zoolander 2 its actually a funny movie rather than a masked one,comedy
is a movie based on the comic book character of the same name ive read a few comics and yeah this movie felt kind of disappointing okay so wade wilson has a wife and we have a montage of them having sex around holidays and then he gets cancer and then he gets horribly tortured for no reason other than to make the villain more evil than he needed to be oh yeah the villain is pretty forgettable a common problem with many marvel films and he rescues his wife at the end of the day and makes out with her i also didnt find it very funny but i will give credit that at least the action was pretty good thats about it,comedy
the image i had of before the movie from what ive heard and seen from friends and internet never read the comics was a rather good one the movie completely ruined this imagethe in the movie is very annoying and trying way too hard to be funny 95 of the jokes are simply bad and not funny i dont mind dumb simple stupid or dirty jokes i love enough shows like that eg south park but in this movie the jokes can mostly be only enjoyed if youre 10 years old or so it was just badapart from the horrible humor the story was well interesting enough to follow nothing special but also nothing much worse than any other superhero movie storyconclusion dont watch this better read the comics and i really hope that the comics are better than this,comedy
for my money is nowhere near as funny as its star rating would have you believe the jokes are repetitive crass and boring on three separate occasions a character is described as looking like thing a had sex with thing b the movie is only two hours long youd think a bit more variety in joke insults would be possible sadly the writers seem to lack imagination and instead repeatedly fall back on reminding us how much likes having sex or breaking the fourth wall and making some reference to the films budgetas a character is totally unlikeable hes a completely selfabsorbed narcissist whose main dilemma in the film is that hes not as attractive as ryan reynolds anymore the plot is virtually nonexistent some vague reference is made near the start to the fact that the bad guys are creating mutantssuperhumans and selling them as weapons but its never really followed up on the main villain is utterly twodimensional we dont really know anything about him except that he is really evil and has a grudge against for some reason that seems to largely be down to hilarious smartassery the final action setpiece at the end of the film is totally boring and in this day and age it takes more than some whizzy cgi to make for an interesting film sequence theres a bit of fighting a buildingthing falls over and there you have it the film endsall in all the film is well made and looks nice the actors put in good performances i just found it to be totally boring not nearly as clever or funny as it acts like it is and to be almost entirely without any sort of interesting story,comedy
ive heard it again and again over the last few weeks people keep saying that brings something new to the superhero genre the problem with this claim is that no one seems to be able to tell me what it is that is so revolutionary about this flick is it the dick jokes the fisting jokes the prom sex jokes the face sitting jokes so revolutionary i suppose its necessary to say that i am no prude and that i take no issue with those types of jokes other than the fact that they just didnt make me laugh the humor in this movie just reeked of desperate immaturity the jokes seemed aimed at the middleschoolboywholurksonredditcrowd which is thankfully a frame of mind that i have long since moved past the humor often felt like it was trying too hard as if it was screaming at the top of its lungs laugh at me im so hilarious and if the humor doesnt work for you which it did with many people at my screening for some reason then there is really very little for you there the beginning credits of the film call the writers the real heroes of the film an assertion that i must wholeheartedly disagree with the movie is remarkably light on plot and what is there has been painfully rehashed from every superhero origin story ever the noncharacters are all paper thin none of them are given sufficient arcs to make them interesting even himself is not entirely interesting he begins the movie the same way he ends smarmy as ever violent as ever wanting the same things he did 1 hr and 48 mins ago the saddest part of all of this is that because this movie made so much money there will be a sequel as well as many worse ripoffs of it that are even more cringeworthy and forced,comedy
entirely entertaining well paced great script and excellent performance by ryan reynolds good supporting cast nice balance between dialogue and action restored my faith in marvel and xmen movieshard not to like this movie,comedy
by ten minutes into it i wanted some bad guy to kill just to shut him up the writing is terrible they are so thrilled with the r rating that they sound like kids trying out swear words in the school yard at recess the sex is terrible not erotic at all what with all that smirking the plot is um missing the acting is what you would expect when you make a movie using 100 green screencgi and heres a secret and a major spoiler oxygen does not explode oxygen does not even burn woah try to wrap your head around that while you munch another hash brownie its like wow man does water float if you light a match in 100 oxygen the match will burn quickly and brightly until the wood ie the fuel is exhausted and then the fire will go out no fuel no burn doesnt matter how much oxygen there is,comedy
i found to be somewhat of a disappointment like many i was psyched to see what could be done with an r rated superhero movie and it definitely had its meritsthe constant crude humor and comic references make it bearable for superhero lovers and perhaps enjoyable if one is willing to pull the wool over their eyes and not engage in the meat of the movie the plota basic love story which fails miserably in getting one to care for the characters portrayed there is a weak bond made with the audience and the lead characters we find ourselves finding negasonic teenage warhead the only engaging character in the entire film the others are too abstract and annoying for the majority of the time not what i was hoping for story too weak to fully be content with it as anything other than a token r rated superhero film,comedy
rather than tell you whether i liked this movie or not ill try to tell you what to expect and you can make up your own mind if you want to see itstorywise its really not that interesting punk gets superpowers but because of how he acquired them he holds a huge grudge against the person responsible for giving them to him revenge ensues this is the introduction of a new supercharacter from the marvel universe theres plenty of action much of it gratuitous and with ridiculously violent and cruel one sided slaughter scenes of people with no super powersthe most entertaining action of course is when adversaries are evenly matched and whilst there is plenty of this too the villains are ultimately hopelessly outgunned and that puts a cap on the potential for a nailbiting climax the dialogue wisecracks his way through the 108 minutes sometimes hes genuinely funny but mostly he talks fast to keep things from slowing down there are plenty of laugh out loud moments and equally there were others that were just embarrassing in their vulgaritywhat makes this film different is that knows hes in a movie and takes time out to joke with the audience its an interesting move for such a high budget film and generally it worked out pretty wellthe target audience is undoubtedly male from 16 to 25 teens are going to love it but theres probably not enough story there for everyone else and its just too violent for anyone under 16this is a movie of our time violent with a wayward moral compass heros are out of style and instead we are treated to a dose of narcissism this doesnt mean the film is unwatchable but dont expect to leave the cinema uplifted and inspired,comedy
but then if you had any clue you expected that whether you appreciate the dirty or not i will not not go so far as to say it is a perfect movie and i dont know why somehow i feel if real would not appreciate it being called a perfect movie he would care less what i think as long as i shelled out the money to go see it although i did cheat and went matine i asked my son on his birthday last year if there was a movie he wanted to go see he repliedwhich was 4 months later i am not a geek or a comic book man and most of my super hero knowledge comes from tv and movies obviously i had no idea who was i decided to let the movie introduce me to him and whatever my son was telling is a favorite of his he would rate the movie at 85fittingly enoughit has b movie feel but the cgi is top rate it is easily the perfect format for btw  dont be late the opening credits set the tone for the entire movie and perhaps all you need to know about the movie everybody is so afraid that ryan reynolds would ruin like he ruined green lantern or like everyone was afraid that jack black would ruin king kong but as i understand it ryan inserted himself into the creative writing process which made the words his words like a song a singer writes it is always better and ryan reynolds was awesome morena baccarin is perfectly in sync with ryan in a love and romance for the ageless and immature her training in fireflyserenity as a high price escort with nathan fillion as love interest was very helpful ed skrein is great as the bad guy this maybe the only drawback i imagine that it is dead pools style to focus on the problem in front and not go for the bigger boss or the money behind the bad guy of course that is probably in 2like i said in the beginning somewhere they did no wrong which is helpful when you are telling a lot of jokes all of them hit at the right time with the right tenortone which is really difficult to keep it fresh and keep it from being a one joke movie especially when all the material is irreverentmy recommendation is if you want to see a super antihero action comedy movie where most of the jokes were created by the cartoonists of playboy penthouse high society and so far way down the sewer and approved by drunk frat boys who whose humor never grew age 12redundant i know then you should sell everything you have and sprint to the best theater near you and plan to live there until hit blue raybtw  i called the ending at the end of the credits on the way i told my son that what i want to see is not going to be a spoiler sport and they did it my son thinks i am a super hero now and true he thinks i am like gleek from the wonder twins than thor but i will take it,comedy
its aimed at 13 year olds with the excessive cheap sexual references except it has many nude scenes typical elements of a money mining film if you didnt like the martian you wont like this its idea of comedy is swearing repeatedly references to casual drug use and the kingsman style villainsit has a poor story line with the main guy woman worshipping i struggled to finish it as it became frustrating and very cringey the main guy often dictates his actions like its an episode of the power rangersthe music and sound were nothing to be impressed by i really cannot understand the ratings,comedy
wade aka ryan reynolds tells the story of how he was subjected to painful experiments now with mutant abilities he seeks revengeis a superhero movie unlike anything before it first off its extremely rrated second throughout the film the main is constantly braking the fourth wall not mention there are some great jokes about the studiohas lots of comedy but with comedy being very subjective i personally felt this movie was very hitandmiss though when it hit it was hystericalnext the story its nothing outstanding a simple predictable revenge story the villain is really nothing speciallast the action it wasnt as awesome and exciting as i was hoping there was an overuse of cgi given some scenes required it but still it feels faker looking then other cgi heavy films ive seen early on there are some pretty crazy action scenes but the further the film goes the duller the action goti personally feel this film was perhaps rushed more time couldve given them the chance to focus on crazier stunts and in the least a more balanced sense of humorone last note the one reason actually didnt meet my expectations was that i kept hearing how this film was setting the new standard for rrated films i dont know what those people mean ive seen movies push the envelope way morein conclusion its worth a laugh but dont expect anything oscarworthy,comedy
a friend told to watch this movie and assured me that i would love it since i love all the other marvel movies and tvseries i think i had the strength to watch 1520 minutes before i was completely disgusted of how really really bad this is how in the name of all thats holy has this movie got this high rating the last hour and twenty minutes of the movie i actually was forced to fast forward the movie to stop me from putting my fingers in tvs wall socket i rather play with my sisters tweezers pulling my own noose hair than to even speak about this movie againplease what ever you do dont see this movie save that time for something more useful and mr reynolds i will forgive you this time and forget that you ever did this movie im now going to put soap in my eyes to help wash away anything thats left of the memory of this big pile of monkey poo,comedy
is a tiresomely unfunny stab at making both a superhero movie that can compete with the best of that genre and a parody of superhero movies that can also satirise them it succeeds at neither for a huge budget superhero flick the plot and scenarios are just way too uninspired and boring it has a pretty good opening action scene but after that it has absolutely nothing you wont have seen before in any other recent comic book movie as a parody it just isnt funny and all the nudge nudge wink wink moments get old in the first scene and then continue all the way up to the inevitable aftercreditsscene which is just as unfunny as everything weve seen before itits the seth macfarlane school of anticomedy didnt laugh the first time well youre out of luck because that joke will be repeated obnoxiously throughout the rest of the run timethe movie also seems to think that name dropping everything popculture related is funny by default you leave probably unable to remember an actual gag but maybe some of the relentless name dropping is still with you because youve just heard it a million times reynolds as even namedrops himself at one point and not even that got a laugh,comedy
wasnt supposed to be made but i am glad it was as with the comic book character is at his best because of his selfdeprecating humor and his fourthwallbreaking style ryan reynolds inhabits the character with aplomb making good use of his wellhoned comic timing and a genuinely funny script to deliver a character so funny irreverent and relentless you begin to wonder why it almost wasnt made into a movie and why studios werent that much into it in the first placeno one knows who actually leaked the test footage that kicked all of this off but thank goodness it happenedwhat a ride heres waiting for the next one,comedy
was everything as advertised and so much more this is a superhero movie for adults it was in the comics and even more so in the movies to those who are so pent up over the idea that a movie would have sex jokes break the fourth wall grotesque violence and so much more please get over yourselfto begin with i have four kids two younger than 18 when the previews came out i did a littler research not for kids so i didnt take mine i knew what i was getting into sex violence jokes jokes about sex and violence i am 38 with a masters degree and teach at the high school level and the movie was great i laughed until i cried and ended up coughing because i was laughing so hard to those who were offended by this movie you obviously have a a certain set of standards for movies that you think all movies should have you knew what you were getting into it had an r rating it was very evident what would be in the movie to trash the movie because it did not fit into your world view that all superhero movies should be exactly like xmen or batman please get over yourself sometimes people want to see something nasty and over the top and get a good laugh mission accomplished see this if you want the low hanging fruit,comedy
best comic movie ever laughter after laughter i can take these insults just like can he is the manpeople take these movies too seriously these days i mean after awhile you forget why you were mad in the first place some are just too neurotic and judgmental on almost anything they can see or get their greedy hands on the movie will be a classic and for future generations this movie was spot on no doubt about iti will keep seeing this until it runs dry in theaters and then i will burn it red hot on dvd playeri would easily give half my life to dedicating this movie as the alltime greatest comic movie ever until another can top it but its because future movies will suck,comedy
kickstarting 2016s superhero season with a bang this adultsonly comic book adaptation is ballsy irreverent and hilariously cheeky think a kickass flavoured xmen movie but even filthier wisely opting to forgo the typical us pg13 rating the vast majority of blockbusters aim for in order to widen their audience reach doubles down on its brainsplattering violence vulgar jokes and disgusting potty mouth all to great effect theres also the unique tone to separate it from other comicbook flicks not only is it subversive and amusingly juvenile but it whole heartedly embraces its fourthwallbreaking and meta humour roots wolverine and hugh jackman beware screenwriters rhett reese and paul wernick earn praise for more than just the snappy dialogue and pitchperfect gags though for they have crafted a franchise starter that evades the usual origin story pitfalls by messing with timelines and genre tropes working with a relatively low budget of 58m debutant director tim miller puts every dollar to work to ensure the action sequences are inventive exhilarating and high calibre augmented with cgi as good as anything youll see in the mcu or dccu none of this would be possible however if it wasnt for ryan reynolds having pushed for this film incessantly over the last seven years reynolds finally gets his wish to properly portray the smartalec character he was born to play after the debacle that was xmen origins wolverine  where his merc with the mouth was idiotically sidelined and silenced  reynolds relishes the opportunity to finally give the titular antihero and alterego wade wilson the spotlight he deserves the support is top notch too morena baccarin is game for anything as wilsons toughasnails fianc tj miller gives good comedy relief and ed skrein and gina carano are suitably nasty as the merciless villains holding absolutely nothing back is a riproaring movie that will have you squirming cheering and laughing possibly all at once,comedy
well they got the basics right the jokes and the violence were quite what id expect when seeing one of my favorite comicbookcharacters come to life i had a lot of fun and the movie had the audience roaring with laughter more than oncehowever the story and the way the other characters were portrayed couldnt keep up with that it felt like they put in so much effort to make really really deadpoolish that they forgot how crazy insane his usual story lines are and just used a superheromovietemplate to make something up i was disappointed by most characters too apart from dp only colossus to my surprise and blind al seemed to have some substanceover all id recommend seeing it but keep your expectations low and just enjoy the fun,comedy
refreshing astounding one of the best comic book movies of all timei honestly wouldnt know where to begin as a fan of the comic book i was angry and disappointed how they butchered the character in x men origins wolverine but that has been forgiventhis is a movie made by fans for the fans ryan reynolds lives the role and tim miller directed a perfect adaptation of a popular comic book antihero full of rich supporting characters this was a joy ridefull of action a twisted sense of humor fourthwall breaking moments this movie was just outstanding at every turnnot for the faint of heart due to mature content but otherwise one of the best movie experiences i have ever had,comedy
this movie was not funny it was not exciting and the plot was so bad that you could just say it was plot less this is easily the worst movie i have seen so far this year out of about fifthteen movies in total id say that is more than enough to warrant the rating of a one the jokes completely lacked creativity they were just crude and very juvenile it was like a twelve year old trying to be as offensive as possible yeah theyre saying some stupid and offensive stuff but theyre still only 12 years old so theyre not very good at it any any on stage comedian ive ever heard is about twenty times more creative and offensive,comedy
a lot of superhero movies favor special effects over character im looking at you 2012s the avengers but perhaps because had a relatively low budget for this sort of thing  something i only know because i read it on wikipedia  this movie is full of character the protagonist is a vengeance seeking madman constantly breaking the forth wall his best friend is a hipster bartender who gambles on his brief longevity and he and his girlfriend the ridiculously attractive morena baccarin engage in the dark clever banter youll love if youre a fan of the series youre the worstproves that giving your characters personality does not mean you cant also have great action scenes such as the crazed one that begins the movie and clarifies the funny and perplexing title sequence i found the action in this movie far more exhilarating than the biggerisbetter approach of some movies im looking at you again avengersoverall this is as fun and funny as guardians of the galaxy and has action as memorable as that in xmen first class ryan reynolds beautifully plays as a psychotic version of spiderman and really the whole cast is excellentthis is a sort of tangential xmen movie but it still exhibits a lot of what makes that series the best of the marvel universe,comedy
ive only ever cared for blade and the xmen films as a movie buff the other rubbish like spiderman the fantastic four superman guardians of the galaxy and the myriad of avenger heroes and their own crap films that they keep rehashing every few years are the most boring generic epic cinema experiences ive ever put up with that werent aimed entirely at little children such as ice age 4 and whatnotwas a breath of fresh air it couldnt have been better they finally made a superhero movie for people who were kids when these superheroes were big commercial comic book successes i bought comics all throughout the 90s as a teenager and knew exactly what to expect ryan reynolds couldnt be more perfect for the role and couldnt be a more perfect character for an adultoriented hero moviewhat bothers me is the amount of 1 out 10 ratings im seeing here some calling it too foulmouthed others calling it too violent others again whining about the sex scenes and then others who took their children to see all of this what i have to wonder were you thinking this movie is rated r and months and months before it was released this was made very abundantly clear through advertising and reynolds own interviews this movie is rated the same as reservoir dogs the same as saving private ryan django unchained the green mile traffic the wolf of wall street seven and schindlers list you came into this movie not expecting violence or swearing or sex you brought your children to watch this movie why is this getting 1 out of 10 i wonder the onus then is on yourselves obviously the fault here is with the common sense of the people buying the tickets and expecting some sort of pg13 fare because as somebody who pays attention to a movies classification rating i knew exactly what to expect the movie did not swindle us as movie goers into thinking this was a family filmonce again i loved this movie i got all of the references and all of the fourth wall breaks which no doubt would have flown over the heads of those who havent had a keen investment in for a long time and would probably take away from a lot of the laughs so thats to be expected but ill just say to anybody reading this review that if a person complains about the violence or the sex or the swearing just disregard their rating of this film just as they disregarded the actual rating of this film movies rated r are rated r for a reason,comedy
this film tells the story of he has superpowers he fights bad guys but he is certainly not a superhero after an introductory scene where our antihero dispatches numerous bad guys and confronts his foe before being interrupted by a couple of xmen who believe he should join their ranks we see through a series of flashbacks how former soldier wade wilson becomes and just why he is looking for francis freeman aka ajax two years previously things were looking up for wade he had fallen in love with vanessa and they were planning to get married then he is diagnosed with terminal cancer with nothing left to lose he accepts an offer from the mysterious mr smith who tells him that he could be better than better a superhero smith delivers him to ajax and he soon learns that life is going to get far worse after some horrific treatment to activate dormant mutant cells he does indeed recover and becomes immortal he is also so horrifically disfigured that he cant face returning to vanessa he escapes but believes that ajax is the only person who can fix the way he looks so is determined to take him aliveif you are expecting a typical superhero film than you are in for a shock is far from heroic he isnt concerned with taking enemies alive and in the opening scenes we see him dispatching numerous foes some in a fairly grisly fashion he is also foulmouthed and frequently makes comments of a sexual nature this could easily be offputting but it is done in a way that makes it all rather funny the story isnt overly complex but that doesnt matter as the action is great and there are lots of funny moments the cast do a fine job ryan reynolds impresses as much of the time hidden by a mask of prosthetic facial scarring ed skrein is suitably villainous as ajax and morena baccarin is good as love interest vanessa overall i really enjoyed this and would recommend it to anybody who enjoyed films like kickass or super,comedy
i dont know what genre this movie is it may be comedy it may be action it is hard to say because this movie tries to be a little bit of both but the humor in this movie is toilet humor there is simply too much of it when i watched the action scenes the attempt at humor is very distracting so first yall made a movie that is not funny and then you have diluted action scenes its really bad there is too much distraction in the movie do it like the avengers with short funny lines after the action scenes but i think this movie is better than batman vs superman because at least something happened in this movie its just that they try to insert toilet humor each chance they get watch the movie and youll see what i mean it is just not funny,comedy
like many people i had been anticipating for quite some time and had been looking forward to it what a let down if its directed toward adults i have no idea why its so childish in nature  i had to finish watching it on my own later after a group of us decided to watch it and lasted 20 mins before there was a general vote that it was rubbish i was sorry i tried to give it a chance  it just didnt get any better it actually got worsethe jokeshumour is bad really childish the fight scenes match the humour and the overall style and feel is more like well i honestly dont know i just know that i braved it to the end and got very little out of it for such a large amount of hype i expected something better than this  much bettersuch a high score brings to mind another movie  featuring a certain max where i just feel it too was overrated overhyped and was very happy when it was over ive loved a lot of what marvel have done with many of their adaptations but this certainly isnt one of them not by a long shot3510,comedy
i went to a cinema to view this with the oh due to the hype and some friends recommending it and even though i wasnt too thrilled by the trailer it did seem like a welcome departure from the avalanche of average clich filled superhero marvel dc movies it wasnt it wasnt funny at all the story to the extent that there was one was not the least engaging and the character just felt like a cardboard cutout and i actually enjoyed the other movies that reynolds starred in not this one i dont usually leave reviews on imdb and i have never walked out of a movie that i paid to see before but i did on this one extremely overrated,comedy
i dont know what all the fuss is about with this unpleasant film i find it peculiar and not very interesting for me its not funny with the humour being crass and boring unlike the humour in guardians of the galaxy the constant use of swear words mostly the same ones over and over again is boring and irritating the violence is ott and unnecessary maybe it is felt by the money makers that films need to be increasingly violent to attract audiences which are perhaps becoming inured to violence both on and off the screen it seems that film companies are looking for different ways of making money with the marvel franchise since the standard formulaic superhero films with their celebrity personalities lost their interest to many after the first few being full of sound and fury signifying nothingthe only thing that is reasonably good about imho is the visual effects so for that it could have a 3 from me,comedy
okay i dont know where to start there were times where i liked it and times where i didnt like it all i feel like it had more potential first of all too many dirty joke and i like dirty jokes but this was just too much i felt like i watched a teenage boy trapped in a grown mans body and he had just discovered the words d penis fart masturbate and f and i dont know the whole be a bad ass douche and youll get your d wet i dont feel like that sends out the right message to young guys i dont know one thing i liked a lot though was that they opened upbroke the fourth wall if you dont know what that is look it up it overall it was pretty entertaining and a lot of raw action but you have to see it for what it really is fantasy marvel fiction oh and there are better films to take your girlfriend this is more of a chilling with the mates kind of film words to help describe this film cancer revenge d fart mansion self touching i give it 7 out of 10,comedy
it wasnt a bad movie but i came in with high expectations in the end the funny moment cannot save a movie without a story if by throwing in some punchlines and some cgis the studio can expect a big pay day i will be very disappointed of the audience preferences we should have better superhero moviesin addition a superhero movie is as good as the villain in the movie and i will have to say this one is rather pedestrian normally bad people still have their reasons to do the things they do and it needs to be sufficiently explained and exploited to tell a good story i am not sure about the bad guys in this movie there really isnt an epic struggle to be remembered no matter how much cgi is in the film,comedy
we really enjoyed this one great writing lots of action excellent comic timing blowed lots of stuff up real good keep this team together and make more i say re ryan reynolds i never took him seriously before and maybe its because this happens to be the perfect wisecracking witty role to finally showcase properly so now we have one good memory to erase the sadness of blade trinity ripd etc re writers rheese and wernick who also wrote zombieland screenplay  i really think you have a good team there  keep doing what youre doing dont let egos a yoko or agent split you up director tim miller comes from an animation background and applies an animators sense of motion that really added to the pacing and style some may say theres too much gratuitous violence and nakedness but they may be getting used to the sanitized family content of most comic book films as long as this gets put into the adult category with tarentino and frank miller sin city the rest of us will have a place to party away from the harper valley pta,comedy
wade wilson ryan reynolds has cancer and undergoes a procedure by ajax ed skrein to cure him of the cancer and it gives him super powers the idea was to make wilson a superhero who can be auctioned off to the highest bidder for other mercenary work but he escapes from ajax the main problem is that his face changed to something hideous and he is afraid to confront girlfriend vanessa morena baccarin he now calls himself and he needs to find ajax who he believes can reverse the procedure and make him normal looking again what was good the action scenes with generous compliments of cgi is spectacular and very creative kudos the acting was good when dialogues werent being too sillywhat was bad silly childish dialogues mostly from toilet humor fbombs and other disgusting sexual language to be fair sometimes humor was spot on i said sometimesgets xmen colossus stefan kapicic and negasonic teenage warhead brianna hildebrand to help him defeat ajaxnotable leslie uggums as blind althe movie would have been better if much of the bad stuff above was toned back a lot the way this was presented was too over the top and bordered on being most annoying and childish at timesthis movie has taught me to be wary of marvel comics presentations to the big screen they just go too far with language and toilet humor and now we can add silly dialogues this was disappointing 310violence yes sex yes one time in the beginning nudity yes at a girlie bar language yes rating d,comedy
where do i startwell this is complete redemption for fox after the awful introduction in xmen origins wolverineless said the better this movie was an apology to the fans now ill be honest the plot is a pretty straightforward revenge story its very simple and easy to follow it doesnt do anything new in that department as it is an origin story but its told with more flare you would think jumping from place to place flashback to flashback would confuse you and many other people but it doesnt so kudos to director tim miller ryan reynolds and writers rhett reese and paul wernick for a sharp clear vision of the movie they knew what they were going for and executed it very well the origin told through flashbacks was a breath of fresh air something i admired about man of steel i feel superhero origin stories are best told through flashbacks the visuals are solid and the action sequences are pretty stellar small in scalecause of their budget but nevertheless very fun theres no pg13 compromise here the filmmakers absolutely do not hold back this is hard r with nudity including ryan reynoldss bare ass hyperstylized violence blood gore foul language and dirty jokes so if youre someone who gets easily offended by this i would advise you to stay away but even with that being said one must admit this brings something new to the superhero genre and its a film made for comic fans such as myself the cast is great in typical fashion the villains are not too fleshed out they do present a threat but its nothing special ed skrein as ajax and gina carano as angel dust do their job at being evil tj miller as sidekick is hysterical with quippy and crude lines leslie uggams is blind al she and share some nice and funny banter with each other colossus is voiced by stefan kapicic played by andre tricoteux and his young trainee negasonic teenage warhead is played by brianna hildebrand and they have their fun moments with as well colossus certainly does a lot more than he ever did in the previous xmen films although i am a bit annoyed daniel cudmore did not return for the role for continuitys sake this colossus is a more faithful interpretation to the comics id also like to mention im not big on superhero romance on occasion they do work like captain america and peggy carter spiderman and gwen or mary jane and i guess tony stark and pepper potts but outside of that i never really buy into them they just seem like an afterthought but here in this film the chemistry works ryan reynolds and morena baccarin have fabulous chemistry between each other i know it sounds like a broken record but chemistry really counts in all type of films so it was pleasantly shocking to see it work on screen especially from a movie like now lets talk about ryan man from now on every time i read a comic im going to hear his voice like the title of my review he was born to play this role even in xmen origins wolverine prior to the abysmal transformation when he was just wade wilson reynolds killed it he carries the film very well and he does a great job making him almost sympathetic you know for a fact wade wilson is not a great person but what he goes through in the somewhat difficult torture sequences you come to care and personally want to see him get his revenge on ajax again jokes are hilarious and ryan definitely knows how to deliver it effectively isnt a perfect film it does have some minor problems but its a hell of a fun ride its face paced never boring consistently funny and filled with clever fourth wall breaking moments himself even pokes fun at ryans career other superheroes and even fox the studio itself subverts the superhero formula resulting in a hilarious and violent thrill ride all in its nonfamily friendly glory and if you werent sold on the marketing of this film already then i dont know what to tell you i have no doubt that this will be successful and im only anticipating the sequel even more i hope this film will unretire hugh jackman so i can see a proper wolverine and fight in a future installment or even xforce910,comedy
i will admit that i had trepidations about seeing this movie i was concerned that they wouldnt do the character of justice i am happy to say i had no reason for concern i can honestly say that i was totally impressed with this movie i found that they kept to the spirit of the comic character extremely well i thought the writing was exceptionally well done i like the way the story unfolded the special effects were there but they werent over the top lastly i have to say that in the end i think it was one of my favorite movies to watch this year thus far it had action it had laughs and a bit of a twisted moral in its own way i know some people were upset with it but i have to be honest i think those are the people that had never picked up a comic or even bothered to actually watch the previews which to me is the fault of the viewer not the movie i mean if your going to go spend money on a show do some research that goes for those parents that took their kids to the movie,comedy
this might be my favorite superhero movie of all time there is simply no comparison let me start by saying how happy i am that they did not let hollywood ruin this film by giving it a pg 13 rating they allowed to be himself it is witty funny and of course action packed with violence i am kind of ticked they cut the budget on this movie i can only imagine how much better the original script would have been usually when they do superhero movies i look at them with dread seeing ben aflack as batman makes me think instant bust when i saw the horrible actor from green lantern staring i thought man they are going to trash another superhero movie but absolutely nothing could have destroyed this script it is so well written the director did a great job in keeping it together and the acting simply did their job which is all they needed to do i would watch this movie again in a heart beat best super hero movie in years maybe decades,comedy
guess i was suckered by all the superslick promotional hype pushed onto social media by the studio the movie really fails to provide anything more than what is in the trailers it left me feeling i wasted my time and money even if it went straight to dvd i dont know if it would be a worthwhile watch does not provide any kind of character development even the comic book offered more the movie characters are flat and twodimensional often using strained dialog and weak humor to explain major characteristics of the characters personae they should have stuck with the video game do yourself a favor watch the trailer a couple times and save your time and money it is becoming apparent that the studios have a very good understanding of what kind of hype and promotion it takes to get audiences to open their wallets even if they leave disappointed,comedy
if you just hate classic superheroes with their moral principles and good intentions well i guess was made for you obviously marvel decided to cover teenage bully demographic and give them character that they can relate to this intended to be an adult movie but it actually is more then any other marvel movie aimed on teenagers there is no other audience that will be able to get anything from watching it very poor story dumb characters absolutely zero ideas poor dialog and a bunch of toilet jokes thats it they tried to make it funny but failed at that also all the jokes are stupid and worst of all not funny this is first marvel movie that i would not recommend seeing,comedy
you saw a bullet create a hole on my body in those trailers though indian censor had some culture supporting cuts my movie is worth watching oh wait you may be wondering why the narrative review thats because reviewers dont make me bleed what do they usually start a review with the storyline right my movie doesnt have a great story to deal with like those marvel films yes the wolverine film i hunt the ones who gave me super powers and get back my girl but stop i got a better love story here indian audience wont get to feel the love completely the plot isnt that twisting or philosophical uhoh i saw some of them complaining my lukewarm plot were you expecting nolan or what you can actually relate my film to guardians of the galaxy well the whole pack wasnt as abusive as me indeed but the fun factor resonates may be i could have coffee with those guys in some crossover filmyeah i know that you all saw my red band trailer so you mightve got an idea of what kinda superhero im im of the rambunctious sort thanks to my creators they have allowed me break the fourth wall and even re generate my body parts i know that this thing interested you guys you wanna see blood spurt in slow motion and the sharp blade take a full view on the screen dont worry though debutant tim miller has packed stuff to keep you guys appealing but nerds stay away im not the type of superhero who protects the city im neither a watchful guardian nor a genius billionaire whatever when you step into theaters right from the opening credits you stay entertained even after the end credits thats more important for me when you get to see a sarcastic antihero like me which is what matters more i troll almost everyone i know right from all those superheroes to that oncefailed super hero guy ryan reynolds uh oh time to enter performance side this guy is the show stealer of my film he portrayed me in the most lovable manner thanks man  hope you guys are reading this in his voice without his narration my film wouldnt have been so effective well this role will patch is career so cool he was ed skrein too did his part well he was sleek and so were the ones who did the supportive mutants morenna baccarin was sexy while tj miller had a couple of extra scenes than what you have seen in all the trailers combined i did even spot marvels chairman maybe he was being cautious of me breaking the fourth wallat the making part as ive already said miller packed things together to make my movie as engaging and entertaining as possible you wont feel even the slightest trace of bore the action sequences are of top class they appeal both visually and violently another factor that pumps energy is the music by junkie xl i know most of youve fallen in love with x gon give it to ya i saw the theater go crazy when i walked in slow motion for that song is there anything remaining to mention yes editing was crisp with those sharp cuts and the film is technically brilliantyou guys are still reading this aah got it the tail piece right these days people make a statistical analysis of money spent on watching the film im not gonna do that if you wanna really see the different kinda superhero i mean antihero go get your tickets dont gather reasons to watch the torrent print though indian censor tried to make me cultural im still entertaining cause im deadfkingpool i hired this sooraj pattazhy to write this review as he was watching the film while i was slicing the baddies i promised him that my fans are gonna shower this post with likes,comedy
i saw it last night and thought it a wonderful hilarious and entertaining film so many different and clever humour to laugh at and character was magnetici thought the bad guy was very well played and liked that the story was a simple originrevenge tale rather than some over the topend of the worldbuildings being sucked into the air extravaganzait meant they concentrated on the characters more and were less worried about achieving the killer money shot for the trailers maybe having less budget is not such a hindrancei loved all the interactions the romance was wonderfully refreshing and the action top notch there was laughing and gasping out loudi really hope the film does well as ive been impressed with ryans efforts to get this made loved the novel marketing and respect the studios courage to sink some dollar into an rrated superhero film id love to see the making of features on this as i think they would be fascinatingid put this up with kick ass and kingsman for providing all round adult entertainmentgreat work ryan and tim cant wait for a sequel,comedy
is the story of two likeminded individuals who fall in love amidst calamitous hardships  and physiologyaltering mutant abilities with disfiguring side effects former special forces soldier wade wilson ryan reynolds works as a mercenaryforhire out of sister margarets school for wayward children running his mouth while running odious lowlifes out of business nets him a satisfying career that also inadvertently introduces him to vanessa morena baccarin a prostitute who shares his penchant for dark humor and funereal banter the two quickly fall in love and become engaged only to discover shortly thereafter that wade is afflicted with terminal cancer unwilling to subject vanessa to further torment and misery wilson spontaneously leaves her when a mysterious broker offers the desperate man a possible remedy he agrees to undergo an experimental procedure that will change his life foreverposing itself as the ultimate antisuperhero movie with a theatrical release timed for valentines day goes to great lengths to distance itself from the pack of recent marvel entities which have become more or less interchangeable the problem is that it accomplishes this mission with such unyielding purposefulness that it regularly ceases to be a about a character in a film at times the world of exists somewhere in between the marvel cinematic universe selfaware satire and an alternate reality where superheroes are recognized as products of movie studios fortunately the humor tends to make up for the noncanonical bits and the occasionally unwelcome attention towards the fictionality of cinemacrazy credits pop culture references animation midscene nods to movie tropes it might further the plot suggests tj millers weasel when motioning wade to meet a blackclad man in a shadowy corner booth and routine breaking of the fourth wall are all gimmicks to highlight the flaws of superhero pictures as well as to mock them mercilessly its funny to see this skewering in action but it becomes contrary as the film progresses particularly as it begins to employ the very techniques and devices previously laid bare for roasting had chosen to use only supersoldiers and human sidekicks it would have been forgivable to see the star prancing about like an rrated version of the mask filled with the dirty dialogue of kevin smith but once colossus voiced by stefan kapicic and negasonic teenage warhead brianna hildebrand show up and angel dust  played by gina carano  reveals her abilities the clich superhero customs turn exhausting rather than facetiously selfdeprecatingthe film wisely takes a cue from guardians of the galaxy with its soundtrack utilizing fitting or contrasting music at all the right times which helps to enhance the action and romance or make fun of various activities like kickass the main amusement comes from the comedic insight on the fallible potentially laughable construct of superheroes though hyperactive violence and expletivefilled wordplay strive to overshadow the cleverer humor of expos sex nudity strip clubs and sadistic torture also aim to darken up the typical pg13 vibe of marvels better known projects ironically the element that stands out the most is the love story accentuated by sarcastic damagedgoods morbidity which demonstrates a quirky compatibility for two modern sexually progressive personas stuck in a superhero movie  a superhero movie disguised as one too quickwitted to fall into that categorythe massie twins,comedy
i think ryan reynolds has officially redeemed himself from his previous two blunders as a superhero while i do wish the movie took more chances what we got was still a great movie its funny actionpacked and undeniably just to give you some context as to why i like this movie so much its the first marvel movie ive been invested in since spiderman 3 i didnt care for any of the iron man movies i dont care about the thor captain america guardians of the galaxy or the xmen movies and i certainly dont care about any of the 900 superhero crossovers that are in the works all i wanted was a standalone superhero movie that could stand on its own two feet without having 6 heroes in it and this delivered the storys simple to follow a little too simple but for the first in what im guessing will be a series they did a great job here,comedy
dont get me wrong i like black humour and sometimes the marvel comic genre eg dr strange my dear wife less so but she usually lets me watch both black humour and the marvel genre if i insist this time it was stop watching or divorce is on the horizon i actually had to agree and we went on to watch something less juvenilei cant fathom why anyone would watch this whole movie without walking out crappy jokes based on gore and car crashes are not entertainment i have said in other posts on imdb that art and entertainment are not mutually exclusive in fact at most times they go hand in hand is neither art nor entertainment it well deserves the back of the hand it received for any major award for 2016really awful trust me,comedy
perhaps i have too many personal biases and am very ignorant of the character of so this may not be one of my better reviews but here i go i felt the movie had an extreme overreliance on immature humour it would not have been such a negative factor for me if it wasnt for what i felt to be a 2hour contest of how many dirty jokes can we fit in the excessive everythingsex dialogue only robs the characters of their other more interesting and relatable qualities im perfectly alright with adult humour but something about this film got in its own way and came across as only pretentious and unintelligent what could have been a simple and compelling plot was muddied i still dont know what any of the characters motivations were but i dont care either and just as in so many other superhero films there were characters thrown in from other intellectual properties that didnt seem to serve any real purpose i find it rather distasteful when a movie like this attempts to justify the inclusion of unrelated characters only through flashy mindless action scenes but i understand  marketing merchandising etc overall there was nothing compelling about aside from the lead performance by ryan reynolds which carried the film entirely on its own it was probably the most comfortable and relaxed ive seen him in a role and he made it his own,comedy
very disappointed not as much with the movie as i am with my friendsco workers etc that told me this movie was really good i understand that they are trying to stick true to the comic book heros vulgar demeanor which is absolutely fine but do the jokes have to be so incredibly bad i would be shocked if they told me that a 13 year old did not write all the jokes in the movie listening to a table full of dads joking with one another would be infinitely more funny i am sure that you guys dont want to hear more about how much i hate this movie unfortunately imdb is forcing me to write a longer review for this movie than i would have preferred,comedy
there are reviews of this movie that say the movie tries too hard to be funny and ends up not being funny at all that is true only for those who dont get humor as a character and as portrayed by ryan reynolds is just brilliant he is funny and full of sarcastic colorful commentsthe entire premise of the movie and the way it has been shot and edited is one of the best that ive seen in a long time the movie has a lot of blood violence and usage of strong language but that is the dialogue delivery of and all the others in the movie is sublime and the action sequences are believable and well shot,comedy
not only did i find this movie absolutely hilarious but the way they made pick on xmen ryan renoalds himself and the green lantern just made me want to watch it even more  the way they phrase words and emphasizing on certain words and phrases is just outstanding  i have watched this movie over 10 times the night i purchased it and i can not stop laughing  it is great  i love it  now as i was doing research i did not know until today that is part of the xmen series  the original title of this movie is  xmen orgins also known as  xmen another part i noticed is in the beginning in the black truck one of the bad guys head was being rammed into the stereo each hit changed the station just for a brief second or two you will hear batmans music which i thought was funny too there are a bunch of little things like that that are hidden within the movie that you will hear and see but you will not realize its there that is another reason why i loved the movie,comedy
the masked ryan reynolds uses the taxi of dopinder karan soni to chase a gang commanded by ajax aka francis freeman ed skrein he explains that he is the former special forces agent wade wilson that worked hunting down bad people in new york when he meets the prostitute vanessa carlysle morena baccarin in the bar of his friend weasel tj miller they immediately fall in love with each other one year later he proposes to marry her however he faints and he learns that he has an incurable cancer soon a man offers the cure to wade and he decides to leave vanessa to submit to the treatment ajax and his assistant angel dust gina carano submit wade to painful experiments in an underground laboratory wade discovers his true name and his true intentions with the experiment intended to transform the patients in powerful slaves to be sold wade is left trapped in a machine for the weekend but he succeeds to escape he finds that he is cured from the cancer but with awful scars on the face and body further he has developed healing powers and is super strength however he is a monster the decides to leave vanessa forever and seek out francis freeman now he has found him is a funny gross and violent antisuperhero film destroys the clichs of the superhero that does not kill and protects the innocents further he loves a hooker ryan reynolds performs a hilarious hero in love with the brazilian morena baccarin his concern is not to protect the innocents but to kill the man that destroyed his face and body the film is a great entertainment for those that like politically incorrect movies my vote is seventitle brazil deadpool,comedy
im aware most will feel a 1010 is unjustified and that even an 810 is too high people are also very upset this is becoming considered one of the best rated superhero films of alltime what they are missing is that this film did exactly what it set out to do and was everything it promised its fans we had the test footage of this video we had trailers that revealed just about everything those of us that loved it knew exactly what this film was before filming was finishedthis is a film that fans pushed for this is a film many can say they had a hand in helping become a reality fox was terrified to make this film it barely squeaked through the cracks their jaws are now on the floor and are probably ready to listen when it comes to some fresh ideasif you have ever read a comic you know how faithful this was the things they had wanted to do and planned werent in the budget they cut entire scenes out and had to change others seriously just watch him talk about all the things they had to do just to stay in budget the bullet count had to be low the character forgetting his guns in a certain scene the lack of other xmen all cut corners however i think working in these parameters did nothing but help push the creativitysothis film was perfect in the fact it was enjoyable and it ended up being what was promised,comedy
true to comicunlike other marvel moviestells it like it isunafraid and dont cater to the whiny marvel fanboy that enjoys even a horrible iron man 3 moviestraight forwardrawgrittyfunny and originallooking forward to the sequelis a triumph of artistic vision over studio interference little credit should be given to 20th century fox as they had zero faith in the success of a moviefrom the ingenious opening credits to the subversive ending constantly upends clichs and tropes youre used to seeing in superhero flicks in the past few yearsafter all the straight superhero flicks of which we might have seen too many this is a fresh breeze and welcome addition to the genre so if you see one superhero movie this year see if you are sick of or hate superhero movies this is also right up your alley very highly recommended,comedy
hm why did i like it so much first of all i liked it so much because it was a different kind of super hero movie compared to the others i have seeni liked it so much because i was more interested in the crazy funny scenes and words that came out of  w wilsons mouth than in the plot  story of the movie or in other words i went to the movie to laugh and didnt expect an amazing plot and i didnt get disappointed i loved how they made fun about a lot of other superhero movies surely not every joke belonged to my kind of humor but some jokes  scenes were just done brilliantly  funny if you do not take this movies story plot and maybe some jokes too seriously than you will definitely like it but the plot isnt that bad better than a lot of other super hero movies i have seenive read that some people are complaining that there is nudity and a sex scene in this movie so come on people we are living in the 21 century where almost everyone has access to the internet and not in the middle ages while i was watching the movie there was never a second where i felt bored you always wanted to know what wade was going to do or say nextryan r and the rest of the cast did a great job ryan is definitely billion times better in portraying than the other super hero with the green suit ,comedy
wow where to start with this one it was my favorite movie ive seen in a long timeyes that includes star wars the force awakens im used to taking my two sons to every marvel release and although its rated r and my kids wouldnt be allowed in anyway i still blush at the thought of it this one is definitely a mashup of jackass and the x menis as deprecating of a film as youre ever likely to see it also skewers the entire superhero genre as well as the acting talents of many of hollywoods biggest stars including its own leading man much has been made of it demolishing the fourth wall of hollywood as wellbut it also destroys walls 510 as well ridiculously profane heaps of gratuitous violence nudity and sexand yes grandfatherly stan lee in a cameo as a dj at an all nude strip clubwhats not to lovebreaks all of the nonexistent rules of superhero movies because no one said that all superheroes have to strictly adhere to an unwritten code of conduct theres not much to the movie we havent seen in other superheromutant films guy turned into a mutant by some bad guys guy wants revenge against those bad guys guy gains revenge on these bad guys using his mutant powersyeah its a formula we have seen before but not in this over the top way this movie is big and bold and not afraid to take shots at everyone and everything within its genre and beyond i havent laughed so hard at a movie since i saw bad grandpa and its no mistake that i mentioned that particular movie while providing my two cents on omewhere captain america is shaking his head right now and johnny knoxville and his band of puerile mischief makers are laughing their butts offdecidedly different and hilariously funny this is something you havent seen beforejust make sure you leave the kiddos behind for this one,comedy
is by far the best comic to movie adaptation i have seen yet following the source material so closely that any fan will love this moviebut this is not your basic cookie cutter superhero movieso if you are planning on taking your kids to see this be warned it contains sexnudityviolencedirty jokesviolence4th wall breakingviolencedick jokes and did i mention violenceseriously dont take your kids to this movie if you value there sanity and purity in any waybut if your a fan this movie will make you happy i cant wait for the sequel,comedy
after years of development hell we finally have a version of that comic book fans were asking for ryan reynolds returns once again as wade wilson he played the character in xmen origins wolverine and delivers a performance that is one of the highlights of his careerminor spoilers of the movies plot follows a mercenary turned good guy one could argue who finds a girl whos crazy matches his crazy everything seems perfect until our hero gets diagnosed with terminal cancer a mysterious organisation that promises to cure his cancer and give him powers beyond his imagination contacts him in a not so shocking twist they turn out to be using people with serious health conditions to experiment on and use them as super slaves i was a bit worried that the backstory of how wade wilson became would take half of the movie that is not the case the blend between action and story development makes this movie one of marvels bestthe main thing everyone wants to know is the movie actually any good and the short answer is yes at the beginning of the production there were talks of making the movie pg13 american equivalent of 12a fortunately it was announced that the movie would indeed be rated r american equivalent of 15 rating of course because the movie is rated 15 the budget was not as big as it could have been and it shows the whole scale is smaller compared to other superhero movies but i think that makes the movie stand out even more even with the rating everyone was hoping for there were doubts if the violence swearing and the nudity would not be toned down i can gladly say that there is no need to worry we were promised a movie for the fans and that is exactly what we got the main reason why is so popular as a character is because of his personality and wisecracking attitude the movie is great at showing that there are numerous 4th wall breaks dirty jokes and surprisingly a lot of swearing even the opening credits make fun of the cast and the director of the movie if you are familiar with the xmen movie universe you might catch few more inside jokes jokes but if you are not that does not make the film less fun to watch the movie even makes fun of the budget of the movie by saying that the only two xmen that we ever see are colossus and negasonic teenage warhead in my opinion the greatest superhero name ever lets talk about the supporting cast morena baccarin plays vannesa wade wilsons love interest which automatically makes her the damsel in distress that our hero has to save her character is not really developed enough to form an opinion but the few scenes she is in baccarin does the best she can with the character next i want to talk about my favourite character in the movie excluding weasel played by tj miller weasel is wades best friend i have to say he is not given a lot of screen time but when he is on the screen he does a marvellous job you have to remember that the movie is short and the supporting cast suffers from that quite a bit ed skrein and gina carano play ajax and angel dust respectively their characters are a bit onedimensional they are evil just for the sake of being evil there is no backstory for both of them there are rumours of an extended cut so we can hope to learn more of them in that the two xmen in the film are great especially brianna hildebrand who plays negasonic teenage warhead she acts like a typical teenager would some of the best jokes involve her and talking all in all even with a small budget the action is still great the violence is oven the top and while the special effects are not perfect they are still good even if you are not a fan of superhero genre but you like fun action movies you should at least give this movie a chance,comedy
i think most of us have been expecting this movie or at least something like it a superhero film that is a bit more i would say adult but that doesnt quite fit more willing to cross the line of good taste a film willing to be gory immature and full of adult humour as well as brutal violenceand who better to embody the ideal of bad taste than the fourth wall breaking punkster of marvel hes pretty much what would happen if you gave a looney tunes character wolverines powers and removed the kid filter and hes awesome because of itnow this is not actually ryan reynolds first time playing this character as he also appeared in xmen origins wolverine but the less said about that particular incident the better suffice to say they didnt treat the character kindly and apparently reynolds has always wanted to return back to the character and give him a movie worthy of his insanity well mission accomplished is exactly the kind of movie it needs to be its ugly hilarious constantly veering between brutal violence cringeworthy dark humour and the occasional somber moment doesnt take itself at all seriously and is actually welldone movie in general terms as well especially because they crack jokes at the expense of the relatively cheap budget like the fact that they could only afford the licences of two very minor xmen charactersif you like youre going to love this film if you have no idea who im talking about do go see the film if you like dark humour or the idea of an r rated superhero film because trust me it earns that rating,comedy
the scale here is 110 that should mean that a 10 should have almost everything you would want in a movie and a 1 virtually nothing to offer so how can people score this 1 or 10yes this movie is bad both in the good cool way and in the bad immoral kind of way they action sequences are great its a nonstop actionthrill with a lot of blood gore violence badlanguage nudity toilet humour and virtually everything a hateloving psychopath could want great it was fun and entertaining at times and if you never get tired of constant violence gore and cheesy humour and have nothing better to live for then i am sure you would love this movie which takes movies like sincity kill bill and spawn and upgrades it and makes superhero movies like spiderman and batman look like a vegan dinner so whats not to lovea lot actually to anyone who likes to eat anything other than extra spicy bean burritoes for breakfast lunch and dinner the constant repeat of same lame childish jokes combined with endless of pointless violence gets pretty boring after awhile there is virtually nothing new or original for this movie to offer which has not been done many times before its definitely not a movie to with kids or anyone with a sensitivity level above that of a street thug and i would not recommend if for that reason its the kind of movie which not only has the hero act and kill before thinking or asking questions but it seems the movie makers and everyone involved with the movie did too on a positive its kind of what you would expect looking at the trailer and dont disappoint in that but on the negative it doesnt offer anything morea welldone nonstop action movies for those who dont wish to think feel create change anything for the better or be surprised for anyone else this will likely seem like a waste of time where there are many more movies out there to chill to with far more to offer,comedy
ryan reynolds is despicable and while its quite possible that i hate him out of jealousy glancing over his filmography which is primarily composed of egregious nonsense i can say with a certain degree of confidence that that is likely not the case reynolds has never had the opportunity to endear himself to his audience being consistently the star in projects that cast him in the worst possible light a straightup no holds barred unapologetic douchebagthat being said the character of is widely known for his zany vulgarity so perhaps reynolds was in fact the right choice a famed douchebag to play a fictional famed douchebag sounds right to mebut once again reynolds capacity to entertain is destroyed by a real yawner of a script that pretends to elevate itself above or even below its comicbook predecessors with fourthwall breaks awful jokes and graphic violence while all this could have been effective in creating a delightfully subversive comicbook film that poked fun at literally everything with gleeful abandon it eventually devolves into a blatantly selfcongratulatory splatterfest that assumes that it has achieved its goal of challenging modern film without doing so itselfdespite unique take on the superhero genre it all revolves around a formulaic ridiculous plot populated with unlikeable characters ryan reynolds stars as exspecial forces somethingorother named wade wilson who goes around being a jerk to stalkers he then finds a woman at a bar who is equally despicable and they have great sex for a very very long time then he gets cancerjesus christ exspecial forces the punisher no wait he goes around being a jerk to stalkers sounds sorta likekick ass wait now he has cancer im not sure if eddie brock had cancer in the comics but i think he did and the sex well thats basically every superhero isnt it sigh the formula is all too evident everything we see in this film apart from the jokes weve seen before in other films and comic books and then when it couldnt get any worse it doeshis cancer is cured by a notsonice guy named francis who subjects him to a lot of pain in a slew of equally cringeworthy scenes that emphasize the writer and the directors lack of regard for the human condition oh yes and the story is narrated by himself which really sucks because narrated stories naturally suckeventually gains his superpowers which turn him into yet another invincible superhero he says it himself he cant die i hate it when films do that making antiheroes that cant die even after being completely wasted as it suddenly removes any tension or risk factor that had hitherto existedsubsequently devolves even further into a mess of bullets blood and humourless jokes all in the vein of ryan reynolds quest to regain his beauty yes its as empty and ridiculous as it sounds it may have even been saved had the jokes been funny in any way i mean that was what i wanted from the film i knew that the plot and characters would likely be a letdown but heard that the hilarity factor of the film more than made up for it but i simply didnt laugh not once and i found this unusual its not as if i dont appreciate nasty jokes i laughed until it hurt in spy borat and the dictator hell i even laugh at mike tyson mysteries but this film despite its obvious intention to leave me laughing left me completely impassive if not outright disgustedthis film includes some nice cameos which i certainly didnt expect having avoided the trailers out of anticipation a few welldone action scenes which brim with glorious movement a cool popping soundtrack that i couldnt help but look up and a neat visual style but despite this its still a very very poor film that left me exceedingly disappointedi would recommend only for its novelty although whether such novelty is a step forward or backward is in your hands to determine,comedy
from the first minute youll know what to expect from this is a movie which bluntly admits the director is overpaid and one of the characters is cg then using ryan reynolds in the cover of magazine while random henchmen is burning as introduction aside from all the silliness its love story manages to establish connection better than wolverine ever had with his unhealthy obsession with jean grey and that one girl from his origin storyryan reynolds works as the titular character in the same manner robert downey jr worked as ironman hes already half the character hes playing he does not shy from selfdeprecation in fact most of the jokes are in expense of the man mainly about how ugly he is a healthy dose of pop culture references also helps in making him more amiable even though hes made out of profanity and vulgarityed skrein finds a better success as the villain here than he did as the new transporter hes the fine opposite of with almost the same physical built and quite the charisma though more on the grim side morena baccarin as vanessa is looking like normal lovely brunette yet shes humorous enough to set her character apart apparently the experience as love interest in gotham might help in thatlive and die or perhaps regenerate by its comedy its his thing breaking the fourth wall with real life references and talking with audience this is an advantage other superheroes are deprived of hes already more enjoyable due to his ability to mock practically everything between all its galore of decapitation and cursing this is a legitimate comedy for not all ages certainly not for kidsaction is pretty solid presentable cg and choreography make it a visual treat its chase scene has high resemblance from another blockbuster and even animation from video game this is not the worlds end type of crisis from avengers is not that selfless yet its a proper visual one might expect from marvel selection of soundtrack is also commendable using a more direct and classic approach for the tunes from himselfdelivers what other superheroes lacking figurative regenerating balls or guts wont even attempt crude jokes brutal display and heavy set of sarcasm this might not be for everyone but its every bit orgasmically fun as one expects from merc with a mouth,comedy
marvel has earned the right to take some chances when it comes to its cinematic universe and while does not fall into that just being able to put a marvel logo in front of your movie goes a long way is more related to the xmen universe a universe that seems less fit for the merc with a mouth but none the less it is where his story resides brings some adult comic relief to comic book movies that is not necessarily the first of its kind but definitely the first to take it this farfirst the good things right off the bat i will mention that this movie has earned its r rating which for a movie is almost necessarily a must this was the right choice for so many reasons namely the violence and the dirty words laden through this movie its nice to see what may actually happen to an unlucky civilian if they were toy get into the crossfire with one of these superheros ryan reynolds is perfect for this role and we all knew it since xmen origins his comedic style fits the role perfectly and its always nice when an actor really throws himself fully behind a character the way reynolds has done here the story is surprisingly well paces mixing back story with action sequences in a creative way unlike most if not all other comic book movies the humor in has no cheese ball factor not every joke is a home run but most of it fits the characters another problem comic book movies have is too much back storypersonal stories interfering with the main plot of the story they may add some light to these characters but ultimately bog down these movies pays its service and gives him a reason to go on his quest without spending more time than neededi do have some problems with the movie none of which ruin the movie but if some were not there it would have been a much better movie while ryan reynolds is perfect in his role i thought he was almost underutilized the character was without a doubt written with him in mind but i think the writers tried too hard to make the fit ryan reynolds rather than letting him fit into the movie also sort of teases us at the beginning the opening is so different than anything in any comic book movie to date and gives hope that not only will the comic book movie genre get lampooned a bit but also that will be different than all of these movies as the movie goes on though that seems to fall away and we almost get left with a basic comic book movie plot in the end this genre has been so flooded in the last few years it can feel like i am watching the same story unfold over and over again and i had hopes that would avoid this structureoverall is a great deal of fun for anyone who is a fan of the genre but has been getting bored with the same 7 characters being re booted and re made took some of what guardians of the galaxy had going for it new characters solid well thought out comedy and a sheer passion to make the movie happen you can tell that even while there seems to have been some slight interference from the studio seems to be almost a passion project for some people involved and that always shows through a truly enjoyable movie for any comic book fan of legal age that is,comedy
a wisecracking gun for hire finds love in the underworld but cancer robs him of his bliss  until he strikes a devilish bargain with a genemutating doctorstuffed with gags about the movie process gets tiring and a couple of superhero characters are thrown in because  the ip rights were granted by the studio dont have to look far for the problem written and produced by the same guys responsible for the overworked wordfest that was zombieland and again they chose a whining selfsatisfied lead actorthe intro is interesting action pacy but the formula keeps repeating until the editing runs out of imagination and a giant sigh of boredom is released at about the hour markmusic is standard with the worrying fact that a teen movie keeps harping back to stuff from 30 years ago and the unfunniest post credits gag ever yes you will gagsurprised they didnt include a midget in a clown suit and an ugly pet plus the boob cover up was pure how much cant we get away with  hehehe overall lots of energy but tiresome like saturday night live,comedy
i wish id never seen it crap very very disappointing i cant believe it got an 83 rating i was really looking forward to seeing this and after watching it im pretty disappointed i cant believe it got such good reviews definitely undeserving crappy dark twisted humour definitely took everything way too far dont bother watching it i wish someone had given me this advice before sitting through it i want 148mins of my life back they could have made a great movie so upsetting that this is what they managed to come up with pretty gratuitous violence lasting the entire length of the movie lost count of the number of decapitations dont waste your time,comedy
while the whole world is seemingly loosing their minds in a marvelbased mass hysteria i will try to review this completely average movie with a logical perspectivein summer 2012 i swore off superhero and comicbook movies after the double disappointing punches of amazing spiderman and the dark knight rises since there was a hurricane of hype surrounding i decided to break that rule just once and see what all the fuss was about i need not have botheredbelieve me i am grateful that this film shakes up the comicbooksuperhero genre which at this point is becoming extremely stale and boring we are all suffering from superhero fatigue as these indistinguishable films all look and feel the same and all end with a big blue laser shooting up into the sky this tiring onslaught has to stop and seems to be the gamechangerhowever the actual movie is not very good on a technical level and has a juvenile immature sense of humor that just wont let up dont get me wrong i love crude jokes i mean caddyshack is my favorite comedy of all time but if the barrage of dirty humor and pop culture references were fewer and bit smarter it would have upped the quality of the film the physics are just as impossible as any other superhero movie with able to pull of feats no human super or otherwise is capable of and if he healing powers then why does he heal back to disfigured instead of naturalvisually the film is very drab and ugly to look at with lots of greys and dull colors half of it seems to be set on an inner city freeway overpass and many other scenes feature lots of cold wet concrete alleyways junkyards and empty lots it almost has the sleazy feel of an early 80s exploitation film which is not welcome and unsuitable for a film of this naturethe plot is smaller and easier to grasp than typical comicbook fare theres no need for to be expansive so focusing on personal problems and lowerrung villains was just fine it also liked how it incorporated other xmen characters particularly colossus who was really quite sweet its in a different continuity from the disney shared universe which is a model i dont think works at all but if can share with some of the more identifiable xmen in future movies id be cool with thatjust remember weve had rrated marvel movie before blade was a success and i enjoyed thomas janes version of the punisher but none of them were able to change the rules as much as perhaps now the studios will invest in taking risks and stop grinding out safe pg13 heroes who are too afraid to kill just dial down the in jokes the raunchy humor and aim a little higher,comedy
a movie from the studio who totally ruined fantastic four for me and did a baraka from mortal kombat kinda version of in xmen origins wolverine comes a movie that totally takes any doubt about if fox can make a proper movie and delivers one of the best straight outta comic book to movie adaptation ever i am impressed to the way has made transition to the big screen in a total funny violent and unexpected turn of events the movie literally makes you wanna see it again and again until your wallet remains out of moneyby the way i am not a fan but after i saw the movie i become one i laughed so hard at some scenes that totally annoyed the all movie theatre and confirmed the fact that marvel fanboys think if stan lee makes a cameo in the movie  the movie will be good well they were not too wrong about this fact but i dont think this always works the fact that hugh jackman gets dissed and the fox studio itself a couple of times was quite hilarious and the inside joke about colossus and teenage negasonic warhead were the only characters they can afford was just too much the action scenes and constant rewind scenes are great the villains ajax amsterdam i mean francis and angel not so much dust were fine in the end not the linkin park song the movie was fun to watch got great action scenes and if you dont like swearing and curse words to much this movie is not the one you should go at unless you take your children just kidding  wait till your children get a proper age or notor just go watch it because you like comic book movie adaptations like me more or less,comedy
maybe i am just done with superhero movies the last few that people have raved about have left me feeling blah captain america winter soldier left me feeling the same way good in parts but the other ones feel repetitive especially the fight scenesand this one was supposed to be the antisuperhero superhero movie i enjoyed the attitude and crudeness of the character the editing in the first 45 minutes was compelling too but the last third of the movie felt like your typical good versus evil saga that leaves me snoozingthe music was really good and nicely intertwined throughout the movieworth a watch once but forgettable in the end,comedy
this is my first review in imdb waited for the movie to release and finally got released in indiaiam surprised and enjoyed the movie a lot actually these kind of movies dont need a reviewthey should just go onryan reynolds is a perfect apt for this dead poolthe way he played in this role was fantastic and mind blowing past he acted in the green lantern with a green suit in 2011 and was disappointed he made a banging return with this deadpoolthe movie started with a douchebag filmthe director created the comedy with intro titlesthe great sense of humor of the hero in the movie made the movie successful all the other acted perfectly in their rolesthe climax scene with a slight adult comedy it was damn good and the character colossus was greatly textured and designedfinally the movie with great comedyultra actionthese kind of movies should be enjoyed only in theaters so please dont encourage piracythank you,comedy
wow i had a feeling this movie would be awesome but i really was not prepared for what i just saw i knew the film would be raunchy and irreverent but i had no idea just how far they would go to make fun of both themselves and the entire genre while still making a badass comic book movie im sort of familiar with the character of from the comic books but i had no idea this kind of craziness was in store for me ive never even heard of the director before a guy named tim miller but im already excited to see more from him and im hoping it will come in the form of another movie the story is insanity but lets try and talk about itryan reynolds otherwise known as wade wilson is an antihero hunting down a man named ajax ed skrein otherwise known as francis we start to learn why wade wants to get to francis thanks to a number of flashbacks and a heavy dose of fourth wall breaking from wade himself you see knows that hes in a movie and he knows that were watching him he even knows about the other xmen films and the somewhat strange continuity problems theyve been having anyway the reason wants ajax is because he was tricked into signing up for a military program to give him mutant powers and cure the cancer that was eating away at his body he didnt know that ajax would basically be torturing him and turn him into a freak on top of this wade was forced to leave the love of his life vanessa morena baccarin when he joined the program now wade is out for revenge against the people that scarred him so that he can get back together with vanessa and live happily ever afterive never been a huge fan of ryan reynolds in the past but he absolutely nailed it with this role wade is basically insane ridiculously hyper and an all around prick reynolds not only gives us all of this but seems to be really enjoying himself while he does it reynolds can also pull off the more dramatic moments with ease so no complaints there honestly it seem like everyone is really enjoying themselves in this film baccarins vanessa is almost as messed up as wade and comes off as genuinely caring for him skrein is the prototypical bad guy but it seems to work really well in this story hes a prick and he knows hes a prick there really isnt a weak link in this onethe general look of this movie is very different from other films of the same genre its a bit dirtier looking than the common manhattan or metropolis type area but not as romanticized as say gotham city it really gives the film a unique look that the others dont have im not sure if that was intentional or if its a result of a low budget something that jokes about during the movie itself just compare the general look of the city to xaviers mansion which does show up a few times in the filmi was blown away by the number of jokes that are thrown around in this movie everyone in the theater was laughing every few minutes just because of how genuinely funny a lot of these scenes are not all of them come off as comedy gold but the good ones are really damn good and easily make up for the lackluster ones im also surprised how far they took the comedy at times they definitely dont shy away from offensive material but it actually helps to show what kind of a character is if youre offended by material that isnt politically correct then this movie definitely isnt for youi straight up adored this film and i came out of the theater wanting to see another one right away the world really does need more i cant express enough just how fresh this movie feels when compared to a lot of other films in the same genre i dont know if a sequel can top the madness in this one but i would love to see them try i cant recommend this movie strongly enough go watch it,comedy
glad to see they finally made the movie i have been looking forward to this release since production was first announced i was glad to see that they cast ryan renolds as he is the perfect choice for this role it was a much better fit for him than his role in green lantern i really enjoyed the story and the way it was told it was a refreshing change from some of the pg rated super hero films that try to appeal to a larger market by going for the lower rating the film moved along at a brisk pace and was filled with a lot of humour and shots at other action films i am looking forward to the sequel i donit have anything negative to say about the film as all of the character choices were good and i like how stan lee inserts into all his films i found myself laughing all the way through the film great job,comedy
in what has probably been the greatest and most outrageous marketing campaign for any film finally made it to the big screen no xmen origins wolverine doesnt count because there is absolutely no way we can call that character and luckily this film takes a few stabs at that nonetheless it has been a long road for the merc with a mouth but i think now is the right time with the abundance of comic book films pouring out every year brings a refreshing take on the genre much thanks to his daring comic creators in the 90s hes an uncompromising foul mouthed antihero that has fun doing what hes doing thats a great way to describe this film insane funthe film tells the relatively paint by the numbers narrative of wade wilson falling in love with vanessa played by morena baccarin and then having to look for a cure to his terminal cancer enter a weapon x like program run by ajax played by ed skrein who offers wilson the chance to become cured from his cancer and also gain special abilities the film is told in a nonlinear structure for the first hour or so which can feel a little strange at first but after a few scenes you grow comfortable with it knowing the chaotic and absurd nature of the character of himself thus a non linear structure fits the billryan reynolds was absolutely born to play wade wilsonover the last year or so seeing all the marketing material we have gotten plenty of reasons why he was the perfect fit for him but i still went in with reasonable expectations there are a lot of great characters in the film that have fun playing alongside but make no mistake reynolds is the star of this film in more ways than one reynolds has had difficulties in the past with picking the right roles to fit his strengths but this is the role that will define his career and i sure hope he sticks around for awhilecolossus and negasonic teenage warhead provide us and with the extra heroes and xmen characters that help pool against ajax and crew but also confirm to the audience that he does have the potential to crossover with the xmen at some point banter with them two makes for some of the best comedic relief of the entire script not only that but they served a purpose for the character of in his emotional arc of the story and also the physical arc as wellfirst time feature film director tim miller does a brilliant job bringing a lot of peoples favorite comic character to life and paul wernick and rhett reese do an impeccable job writing the screenplay i came out of this thoroughly entertained and with a giant smile on my face surprisingly it didnt have anything to do with the well choreographed action sequences the hilariously placed cameos or the perfect after credits sequences but the fact that the writers producers director and everyone involved got this character right its only been a few months since fox messed up another one of their comic book properties but the fact that this film started of the 2016 superhero slate with a bang just makes me happy for all intents and purposes this film is made for nerds myself being one of them its made for those who begged fox to make a film all these years even after ryan reynolds got stuck in green lantern hell another area in which enjoyed poking fun at in reality though i think everyone can at least enjoy themselves watching the film they pitched it as a love story for valentines day weekend and you definitely get that vanessa and wade worked well together and a love story that you care about in a superhero film is usually tough to come by theres something for everyone here but those who truly care about this character will appreciate it the most whether it was presence of the xmansion ripping hugh jackmanwolverine surprising batman and even marvel universe nods the amount of easter eggs are endless this was the film we all wanted to see and boy did we get itreynolds is perfectdirty brutal and hilariousspot on interpretation of o many easter eggscolossus and negasonic teenage warhead fit in well9210,comedy
is one of my all time favorite heroes so i was waiting for this movie since ages and luckily it turned out great ive watched it three times in the theaters i usually never watch a movie so many times in such a short time this was so fun i just couldnt resist and i had to watch it again and again it felt like the creators of the movie were also big fans of and really enjoyed creating this movie it is very accurate to the comic version and its a great movie interpretation to really enjoy the movie you need know some comics the 90s and of course movies but there plenty of jokes and easter eggs about all kinds of stuff the action scenes of the movie were also top notch brutal and bloody also as we are talking about an r rated movie and well we can hear a lot swearing its a different kind of superhero movie its easily one of the best superhero movies and ive enjoyed every seconds of it would watch it again 1010 cant wait for the sequel,comedy
props for the humour in the opening credits that was really creative and funny cant say the same for the rest of the movietypical bland storyline and i dont see whats so appealing about all the crude humour the ability to crack dirty jokes does not make your movie automatically funny but unfortunately that seems to be the trend in hollywood nowadaysmain motivation in the movie is to track down the man who destroyed his life and rescue his lady love how many times has that been done already and compared to other superhero movies these days that is a really weak and unappealing ploti guess i just dont get or the hype,comedy
i have been looking forward to this movie for a long time and i really want to love it but i just cant they could have done so much more with the movie that i cant help but feel disappointed the origin story takes up too much time while adding almost nothing the movie failed to make me care about vanessa morena baccarin and the only good the love story really added was a joke about pegging the origin story also failed to make me think ajax was a bad ass mercenary on par with he just never feels like much of a threat it also fails to show us that wade wilson was an extremely skilled mercenary before he became which is what allows him to become they could have just skipped the origin story and done another story arc or explained his origin in another way that would still make us want him to kick ajaxs ass the jokes are hitandmiss and in my opinion they failed to show wittiness and truly give us the merc with a mouth they also failed to show what a deeply disturbed individual actually is and he doesnt have the same depth as he does in the comics i guess the love story was there to show that hes more than just a wacky character but it in my opinion just doesnt workthe upside to this movie is that when it gets things right it truly does get things right there are plenty of funny moments and some great action scenes and i guess its worth watching but as a fan of im left unsatisfied at least cable will be in the sequel,comedy
is a superhero comedy film based on the marvel comic of the same name as an adaptation of a crude violent and hilarious comic book it is very successful for me it has dethroned kickass as the funniest comic book film i have ever seenwade wilson ryan reynolds is a wisecracking mercenary who protects his clients from unwanted associates one day wade is diagnosed with cancer in most of his important internal organs in an attempt to cure the cancer wade undergoes a top secret experiment which leaves him with accelerated healing powers and a sick twisted sense of humour as a result he becomes the merc with a mouthfilled with all the metahumour and action one would expect to see is one of the best comic book adaptations to date you know a movie is off to a good start when even the opening credits have you laughing theres no denying that this is the role that ryan reynolds was born to play he embodies so perfectly that it is impossible for me to see any other actor portraying the character theres rarely a dull momenti rate it 8510,comedy
let me be perfectly frank theres a very small market for the new movie and that seems to exclusively be teenage boys who enjoy the odd breast decapitation and curse word while superhero films are all the rage today has always been a very niche superhero and it seems to me like it wont exactly bring in the female crowd although i could be entirely wrong about that and its rated r mostly due to its gratuitous violence and nudity so lets just nix the children right now this leaves a very small window for the movie but its success depends on them and i feel as if it will succeed although it doesnt entirely deserve tofollows mercenary wade wilson a typical ryan reynolds as he is lured into some dark dingy underground lab in order to receive experimental medical attention in order to cure him of his debilitating cancer of course as if often the case with these superhero films things to awry and wilson is left horribly disfigured much to his chagrin this leads him to adopting the moniker and beginning his violent adventure to find and kill the man responsible ed skrein if this sounds overly familiar thats because it is while the movie may want to subvert typical superhero expectations and tropes it ends up being entirely unoriginal which is definitely a downside to this otherwise well intentioned filmit seems to me like the only thing this movie has going for it is its violence and adultoriented content but even that is highly unoriginal im thinking specifically of what last years kingsmen did to the spy movie or even what kickass did to this very genre it presents an atypical hero in an atypical movie full of blood carnage swearing and nudity that you wouldnt otherwise find in a hollywood blockbuster superhero film wants to market itself as a highly original film thats regarded as an intelligent subversion of superhero tropes but it often falls into the very own tropes that its parodying that it loses most of its originality and muster while teenagers will undoubtedly gobble this movie up because its filled with boobies and gore and swearing and thats cool for teenagers specifically boys everyone else will find it a merely average watchable movie that fails at its own ambitionsryan reynolds is good in the role as his typical sarcastic humor fits the character of perfectly its also genuinely stylish and some of the jokes are admittedly very clever and funny im thinking specifically of the opening credits where the usual directed by written by titles are replaced by funny declarations like from this douchebag or other similar titles its an original concept but unfortunately the film loses its own way immediately after these credits and devolves into a typical superhero film just with the odd severed headfor fans of dick jokes this movie is sure to bring tears to the eyes but dick jokes can only get you so far and you can only tell enough of them before it starts to get tiring seriously theres enough jokes about the male genitalia here that it could fill a book and become the bible of dick jokes but for anyone who isnt 17 years old this can get very annoying and unfunny as it often does the movie aims for these types of jokes because it isnt what youd find in a superhero movie but the film overshoots its own goal and tires its audience out well before the movie thinks its told enough of them the same thing goes for the violence weve seen enough bloody violence in cinema before that these instances are nothing new yet the movie is so smug and so naive as to think that wed be amazed at how subversive it is being its not weve seen this all before weve seen it better and weve seen it funnierin the end becomes what it is parodying the movie wants to make fun of superhero origin tropes but it becomes one in the process wade gets bad news he becomes the guinea pig of some form of experimentation he gets magic powers and he fights his way to the big bad in order to stop him the only difference here is that his path is littered with tits and severed heads rather than handcuffs if thats enough for you youll be thoroughly entertained for everyone else maybe youd best to rewatch kick ass and ponder at what could have beenc,comedy
so is after drfrancis or drajax to fix his face he catches him in the beginning of the movie but he gets away so drfrancis decides to kidnap old girlfriend to make come to him  but is already after him so the girlfriend has no place in this story its not like they threaten with if you show your face here we will kill your girlfriendnope the story sucked,comedy
golf clap for ryan reynolds and the team that brought this film together for all the wrongs in super hero cinema will give you hope that it will be all right of course then they released xmen apocalypse is not the greatest movie ever made no super hero movie ever will be and ryan reynolds likely did not set out to make the greatest movie ever made but what he did accomplish with is something more important to the future of the genre he has the credibility to trust his instincts and to make super hero films fans want he is an authority now and the success of will reverberate through hollywood this will transcend into other genres as well such as scifi and fantasy star wars i am staring directly at you right now dont divert your eyes from me im going to make this hella awkward for you right nowreynolds and company captured everything that makes the comic loved and successfully transferred it to the big screen he even corrected longtime failures like colossus and was able to make a seemingly absurd and obscure character nega sonic teenage warhead did i get that right relevant relatable likable and memorable whats more is he did all this while not diverting from the central story with cloddish origin stories or other blockbuster tropesi dont write reviews but this film left me so happy after years of disappointment with my favorite properties that i was compelled to publish something to show my gratitude rr please executive produce every marvel film from here on out because you get itthank youps singer and abrams can eat a d,comedy
i dont usually watch comedy movies as they most often fail to achieve their purpose of making me laugh was a stunning combination of stupid but funny jokes jokes and the occasional bad jokes ryan reynolds seems to play as natural as if hed written the role himself while also respecting the comic book characters persona to a high degree is one of the best comedy movies ive ever watched if not the best and id also place it in my top overall movies the reasons why its considered unsuited for children and rrated are pretty obvious but if youre not planning to see a movie with your kids its definitely a title to keep in mind,comedy
is certainly a film worth your money however i would say it is an extremely overrated movie notable for breaking the typical superhero boundariesespecially when it comes to a marvel productis a violent obscene and gory movie yet not in a bad way at all i strongly disagree with it being in the top 250 above dances with wolves might i add but a perfect movie for lovers of action somewhatcheap comedy and tons of popculture references the humour wasnt really my thing but certainly elicited a few chuckles and some hearty laughs action was superbly done plot was shaky characters interesting and colourful overall a good superhero movie but not incredible,comedy
this is such a trash an unwatchable thing even if it is meant to be a parody of something it is just bad i have rarely seen such a low level of everything,comedy
i dont know what some people expected to see herethey must not have watched the trailer or seen any advertising for before actually watching itis meant to be cheesy corny over the top naff and all the things a superhero film tries its best not to be but usually isthis is the beauty of it is reversereverse ripping the pss out of all the other superhero movies and it does it with such style takes all the things superhero movies try their best to avoid but fail every time and magnifies them by x 10 that is the fun of iti love this film it is a very welcome departure from the usual marvel cap we have been receiving time and time againwell done guys cant wait for the sequel or number 2 lol,comedy
most fans would rather forget the characters first film appearance but it was that appearance that did lead to this film so while the character did not really get fleshed out all that much at the beginning of xmen origins wolverine nor was he portrayed correctly at the end the end result is one of the funniest movies i have seen at the theaters in many years truth be told though i am not really big on comedies for the most part still this film was a great spectacle to behold and it is nice seeing ryan reynolds film really take off not only because i always enjoy seeing him in films but also because he made a comic book movie the right way something hollywood seems to scared to do he made a comic book film where the character acts like he does in the comic looks like he does in the comic and it has not been made for the general audience no we get in all his crazed glory doing what he does bestkilling when he is not killing he is constantly breaking the fourth wall as knows he is a comic book character and reynolds portrays the crazed hero with magnificent glee the story well that is simple wants to kill someone why well through a series of flashbacks we learn of the way the merc with a mouth has become the way he is and a love that is lost to him to not only fix his deformed face but to also get revenge he must find a guy named ajax who is actually named francis will get help in the form of the mighty colossus and his teenage protg he also has allies in a man who runs a bar that deals with problems a cab driver who does not seem to mind getting paid in high fives and a blind roommate who enjoys cocaine yes all the typical things one tends to find in comic book moviesnot did i mention boobs yep theyre in there too so must go find the ones who wronged him and do some slicing and dicing too i am very happy with the films success unfortunately i do believe that hollywood will get the wrong idea by the results they are going to just assume that making every comic book film with a slightly edgy character should contain gratuitous violence and nudity and all that when the real reason the film is doing well is the fact it was made for those of us who enjoy reading comics too often they soften up a character and completely change things to suit a wider audience but this film proves that is not necessary the characters have been portrayed a certain way and i find it insulting when those of us who read comics get dismissed and things added to other comic book films to attract say more female viewers seriously did having bruce banner and the black widow have a thing really work never happened in the comics and this is just one example in one of the more recent comic book movies just look at colossus in this movie he finally has a russian accent and he has a better fight scene here than he did in any of the xmen movies this movie proves you can do things by the book and the film will do good but the lesson they will learn is just to make everything rso i enjoyed this film immensely had it opened last year it would have trailed only mad max fury road as my favorite film of 2015 my only problems with the film are the fact i thought they showed a bit too much back story in how he became who he was as the film did have a bit of a romantic subplot going itself still in the end it was about shooting and killing and learning that if you are going to be killing and bleeding a lot to make your costume red this film took awhile to finally get off the ground and i am glad ryan reynolds did not give up as he made a very funny comic book film on a rather small budget by todays standards,comedy
the idea of making an rrated superhero movie is good and i think it should be a trend but this movie is not a very good examplea few scenes did make me laugh i liked the action sceneshowever one problem i have with this movie was that it was trying too hard to be funny some of the humor was just ridiculous and very bad taste examples would be the scene where ryan reynolds farts and the scene close to the ending where ryan reynolds was lying next to his lover vanessa as he was still fighting ajax he made a hole with his fingers and stuck a finger in the hole as a sex joke also the scene close to the beginning of the film where ryan reynolds had a hole right in the center of his ass on his suit was just childishanother problem i had with this movie was that ajax was just not an interesting villain he tortured fought him kidnapped vanessa fought again and then got shot in the head at the end for a supervillain ajax didnt do much and the movie never explained how ajax got his super strengthmy last issue with this movie is the fact that was played by ryan reynolds he is like jackie chan danny trejo or adam sandler you cant take those guys seriously especially after ryan reynolds was in that horrible green lantern film in 2011hopefully the sequel will have better humor and villains,comedy
i can honestly this is one of the worse movies ive ever seen its so annoying its untrue its not funny and its attempt at being funny is cringe worthy the character is so annoying and comes out with childish jokes that only an idiot would find funny constantly making cock jokes just screams out the immaturity of the movie i can honestly say i didnt laugh once through the movie and was just getting more and more anoid at how crap the movie was and was questioning what i was doing with my life the plot has about as much substance as a pre ejaculation there another cock joke to go with the movie ryan reynolds is annoying anyway and this movie has made me border line hate him i will never watch this again and definitely wont be watching the sequel save valuable hours of your life and stay away from this complete waste of a movie its truly horrific ,comedy
im not a fanboy of anything so i dont give 1010 for anything i liked slightly so 710 is a good review from me there was only a couple of times i found my mind wandering in this there were times i found the wisecracking annoying but i did not mind that because it was supposed to be annoying i liked the comic book style for example we spend a lot of time in silly dialogue with a taxi driver while ignoring the main plot  just as youd expect in a comic of this naturei found the story to be interesting and sufficiently different from other hero films to make it worthwhile some reminiscences of watchmen  which i enjoyed i found the main villain also to be good robotic in his evil as to be expected but also in some ways human in a its nothing personal friend but im forced to hurt you now kind of way the villain sidekick is also quite a scary woman the involvement of the xmen was rightfully a sideissue as this was the story of deadpoolon the whole its slightly more artistic than the usual pulp superhero movie as was watchmen and dare i say it guardians of the galaxy but more adult than either of those,comedy
after watching being a comic lover i thought that the dramatization and personal life of wade wilson was overly exaggerated to the point of making the character simply dumb the character jubilee and colussus were accurate portrayals to their comic counterpart however was overly talkative and lost his furious approach to allthings decadent i was honestly expecting his voice to be charred and more cruel less happy i mean isnt that why theres a yellow bubble around the characters voice in the comics although ryan reynolds joked around and played the part well even if the director missed some actual personifications i would have maybe used a less personalized script to me is a new york street hobo whom was slightly borrowed from deathstroke the terminator rorschach from watchmen and maybe idk spiderman in personality and in this regard rob liefield is a genius however the movie itself was drab and made me think of as some loser whom gets a quickrich scheme if you know what i mean not because of the actors themselves but because of the directing to please rob liefieldthe jeans commercial guyloll no really hes been in comics since the early 90s so he knows what characters work and what characters dont this movie was another spawn imho it was just a movie with a crazy budget i would in fact like to see more of the third party characters then during the escapade the matrix style effects though works and i wouldnt know it from a movie made in the late 90s another minor miss would be the mask not doing the lobos fetals giz gesture syndrome idk a big eye and a small eyeno kids we wont be seeing a sequel for reasons unknown needs a plot without the love and romance i would like him to be more carefree chris pratt could play more effectively like idk daniel daylewis then if you could use some sort of sin city like transition to comics in the scenes that would be too cool in the end though was just too tame,comedy
this movie is definitely for the 20s crowd it is a comic book story which appeals to the young but the lewd scenes and language is not for teenagers its rated r and definitely not for the morally faint and the body count gore is not for the fainthearted i gave it a 7 because it is overall fun funny and entertaining but the plot is simple revenge with a side note of shallow romance with a few snide remarks in psychological therapy its an experiment in the antihero where the protagonist character traits are worse than ever looking villainous a few scenes dont make sense such as what the villain was trying to accomplish how the hero escaped the rebar and a few others that left me wondering how to fill in the blanks finally some lame explanations were made for a few puzzling scenes,comedy
ill keep it short wise people dont watch this this is not for you this is a teen movie which is paradoxically not suitable for teens if you really plan to watch it do it at home later i was fooled by the metascore you dont be if this kind of movies succeed in the market were gonna see more and more of them in the future unfortunately the super hero movies are getting more vulgar and empty one after another they abuse too much of sex blood and violence to attract the crowd no matter what kind of effects it might have on youngsters the detrimental effect of this type of violent scenes on children and teen have been proved by research i see this trend alarming,comedy
unique character whose sense of humor is appreciated those together and a fairly good story would have made this movie better than most superhero fare of late but the sheer number of references to dicks dropped my rating by 4 points dragging out sad tired punchedinthe balls gags one liners about dicks penis constant mention of masturbation hand gestures lots of unsexy sex on repeat and damn just in your face dick dick dick it got old quick it just seemed obvious to me that the movie was aimed boys in the earliest stage of puberty which is too bad because it could have had a wider appeal that his gf worked in a stripclub as a waitress yeah big diff hit the limit of my patience its too bad guys will get the idea they could rank such a gorgeous woman because no woman would put up with such a juvenile personality much less share it herself to those heres a warning no gf worth having appreciates a boy man who still lives with his mom and plays games all day pure comic book fantasy  which im sure somebody will write one day there was so much wrong with this whole setup i mean i was ready to get into this movie for the unique elements such as the antihero bit humor experiments gone wrong etc then i realized it was just a bunch of boys in a circle jerk touching each other then all laughing their heads off after the awkwardness subsides and they start farting if youre not 11 its gross to watch then just pitiful to remember,comedy
this film serves as a perfect testimony to just how far the current superhero obsession has run amok into completely asinine territory is arguably the most despicable character ever to have been passed off as a hero aside from this fact all of the hoopla from the fan boys saying that this was an edgy film couldnt be more wrong throwing vulgar language into the dialogue doesnt make for an edgy film but it does make for a film that is a phony tryhard at the end of the day this film follows the exact same formula as any other contrived superhero film regardless of what the hype surrounding it might say this level of selfcongratulation attempting to pass itself off as clever is offensive to any viewer who is smart enough to see whats going on dont fall for it this film isnt nearly as smart or witty as it thinks it is,comedy
i remember stumbling into my fathers office one day as he was editing footage of a thirteen yearold boys bar mitzvah he was trying to figure out what to do with this horrible chunk of film wherein the boy and his friends were passing around a microphone shouting any and every moronic inane thing their brains could come up with i recently rewatched bits of that footage under a new name deadpoolwade wilson ryan reynolds former special forces operative turned gunforhire finds the love of his life vanessa morena baccarin they understand each other they have great fun and great sex together and wade is the happiest hes ever been that is until he inexplicably develops latestage cancer throughout his body and randomly leaves his girlfriend in the middle of the night to participate in some super secret experimental procedure that will cure him the procedure turns him into an ugly freak but grants him extraordinary healing powers prompting wade to seek revenge on the man who changed him and win back his girlthe biggest problem has is himself for some reason people seem to mistake his rampant profanity and poorly cultivated sexual humor as comedy because it comes from the mouth of a comic book protagonist i thought we had matured from beyond that point i thought that watchmen a product of the 80s proved that we could expect more from our superheroes why people choose to settle for comedy that was stale when we were middle schoolers i dont know but i think it bears mentioning that doesnt tell jokes he just curses and makes half polished thats what she said quips his breaking the fourth wall shatters any sense of immersion a viewer might have experienced and while godard gets a pass on such antics because hes not directing storydriven action films tim miller gets no such pass similarly discussing the actors who play other xmen characters is beyond frustrating i want to grab the scriptwriters and scream at them what kind of universe is this where ryan reynolds references himself but doesnt acknowledge that he himself is currently playing wade wilson i hear the argument all the time that all of this is satire comics exist to lampoon preexisting tropes and archetypes but satire requires a point of view which ultimately lacks in actuality the film succumbs to the same trite stereotypes it pretends to transcendall that aside there is still a considerable amount in this movie to like most notably wade and vanessas love story prior to the ill conceived revenge plot reynolds plays wade with charisma and energy and baccarin reciprocates in turn their characters are engagingly quirky and some of the most well crafted and cinematic jokes come during these scenes one scene in particular which takes place in an arcade stands out as my favorite sequence in the entire movieunfortunately when your movie is called and is nothing more than an obnoxious manchild who leans so heavily on the crutch of generic crass uninspired rrated humor its hard to look too fondly upon the film as a whole dont succumb to the fanboy hype realize for the manipulative immature rehash it is,comedy
short and simple review by wubsthefadgerafter the horrible representation of in xmen origins wolverine we finally get the we always wanted the film is hilarious gruesome graphic and did i mention hilarious the story is a basic revenge plot but the characters make the film amazing the jokes used throughout the film are mostly solid the use of graphic violence and language add to the hilarity the fourth wall breaks are amazing the opening credit scene is amazingthe acting is very good ryan reynolds was born to play he imbodies and he does so in a believable way ed skrein despite his bad performance in transporter refueled is actually a great actor he plays a really good bad guy morena baccarin also performs well as wilsons love interest karan soni stefan kapicic brianna hildebrand and tj miller all perform very wellthe pacing is very fast we are instantly throw into the movie with some funny jokes and brutal violence the runtime is not overly longis a perfect blend of action comedy and violence i did find some of the jokes not very funny and the story was a little clichpros a perfect blend of action and comedy brutal violence amazing characters hilarious jokes fourth wall breaks good acting an amazing performance by ryan reynolds fast pacing and a short runtimecons some of the jokes were not funny and the plot was a little clich overall rating 87,comedy
good to see this comic book have a good adaptation to the big screen having a great backstory and performance by ryan reynolds to show what should really be is awesome great to see that they fixed the wrongs that xmen origins did wrong with the character looks and sounds like they ripped the comic out of the pages to make into a great live action film the costumes are super accurate and gives a good twist on the normal superhero formula,comedy
reviewa film i watched oh just a couple of times then 4k uhd another hmm 4 times dont miss the intro or the titles and better than any of the other marvel films made if you are looking for some thing very different and at times hilarious even ryan reynolds takes on the roll really well imo taking the risks that many others would not i betdoes not get better for this genre with a twist and its just fun to watch 90 of the movie,comedy
without ryan reynolds this movie would not be what it is today yes the character from the comics is already a cult legend but still there is not a single actor who could outperform ryan in this role the fact that he is the same kind of a cool guy in his private life gives the extra taste of dedication to the role he was given the references to other movies and to himself were also very entertaining altho i think that maybe just a bit less nudity would be more appropriate but still this is and that is what he does,comedy
so greatfrom the beginningthere are tons of words which addict me tohe isnt a super hero as he saidbut rather a antiherohe clash the public placespeak nasty wordsso it isnt suitable to childrenit makes me happy for him to use swords to kill opponentsim looking forward to next movie,comedy
i am aware that to many people especially those unfamiliar with comic or marvel comics at all this movie would seem too gory unnecessary brutal and excessively violent but this movie is a comedy where its main protagonist should be perceived as a comedian and ryan reynolds did an excellent job representing this characterthe story of isnt complex or profound  and it wasnt meant to be this movie is all about fun and entertainment abundant with action jokes blood and foul language therefore it is not suitable for children i grew tired of people thinking that movies based on comics are intended for children onlyrelated to that i believe that many marvel movies could have been far more successful if they didnt refrain from gory scenes i am sorry but if you want to make a serious combatbased movie and you make it without blood than that movie will be all but seriousthat is why i see as a refreshment nowadays many writers and directors are too worried about political correctness in their movies that really stifles creativity and that is why today we have so many movies with great ideas but poor realizationthus to me was a very pleasant surprise i had fun watching it and i intend to watch it again some time soon,comedy

is a damn good badass action film in the marvel comic book section movies i have seen the film is rated r with blood squibs filed with explosive action i love this film from end till end it is one of my favorites it has jokes and humor i was laughing the same time i enjoyed a bloody action sequences in the opening scene you have a badass action sequences in which jumps in too van beating thugs on a bridge is fantastic sequence in which has only 12 shots in his iwi desert eagle mark xix gun and he kills bad guys one by one while mercenaries are firing at him with machine gunsthe best thing is the ajaxs motorcycle mercenaries use the heckler  koch mp5k against firing thousand rounds on him dodging gun firing bullets at the motorcyclist maximum effort is a badass theme for that is why i enjoy the film so much for the action and humor ryan ryanolds know how too make a good movie bullet countdown scene awesome in which he counts bullets before he kills badguys he shots with one bullet a mercenary in the grenade causing explosion badass this is a badass action film but it is also an origin story about wade wilson how he become deadpoolthe movie isnt about superhero who has a nice life or is rich or billionaire no slade wilson is poor he has a hard life he has to earn his money with hard work he is an ex special forces operative now a criminal as an mercenary helping youth people like he save a young girl from a stalker a real stalker yes he was mean he still saved a young girl of course he was paid he meet his girlfriend who is a prostitute and he lives normal life until he finds out he has cancer because he doesnt want to die he accepts invention for faculty for experimental treatment for his cancer he is taken to ajax and angel dust who inject him with a serum designed to awaken latent mutant genes they torture him until the faculty prison doesnt explode caused by wilson while ajax stabbed him with an iron stick wade wilson survives and promise revenge on francis freeman  ajax ed skrein honestly one of the best rated r action films i have seeni absolutely love ryan reynolds as wade wilson  he is a badass in this movie not only he jokes but he acts really believable love his character i love the action sequences gina carano is in this movie and she is a badass the fight sequence between her and colossus stefan kapicic is excellent in the movie stefan kapicic who provides the voice for colossus is excellent right from the comic book his character brianna hildebrand is negasonic teenage warhead she is likable her character is a good superhero character ed skrein as francis freeman  ajax is a great psychopath villain who tortures innocent people with his experiments until stops him morena baccarin as vanessa as a good love interest of wade wilsoni love the ending sequence in which recruits colossus and negasonic teenage warhead to help him fight against francis freeman  ajax and angel dust that is a badas action ever love the rescue mission on vanessatim miller directed perfectly this movie that i had blast watching it the action sequences in this movie are completely insane that is why it is so good film i would gave this movie a 10 but the song chicago youre the inspiration by berracelik in which vanessa lies and you see some animated animals and that song plays that scene ruined the movie for me sounds from the karate kid part ii the glory of love  peter cetera that is why i hate that song in this movie that is why i gave a 9 which is a good score the soundtracks could have been better in this movie there is neither one soundtrack that i like in here the rest of the film i enjoy and i love it it is fast paced and goes quickly aroundjust too let you know this isnt the greatest film of all time the best one but it is a damn good action film i recommend it,comedy
takes the  superhero  chandra by the balls and rips them offits funny nasty sick in places and totally irreverent to the genre its meant to present in short its a breath of foul air in an over sanitized series of films after youve have had the experience every other superhero is just so weak in this outing suffers a personal loss of such proportions that he seeks to end his life in many sick and funny ways saved by his metal friend from the first film he joins the xmen as a  trainee  with many hilarious results watch and enjoy,comedy
i never liked superhero stile movies because the actors who play those superheroes are so pathetic and unrealistic i mean you dont believe they have super powers in spite their serious faces and a lot of trying but in this movie wow ryan reynolds acts like he really has super powers and he doesnt even trying to persuade you to believe that his acting is good and he is funny to boot i didnt give the movie 10 stars because in my opinion an actress who played vanessacopycat had to be much younger and prettier,comedy
354the xmen universe needed a fun superhero movie after 6 xmen movies focused on a hardened magneto and a deliberate charles xavier was the least the franchise could do to keep your attention for another movie it simultaneously provided ryan reynolds with his first good role as a comicbook characteris the unlikely hero whod defy all of the preset hero stereotypes he can get the job done but still chooses to carry himself like a kid hes a good person at heart but has an arsenal of rrated humor to dispense at a moments notice at the same time he can present a more mature dark theme and take himself seriouslywhat makes great is his flexibility as a character whenever the movie takes a carefree or silly turn it doesnt saturate the more intense emotionally driven sequences and vice versa truly has a plot an issue and a resolution however its not scared to take you on too fun a ride replete with comicbook violence and profanitylaced hilarityi am thoroughly pleased with as it showed that even the most morallyflexible of us can be a hero in our own right he doesnt settle for lighthearted or heavyhanded and he knows how to please the crowds,comedy
the main triumph of is its capability of making its title character sympathetic yet wildly outrageous with his inappropriate sense of humor ryan reynolds certainly deserves much of the credit for this because of his unequivocal commitment to the role any hesitation or lack of conviction in lines would significantly lessen his characters appeal reynolds manages to make seem lovable in his most irreverent moments as well as his most vulnerable however is mostly allowed to get away with his heinous crimes because he is trying to save the perfect girl against an undeniably evil villain the writers go all in with both of these overused elements in any other superhero movie his romance and revenge quest would be trite but the enthusiastically delivered snarky jokes overshadow this the humor in is for the immature at heart and isnt nearly as clever as it would like to think attempts to poke fun at the superhero genre arent necessary and seem forced at times luckily the movie is funny enough in its own right to cover for these missteps the main laughs come from interactions with colorful characters such as his girlfriend a confused taxi driver a blind african american woman and two superhumans the secondary characters complement reynolds well despite their limited development and screen time the movie is a joyride until the third act where unfortunately the requisite action takes precedence over both humor and narrative the drawnout battle sequence is bearable for a while because is a sympathetic character but it eventually overplays its welcome two characters are present for seemingly no reason at all except for comedic relief and perhaps sequel materialwhen the action finally does come to an end it is abrupt and the movie makes no concluding message thus certainly deserves the praise it gets for tapping into a creative use of the superhero genre but it should not be lauded as groundbreaking its pure fun nothing more nothing less,comedy
this whole movie tried wallbreaking since its the main point of the character and it actually made laughs sincerely for us but with that also had some bland moments really just the whole aesthetic of itit was also clever to not have this be the highest budgeted movie ever it paved way to have gigs on this broke dude making fun of how much these heroes are and studio deals that has to go throughbut with that the origin story pushed the movie back we couldve had more time this is the troubling concernthe movie had too many themes as the origin story continued it tried to have a cool revenge story and then filled the movie with a bunch of blocks about little past bits as himself bd before still this didnt give much weight to wade wilson as he kept on doin funny jokes and 4th wallbreaking to fit his superhero personaso yeah gigs and revenge maybe love story too just a good mahem of both,comedy
i was in two minds about watching on the one hand i generally enjoy modernday superhero movies which are very much all of a kind but have decent special effects and lots of action to see them through theyre easy viewing on the other hand im no fan of crude humour and bad language and i knew what to expect with this one i dont think much of ryan reynolds either i was pleased to find then that i enjoyed quite a bit its not one of my favourite superhero films but as an origin story it does the job nicely and there are lots of memorable quirky moments and characters to enjoy as a comedy its also a lot wittier than i was expected and i enjoyed picking up all of the pop culture references the crudeness did nothing for me but most of it was in the form of throaway lines so didnt matter too much the strong supporting cast features an onform ed skrein and a typically hulking gina carano but colossus was my favourite star here the cgiaugmented action scenes are well staged and the action has a nicely brutal edge to me this feels like a natural successor to the crank films albeit better made,comedy
this is a selfsatisfied sexist little romp with a few laughs and an affable central performance from ryan reynolds one of many ben affleck clones currently doing the hollywood rounds it amazes me that anyone could possibly mistake it as in any way progressive its postmodern we know were in a movieis as contemporary as a bugs bunny cartooned skrein gives good villain its a treat to see leslie uggams enjoying herself in a supporting role and theres a nice sardonic turn from tj miller the music by junkie xl aka tom holkenborg is in contrast to the movie as a whole unselfconsciously generic and is all the more enjoyable for itwill pass slightly too much of your time it could have been shortened by ten minutes without anyone noticing otherwise theres not a lot to be said for it,comedy
honestly i was actually bored through most of it which is unusual for me the entire movie was like a collage of meta jokes which was fun for about five minutes but got old really quickly there is no substance to the movie the best thing you can say about the story line is that it exists the characters are boring and couldnt compensate for the lack of plot and while i dont normally mind violence and gore these fighting scenes were not clever or creative in any way and seemed only to try and shock people a lot of talk about penises and assholes and wow look at how meta i am and it would have been funny if i had been a kid or a teenager or an adult who hasnt seen a lot of movies before but for me it was lame and embarrassing i cant believe it got a higher rating than kingsman,comedy
this could just be a situation where this film isnt meant to be for people like me but i can honestly say that this is one of the most forgettable films i have ever seeni cant fault the technical aspects of this film the cgi was pretty good at points and didnt look terrible compared to other films i have seen however this doesnt carry the film 90 of this film relies on its humour and it wasnt very good the jokes where pretty copy paste trying to be raunchy and edgy and were quite pandering i genuinely didnt laugh or even smirk for any of the jokes the shit did i leave the stove on is such a easy and overused joke and for a film that is meant to be the best thing since sliced bread i honestly hoped for better there is also only about 20 mins of actual story that seems to get mixed in with the flashbacks and action sequences i wasnt expecting to be blown away by the story but i feel that they could of tried a little harder the flash back scenes really disrupted the flow of the film and made it hard for me to get into the movie as i was just waiting for another flash back at any moment now to be fair i have only read little segments of the comics but what i did read made me laugh i had heard from friends and others that this is the that is in the comics and not some film that completely screws up the character if that is the case then i am not sure if i want to read the comics i could go on and nit pick little things and scenes that i didnt like but not many people are going to read this overall i would say that fans of comic book movies will most likely enjoy this if sex lolrandom and darker humour are your type of thing you might enjoy this however the jokes arent original enough or executed well enough to be hysterical this isnt going to be a classic but its not bad enough to fully hate it either,comedy
is a new comic book movie and its the story of how the antihero gets his identity and his name and also how he sets in a path of revenge against ed skerin this has to be the best marvel comic book movie ive ever seen its debatable with the avengers and guardians of the galaxy the script is very funny clever and aware of the mistakes marvel has done of the past about ryan reynolds portraits again and does a great job doing so the love interest with wade wilson and vanessa its handled very well and gives the story some weight because you want to succeed you want him to get his girlfriend the action is done masterfully well blending cgi with practical effects tj miller was also hilariously funny with a lot of great lines and colossus is there because he wants to use powers for good and he wants to join the xmen so it gives a reason for to decide who he really wants to be in the future the name wade gives himself its amazingly clever and unexpected the end credit scene was hilarious and its aware of what marvel has done in the past as the general audience expects information about the sequel or future installments the music is very well incorporated the r rating finally gives the movie freedom of doing what they want the villain is very hateful and the first credit scene is gut bustlingly funny this has to be the funniest movie ive seen in quite some time 810,comedy
nice try attempting to breathe some fresh air into the wornout superhero genre but it is too full of cute and witty oneliners after a while it gets repetitive and tiresome like a 6hour long standup comedy show with the same comedian and the plot actually there isnt one you get a few grins here and there and thats it,comedy
king ace movie i watched it again twicethis review is a rush job i am waiting for the vhs to rewind so i can view movie againmuch action and comedy kept me entertainedmy brain liked it my scoring 9  10 stars proves thatspoiler  no guns or cars were harmed in the making of this filmi did this review just so my profile can be completedcostumes were outstandingtops intro that in itself could be moviemarvell fans will enjoy,comedy
when a friend of mine first invited me to see my expectations were quite low i had known nothing about and expected to see a classical super hero movie suitable for all ages which i usually dont enjoy little did i know was a full blown comedy super hero movie made for mature audienceswatching 4dx was amazing experience a scene where jumps from bridge into a car was one of the most entertaining movie experience ive ever had if only the rest of the movie was this good if youre still somehow able to see it 4dx dont miss the chancedeadpol is very bloody with a lot of violence and mayhem language used is too obscene for my taste many conversations and scenes are very childish the whole movie is very immature is going to strongly entertain younger audiences so yes is pretty bold and quaint experiment you have brutal violence combined with childish humor for its authors audacity i give it a seven objectively its more of a sixstill delivery is pretty homogeneous all the violence and mayhem fit nicely within the context fostered by character ryan reynolds is the guy he delivered much much better performance than in selfless morena baccarin played vanessa girlfriend and when i say shes girlfriend i mean she is girlfriend if youve seen the movie you know what i mean let me mention that soundtrack plays a somewhat important role loves good music  producers picked good hits which contribute to milieu wham if youre in for some non sensible crude humor and brutal violence youll surely have fun just dont forget not to bring your kids with you witness the beginning of a happy ending,comedy
not for the weak of heart and definitely not for the sound of mind this movie is basically the ultimate combination of humor and violence that every movie should bemost people who dislike this movie have a more tamed sense of humor but thats okay leave it to people like me to enjoy it every now and then we get tired of these conservative movies stays true to its comic roots its a great treat of ardent marvelfans i would urge some of the negative reviewers to reconsider however to new fans read the comic books before you watch this movie youll understand the humor much better to appreciate the movie,comedy
if you did not like or enjoy this movie then it is quite clear that you went to the movie not knowing who is not having researched the character at all or you did not see any of the advertisements for the movie character is a merc with a mouth which means he is going to curse and say sarcastic things at every turn it would be like going to see the punisher in theaters and being upset that he maimed people or seeing spiderman and saying it was boring because all he did was shoot webs the character is who the character is if you do not like the character you will not like the movie my suggestion is to research your superhero characters before seeing the movie so you know what to expect ryan reynolds perfectly portrayed the from the comics video games and cartoons,comedy
there are some seriously seriously boring people in the world if you didnt find this film fun id hate to think what your lives are like or what type of films you would consider good if you thought this was that bad i personally thought the cinematography and effects were amazing as well as the acting especially ryan reynolds the humour was also brilliant  maybe it was a bit childish in parts but i am 50 years old and laughed my ass off at the cinema ok there was sex scenes and offensive language that might of offended some but surely the majority of people for this was exactly how it was meant to be taken fun you dont get an 87 on imdb for nothing to the haters get a grip get a life is very short,comedy
i went to watch this at the movies for my husbands birthday and it was hilarious the movie theater was full but everyone respected the film and was quiet except when you couldnt help but laugh i had never really heard of before the movie so i cant comment on the movie compared to the comics but i hope there are more movies to come ryan reynolds owned the character and im glad he was able to leave the green suit behind definitely dont take the kids or watch with your parents i cant really remember ever being bored and thinking the film was too long or too short so thats also a plus i would probably buy this and watch when im bored,comedy
my teenage son encouraged me to watch  theoretically an r rated love story wow what a different kind of film selfdeprecating witty different funny all these apply to i guess you could loosely call it a love story there are some sex scenes and lots lots of blood and violence the story constantly pokes fun at marvel ryan previous flics future films but mostly continually at itself this selfhumorous approach roughly similar to antman hits the mark is a pretty cool innovative story ryan plays the role of wade who eventually becomes the story pokes fun at him over and over especially around his love for sex and his lover the editor had a ball with stop action film sequences where stops to tell us what is going to happen pulling himself out of the scene then diving back in it worksthe movie does slow down a bit in the middle  it was impossible to keep up the nonstop level of witty repartee that introduces the film starting with the introductory credits  just watch  youll understandthe end was somewhat predictable good guy against bad guy there also is the tiein with xmen so i expect that will continue i understand theres already a 2 en route so buckle up for more funi loved and you will too if you dont mind the bloodviolence enjoy,comedy
i went for this movie with high expectations after watching the trailers and the mini trailers plus the trust in ryan reynolds well the movie opened with title credits which is very new to me and was very much impressive then continues with an amazing stunt which was totally good well then i thought wow marvel is not going to follow their typical chick flick superhuman movies story revolves around a navy returned wade wilson who works as a mercenary in new york city he founds his love interest from a bar and started to live peacefully but fate struck him in the form of cancer an agent approaches him to recruit for his secret organization that will give mutant abilities and he accepts the offer but during the process he was disfigured and he calls himself as and takes the revenge on the organization forms the crux of the story dialogues action sequences comedy one liner punches scenes background score ryan reynolds of course with an ensemble cast are the positives of the movie a wonderful entertainer which is not to be missed in theater without much negatives all in whole a wonderful movie and i will go out with 9 on 10,comedy
ok i dont want to spoil this or talk it up to much but just go see this movie its fantastic this movie had me smiling nearly the whole time everything about this movie was just awesome this movie is just fun from start to finish and the team that finally got it made have done something really special and fox wow this has just come along with such a tiny budget compared to the other movies in the genre and blown them all out of the water anyway this movie delivers on everything it promises just go see it if you dont like it get the hospital and get them to take the stick out of your bhole is just so much fun,comedy
this has been among the most hyped movies to have hit the screen recently the trailers and commercials were very indicative of a hilariously rendered action flick and for the most part it delivers its different wacky and cheeky in that it is very conscious of itself as a superhero movie and it exercises this to the fullest the story and villain however are disappointingly mundane the central performance by ryan reynolds is perfect he effortlessly captures the essence of portraying him with the requisite quirk and gleeful abandon the music is another entertaining aspect of the movie and complements the adjoining scenes wonderfully the movie is funny right at the getgo the opening credits was definitely the funniest and most innovative introduction to a movie and is sure to have everyone in splitsthe beginning of this movie is about the only time its able to be consistently funny starting with the opening credits and the car chaseshooting sequence post the first 20 minutes however things take a turn for a worse in these poor transitions to past which act as a sudden mellow to the intensity of the opening action scene were then subjected to the quintessential romance that i felt was largely unsatisfying for as much as the movie detests conformism and clich it was unable to do anything new with its half baked romance in the entirety of its runtime the story hardly progresses in the first half because it only orchestrates a lot of catching up on the part of the viewer the origin story was already quite clear from the amazing trailers and so it oddly felt like a retread also the trailers featured almost all the funniest lines in the movie so there impact in the movie itself was alarmingly shallow what with the absence of any more funny scenes with the exception of a couple in the latter half of the film the action too was quite standard with no real off the chart sequences barring possibly the initial scene the story as i already stated was conventional comic bookesque fare in the second half the film picks up since it focuses on the present and does not waste anymore time on the ramblings of the past the humour once again finds its place and the action hits the crescendo all to once again collapse to a lacklustre climax the villain lest i forget seemed more akin to being the secondincommand to a villain and was hardly menacing one last aspect id like to dwell upon is the character development its safe to say that this movie has very little to no character development at all there is also little to no back story for the two funny but disappointingly inconsequential xmen in the film love interest too is hardly explored so all in all this movie has a great wisecracking comedian in for i wouldnt call him a hero there are a plethora of ingeniously funny scenes betrayed only by there revelation in the trailers themselves the story is dull and generic something that the movie claims so hard to detest the villain and the romance are half baked so thats what this is a comedy with action to complement if youre looking for plot character development arcs romance or even an immediacy or urgency of knowing something is at stake that youre familiar with in other comic book movies youll find yourself disappointed its apparent that it is receiving a lot of love from viewers which most likely is driven by the insane amount of hype created by the trailers to the movie for if we were to keep the laugh riot aside it would be quite apparent that its current rating of 87 on imdb is exaggerated go in with lower expectations and youll definitely be entertained if nothing else,comedy
the first reaction watching this movie from quite early on is where did they get the movie to make it is a niche movie it is for aging super hero fans who like their violence and their geekie references it cant by definition for everyone if you are a in the targeted audience then its really fun the jokes work the violence is enjoyable and ryan reynolds delivers you can tell hes passionateit is not a great movie either you can feel some budget constraints  honestly the villains arent that bad i was however giggling the whole way and liked this fresh at least on the silver screen take on marvel recommended,comedy
i write this review as a hardcore fan of having read a  ridiculous amount of stories involved with this character i have  waited years for this movie to be made and leading up to the entire  production of this film i always pictured ryan reynolds as i  was not wrong in believing he can pull it off at this moment i believe  that he is the only person who can play this character looking passed  the amazing casting of the title character i believe this movie was  faithful to fans and funny enough for the newcomers this was clearly a  testing the waters project for 20th century fox the lack of budget i  believe held back a truly motivated group of people who wanted to push  the limits and basically hit the line that cannot be crossed the  dreaded r rating they have put together a film that essentially has  almost no plot but gives a look at the origin of a character that  people may not have heard of as a fan of the comics i know that the  story is not exactly canon to the comics but as a fan of i  know that nothing is ever clear in any story hes involved with this  movie feels like a collection of 4 comics put together in a soft cover  book the story starts and ends just like any story you would  read loved it but maybe i have a conflict of interest because of the  history i have with the character either way i think anyone can find  some humor with this movie unless youre a complete hard ass if so  stay home and read the bible cause this movie will make you question  where the human race spends its time thinking,comedy
like many other people who read misadventures on a monthly basis this film had a lot to live up to to make me happy getting the right blend of over the top violence and gore crude jokes and 4th wall breaking references was never going to be easy but it has been achieved with great success the film is consistently funny from start to finish as long as you have the right level of maturity or arent prudishryan renyolds is perfect as the regeneratin degenerate delivering gags as fast the the bullets are coming from the various guns and dps wingman weasel is not short of wit either one of the best things here was colossus and negasonic teenage warhead appearance which gives not only more options for characters for to mock but also gives the movie the feeling of being a part of a bigger universe in the same way as the marvel studios movies doif there is one thing that i must criticise about this film its that sometimes the switch between the action to the origin flashbacks dont feel fluid leaving the audience wanting more of the action but instead just jumping back in time in what feels like the worst time this could be to highlight how disjointed wades mind is though so ill let it slide bring on the sequel 910 for pure entertainment i mean why else would you watch a film if not to be entertained,comedy
this is the very nicest movie ever i have waited for i had a great day watching it allthere was a continuous laughs all overthere was no boring scenes at alleven the ending was interesting i hated first watched green lantern and it was the baddest movie of him butttam now fan of him please go and and watch this moviebecause it is a must watch movie it was all house fullaction scenes are brilliant and also comedy is its meaningis going to endear a whole new audience to the vivid and weird character while once again demonstrating the tremendous opportunity for variety in the comic book movie genre keep going buddyhave a great box office,comedy
a former special forces operative turned mercenary is subjected to a rogue experiment that leaves him with accelerated healing powers adopting the alter ego deadpoolafter a brilliant marketing campaign that set some pretty high expectations the wait is finally over the timing of things is perfect especially with the superheroes overload we are getting lately im not complaining we like comic book movies theyre fun but even the most hard core comic book fan can tell you that right now we are oversaturated  some of them are really good and then we have the fantastic four i was blown away by this film i loved every minute of it coming from someone who didnt know much about character it surprised me in so many ways it sure as hell beats kickass and is many many cuts above green lantern this offshoot of the xmen series feels like a nasty child next to the shiny delegations of the mcu as represented by disneys avengers franchise and sonys notsoamazing spider man this wholesome reboot pulls off that postmodern trick of getting away with formulas and clichs simply by pointing them out knows what world its in and since it exists within this world the movie is fully aware of it selfaware in every way and selfreferential it completely breaks the fourth wall with its main character looking at the audience and stating something that we are already thinking about in today state of comic book films this is beautiful lets talk about this as its easy  especially nowadays  to watch a comic book film and just go like omg theres so much action and cool stuff him punching things really hard i loved it thats not what i loved the most about its the script the script is extremely funny its a smart structure one that really sidesteps the major issue with origin stories the suited up main attraction being mostly absent for the first hour or so plus wolverine or superman require something interesting to do  for the most part  but what is up to here is less important than the fuss he makes about it and the film still is quite entertaining a fight a kidnapping a rescue attempt and roll credits for years hollywood hasnt known what to do with this sexiest man alive and his caustic charm at least in this film they new exactly how to use ryan reynolds an actor whose smooth leading good looking man roles have long disguised one of the sharpest funnyman in the business as fans of the proposal definitely maybe and just friends attest here he truly has his role of a lifetime with his mad energy fuelling the film and his likable almost clooneyesque goofiness its not the kind of star profile that immediately screams blockbuster and reynolds first appearance as in xmen origins wolverine 2009 offered sadly little hint of what he could do with the role indeed this film function as a star vehicle for him demolishing his physical beauty  a small price to pay when an actors tongue is this gloriously sharp though even with a face thats been horrifically shattered into what his friend likens to the offspring of an avocado that had sex with an older avocado ryan reynolds and his character are a blast of laughing giving all these selfreferential potty talk a delirious comic momentum hes at his best as nailing snappy jokes and slaying one liners weirdly similar to his cousin robert downey jrs iron man but with more sugar in the mix reynolds genuinely is fun and he seems to enjoy giving the chance to his chimichangaloving hero the main stage he deserves his love story with vanessa starring morena baccarin doesnt appear like a plot devices at all they have good chemistry that sells the love story even more they feel like a real couple who really enjoys each other though ed skrein does a far better imitation of jason statham as this british badass than he managed in the transporter refueled he doesnt look or sound like a proper villain he looks more like the villain henchman in fact that british villain joke in the opening titles is misleading the brit in question   more on my blog,comedy
now im going to be honest i didnt know what to think going in to this movie and so i didnt really have high hopes and holy hell did this movie amaze meright from the opening credits you get an immediate idea of the humour in this movie and it is hilarious whether its the crude humour the sexual innuendos the 4th wall breaks or the puns aimed at reynolds previous movies it was hilarious reynolds perfectly portrayed the character of and i am so happy they gave him a second chance because he is the perfect choicei cant really find any negatives to this movie except maybe the simple plot and the bland villain but then i would say that it was just so we could focus on so in my opinion a good choiceoverall this not just a great superhero movie but a great movie and with the huge amount of superhero movies being released this year has set the bar high and all the others will have hard work to do to follow it up 910 awesome,comedy
memorable movie its so different from all the other superheroes movies its funny dirty sexy savage mad sad and so on ryan reynolds made the movie of his life i never seen him like this before although i saw him in some comedies every character in the movie is well placed and have the role good defined i hope in the sequel the keep this salt and piper line he alongside the screenwriters and director made avery good job i cant wait for the sequel enjoy,comedy
is a marvel film that steps outside the box a tad they go for an edgier film this time around that breaks the fourth wall has a good bit of gore which many marvel films lack and is more humorous personally i feel the formula worked well is an enjoyable films with a ton of laughs and some good actionthe film follows wade a sarcastic mercenary with little to care for in the world he falls for a prostitute vanessa and the two fall head over heels for each other wade however is diagnosed with terminal cancer and in desperation leaves vanessa for an experimental medical facility that turns ordinary people into mutants a la xmen the goons who run the facility however are sadistic and wish to turn their patients into mindless drones for hire wade is scarred from the procedure and seeks revenge on the facility manager francis and his goons for what they have done he also looks to get back vanessa even though he looks a bit like a hamburger pattystory is pretty bogstandard superhero stuff and has little to offer it felt generic enough as many marvel films do in my opinion however the romance between wade and vanessa was genuinely interesting both played rough but fair characters with a lot in common and the banter between the two was sweet and fun ryan reynolds as is also a great fit he plays the part like he was born to do so the films itself is quite funny with tons of fourth wall breaking winks small jabs at the entertainment industry selfreferential humour and the like reynolds even makes jokes about himself their were a lot of funny popculture references as well although these will surely be dated by the time next year hitsthe action in the film was quite good as well as it is in marvels films lots of fancy explosions good fights and so on abound two xmen make appearances as well and it was great to see marvel taking on a few  hopefully they will retain control for a marvel led xmen film in the future small complaint about the cgi however their were some parts with excellent cgi but some very poor ones as well the establishing shot of the aircraft carrier under construction in the final act is especially poor and jarring enough to bring me out of the film a few of these issues exist but the cgi in much of the action scenes holds up well enoughall in all a really fun and enjoyable marvel film i do enjoy the more humorous marvel films this guardians etc as it adds an extra layer of entertainment beyond the bogstandard superhero film played to death almost in modern times reynolds was great as were most of the side actors the action was cool and fun aside from a weaker story and some shaky cgi this film really holds its own i look forward to more of this from marvel and this film can be easily recommended for superhero fans action film junkies and those into dark comedies 810,comedy
when watching the trailer for i expected it to be about a wisecracking and crass superhero with a penchant for showing off his taut body in a red spandex outfit my expectation was proved true when i watched it i just never expected it to be filled with dollops of crude humourthe film actually has a soft spot even though its littered with profanities and action scenes that would make arnold schwarzenegger go green with envyon the surface its about a superhero whose face is so scarred that people in the streets avoid walking near him deep down however its about whether his girlfriend can look him in the eye and accept him for who he isryan reynolds doesnt have a good track record playing superheroes his green lantern 2011 quickly faded into oblivion he however takes a different tack with using his motormouth instead of his dashing handsomeness to portray his characters quirks and insecuritiesread more at wwwabigsparkblogspotcom,comedy
i suspect before becoming a soldier and a mercenary wade wilson must had tried very hard to become a stand up comedian for teenagers with no successit is painfully obvious that our hero desperately tries to do stand up comedy during the whole film while fighting while working while having sex while being tortured etc etc he is even talking to invisible people  i guess he is fantasizing he has an audience the poor bastard sometimes he does manage to make good jokes but most of the times his nonstop comedic delirium is falling flat soon you wish his mutation will extend to his vocal cords and you will be spared with a few minutes without juvenile jokes aboutwell everything in vain the wannabecomedian torture continues till the end4 stars for the scene where ajax gags him i literally cheered,comedy
is definitely a one of a kind movie a mash up of super hero raunchy comedy and extreme violence which is why many fans love the movie and character so much nobody couldve played the merc with a mouth like ryan reynolds his charm attitude and sarcasm kept the whole film alive and not to mention the rest of the cast played their parts beautifully the story played and unfolded well too although the film was well adapted it seemed to be missing a lot of action i know its and hes funny and what not but they couldve exchanged a few scenes for a little more action overall a good film just overhyped 34,comedy
like so many of todays action movies millions of dollars are spent on cgi explosions people beating each other up and highly realistic renditions of bullets and swords ripping apart human flesh and bone if these are the kinds of movies you like you might like since there is plenty of that going on many hollywood movies today also have a highly simplistic moral plot which boils down to getting the audience to sympathize with good people hurting bad people in horrific ways because the bad people hurt the good people first in equally horrific ways essentially it is all about justified violence and hatred or an eye for an eye if you will beneath this simplistic moralism the writers usually try to throw in a love story to make you feel good about killing all those bad people because there is romance going on in this sense is exactly like every other big budget action movie coming out of hollywood these days especially the marvel comic variety  endless fights brutal killings nonstop explosions and car crashes all done in hyperrealistic fashion with the audience rooting to kill the evildoerswhere differs somewhat from this formula is that it seems more like it was written by the cast of mad magazine with more clever if still childish jokes that do make you laugh more than a few times in fact virtually every line delivered in this movie is either a hypersarcastic joke or a clever put down while often funny the dialog is too contrived for me and polished to give it any soul or sense of believability despite the many laughsyou can probably tell that i am not a big fan of these kinds of action movies and that is true many people will probably like this movie but i found it totally formulaic and it seemed like the writers were trying too hard on top of that too much cgi and too little soul still it was a fun movie to watch even if i kept rolling my eyes throughout most of the movie,comedy
ill admit im not a fan with only passing knowledge of the character so my rating is just based on the movie experience overallwarning  may contain spoilersthe opening sequence sets the tone for the film its well executed action and cgi with lots of graphic violence sex and crude slapstick humour it doesnt take itself seriously from the get go and neither should you the comedy is often forced and lines fall flat as there is no comedic timing the story line is predictable and hohum the acting leaves much on the table i love ryan reynolds in romcoms and he speaks to audience directly about this in a self depreciating way but i just dont find his portrayal of a mentally unbalanced anti hero believable i expected the character to be darker edgierjust a little bit dangerous and unpredictable but with a quirky likability a tall order for someone who is out of his usual genre more like jim carreys green alter ego from the mask with a bit of cranston from breaking bad these short comings are markedly evident when minor characters are able to steal scenes such as the cabbie dopinder the recruiter and the blind althe film gets a solid 5 for bringing it to fruition despite many odds and obstacles in production it gets a 1 for cgi for a total rating of 6its not a flick for chicks or children i saw many kids in the theater  wildly inappropriate otherwise its good entertainment for fans who are already looking forward to round 2,comedy
repulsive violence paired with juvenile humor we switched it off after the first scene the fact that this movie is so popular is disturbing,comedy
i think didnt choose what sort of film it would like to be it lacks enthusiasm and sounds moree like a tv series allowing me to cut in between and watch it the next day 4 weeks in a row in box office weekend rates made me expect greatness the love story that faced unreal problems the nonscary hunting process the never happening sacrifices he made the characters who lacked identities  and so on was lame i could say it was a from a high school kids imagination who is looking for the love of his life the story says after he had accelerated healing power he decided to hunt who man who destroyed his life healing power was not over whelming and simply hunting the man who made me look like the worst thing on earth wasnt a great idea after all it was a successful business a for the talent of ryan reynolds and his sense of humor,comedy
i am definitely late on this movie but i was blessed to get to see it last night i must say that i was impressed the movie was cleverly written and it also brought some things to the comedy genre that i had never seen before for example the opening credits had a fun twist it is good to see something different in the comedy genre instead of the same old techniques that we see in your everyday comedy movie along side the comedy manages to tell an interesting story which is not common among comedy movies it was also exciting to watch especially during the fighting sequences which were greatly choreographed and easy to follow the final fight was really exciting and i enjoyed watching it one thing that bugged me was that a lot of the best jokes could be seen in the trailer i think i would have enjoyed the movie more if i had not seen some of the jokes that were played in the movie already in the trailer however i laughed at them the first time i saw them in the trailer so still a success basically when making a comedy movie you have to put some jokes in the trailer to show it is a comedy so i cant complain too much overall was a success and i am excited to see what else the franchise could have in store,comedy
so i went to the movies with a group of friends one of them had already seen the movie and had ranted and raved about how good this movie is and how i just had to see it when i got to this movie i was pretty excited since so many people had given this movie good reviews as the movie started i had already knew it was not going to be as good as everyone had hyped it up to be the movie to me was suppose to be about a man overcoming a tragedy when in reality the movie was about a man getting revenge on a guy that cured himmade him look terrible with a lot of flashbacks in between on the killing and the immense amount of blood scenes also i was expecting this movie to be funny and to make me laugh a lot i will admit i chuckled a few times but not to the point where i was falling out of my seat laughing overall i was extremely disappointed in this movie,comedy
being a comic book fan i loved it had wit thrills gore and was extremely entertaining thru out well recommendedgo with an open mind and am sure you will enjoyit has quiet a few action packed scenes it has quiet a few moments when you will be unable to stop your self from having a chucklebut most of all stay till all the credits have been show there maybe something extra you might miss out on enjoyand dont forget your popcorngeordieguy,comedy
if this movie passes for good or great entertainment the human race is doomed it does have some humor but zero creativity or imaginationi am yet agian wanting the time back that i spent watching g this garbage,comedy
hello i saw this film because i like the comedy films this film has a good rate in my opinion i vote 2 because the film is very bad 0 laugh for me too much insults male chauvinism if u laugh with insults vulgarities rudeness this is your film good luck if you see the film for the rate loose of time only has a little bit good special effects and the protagonists have a very pretty body this is not sufficient for me i hope or you not too if you want get revenge for one spoiler or something say himher that is very good film that you laugh all time with itregards,comedy
ryan reynolds is wade wilson a former special forces guy who transforms into a superhero who names himself this is a very different comic book adventure with numerous inside jokes including a couple of shots of a people magazine cover with reynolds pictured as the sexiest man alive the language and a brief sex scene give the film an r rating and the cgi is as good as expected reynolds and love interest vanessamorena baccarin have good chemistry and the villains especially ajaxed skrein are excellent a good story line and great casting including leslie uggams as an old eccentric blind woman make a solid 810,comedy
unlike some i go to the movies with an open mind and do not let others sway me by their opinions i enjoyed this movie enormously because of the sticking to the comics originals so to speak some of the critics fail to grasp the merc with a mouth conceptpro humor crazy things wade wilson at his best no pc nonsense in here excellent script perfect actingi could go on about the pros but you get the point a great must see movie dont let the dc fanboys influence you in any way and make up your own mind some people are complaining about the explicit material in the movie but you see more of that on a regular 24hours of tv than those couple scenes you get in the movie critics stop being so puritanical and come of your high horse ,comedy
there are always a ton of super hero movies that have been made and are in the makingbut ive always watched these super hero movies and hit a certain nerve in me in the most positive waycomic book movies seem to be all about franchises nowadays building a universe setting up sequels setting up spinoffs setting up everything  and often forgetting to be a movie on their own like what arguably happened with avengers age of ultron and even more shockingly happened with batman vs superman dawn of justicei would not be not surprised if is going to head straight into that circus of brands and formulaic nothingness because at this point its clear how successful this movie was but i can hope for something better because this movie was actually really fun to watchthis film is almost like a parody of superhero films which is what the comics were a parody of superhero comics it is not only self aware but painfully aware of the whole superhero movie business too expect some jokes about that in our main characters often say what the audience is thinking the fourth wall gets broken and sometimes the movie feels like its more of a weird mind game than a movie and that is what makes this so much more special and original among all of these same formulated superhero filmswhile doesnt take many things seriously and it sure enough is not a serious movie it still seems to take itself seriously in what its trying to do and somehow it works rrated violence strong language weird sense of humor and this lack of restraint of course helps but there is a real heart to this movie that isnt defined by any of these things perhaps its the source material and the respect director miller writers reesewernick and actorproducer reynolds pay to it perhaps its the fact they wanted to make a movie not just something for brand recognition all i can say is that in a crazy movie like this i dont expect go see any heartfelt naturally emotional moments but i did this movie has a heartreynolds is very entertaining as the main character and right now i cant see anyone else pulling it off well done morena baccarin is good and special mention goes to brianna hildebrand i had fun with her playing her role straight in a movie like this actors do a fine job and even the cgi colossus didnt bother me too muchone hour and a half went by quickly and i got my moneys worth a simple tight story that has fun with itself and the current state of superhero movies not once did i feel like there was a message being pounded to my head and not once did i feel like i have to suffer formulaic boredom in the name of cinematic universes no cities get demolished in this movie i missed that not all comic book movies need to have the same threats same boring 200 million dollar visuals of cities crumbling the ending felt very fitting too and overall i had a very good time in the theateris a weird example of how less is more and how at the same time daring to cross formulaic boundaries can be rewarding,comedy
is a slightly better than average superhero movie but thats it it has a lot of weaknesses here are some of them1 if youve seen the trailers youve seen the movie 2 the storyline is bog standard the writersdirector try to mix it up through an unusually and unnecessarily complex flashback structure that feels like a failed magic trick 3 all the characters are underdeveloped including wade wilson whilst there seem to be a lot of scenes dealing with character development we are nonetheless left with very superficial simplistic and clichd motivations 4 its got tons of jokes but only a few are actually funny at the chuckle level only 5 its filled with violent action but none of it is particularly creative see a tarantino film nor does the violence carry any real emotional impact see tarantino netflix daredevil  jessica jones or even kickass 6 its got plenty of nudity and a little sex but it feels gratuitous 7 it breaks the fourth wall but its for no reason the way it breaks it doesnt actually draw us into the movie nor does it give us a deeper understanding of himself at best its used as just another chuckle level joke at worst it takes the place of the laziest expositional voiceover 8 limited sets and settings make the movie feel a bit cheap you can see where the bulk of the limited   60 million budget was spent initial freeway fight and where they cut corners just about everywhere else on the plus side 1 whilst the story is standard its paced well the action jokes swearingnudity etc are all seamlessly orchestrated it never feels flat until you leave the theater 2 ryan reynolds does a great job carrying the energy and the pace of the movie his acting is fine but its his enthusiasm and alignment with this version of that is the foundation of the picture 3 the opening action sequence is excellent well envisaged and choreographed the film starts with a bang and the energy of that bang carries you through most of the filmim not familiar with the comic book version of but based on what ive read leading up to the release of the film he does sound like a cool character he does feel as though he could form the basis for a smart selfaware complex and edgy superhero movie unfortunately this is not that film,comedy
last year i said i hated avengers age of ultron because it was just throwing oneliners at the audience and yes was one one liner after another but is different it has substance where avengers doesnt it has a character weve been waiting for so many years the movie is hilarious basically the audience got to laugh almost all the time i think its almost useless to say that was funny because we have been able to see that from the trailers and the marketing of this film alonethe story was good it was very similar to xmen origins wolverine to be honest wilson gets new powers through experimentation he agreed to but which turned out to go not as smoothly as previously thought and then he hunts down the people who did that to him  and of course theres romance but does that story way better than xmen origins wolverine mostly because it doesnt ruin any characters and other story lines while doing so quite the opposite introduces old familiar characters colossus and some really cool new characters negasonic teenage warhead and doesnt ruin them and in colossus has the right accent because i dont remember him having any accents in the other movies we saw him did he even talk in those i doubt itthe action scenes were alright but the thing is in superhero movies  especially anything related to xmen  i kind of hope to see a lot of different mutant powers during those fights like sure we might not know who those people are but the powers are cool well here we had like two villain mutates and both had pretty boring skills of course negasonic teenage warhead  whom i am in love with  pretty much made up for everything elsei love the soundtrack of this movie thankfully its on spotifyis kind of like one of those new wave superhero stuff like kickass incredibly violent and filled with twisted jokes however comparing to anything else than a superhero movie its just decent and of course i have to compare it to my favourite action movie compared to which is only okay was everything i wanted it to be  it was funny in a lot of different ways it had enjoyable battle scenes and cool characters it might not be the best action movie there is but it definitely beats every avenger movie there is its kind of like one of those new wave superhero stuff like kickass incredibly violent and filled with twisted jokes is worth your money because ever comic book geek is going to love it,comedy
watching made childs play out of every tony stark exploit there ever was the lascivious transformation of wade wilson into was intertwined with flashback scenes from wades past romances encounters with civilian lowlife and rouge organized crime organizations were all prey for nonchalant wrath knives swords and a repertoire of martial arts moves would present the ingredients of a quintessential hero ordinarily nave style was a mixture of aggression romantic confidence slapstick and koi quickwittedness not only his fists and flying kicks but also his jeering patois fended off enemies who had disturbed the hero and his girlfriend,comedy
finally i had the time to see last night and it was far from what one could define as a great movie or even a great superhero movie at that it wasnt a bad film but it did not impress me in anything beyond the action choreography and the overall designformation of the wade wilsoncharacterwilson as a character was relatively welldeveloped and he did have a somewhat entertaining sense of humor but that said i only remember giggling maybe about 5 or 6 times at any of the intended humor that was presented before the audience coming from wade or otherwise and only about twice do i remember actually laughing he kept beating a dead horse with the infinite sex jokes and eventually they grew tiringbut i would also like to add that the design of the cinematic costume was very thoroughlydone and that i appreciated it was through and through and that is failing to mention that it looked gorgeous onscreen in action sequences or otherwise oh but i would like to add that colossus and warhead were kind of just there and added nothing of real interest to the filmthe story and antagonists that came with were both i dare say weak there were definitely a few heaviermore satisfying moments in regards to the plot wade being diagnosed with terminal cancer and the emotional impact that left on himself and his friends which included his love interest but the storyline was bland and uninteresting in general wilson is diagnosed with supposedly incurable cancer ajax promises that he will cure him ajax mutates him during the operation which leaves him hideous and looking like freddy krueger and a topographical map of utah wilson despises ajax for what he has done to his facebody and decides to hunt him down in an act of revenge believe me this plot does not come remotely close to being executed as how it is read in other words it sounds more intriguing when you read the synopsis but ultimately it is poorly executed infilm and with that comes ajax the primary antagonist and his lackeys which can all be described identically as the plot boring and unoriginal in other recent superhero films the antagonists have successfully stolen the show for me and i always endup disappointed when they receive less screen time than i initially anticipated but with they possess zero intriguing qualities that only intensify the bland mood of the already underwhelming plot actionfightingwise all i can say is that it was very pleasing and rightfully gorydisgusting not much else to say save for the fact that the actionbased scenes were generally fun to watchshould i give it a score i think a 6510 is appropriate not a bad superhero film but it has its fair share of flaws these include oversaturation of sexual jokes failing to make me laugh throughout and boring sidecharactersantagonists coming with a storyline as flat as the state of nebraska,comedy
like guardians of the galaxy and the two avengers movies before it shows a worrying amount of smugness its own selfamusement only equalled by its disregard for the intelligence of the audience theres not a single one of the instant reverse jokes in the avengers that even a very credulous small child wouldnt see coming and scatological humour aims for little higher than the lowest or broadest common denominator its a crowdpleaser and not awful but if fart jokes genital punching and a plot that resembles a 15yearolds masturbation fantasies arent your thing you may find it all a little wearying the gags are predictable and relentless which in fairness is kind of the point for the merc with the mouth but doesnt make it any less tiresome in an age where scarcely any film lacks postmodernism constant fourth wall breaks seem almost pass while a reasonable conceit in and of itself theres nothing particularly intelligent done with it the fourth wall just used as another vessel for some masturbation gagsthe best jokes in the film  frequently commenting on why alist xmen dont appear  lose lustre when you realise its made by fox and so they could well have current voting on the imdb sees it just inside the top 50 alltime greatest films comfortably edging out citizen kane m rashomon and taxi driverplotwise then a thug also being the brains behind the bad guys operation lacks credulity though this is a film where stan lee urges prostitution so all bets are very much off,comedy
this is the best superhero film i have seen in a good while i am a bit partial though being a comic fan but even then i have not laughed my backside off that hard in a whilei will admit some of the scenes where a bit graphic for some especially the torture scenes but other than that it is actually the most accurately portrayed character in movie from comics possibly everto the people who nay say the film and have given it a low rating because of the swearing violence sexual content and fourth wall breakseven the ones who say it is un marvel like unless you are one of those people who signed the petition to make it a 15 plus movie and are on here just to slate it then shame on you i suggest you read his comics everything you see in this film is exactly what you get in his comics well makeup can only go so far to portray how messed up his body is in the books and how he got his name was through the in the facility not his bar i was surprised that here in the uk it was a 15 plus movie though due to the content as i know some of our 15 year olds are still too immature to see this so i suggest uk movie goers watch the movie first before you let them go see it themselves who knows you may enjoy it,comedy
from the studio that brought the xmen franchise comes a different type of superhero film that delivers with a bangwade wilson ryan reynolds is subjected to an experiment that destroys his face now he wants revenge while going by the altarego deadpoolryan reynolds is truly the creative force behind this film as he seems to pull off naturally and with a great sense of humor tim millers direction is also great as he mixes comic book aspects with raunchy comedy the rest of the cast does a very good job also and the inside jokes are very well craftedis a different type of comic book film that isnt afraid to be raunchy and adultrated and also exceeds as a actioncomedy 910,comedy
for years marvels anticonventional hero has been a huge following for comic book fans worldwide and for years as well it has taken so long to get a film adaptation made for the big screen though the character was featured in the weak xmen origins wolverine the appearance of him wasnt considered worth it as his appearance had been altered and wasnt given the proper character treatment to win over the fans finally after years of development hell ryan reynolds reprises in the way that sticks true to its source material and the results are worth the ticket price and time to watchi wont give away too much on plot details but it does play out as both an origin story and a revenge plot that breaks away from the traditional superhero movie it charts the beginning of as a wisecracking foulmouthed and really abstracted antihero showcasing how he had earned his powers and what made him become this figure i think the plot itself is great and it doesnt drag itself once in the film and best of all it doesnt take a whole movie to establish the main characters origin unlike a certain film from last year coughing fantastic fourin terms of acting there are solid performances throughout but the best of the bunch would definitely be reynolds as wade wilsonthis is possibly his best performance in film to date though i have watched reynolds in other great films such as the change up safe house the voices and even buried but this role in particular is often seen and considered a redeeming role as previously he had played the role of before in xmo wolverine and of course the cheesy but bad green lantern for dc his delivery on humour is present throughout and when things get slightly serious he does what he does best and lightens the moment the supporting cast handle themselves as well as reynolds with game of thrones actor ed skein comic relief tj miller the more tougher female than ronda rousey gina carano and the lovely morena baccarin giving their best to keep the storys characters great only minor negative to say was the films villain wasnt given enough polish as to show why he was bad though we are shown why hes a threat to and was just as powerful as he was but we arent given a true purpose villain that wants to dominate the world but thankfully skein does give his best throughout in both terms of acting and stunt workdirection is strong from first time director tim miller he keeps the film moving along in a decent pace thats not rushed and the production value set for the film is quality assured as costume design visual effects and make up are all worthwhile and its script is pretty polished throughout with humour exciting action setpieces and the best 4th wall breaks meta humour ive seen in years the knocks at both wolverine gl and even the trouble to get a movie made are hilarious in particular overall is a blast of a movie that packs action comedy and superhero clichs into one and even pokes fun of not only itself but breaks the 4th wall in wonderful ways only a fault with its villain in terms of character development will leave you leaving the cinema in the most awesome way possible and stick around after the credits for a cool surprise,comedy
yeah yeah i know i have a 1010 most of it is me being a fan but this movie is really and i mean really good just from the opening scene i was hooked to this movie great action scenes and great comedy and on top of that great violence this movie really did deserve a rrating if you are a fan of comics or just a person who is looking for a kickass movie going experience then this is for you there is so much stuff to love i mean hey its what is not to love so parents keep your kids away from this one and have you a night out most to some it up yes this movie is good but it will not be for everyone if you are easily offended then go see norm of the north or something but if you want to have a great time well look no further,comedy
for 10 long years fans have been anticipating the possibility of seeing one of the fan favorite on the big screen there were even times when it seemed like there wouldnt ever bee a movie xmen origins wolverine however our prayers have finally been answered with the arrival of this near perfect movie lets start with himself in origins the couple of scenes that actually featured ryan reynolds playing the wisecracking not the taped mouthed crap showed that there was definitely potential for the character now we finally get to see him in all of his glory and ryan reynolds does an absolute fantastic job of making that happen everything about from his voice to his reactions and especially his jokes makes it feel like him and reynolds are one in the same this is honestly the best casting of a superhero since robert downey jr as iron man also receives a great supporting cast with colossus and negasonic teenage warhead being particular standouts the scenes with these two are honestly some of the funniest and also poke fun at the xmen franchise in the best way possible i dont care what others might say but ajax was a great villain early on he proved to be much more lethal than expected and honestly felt like a threat to the addition of angel dust was also a huge plus as her fight with colossus was very well done finally the best aspect of the movie the comedy there might have only been 10 minutes during the whole movie where i was not laughing pretty much every joke is spot on with perfect timing and better yet the jokes never felt overabundant  the 4th wall breaks were also very effective and well done i mean by now you must get the point is a hilarious movie for its budget production value and overall objective is literally the perfect movie it may not have all the flashyness of the other bigbudget superhero movies but it sure matches up to them it feels even better for the fans especially considering foxs last attempt at a superhero movie truly feels like a movie made by and for the fans and we the fans thank you,comedy
rating  out of 5 this film is recommended in brief ryan reynolds makes us care about this violent superhero and thats the better half of the fungrade bplot summary after a scientific experiment renders him disfigured but endowed with superhuman strength and powers wade wilson becomes an antihero who wants revenge jims review the marvel superhero factory unleashes another action figure from its assembly line of comic book personalities a hip but crazed vigilante who goes by the name coming from the second tier of players instead of its popular ateam of avengers this brand of superhero has some interesting traits unlike his predecessors besides loving to kick ass and destroy his foes this character lobs double entendres and curses to anyone in his vicinity beats everyone to the bloodiest of pulp hence the films adult rating and breaks down any walls in his way especially the fourth one with his pithy and snide asides to our moviegoing audiencethe plot is a typical revenge  action movie wade wilson a wonderfully charming ryan reynolds who uses his sex appeal most appealingly takes the form of our favorite mercenary ready to do battle with his maker francis freeman aka ajax a menacing ed skrein a sadistic scientist and his lovely igor named angel dust gina carano of course has help from a supporting group of friends that include his girlfriend vanessa a winning morcena baccarin loyal sidekick weasel a wisecracking tj miller and some other xmen crusaders colossus stefan kapicic and warhead brianna hildebrand the action is nonstop and so are the jokes which land most of the time foul mouth works overtime to entertain his adult followers between the blood spatter and it all surprisingly works excluding the over indulgence of too much slowmo and cgi effects frenetic editing and shaky handheld camerawork but the filmmakers never take the character or his plight so seriously as in other films of this ilk and are more obsessed with the dark humor aspects in their story credit goes to the screenwriters rhett reese and paul wernick with their zingy oneliners and director tim miller who gives the film the needed jolt of energy which allows this hero some distinctive qualities that other superheroes in the marvel universe lack primarily a underlying sadness that define the human character inside the superhuman but it is mr reynolds who contributes the most to the films success the role fits him like a suit his anticharm is the real thing and the actor uses his physical presence to the nth degree frontal nude scene notwithstanding is far from dead this avenger has legs and muscle with just the right amount of appeal the movie will make a killing at the box office with a sequel on its way as we speak so fans of this comic book genre and many new devotees can enjoy the start of a beautiful friendship with a new adult action hero and all of his profanity and insightsvisit my blog at wwwdearmoviegoercomany comments please contact me at jadepietrorcncom,comedy
perfect casting choice for and a perfect comic book adaptation ryan reynolds was incredible as and this is his role we rarely see this but it happens belongs to ryan reynolds weve seen this a few times where an actor becomes a role with robert downey jnr hugh jackman and now ryan reynolds this film was everything i expected and more childish but hilarious jokes breaking the fourth wall also worked incredibly for this film the action sequences were fun and enjoyable the only thing i felt this lacked was a stronger villain which is why i have hesitated to give it a 10 other than that this is a brilliant film and i definitely recommend it,comedy
i have been following this movie intently since the test footage i loved the video game and ive read a decent percentage of the comics i knew ahead of time that this movie would be for me so i cant give a completely unbiased opinion i can say though as a fan of the character this movie was everything i wanted it to be it was just short of perfect but it is by far one of the most faithful adaptations of a comic book i have ever seenminor spoilers ahead our hero ryan reynolds is picked up in a cab by dopinder karan soni its christmas day for and hes more than a little excited to dole out the presents death and destruction after fiddling around in the back seat he climbs through the glass barrier and sits up front he tells dopinder that hes going to deal with someone on his naughty list he sees the picture of a beautiful girl on the dash and dopinder tells him about her saying he cannot steal her away from another suitor gives him some advice and requests to be let out on a bridge instead of paying gives dopinder a high five and sits on the bridge guard rail it is here where we launch into the famous test footage of describing the plot launching into a monologue about him having his own movie and the events leading up to thisim going to keep the plot description short and ill start with the plot one of the criticisms of this movie is that it still sticks with the same old super hero plot i will admit that in the big picture sense the plot isnt as revolutionary as the rest of the movie its still about a guy getting revenge on his adversary while he chases the love that he lost but that criticism isnt accurate a lot of this movie is flashing back and forth between the present and the past and its not done in a way thats been seen before it keeps the movie from getting stale at any point not that it does and it keeps moving along at a quick pace it never really slows down and thats a compliment considering wades origin as a character is pretty dark at points another aspect that makes this movie special is that theres actually a decent romantic angle in a comic book movie ill talk more about the characters later but the movie spends enough time with wade and vanessa that you actually care about them staying together i was pretty wrapped up in it and its a credit to the creative team and the actors for making that possible this story that this movie has to tell is far from boring or being a retread even if it doesnt completely break the moldwhen it comes to the acting im going to have to echo what a lot of people have already said this is the role ryan reynolds was meant to play hes definitely had a scattershot career with comic book movies but if you check out his more indie geared movies he shows that hes a great actor he has the dramatic chops buried and chaos theory and hes always had the comedic touch waiting and just friends hes never really got his due is perfect for him and he deserves all the credit hes been getting for his success i really liked morena baccarin as vanessa she worked really well with ryan she was very funny in her own right and she made you care what happened to her character even though the villains werent the most indepth characters i thought ed skrein did a pretty good job he was a lot better in this than he was in the transporter refueled i really liked stefan kapicic vocal performance as colossus and briana hildebrand gave a good debut performance as negasonic teenage warhead of the main cast i felt bad for gina carano as angel dust her screen presence is pretty intimidating and her fight with colossus was pretty intense too but shes in another role where she gets almost no dialogue i get shes not classically trained as an actress but shes got a unique skill set shes good looking too and i would like to see her get a chance to expand her range i though jed rees and karan soni did good jobs in small parts tooyou cant talk about the movie without going into its harder aspects the movie features some well filmed dirty action scenes that were pretty impressive for tim miller as a first time director you also get some pretty filthy jokes which were hilarious it doesnt go to any extremes but it wasnt child friendly material it could be considered too crude for some people but its truly faithful to roots you cant fault an adaptation for sticking to the source material and i was killing myself laughing its one of the funniest comedies i have seen in years bar none they also show the character for what he is an  this is bold because were used to boy scouts waging war against evil they made the correct one staying faithful to the comics even says in the movie im the bad guy you get to hunt the worse guys is a riot and a quality action movie wrapped in one i loved it from start to finish it wasnt perfect the jokes dont land 100 more like 8090 and i wouldnt be able to recommend it to everyone i would describe it as this years kingsman the secret service it has good action scenes interesting characters truly funny jokes and an involving plot i left extremely happy as a fan and ill start counting the days till the next one,comedy
is marvels take on kill bill theres graphic violence close shots of deadly injuries and a quest for revenge its the tone that sets apart from your average action movie the guys nuts and we love him for itright from the opening credits you will regret skipping them its clear not just another superhero movie it could be argued its not a superhero movie at all isnt the first antihero marvels ever produced but hes certainly the first theyve put no filter on the shooting stabbing slashing and asskicking is balanced by his absolute determination not to give a f and ability to come up with a new sexual innuendo in every scene making the movie super entertaining maybe dont watch it with your inlaws though,comedy
this is the funniest superhero movie of all time the funniest of its own subgenre of a sub genre marvel comedies guardians antman and now this screamingly funny ryan reynolds couldnt have been a better a choice for well maybe if you dunked jim carrey into the fountain of youth he wouldve probably been able to blow everyone else away speaking of thats what this whole thing kind of reminded me of is the ace ventura of superheroes he wins any battle by being a total clown not only is a joker but this whole movie throws a pie at the superhero renaissance of this decade every clich and plot device gets their ass handed to them i would say it breaks the fourth wall but that would mean that there is a wall here to begin with and there is none winter is a dead zone for movies but this is worthy enough to be a summer blockbuster lets get a sequel going,comedy
has been a long time coming and some people were never sure if this movie would never happen now its here and it doesnt disappointif you go to this movie for a serious movie that has a high budget you will leave this movie slightly unhappy but i wasnt this movie does everything that it has to do with the character that it has and keeps you entertained the entire timecgi in this movie sometimes looks bad and can be easily spotted by anyone but it does not take away from this moviethe jokes are spot on not all of the time but it still keeps the movie going and the 4th wall is pretty much not a part of this movie each reference that makes nails everything that they need toalso make sure to stay after all of the credits for an end credits scene that keeps the tone of the entire moviethis movie is good for the people that have been fans of since the beginning and those who are new fans of this character1010,comedy
i made a profile on imdb just to review this movie this is what superhero movies should be like remember the first time you watched iron man 1 and you hadfun someone remembered that marvel movies were supposed to be fun not whatever political drama captain americas going on about these days the humor starts from the opening credits do not miss the opening credits and then makes fun of xmen superheroes in general movies himself marvel and all the other silly things that usually happen in action movies i was worried it would get to be too selfreferential but the pace was perfect and most every thing worked perfectlyif you want more interesting fun movies made go see it i still cant believe they made a movie like this,comedy
the story of a movie with a poor storyline which tries to be atypical using vulgarity crudeness and nudity to distract from how typical of a superhero movie it isits what youve been seeing for years but it has been disguised and repackaged through means including clever marketing shockfactor and being justdifferentenough to make money at the box office audiences must surely be beginning to tire of this movie genre and should not be fooled by the new wrapping and trimmings while a solid movie in itself is not the change that this genre needs but is different enough to entice mainstream audiences back if they can stand the inyourface overstylisation that has been relied upon to make this movie marketablethe humour not only are the forms of humour used in this film some of the lowest forms of humour but also they have the effect of detracting from the movies potential because they are overused to the point of being tedious and because they take away from movie time which could otherwise be spent developing a quality story and purposeful dialogue gratuitous nudity action and an overcommitment to being funny are not going to leave any lasting mark in the film industry audiences may view that this was memorable but this is likely only due to the shockfactor and should not be viewed as making this a fantastic movie as some fellow reviewers have remarkedinduced misconceptions audiences are sold a concept of a nonlinear alternative less idyllic and exciting perspective on the warnout superhero movie genre however that is a misnomer a misconception induced by the producers the director and clever marketing minds mainstream audiences are fooled into consuming the same old crap theyve been served for almost a decade now meanwhile the discerning few who see the character for what he truly is a conglomerate of many of the characters weve been spoonfed for years are lead to believe that the dialogue is sharp and the humour is witty also audiences are lead to believe that the use of metacinema techniques ie being aware that he is being watched is a new or original feature of this movieand makes this movie deserving of praise when in fact the humour and dialogue relies on shockfactor and being overemphasised in order to be effective and the fourth wall is only broken down for comedic relief its the equivalent to the annoying cutesysilly troupe that you are likely to find in a disney movie  ironically the very same troupe that movie is trying to distance itself from the audience can easily tire of this movies overthetop action and overreliance on lowbrow crude or vulgar content which is disguised as wit through methods such as having the character talk quickly or give dialogue at ridiculous times such as during a fight sequence,comedy
a superhero movie has never been funnier than or more outlandish  or obscene that should come as quite a relief to fans of marvel comics foulmouthed antihero and especially ryan reynolds who labored a long time to get his own solo adventure on the big screen a process that entailed  according to at least  fondling 20th century foxs prized asset whose name rhymes with pullverinereynolds and are truly the perfect actorcharacter marriage theyve long purported to be the showy insultdriven and vulgar humor of the part recalls the van wilder days that launched reynolds to stardom and even though audiences are familiar with his shtick theres a whole other degree of wit applied to make funny in an original way but would be nothing but a crass cult film if it werent for strong bones from rhett reese and paul wernicks script holding it together and giving the humor and the entire movie frankly purpose the zombieland duo builds a clever and engaging story structure that serves as both effective origin story and a big showcase for reynolds and the films panacheheavy approachfirsttime director tim miller succeeds with the flair which is saying something given how clear it is that the visual effects budget for this one isnt as high as it is for your typical superhero film but the film is a little bumpy and chaotic at times visually at least action however is not the films primary export so much as cartoonish gore and comedydriven sequencesyet the wit is where really exceeds expectation fourth wallbreaking humor and jokes about breaking the fourth wall is a hallmark of the rob liefeld and fabian nicieza comic and the script really uses this technique appropriately along with a litany of selfaware metahumor that will elicit chuckles from superhero movies fans from references to hugh jackman to jabs at reynolds previous superhero failures these jokes help keep the barrage of foul mouthed humor from feeling too grating though with any comedy that goes for the quantity approach it has noticeable misfiresyou should know if youre into movies like before you even set foot in a theater and if you are your expectations will likely be met if youre not as into the genre you still might be surprised either way youre likely to laugh harder than you ever have watching heroes in spandex and that includes kickass doesnt succeed in all phases but youll be surprised at the level of investment you feel in the story and the outcome thanks to the reese and wernick thats not an easy feat for a film that also knows it cant take itself too seriously either finds that balance just long enough to hold the viewer through its more than reasonable runtime and deliver an enjoyable rump sic at the moviessteven cthanks for reading visit movie muse reviews for more,comedy
its the first really good movie of 2016 and the perfect film to knock star wars out of the imax theaters an action comedy like no other though its not the first superhero movie to be given an r rating blade it does take the concept to a new level this is not a soft r rating its a hard r rating filled with everything i love vulgar humor gory action and unnecessary but always enjoined nudity disney will never give you a flick like this in their version of the marvel cinematic universe its a xxxmen event going on hereryan reynolds reprises his extended cameo from xmen origins wolverine as wade wilson an talkative mercenary diagnosed with terminal cancer who becomes a lab rat to get a cure that instead triggers his dormant mutant abilities to repair any part of his body that gets damaged but left his body looking like crapthe movie starts with a bang opening up with awesome crazy credits that make fun of superhero movie stereotypes the movie stars a hollywood asshat a hot chick a british villain and a cgi character and directed by a guy getting paid too much then goes into one of the most fast pace action sequences ive seen in a while and the whole time is shelling out some of the most hilarious one linersthe momentum never stops even when they do the flashbacks that tell wade wilsons origin story and the love story between him and vanessa the girl he has to save from the british villain and never uses her mutant abilities from the comic is so funny that i have to go back and see it again cause the audience was laughing so hard i missed a joke or two its so action packed with mindless bloody violence too you dont get to see stuff like this anymorei knew i would like this movie but i impressed with how much i loved it its everything you ever wanted from a starring superhero movie they pulled nothing backx gonna give it ya,comedy
even if you downright despise tim millers marvels rrated vulgar and violent superhero film you almost have to admire the lengths to which this film was marketed colorful and eclectic marketing campaigns which featured interactive theater standees a multitude of different posters and banners with tongueincheek lines bold and self referential television spots professional interviews with the cast in character and a release over valentines day weekend to further its lack of boundaries is among one of the best of the new decade in terms of getting people excited about what was predicted by many to be a tough film to marketthe fact of the matter is something like is what the marvel brand needs even amongst superhero fans the recent influx and marketsaturation of heroes getting their first origins story on film or sequels furthering another heros saga the genre is breeding familiarity and contempt at the same time ive spoken about this on a personal level many times superhero films often bear a pg13 rating for strong violence sporadic language and sexual innuendos meanwhile heres a film of the genre that earns its rrating like most judd apatow comedies do comparatively with all the fourletter words tossed around like sentence articles it would the events on saturday night at a city bar look worthy of a pg13 rating finally its bloody often winceinducing violence reminds us that even in the modern day superhero films arent nearly as rough and ugly as they could be the film is less marvels redheaded step child amongst superheroes than it is an unearthly oversized meteor that has just crashlanded in a multiplex near you demanding your money and attention for nearly two hours in return for some of the most cacophonous violence language and debauchery youre likely to see from a mainstream film all yearthe film revolves around wade wilson ryan reynolds a mercenary who now spends his days in new york city protecting teenage girls from stalkers and exboyfriends by working for a company that specializes in taunting and assaulting them wade winds up becoming romantically entangled with a prostitute named vanessa carlysle morena baccarin with plans to marry her until he is diagnosed with terminal cancer as a response he leaves vanessa and undergoes an underground procedure to kill his cancer only to be injected with a serum that leaves him horribly disfigured upon escaping from francis freemans ed skrein the man who has surgically altered him and his body wade learns that he now has the ability to rapidly heal as well as maneuver and contort his body in inhuman waysin effort to mask his horrid appearance wade squeezes his ass into red and black spandex attaches two machetes to his back protects himself with an endless supply of guns and ammo and becomes the violent and unpredictable he plans on taking out francis for ruining his physical appearance rescue his girlfriend from her captivity by francis and continue to assure both colossus stefan kapii and negasonic teenage warheads brianna hildebrand two individuals that are part of xmen that he doesnt need to join xmen in order to become a more competent proved superheroapproach to humor is much like that of dirty grandpas a film i saw about two weeks ago that has already faded from the minds of most consumers its a film that throws numerous lines jokes and concepts at a wall in order to see what sticks throughout the course of this film reynolds probably has a good onehundred and fifty lines rooted in jokes and while less than half produce a laugh they help articulate that this is a character none of us have really seen before unapologetic lack of political incorrectness is what makes him such a monumental albeit exhausting presence his unwillingness to cater to the tendencies of the mainstream or the ordinary are precisely why we watch superhero films in the first place its only recently that we along with the core themes of the films have lost sight of this in favor of quantity over qualitythe consistent pestering of by colossus and negasonic teenage warhead works to illustrate a nice metaphor of how inception onscreen came to be some studio executives probably wanted to neuter or clean up his attitude and story to make him a more marketable character rather than an outspoken anti hero perhaps make him a dark but not too dark xmen character that at least had some semblance of discipline through reynolds millers and screenwriters paul wernick and rhett reeses respect and loyalty to the character and his brand theyve created a film that will satisfy or at least entertain almost all who choose to see it while its humor is a bit infrequent its ability to entertain is quite prolific merging meaningful drama with raunchy comedy and gratuitous bloodshed to create the quentin tarantino of superhero films from the ground upmarvel needed a superhero that the wearying audience could look unto and smile and through the fourthwall breaking crude and careless unapologetically ruthless theyve crafted a hero that is worthy of your attention,comedy
wisecracking smartrse wade wilson exspecial forces and currently engaged in smalltime enforcement for pay falls in love with hooker vanessa and her with him shortly after this idyllic state of affairs begins wade is diagnosed with terminal cancer all is not lost however as he is offered a treatment which will not only cure his cancer but also kickstart his mutant gene giving him superpowers wade opts in not realising that the people doing this have nefarious intentions he is cured and enhanced but notveryhideously scarred how can he show his face to vanessa before he has got villain ajax to cure him so masked up and using the name deadpoolryan reynolds having played wilsonin xmen wolverine  origins has a second pass at the character this time somewhat outside the control of the xmen franchise although this movie is firmly within the xmen movie universe and this time they get the character right they get everything else right too including the fact that makes it very clear directly to the audience that he knows he is a character in a comic book moviethis film is very funny from the opening credits onwards it is also very violent very foulmouthed and fairly rude it is not a kids superhero movie  far from it wilson is not so much morally compromised as completely amoral from head to toe this is clear throughout but made explicit by his response to a speech from colossus which explains to him what makes a hero there is bags of superhero action mostly very well staged although it sometimes goes so fast that it can be a bit difficult to follow some of the slomo is therefore very welcome i think noncomic fans will enjoy it but for comic fans it is full of gags drawn from comics movies and reynolds own superhero screen careerits not without flaws  how come his mutationtreatment heals everything except his face  but it is hugely enjoyable and completely vindicates reynolds lengthy efforts to get it made im looking forward to the sequel greenlit a couple of days ago already,comedy
as i left the theater i told my wife you know is kind of like the muppets of comic booksuperhero movies it wasnt the wisest comparison maybe filthy fing bugs bunny is far more accurate but i digress in large part since the muppets are family entertainment with an edge that can appeal to adults and yet still be good fun for kids while is hardr action carnage with sometimes ok a good lot of the time lines that will make many many many teenagers laugh and some folks who get a few key references to things outside of this decade i think i was just responding to the total irreverence of the whole thing not to mention the constant breaking of the fourth wall  its not something completely groundbreaking on its own spiderman talks to the audience for example but here its aware of many of the faults that have come up on comic book and superhero movies including its own franchise for me one of the most cathartic moments of this or any recent movie is seeing a short but noticeable image of an action figure of from the 2009 wolverine movie which suckedwhy it did is for reasons outside of the not getting the character right thing though thats part of it but suffice it to say what director tim miller first timer impressive that and the writers previously of the also superselfconsciousmeta zombieland needed to do was to take the p out of the genre while also delivering a story that had some heart to it wait heart in a movie that has the merc with the mouth wade wilson the guy who goes through weaponxprogramstuff and comes out with the skin of inserttjmillerjokehere appearance sure why not if i can take it back to the muppets one last time those movies had heart to them underneath as well with this movie theres only a couple of scenes where theres no sarcastic lines or quips or just outright ill talk s till the cows come home stuff but they do help to give the movie some grounding and keep things moving along wellwhen i say its hardr i mean it  if you take your kids make sure they know what theyre in for and that despite the appearance of the xavier school this is very violent and bloody and with limbs flying and heads rolling and little tiny hands regenerating and too much said but for me at least in the first half of the movie before it got to the climax which ill get to in a moment it was refreshing to see how violent it got im not completely sure if it was miller and the filmmaers intentions but i suspected all of bodies laid to waste in sometimes horrifying ways is some kind of comment on how bloodless many of the comic book movies and other xmen films can get sure people die and get stabbed by wolverine and so on but theres no consequences is the kind of movie where colossus that one big russian metal guy who was in the other xmen movie that i dont remember the name of tries to tell wade not to hurt any people on a highway where a big gunswordbattle has happened wade says nobody got hurt and then a guy just falls from up above in the background from his wounds oopsits a big comic spectacle that works better as a comedy and somewhat as a love story than as an action film i say this despite a relatively coolly shot and choreographed opening sequence on a highway  which gets sort of cut back to in time during wades introduction in flashback  since when it gets back the fights and stunt work later on the big climax included its just acceptable the real skill of miller and his team is in letting ryan reynolds take this character where it needs to which is being a constant talkings badass by the time it comes down to facing down the man who made him who he is ajax the tension isnt fully there just for the reason that wilson has the ability to regenerate from his injuries its one of those theyworkedonhim sort of thingsbut whats further surprising is that the romantic side of the story works more than i expected thanks to a wonderful set up between reynolds and monica baccarin as vanessa they trade barbs in such a way that you wonder if theyll run out of steam some of their lines are crude a lot of them very nasty and sexrelated and yet that made it endearing to me when things do get serious between them the conflict of course that wilson gets cancer and all his troubles flow from there if these actors didnt have good timing and chemistry it would falter but they dont and so it doesnt and by the time that the characters get reunited near the end the same spark is still there as are the real levels of sorrow about why theyve been apart and whats kept it that way some of it is wilsons own doing the sort of look a way im a hideous beast clich which i forget if its even a clichcould it have been less lowbrow maybe but its smart enough to be exactly the kind of selfreflexive comic book movie that goes after all of the bulls with these movies from the budgets to jackman and beyond and makes its own identity i found it a lot of fun,comedy
ive been a huge fan of the character for several years and ive been waiting for this film for years to finally see this movie on the big screen just felt like a dream this film exceeded all of my expectations with the phenomenal acting and effects ryan reynolds was made for this role and the supporting cast was great as well i would definitely recommend people to see this for the action as well as the great comedy but there were some children in the theater and i want to say that this is not appropriate for children but it will be a great time for adults that are fans of comedy and action films there is also a postcredit scene that made the film even more enjoyable do yourself a favor and see this film and fall in love with the merc with the mouth,comedy
after a disappointing experience from fantastic four i really couldnt see myself to watch any fox movie comfortably but was amazing hands down this is the best marvel comic movie made by a nonmarvel studio and probably among the best ever marvel comic movie the humour was amazing the movie was serious at some points the random joke at of nowhere will pit a smile on your face moments when they make jokes about other marvel characters and movies like when said how the xmen school seemed so empty its as if the studio couldnt afford to have any other characters is just amazing it shows the writers ready to take anything into the moviethe best thing about the jokes is that they are realistic jokes they were the jokes you would say in your mind but just couldnt say out i also couldnt think of anyone better to act other than ryan reynolds its like he was born to play definitely one of his best ever performances and might i also say this movie has the best opening credits i have ever seen only downside to this movie was how long it was other than that it was perfect,comedy
so deadpoolas the name might suggest wont be your typical marvel movie and going by trailers and any kind of background reading of the comics wont be the ideal movie for nanas who hate swearing sex and violence this movie is the perfect first movie for which stays true to the comics simple plot line as it is simply an origins story origin stories are meant to be simple and predictable because everyone knows how it ends as the person becomes the embodiment of the comic book characterryan reynolds nails it mostly because he is so similar to the comic book character that its scary his line deliveries are just right for and the reason is because most of the main jokes were improvised something ryan and tj are very good atits violent its crass sexual and wrong exactly as it is in the comics and pretty much what the trailers suggested beyond the funny love story trailer which probably caught the 1 star reviewers hook line and sinkerif you like comics watch it if you like the crass ryan reynolds of past van wilderblade 2 watch itotherwise dont bother going just so you can affirm you wouldnt like it in the first placeinsert sarcastic rant here i give titanic 110 because it was too lovey dovey and there wasnt enough superpowers gore and crass humour but adam none of that was showed in the trailer in fact the opposite was shown in the trailer why would you expect anything other than what was advertised with the trailer and rating oh yeah right thats how you get a feel for what a movie will he silly me,comedy
ill be damned a superhero movie that was different ill drink to thati was reluctant to go see this as im not a fan of superheroes anything but i was also curious to see what all the fuss was about here come the opening credits and they are like nothing ive seen before best opening credits ever had it not been for the excellent script and wonderful directing would have been your run of the mill formulaic superhero movie the deadpan and tongue in cheek humour the unexpected references and the rhythm make stand out reynolds does a great job delivering the lines at times its so fast your head is spinning in a good way  the soundtrack was spot oni personally didnt have any issues with the language or the nudity i see people comment that its violent theyre probably watching and loving game of thrones it didnt bother methis is definitely not for kids but hey i for one am happy that hollywood dared make a movie that was a bit smarter and i loved that it didnt take itself so seriouslywas so unexpected so irreverent so funny i couldnt help but love it,comedy
comes from a place rooted in marvelmania and geekdom the entire premise seems like one born from the want of fans to have it so and in fact much of the content of the movie suggests it by winking at the camera at every possible opportunity it has already been a massive box office success and as of february 17th it has nearly a 90 on imdb i didnt enter the film with high expectations similar to my feelings about guardians of the galaxy so i cant say i was surprised to realize the film is an utter letdownit seems like marvel is making a new movie every few months or so and it seems like an easy chore for them to dish out a movie throw in a couple recognizable characters and watch the cash come rolling in the wackier the story the bigger chance it was to make but have they ever had a true flop the comic book world has impregnated our psyche whether you have read them or not everyone wants to be in the knowseems to be a response to guardians following an unlikely superhero ryan reynolds as he casually jokes through a plot that would otherwise be full of immense peril when chris pratt challenged the evil galaxyruler guy to a dance off at the climax of guardians it felt funny and fresh when stops in a battle to look at the camera and mention a joke about hugh jackmans wolverine i just sighed theres a self awareness throughout the film that simply removed me from the movie at one point reynolds remarks dont make my costume cgi as he begins his superhero transformation a painful reference to his green lantern stint this is like a grownup airplane parody where characters know they are acting and the good guy never misses his target no matter how far away he is with the gun most people i have talked to describe this movie as a fresh comedy i saw it as a parody a bit too onthenoseknowing nothing about deadpoolwade going in of course we had to trudge through a backstory filled with sex and jokes and throwaway characters that all culminate in the creation of his costume stitched at home of course red hides the blood better we learn that though he fell in love was diagnosed with cancer and left the woman he loved in order to find a cure what he found as well was a new power of rejuvenation strength and witty onelinerslets be honest ryan reynolds is an attractive guy ladies love him and guys want to be him besides this his role in this film just falls flat through narration breaking the 4th wall voiceover and cutaways all i wanted was for him to shut up sometimes a simple action scene is cool in itself without being littered with gags and humor and comedy oh my playing the comedian of course the rest of the cast a couple of xmen i have never heard of that were apparently the only ones available for the shoot plays it straight gawking at the absurdity of lightheartedness and trying to convince him to just shut up and focus on the task at hand the task at hand defeating the villain  what else is a cookiecutter plot that is as predictable as we would expect i mentioned he is aided by some of the xmen so it should come as no surprise that comments on the fact that studios couldnt afford more recognizable actors for some quick cameosyou can tell the filmmakers were trying to be original an opening credits scene that is nothing but puns and injokes directed by someone who was paid too much starring the sexist man in america etc if thats comedy then im sorry i didnt laugh if the fanboys are happy with the film then im sure the marvel studio is pleased perhaps in a year or two when they release ii they can work out the kinks that weighted this film down for a movie so highly regarded as a hip romantic comedy boy was i bored,comedy
the truth that sometimes scares me where the film goes if it can be called cinema to this it seems that now we have to insult to be seen we see it every day in other places but that comes to this the film seems very sad we already had the heroes antiheroes but now they must be rude and unpleasant and thus they will get to the most stupendous girlwell lets not be surprised that kids on the street have no educationin terms of effects is as not a wonder except in some cases that falls short it seems a liethe picture is pretty good the direction saved the moments of great 3d as the titles of credit is very normal that if at least it has bored mei just hope this kind of films do not spread otherwise we will get to see this kind of people on the street,comedy
comicbooksuperhero movies are not my ideal genre i rarely watch them and baring the odd exception i find them relatively uninteresting i had heard positive things about i was told it wasnt your average superhero movie and despite my reservations i decided to give it a go starting with a beautifully constructed intro scene it was clear from the getgo that this wasnt what i have come to expect from previous superhero movies it was violent with graphic gore had bad language and had a unique spoof comicbook style from the first few minutes i was laughing at the oneliners and enjoying the violence i was hookedi was expecting the humour to be forced and awkward the trailers made it look this way and i honestly didnt expect to find it all that funny at the start it did feel slightly off to me but once i adjusted to the style everything clicked and it worked completely from the timing of the oneliners to the witty narrative its simply a well humoured movie which had me laughing to myself on many occasions some jokes did miss the target with me but this is to be expected and isnt something which i can put the movie down for the choreography in the action scenes along with the graphic violence was very refreshing and when it was mixed with a little dry humour it made for some impressive sequences theres some slapstick in the action scenes with immature humour which isnt really to my taste thankfully this was relatively minimal and was balanced out enough to not bog the movie down whilst the movie is violent and graphic its not quite at game of thrones levels of gore so dont let this put you off too much if youre one of the squeamish typesthe runtime is perfect at 105 minutes the movie doesnt drag for a single second and other directors should take note that not all anticipated big screen movies need to be 2 hours just for the sake of it we are thrown into the action straight away before being shown detailed backstory through the use of flashbacks this happens throughout the movie as the story unravels revealing how was created its very well done and although a little predictable it doesnt give everything away too early and i was kept intrigued wanting to know what was going to happen nextdespite being completely ridiculous and not taking itself seriously manages to achieve a sense of emotion the love relationship is kept sharp and works with the plot love stories are a given in practically every single genre of movie nowadays even more so in superhero flicks and does a good enough job of not making it too overpowering or distracting paying homage to other comic books and other movies is a nice touch and although some i could appreciate i feel that many went over my head due to my lack of superherocomic book knowledge or interest the score was fantastic with a fantastic soundtrack this is another thing which worked perfectly with the movie and was one of the things i really appreciated getting the music right is a tough ask for movies and an even tougher one for a movie like this it has a great mix of music which all compliments the movie welloverall my expectations for were very low due to my own personal movie taste and also the trailers which didnt look overly appealing as the credits rolled to yet another strangely perfect song from the fantastic soundtrack i was filled with a huge sense of enjoyment i had just watched a movie which i thoroughly enjoyed even though all the signs were pointing towards it being a film i was going to dislike its witty violent cool excellently choreographed and downright adrenaline pumped go see it as soon as you can and dont forget the popcorn810,comedy
is an amazing film in fact is my favourite movie along with the terminator and beverly hills copthis is a superhero movie but not any old superhero movie it is a full on comedyaction and this is why it is so great for example in one bit he cuts off his own hand it grows back due to his healing abilities normally this would be disgusting which it kinda is but this time its hilarious also the main character always breaks the fourthwall this just adds even more comedy to the filmthe plot is pretty good im not gonna spoil anything its not amazing like in the matrix or the da vinci code but its a fun idea of trying to get his body returned to normal because the main villain ajaxfrancis kinda fcked it upoverall the characters are all hilarious the action is bloody and brutal and the film is rude afa definite 1010 or 5 stars,comedy
ironically enough the movies worst character was himself and the only good parts of the movie were before he was not wearing the red suiti dont get the hype the story was lame  lets just say that really there happened nothing in the movie but badguys getting kicked in the butt the action is quite boring filled with stupid slowmos and still images which were ultimately ruined with the constant yapping and really just irritating jokes by and the 4th wall breaking  geez it just got so boring that i wished i could have breaking the wall and yell at him to stop this annoying thing they called moviei guess the movie was supposed to be fun with the jokes and all but most of the time i ended up with a facepalm as said above ironically the only good parts were the serious ones which those too were usually ruined at the end by saying out loud another lame joke the whole movie felt like it was scripted and acted by a bunch of teenage kids who found out that there are funny curse wordsthe music choices were bad even though i get their point but it just doesnt work everything in this film that was supposed to be cool and funny turned out to be lame and just stupid i just dont get what people see in thisthe sexy scenes and blood were just fillers because frankly there was nothing else to the movie was it fun to watch if you left your brains on the doorstep sure  there are worse movies but there are also better choices even if you just want a good laugh nice action and a couple of nude girls this had all those but only those and even movies where these are not the main things you can find betterin the end i dont know who are supposed to be its audience surely its not for any adult that has his brain activity functioning correctly nor is it for children because of its gore sex and repeated use of the fword who is supposed to like this movie,comedy
is a superhero film based on the marvel comics character of the same name it is on the same universe as the xmen films and it is directed by tim miller it stars ryan reynolds morena baccarin ed skrein t j miller gina carano leslie uggams and brianna hildebrand in wade wilson hunts the man who gave him an accelerated healing factor but also a scarred physical appearance i liked this movie a lot its probably up there on my xmen movie ranking though my favorites are still first class and days of future past ryan reynolds is p e r f e c t on the role of he has comedic talent and is very good at acting the jokes he makes on the movie are straight up hilarious and the puns are just as clever this is definitely as good as a movie was ever going to be though it was clear they had a small budget they still made the most of it and nothing looks fake at all the action is amazingly shot and superbly done theres no shaky cam or whatever that thing is that other cheap action movies do here is just great stunt work mixed in with great visuals and hilarious one liners all around the fourth wall breaks are genius and well though out they had great timing and were actually funny while the overall story might be a bit formulaic still all the other amazing things just surpass that and make us forget the abomination that was xmen origins,comedy
what is the best way to describe the 2016 film there are just too many words to actually describe how incredible this film is not just as a superhero comic book film but as a film overall ryan reynolds is perfectly cast as the fourth wall breaking murdering wise cracking merc with a mouth the film intelligently plays with the usual tropes of a superhero origins film with its fun jokes perfectly timed flashbacks and great fourth wall breaking moments just like the character and his stories in the comics the film is very meta and knows how absurd the movie is especially at the beginning when it gives us the credits may be a sadistic insane killer with macabre jokes but hes still lovable enough you dont care how much blood and guts he spills wherever he goes though one would normally be annoyed when stuff in the trailers arent actually in the films it makes sense since a lot of jokes in the trailer were probably different takes so as to not overplay the actual jokes with its success proving that hard r rated superhero film can work hopefully other similar movies that deserve the rating will be made and not just make something r rated since it went well for deadpool,comedy
even though its not really my thing i watched almost every marvel or super hero comic movies just because they are entertaining but without being great but is different its definitely the best super hero movie i ever watched besides the obvious action scenes this time you get the dry humor for free the funny lines of are what makes this a very enjoyable movie to watch i heard from others it was completely different then the usual xmen movies and i have to agree with that its totally refreshing the cast is well chosen and are perfect in their characters its the first time i actually cant wait to have a sequel for a super hero movie for the haters that complain about the language or scenes just inform yourselves before watching something and just avoid going to a movie like that if you take offense giving a one star rating is just childish behavior,comedy
what isnt to like i mean seriously it is hilarious inappropriate and all in all amazing although it is not a family movie it is good for people who love the marvel universe ryan reynolds is hilarious and the costumes are amazing this is a little violent and has a fair bit of foul language but that just adds to the comedy of the movie i found myself laughing throughout the whole movie non stopthe writers deserve amazing credit for this movie and hopefully we get to see a sequel im sure everyone will get a laugh and love the movie all in all it is a very comedic movie and what is not to love about it ryan reynolds the comedy what not,comedy
as a character is not easy to do many writers have tried their hand at the comics and for a lot of people his sense of humor seems to be wacky random and of the nonsensical monkeycheese variety i maintain that there is and always has been a method to madness without it the character quickly becomes tiresome and annoying its the difference between a noisy eight year old and injokes shared with friendsryan reynolds nails it this movie is incredible it is sharp weird and funny in all the right ways this is the i like over the top without being too over the top referential and not afraid to break the fourth wall  but with just enough tact to save it from being incomprehensible and its violent has to be violentthe only complaint i have is that for the first half of the movie it jumps back and forth a little too much and theres a stretch where things drag just a bit when the movie threatens to take itself a little too seriously in order to give some pathos its necessary i suppose but it also feels a tiny bit formulaic for my tastes like the movie had to have some kind of romance because its a movie and movies have to have romance or something its a small complaint though and if were being honest it doesnt really get in the way every other part of this is a movie worth gushing about just gosh wow i almost dont even believe this movie exists because it is so pitch perfect you should probably watch it,comedy
ryan reynolds is certainly a rising star in hollywood is certainly proof reynolds has been one of my favorite comedians since blade trinity his delivery of lines was superb and his onscreen presence was uncanny hearkening back to my previous actioncomedian eddie murphy so reynolds was a welcome addition to the current actors in hollywood deadool is a delightful progression to reynolds career and a wonderful departure from his lackluster string of weak movies and lame comedies actioncomedy is a great fit for this actor highoctane action is a terrific showcase for the delivery of the characters brilliant oneliners and other comedic elements the nudity fit the tone of the movie and didnt feel gratuitous this has been addressed but unfortunately this isnt a kid friendly movie lots of violence gore profanity and nudity should appeal to most mature audiences who arent prudish and or delusional this movies not for the casual comic fan but someone who doesnt mind the grittier side of superheroes,comedy
this movie is really super super amazing i almost missed this type of movies cause i havent seen such in a very long timeit has a mix of everything action comedy romance and so much more if you get the jokes right i guarantee you will laugh for longi enjoyed watching it so much and its worth the time and the moneyi would watch it again and again never gets oldryan reynolds rocks a very nice actor that i really like most of his movies and i gotta say you nailed iti would like to also add that it makes really no sense to see reviews with one star i mean come on for god sake who wouldnt like this movie ,comedy
after a glorious marketing campaign the merc with a mouth has finally arrived in a film that proves the power fans can have in the pipeline since 2004 was green lit after test footage leaked online during the 2014 comiccon the footage was so well received that the studio had no choice but to announce a film his fans had been well and truly waiting forbeing an r rated film in america and a 15 over here along with the fact he breaks the fourth wall and is very meta offered audiences an escape from the conventional superhero adventure we are so used to seeing how unfortunate then that it feels like a bit of wasted opportunityafter falling in love with vanessa morena baccarin and being diagnosed with multiple organ cancer mercenary wade wilson ryan reynolds is offered a chance by ajax ed skrein to take part in an experiment that will cure his cancerthe treatment sees wade injected with a serum designed to unlock mutated cells and after suffering through torture at the hands of ajax and angel dust gina carano wade is left disfigured out for revenge on ajax wade becomes the antihero who cant help but run his mouthis ryan reynolds passion project he is as much a fan as those who went nuts over the leaked test footage and he really is the only person you could imagine playing the character he is in the same way that robert downey jr is tony stark or hugh jackman is wolverine reynolds performance as is not one for the ages but is is one that works well within the film ive always liked reynolds as a comedic actor and its that skill set that brings about the films more entertaining moments wastes no time in throwing us right into the action with an opening title sequence that is both funny and deliriously entertaining from there we see wades story in flashbacks until we are fully caught up and the film begins to tread that eversofamiliar formula found in most superhero films if only the film carried on the way it started it moves at such a fast pace thanks to the jokefuelled screenplay by paul wernick and rhett reese and the frantic action directed by tim miller in his directorial debut one thing that i found quite disappointing was that quite a number of the jokes cheapen the film and i didnt really take to the meta side of the character much was at its best when combining the action with his sense of humourcoming to the performances doesnt really have a lot to shout about reynolds is of course the star of the show so he gets the majority of screen time and jokes meaning that others are simply shoved to the side or wasted tj miller was pretty funny as wades friend weasel who gets quite a few laughs but morena baccarin is dealt a pretty underwhelming hand as vanessa the villains are rather unforgettable too ed skrein and gina carano both delivering unspectacular performancescolossus stefan kapicic and negasonic teenage warhead brianna hildebrand were welcome additions to aid in his quest for revenge but even then they dont really do much at allthe funniest moments come when the film isnt trying too hard and there is a homage to everybodys favourite fourth wall breaking character in a post credits scene that tickled me is certainly enjoyable however i dont really think its as smart or funny as it thinks it is,comedy
this crazy superhero that mercilessly kills and refuses to call himself a hero wade wilson is an ex special forces operative who after his service works as a mercenary in new york he meets the prostitute vanessa and falls in love but cancer forces him away from her after voluntarily signing up to a clinic that claims to be able to cure his illness he is deceived and tortured until his body deforms and mutate so he gets superhuman powers ashamed of his new appearance and driven by revenge he takes the alter ego ryan reynolds plays the red avenger that half mad kills his way through the underworld of new york looking for his creatorjoins guardians of the galaxy and antman as marvels latest more comical superhero films the humor has always been there in the marvel films but these three films at times belongs to the comedy genre is really a sort of parody that both mocks and salutes the superhero genre movie references and classic clichs are fired in all directions when also turns to speak directly into the camera also sometimes the film completely stops and our hero narratively and humorously explains exactly what is happening its sort of playing with the genre and mixing different styles matching crazy personalityit is ryan reynolds interpretation of that is the driving force of the film many scenes last quite a while so that we all can get in on his jokes but the rest of the film actually isnt that long i guess thats the weak spot of it when weve understood as a character and the parody around the genre theres not that much left to lean on the british villains motive to mutate other people and his personal grudge against sassy attitude eventually gets tiresome even jokes are at times childishly foolish and also the brutal violence loses its meant effect after too many decapitated heads the best thing about the film is actually the short romance between wade and vanessa at the beginning i want to see an entire romantic comedy with just the two of them however i dont think that should be taken as serious as other superhero films it is a small and odd contribution to the marvel family meant to provoke and take other paths than their big flagships light odd and smartdavid lindahl  wwwfilmografense,comedy
is the 7th film in the xmen franchise released in 2016 its the first rrated xmen movie technically was a lowbudget movie its budget was lower than any mcu film well i went to see the movie with high expectations following all the promotional campaign and trailers and it didnt disappoint me right from the opening credits scene it showed its biggest weapon humor and violence was hilarious foulmouthed fun 4thwall breaker and amaaziing it was really fun to watch the action scenes were great considering the films low budget ryan reynolds is perfect as and the film addresses many things too the romantic aspect of the film is better than many superhero movies and the storytelling is inventive the film did the right thing stick to the source but it wasnt perfect the villain could have been more memorable in this revenge story from both sides film thus is a pretty damn good entry a humorous violent and a breath of fresh air in superhero genre 10 out of 10,comedy
2016 directed by tim millerwas precisely accurate and to the point the writing is spoton and twists the medium into a clever reference to the comic the direction is fresh and complete the editor deserves accolades for the exciting way the film was put together i was skeptical about ryan reynolds especially after green lantern but he was perfect for the role reynolds was athletic genuine and hilarious i appreciate breaking the fourth wall in an interesting way and i love the references to canada morena baccarin is fantastic as vanessa and pulls of some great action scenes the rest of the cast including karan soni taylor hickson kyle cassie and michael benyaer elevate this film to a mustsee for marvel fans  aaron rothermund,comedy
all the dinosaurs are afraid of the trex and all future comic book hero movies probably dread reynolds sets a new standard for movies in the genre doing things comic book movies never dared beforethe erotic scenes are lovely theres quite a bit of nudity but the entire sequence is hilarious so its far from being porn levelthe jokes are great its lowclass humor so if youre a snob youd better go watch the notebook or titanic for the billionth time this isnt the movie for you the back story is clich thats why they get it out of the way quickly and with plenty of humor while the main bad guy makes me poop bricks in a very unconventional manneras for the other characters theyre tools and have little depth themselves which is just fine because especially the big guy also acts like a toolall in all it was a great movie experience and the group i went with all loved it if you dont then unlike reynolds you probably do like having a stick up your youknowwhat,comedy
as an old comics nerd i was highly skeptical about a marvel film featuring a hero who did not exist in the golden era of the 70s my daughter had to drag me to the screening but what i found was nothing short of miraculous we laughed almost nonstop from the opening credits to the postclosingcredits teaser delicious millennial irony 4th wall breaking comic commentary outstanding effects rapidfire dialog as compelling as the sophisticated comedies of the 30s white knuckle action scenes and maybe the best opening credits sequence in film history for all the negative reviews i get it i can see why you disliked the film but friends you missed the point give it another try take off the blinders and approach it like a roller coaster enjoy the ride it was engineered by masters,comedy
not going to bother doing a long paragraph for this review but i have to write a review for this movieat first i was aware that when i first hear of was from the comics and ive only seen like a few panels not entirely the whole comic i actually thought he looked a bit similar to spiderman because of its whole red costume and especially the white eyes this is probably the best marvel movie ever so far because of its humor and the differences in heroes in the marvel industry not those mainstream cheesy ones and with humor in it is what makes the movie extremely unique 1010 would recommend this movie,comedy
lets get rid of the dandy familyfriendly superhero who flits across the screen already my biggest problem with super hero movies today is that they are too familyfriendly and largely unoriginalgiven that you are a superhero you are most likely fighting the most evil men on the planet and fighting the most evil men on the planet on a daily basis has got to take a toll on your psychology and you world outlook it makes me cringe every time i see a superhero movie where you have got a guy who is just dancing around happily on screen without a care in the world yes i understand but isnt really a superhero hes just a terrible person who gets paid stop even worse people oh you are so right simply making the winking suggestion at how bad ass and full of yourself you are makes you a terrible person i mean seriously there has to be more to being a hero or a villain than simply thinking about how bad ass you are because its old news and i dont find it even remotely clever or daring for this glamor boy to break the fourth wallhumor is not original simply winking at the fact that there are cameras that are supposed to play the invisible narrator is a concept that has been overdone in comedy and advertising today and people love it for whatever reason like its never been done beforeif you would like an example of nonfamilyfriendly superheroes go check out blade go check out the watchmen go see the dark knight all the superheroes here are largely affected by what they have seen on a daily basis they have real questions about humanity and real questions about saving the planet they are not simply some attractive looking superhero who wears spandex and dances across the screen,comedy
vulgar hipcentric and purposely antihero comic book marvel outing gives ryan reynolds exactly the kind of super hero using that term rather reluctantly part his career has been pining for while this could very well be an ideal villain if tweaked seems to be a perfect alternative to the kiddiefamily friendly marvel summer fare so popular every year hes feisty insulting cocky abrasive relentlessly chatty honesttonofault keen to jump into danger at any moment particularly with mutant powers opportunistic if he can get his revenge no one will stand in his way and unafraid of any consequences of any of his actions he was in the war special forces so his killingfighting talents have reason hes not an altogether bad guy as he is willing to risk it all to save his potential babys mama but not before cracking wise and pulverizing heavies that follow behind this mutant that is impervious to pain he cant feel anything named ajax ed skrein ajax was head of an underground lets change hopeless human bums in need of help into mutant superheroes project that had this suit with a faux sense of offering support to the downtrodden luring unfortunates into a warehouse that features a staff who seem content to pump them full of mutant goo and torture the change into effect ajaxs suit convinces cancerstricken wade reynolds to give the mutant underground project a chance and it leaves himwell worse for wear an oxygen deprivation tank encourages the mutant change on wade which uglies his entire body going the elephant man route provides wade with a modicum of sympathy but i guess his mouth could hinder that somewhat lets just say that this film unleashes some pentup frustration that comes with trying to offer a product to a wide audience within a pg13 rating what many might perceive to be a niche marvel character audience seems to be the answer to a certain demographics prayers theres a freeing feeling you can see in this film with all the swearing sexobsessed dialogue decapitated heads directtocamerafourthwallbreaking 80s music chicago and wham make appearances playful jabs at the xmen metallic muscle colossus  firebrand negasonic teenage warhead lend some help to by films end stan lees cameo in a strip club  and going for a completely offthewall backandforward origin story reynolds energy and sheer exuberance he is having so much fun and seems to be totally turned loose from the chains that bound him in green lantern give the film a buzz it sustains all the way through thankfully hes never a buzzkill ajax is your basic coldblooded villain who looks like someone jason statham is trying to outrunoutlast in a transporter movie with gina carano as his intense and mighty lieutenant she gives colossus quite a run for his money this is all about reynolds and his bluntforceobject honesty and sense of humor the quips are exhaustive theres no shortage of marvel vehicular carnage and explosions epic encounters between fighting heroes and villains are here and accounted for and even the friends treat each other rather harshly wade and his bartender buddy weasel tj miller share an exchange which doesnt politely hold back how new looks are a detriment to him and a blind black lady living in the slums who provides him a place to stay shares the oddest of friendships with wade this films big box office has proved that marvel could make a rrated superhero film and it be successful look for the next film to be even more graphic explicit and against type resistance towards the xmen philosophy and how he corresponds with colossus and the teenage firestarter were my personal favorite parts reynolds found his winner almost pulls out all the stops including quite the inspired opening credits which gleefully ribs the stereotypes of the comic book movie,comedy
five stars out of fivea raunchy and excessively violent superhero comedy flick based on the marvel comics character of the same name the film stars ryan reynolds playing a very different version of the role than he previously did in 2009s xmen origins wolverine reynolds plays a mercenary named wade wilson whos subjected to a secret experiment to cure his cancer which gives him superhuman healing powers but it also leaves him severely scarred the movie also stars morena baccarin ed skrein tj miller gina carano brianna hildebrand and the voice of stefan kapicic as colossus it was directed by first time feature filmmaker tim miller and written by rhett reese and paul wernick based on the comic book character created by rob liefeld and fabian nicieza the film scored the biggest rrated opening of alltime at the boxoffice grossing 150 million in 4 days making it also one of the largest superhero film debuts ever beating the likes of spiderman batman superman iron man and morewade wilson reynolds is a former special forces operative turned mercenary for hire who suddenly falls in love with a beautiful escort named vanessa carlysle baccarin after meeting her at a local new york city bar then hes tragically diagnosed with terminal cancer a mysterious recruiter jed rees for a special program approaches wade at the bar he frequents and offers him a cure for cancer in exchange for his involvement in the program wislon reluctantly accepts his proposal but the program not only cures him of his deadly disease but it mutates him into a scarred and somewhat psychotic superhero as well with the nickname will stop at nothing to get revenge on the people that mutated him and hopefully fix his disfigured face so he can go home to vanessa againthe movie is the perfect combination of action and comedy its a hilarious fourth wall breaking spoof and the action scenes are spectacular and thrilling as well the special effects arent bad either id give it 5 stars in both genres which i never really thought was possible before now reynolds is perfect as the popular antihero and its such a redeeming faithful adaptation this time around the writing is brilliant and the directing is equally impressive from a debut filmmaker even the movie also has great social commentary on most peoples obsession with looks in our society is insanely driven by this motivation the film is also one of my new alltime favorite superhero flicks and i hope they make a lot more rrated comic book movies like it due to its success watch our movie review show movie talk at httpsyoutube0d1sap746m,comedy
after painfully regretted wasting my money on the mediocre to put it mildly age of ultron or avengers 2 basically a carbon copy of the first avengers minus the humor any kind of emotion or coherence i decided to dedicate my resources to serious creators not to studios only dedicated to squeeze a cash cow far beyond dead i caught ant man in a long flight and just because there was really anything else to watch so i gave it a try and enjoyed almost two hours of decent fun time the movie was not good but at least it wasnt taking itself too serious and paul rudd did a good jobwhen i heard about perhaps the funnier character in wolverine played by ryan reynolds a guy who can take sarcasm to the next level and without the constrains of the pg13 rating i decided to give the movie an opportunity and i was not disappointedwithout the limitations of kids oriented movies but still restrained in my opinion can say and show things any other movie of this kind would not dare there is some nudity nothing erotic a sex scene not too erotic either but played for laughs strong bloody violence and continuous fbombs and cruel oneliners that might not be appropriate for kids i doubt many kids will understand most of the jokes could the movie have been better perhaps a more developed villain could have helped however this is the kind of movie where the main character is interesting or perhaps less restraint in images side not only the verbals marvels made a bet with this movie but it was not huge one the production values are fine but there is no extra money for cameo or big names reynolds break the fourth wall a few times and joke about the money constrainsin brief it is the funniest marvel yet and really deserves a public with brains,comedy
so i went to see this with my brother and his girlfriend tonight i was extremely impressed i was honestly looking forward to seeing this for months i never had heard of before in until it was announced that ryan reynolds will play as however i found out last night he was playing as in a xmen movie way before the character was the main lead in his own movie he also played the green lantern who i dont really have interest in so hes right to back away from getting a third role as another superhero figurei really loved the humour it was so cheesy yet it can be pretty rough at the same time i think in my opinion would be the best role model for people with cancer because he is super confident and would make you laugh it proves all the individuals who have the disease are superheros and fight it like legends they really arehands down this is the best marvel movie that i have seen in a long time,comedy
after a long time truly did laugh my arse off in a theater trust me i prefer superhero movies with a nice storytwist and dark gritty this was truly an exception moreover its rated r for all the good reasons ryan reynolds was epic in his role of wade wilson aka morena baccarin plays his ravish girlfriend vanessa tj miller is there for some comic relief butits all about its all him not the villains not the guest stars its all him and his crude vulgar yet hilarious humor the timings are impeccablevillains and guest stars gina carano aka angel was pretty cool and sexy stefan kapicic aka colossus was there for some impressive cgi showdown and comic relief brianna hildebrand aka negasonic teenage warhead solely picked because of the name was impressive specially her powers the best guest star was not there in body youll find outoverall if you want great laughter enjoy epic fights and a simple story is the movie marvel keeps on impressing us,comedy
this movie is completely mad thanks to the brilliantly funny no holdsbarred brand of comedy that is absolutely everywhere from start to finish is a consistently hilarious comedy made even better by a very wellwritten plot excellent performances and amazinglydirected actionis a movie made first and foremost for the fans in comic book lore hes the ultimate foulmouthed wisecracking rogue superhero and the movie takes that character and places him on screen in exactly the same form therefore rather than the more familyfriendly actionoriented superhero movies that dominate the box office nowadays prepare for something completely differentalthough the story and action are great and ill talk about that in a second its the humour thats the real standout of this movie theres so much bad language and so much adult humour but in this movie it works like magici didnt think was the funniest movie ever but i was laughing on a consistent basis right the way through this movie the shock value of the swearing extreme violence selfreferential humour and countless fourth wall breaks didnt wear off at all which is testament to just how brilliant a script this film has even if youre not into the world of superheroes can still be a fantastically enjoyable movie just because its so funnythat leads me into talking about ryan reynolds who was amazing in the lead role he pulls off the chatterbox superhero so well delivering on the comedic front time and time again whilst also managing to make a character that really wont shut up hugely likable which again meant that you could keep enjoying the mad comedy right up to the end of the film because everything that came out of mouth was just hilariousbut dont think that this is just a comedy because it does shine on the story and action front too whilst tying into the xmen universe is a very unique superhero movie its not all about saving the world its just a story of a guy who wants to get revenge on a man who completely ruined his life and because of that you can actually relate to this guy more so than any other big blockbuster superhero because his determination is so simple and realas well as being a revenge story is also a bit of a love story its the revenge that drives the film but the relationship between wade wilson and his old girlfriend is a genuinely believable one helped by the fact that reynolds and morena baccarin work so well together and is yet another brilliantlywritten plot point that allows you to get more invested in what is a hugely entertaining filmfinally lets talk about tim millers directing despite being his feature debut miller has done an absolutely stunning job with whilst the comedy is the driving force one of my main takeaways from the film was how brilliant the action was there could definitely have been less cgi but when we see either in gunfights or handtohand combat its thrilling to watch getting better and better until the excellent final act which i absolutely loved making this one of my favourite superhero movies ever,comedy
amazing one word amazing this movie was by far one of the most action packed funny and thrilling marvel movies i have seen in a very long time is an amazing character to begin with ryan reynolds more than made up for the fiasco of green lantern with this one i cant wait for a sequel the movie had it all nice storyline flashbacks that explained the history of the hero and lots and lots of jokes funny racial you name it a movie with no clichs looking at the spectator more than once and with a decent result other movies that have tried to bring down the fourth wall have not made it  this one didwould love to see more xmen in the movie but its fine as long as i see in the next xmen movie i will be happy hurry and get to the cinema before its out cause even the special effects are worth it and then just buy a dvd to have in your house youll never get tired of watching this one,comedy
admittedly i walked into hoping for little more than just a decent treatment of the character hes not complicated hes got spideys witty banter jacked up with vulgarity wolverines healing factor two guns and a pair of swords not complicated he looks like what youd find in the margins of some twelve yearolds notebookand they finally did it ryan reynolds works well as the merc with a mouth fluent in his own language of potty words whats refreshing about this movie is that its a love story disguised as a very naughty action movie the fight scenes slomo notwithstanding are pretty cool the sex scenes are funny and its somehow a breath of fresh air for those suffering from genre fatigue710,comedy
marvel has gone hardr before but never like this is the latest comic book movie and tells the story of wade wilson an ex mercenary who is transformed into the wisecracking 4th wall breaking swordwielding revengeseeking super hero outside of a guy wearing a suit and having superpowers the comparisons to your traditional comic book movie end there obscene violent and hilarious take on the superhero genre is a thoroughly entertaining though imperfect step closer towards reaching the full potential of the comic book movie industrythe success of rested almost entirely on the shoulders of ryan reynolds thankfully reynolds is one of the best casting decisions i have ever seen in a comic book movie reynolds was born to play and his enthusiasm while playing the role is unmatched i cannot imagine anyone else pulling off and this is a huge credit to the studio for trusting reynolds with another chance to play this controversial and explicit comic book characterentire hour and forty minute runtime is filled to the brim with laughs dirty jokes shocking images and 4th wall breaks are just a few of the many forms laughs take however when you have 100 plus minutes of jokes not every one of them is going to hit thankfully after every miss the downtime between that and the next funny joke is very minimal definitely goes for quantity over quality when it comes to laughs but thats not necessarily a bad thingis extremely violent but all of the violence works in tandem with the character himself and the tone the movie strives for the film is directed by tim miller and while this is his first feature film he does a fantastic job of actually showing the gory action in a coherent and enjoyable manner the punches gunshots and slices all have visual impact and are not hidden or censored by the use of many cuts or other lazy filmmaking techniques however some backgrounds and images that have a deep depth of field appear unfinished and at times dont look good at all im not sure if this was from budgetary constraints or a rush to meet the release deadline in postproduction but it was a minor distraction and worth notingthe story in ties all the gore and laughs together the story is a fairly simple revenge tale but it has some emotional weight to it that gives the movie an element i was not expecting i cared about the man under the mask and his relationship with his girlfriend vanessa and although this relationship is impossible to relate to at least i would hope so you still buy them as a couple and this gives the movie higher stakes another thing i liked about the story is it goes back and forth from the present to origin story which i thought gave the movie a good sense of pacingone of my biggest complaints i have with the movie is the villain ajax im not super familiar with and his comics or who if anyone is his main antagonist but ajax is a very boring and stereotypical villain i get that his stern demeanor contrasts with wisecracking personality and opposites facing off generally makes for an interesting dynamic but i found him as a buzz kill to all the other awesome things going on around him his powers are not even interesting either just because villains sometimes have a tendency to overshadow the hero like the joker overshadowed batman in the dark knight doesnt mean you have to copout with a villain like ajaxthe highest praise i can give that i can rarely say for others movies is everyone in front and behind the camera feels like they are having a blast making it and are trying their hardest to give fans and movie lovers a movie thats not only a lot of fun but also good i hope this movie does well financially to reinforce the fact you dont have to follow a standard superhero formula in order to satisfy fans and critics alike if the subject matter requires it you can go rrated and not limit yourself creatively there have been other rrated marvel comic book movies but embraces its r rating like no other and hopefully paves the way for other brilliant and unique places comic book movies could go in the futureif youre easily offended by extreme violence nudity etc skip altogether everyone else get your brown pantsred pantswhatever color pants on and go support a movie that is unapologetically different from any other movie i have ever seenif you liked this review check out my website wwwwatsonmoviereviewscom to talk movies or read some of my other reviews,comedy
this isnt your normal xman spin off thankfully there are xmen in it and it has all the cheesiness of xmen and other superhero movies but it all made fun off and using the similar light hearted comedy is mixed in with violence and sex that is definitely not used in those movies along with some very dark humour its so out of place of what youd expect from these kind of movies that it brings a fresh feel that is such a relief after being drowned in the same stuff of 3 iron man 7 odd xmen 5 spiderman 3 f4 2 capt america thor ant man avengers unlike the mentioned above this isnt one to bring your kids to see and one of the greatest things about it is that it does stick to many of the rules the above movies follow but it laughs at them and throws in jokes and scenes that tear those rules apart if your a fan of super hero movies watch it if you hate super hero movies watch it,comedy
a superhero with god like powers of immortality added with a wicked sense of humor yes that is our r rated superhero who saves the day after you have movies like iron man 2 and wolverine he is the laughing ninja who has a bad joke for every occasion which will make you laugh hard and yes he directly speaks to his fans without giving a sh to the script or to the director screaming a cut who cares we have our own movie and we will rock it is the sole mantra of this red spanks and no cape awesomenessthe story is not very complicated and basically can be summarized in few sentences the plot is ok for the introductory movie of this new superhero but the action and the comedy is the actual spice in this curry it will keep you laughing and entertained nopes there is no social message in this movie and you dont need one the director whoever he is has done an awesome work by keeping it less complicated and filled with fun this can be really entertaining if you have a good sense of humor or even if you dont have one i mean this movie can entertain everybody and is highly recommendedhit the theaters now you will not regret it,comedy
i will start off by saying that there are a few stipulations to my rating for the more casual moviegoersit is not a movie like other marvel movies or even superhero movies in general nor is it intended to beit is very loyal to the source material so people who are fans of the series people who understand the essence of the character will have a great timeit is not a movie i would take kids under the age of maybe 16 to unless youre a cool parent if you are you are a younger person going to the movie i would really recommend going without your parents it would be pretty awkward at times otherwiseadditionally if you are from a part of canada like myself where the movie is rated 14a you should know that rating really stretches the limits of what can be considered a 14a movieif you are fine with movies that feature lots of swearing violence and nudity then it is great for youwith these points in mind i loved the movie its really clever nice simple story and with a nice pace that doesnt devolve into some of the annoying superhero movie tropes for fans of tarantinos style of humour and violence this is the perfect movie at times it can be really raunchy but it still has its heartwarming moments ill probably return to the theatre to see it at least once more,comedy
the highly anticipated marvel comicbook action movie has arrived with ryan reynolds in after finding out that wade willis has cancer he is reached out to participate in a series of tests that can not only cure but make him capable of having super strength when things go bad willis is out to seek the man who is responsible for his transformation and save his companion the film is directed by tim miller and also stars morena baccarin tj miller and ed skreinwow this is possibly one of the best comic book adaptations weve seen in some time since captain america winter soldier given the r rating that everyone clamored for it gave the movie a gritty edge in violence and humor all staying true to the comics that is all of this mounting to a refreshing contrast to the marvel cinematic universe we all have been used to seeing fun is the word you would describe this film especially the performance given by ryan reynolds fans of the marvel universe will be happy to know that the studio did justice to the character and didnt hold any punches in the processyou can read the entire review here at thecinemascorecom,comedy
if you have a taste for crude humorviolent actionabsofreakinlutely crazy love stories then is your thing downright one of the best comic book adoptions i have ever seen made by hollywood ryan reynolds was born to play wade wilson tj miller plays a brilliant supporting rolethe direction screenplay and cgi are all great but the one thing that i want to give a special mention to is the script writing it is fantastic it is difficult to gauge humor in words you have to experience it for yourself to understand what i meanoverall a 910 for me if you are reading this review i am guessing you are already interested in the movie but just making sure before taking the plunge go for it ,comedy
for it to be a ryan reynolds love project of sorts its an incredibly well accomplished movie the reason i removed one star is because the way the movie is narrated detracted to me from pushing the story forwardthe story is told in a flashback fashion and though sometimes it works i found myself anxious to get back to what was currently happening instead of getting the back story its not like it wasnt interesting fun or important its just that i would much rather figure out where everything was headedalso theres 2 aftercredits scenes so remember to stay,comedy
i have to say that i went into thinking it was gonna be great but well after watching it i have to say that i was wrongit was ing amazing man from start to finish was funny as  laughing my  off from beginning to end and  even the possible preview at the very it about the 2ndroflmao the whole timespoilers below so now i am gonna break down each part of the movieopening credits already breaking the forth wall and funny as  whole place was rolling at the whole thing the scene on the bridge with the suvs and poolie and the only having 12 shots you just know going in that  is gonna go down i was not disappointed in the teasing that there would be hardcore rated r action head shots people going splat limbs and even a shot in the  quiet literally all was just what you might think would have to be and it lived up to it and more ryan was definitely the only person that could have pulled off such a hilariously bad merc with a mouth the back story with his woman was pretty awesome hardcore everything but honestly the scene with stan lee in the strip club was great had me in stitchesbasically in conclusion i will say this again deadpoolforpresident,comedy
no review can do this justice to how amazing this movie is it is one of the best superhero movies one of the best marvel movies and one of the best comedies i have ever seen i have seen every movie on imdb top 250 movie list and i feel this movie definitely belongs in the top 20 movies it doesnt slow down and i never wanted the movie to end its so great at telling his origin story the jokes are so great and funny i had to repeatedly wipe tears out of my eyes and catch my breathe from laughing so hard the action scenes are incredible if you want to watch the movie watch it with a crowd in a cinema its more enjoyable that way,comedy
after months of all kinds of trailers posters and tireless social media promotion is finally in the cinemas to be completely honest it is everything it promises to be what was obvious at a first glance is that this movie is different from usual superhero stuff we see almost every month in factthis movie should not be called a superhero movienor antihero movie why so aka wade wilsonfamously proclaimed as the merc with the mouth is actually a really cool guy in a red suit his role is not saving the world or city from an alien threat he is a man on a mission but one that is more about himself than benefiting society but as we all know it his most noticeable feature is his wit and there are tons of that throughout 105 minutesgiving 910 is giving this movie a considerable weight and i was inclined to give it 8 why didnt i because i simply enjoyed the moviehad many laughs and loved action scenes which were kinda pretentious and overpumpedbut who really cares as far as i am concerned that is mission accomplishedthis movie definitely could have had more use of its plot it is decent at its best and comparable to many other marvel movies as you can now guess the villain played by ed skrein is not that interesting and magnetic and gets completely overshadowed by somewhat egoistic main character those are some serious drawbacks but they are sacrificed for the best thing about this movie it is bringing freshness to a bit mundane superhero world nowyou dont really watch what he is doing next but how he is doing it for once you get not only to love a titular character but you are ready to let him entertain you for an hour and a halfso is this is just an action comedy you can put it that waybut it is difficult to really define it this movie simply exists in its own universeand it does it so effortlessly and it deserves a massive applause for that,comedy
this is the type of movie i would have probably loved in my teenage years its full of silly jokes over the top violence and nudity however the plot is extremely basic its a revenge tale but you cannot take it seriously therefore you dont care what happens to the characters,comedy
basically if you watch the trailer you have already nearly seen all of the gags and funny moments this movie is too short it is a fun to watch movie but i would not watch it again if you are searching for a deep storyline then this is not the movie to watch which i think was not planed for this movie,comedy
2016 we may have seen a lot of superheroes but you will never meet the one as deadpoolhe is the most mischievousobnoxious humor filled guy i had ever seenhe is always mean to others and never takes things seriouslyhe is selfishvulgarrude and what nothe didnt have any quality to be superhero except having some mutative abilitiesthis is the first feature film of this crazy guyso how is itplot wade wilsonryan reynolds is a smalltime mercenary he meets vanessamorena baccarin and falls in love life is idyllic until one day he is diagnosed with terminal cancer things look bleak but a man appears who says he can be cured through a treatment that gives him superhero powers after initially turning him down wilson agrees and meets the man behind the project ajax whose actual name is francised skrein while undergoing the treatment he discovers that it will involve him becoming a mutant and he will need to undergo several painful tests to discover what his mutant abilities are plus ajax is a sadist the treatment results in wilson getting powers of accelerated healing but also leaves him terribly disfigured ajax tries to keep him a prisoner but he escapes he now has two aims find vanessa and make ajax pay for what he did to him killing ajax may not be as easy it seems as ajax is also a mutant and the meddling superhero colossus and his sidekick negasonic teenage warhead keep getting in the way oh and wade wilson is now operating under an alias deadpoolplus points1is one of the most fun superhero i had ever seenwhile all the superheroes are busy in saving peoples liveshas his own issues and deals in hos own wayhe has zero morality and kindnesscant help himself as long as hes able to breathe hell crack wise and make fun of himself and those around himhe even broke the fourth wall and talks with audience which is a good point2humor in latter half initial half of has some good humor but nothing specialbut in latter half i couldnt stop laughing because never looked back with his humorthere are a lot of lol moments which i lovedespecially few scenes are remarkable for its humor3climax climax is awesome with brilliant mix of humor and actionthe scene where they make a slow motion walk and the scene where villain gives a superhero entry is hilariouseven the scene where collosus fights with angel is awesome4performances ryan reynolds is perfect as deadpoolhe showed the characters innocence and insanity pitch perfectlyothers also gave decent performances5vfx vfx is awesome and flawlessinitial scene where car blasts with inside is creative and is one of the best onesminus points1initial half initial half of the movie is not as expected and gave some mixed reaction on this movie as it has no great momentseven humor is not that good so i wondered how this movie got such highly positive reviews but latter half proved me wrong2level of profanity is one of the most obnoxious superhero movie with high level of profanitythere is at least a single use of fkae etcso this movie is surely not for everyonemostly its focuses on teenssois the most unpleasant and surprisingly entertaining superhero movie with brilliant humormy rating 710,comedy
ryan reynolds smarttalking antihero makes a brilliant of one of the most amusing additions to the xmen universe of course we did see him in polverineone of the best i have seen for quite some time ryan reynolds is great cgi is great humour is great and the action is fantastic i have no idea why some people have given this a grudging one as it has everything you need the number of jokes is off the scale but this is sarcasm and this is a fun it is an alternative to the end of the world superhero fests we have all got a bit used toothis is a fab film simply watch and enjoy,comedy
is back after xmen origens wolverine and hopefully we all forgot about that mess this movie blew me away thankfully this film is here and it was awesome ryan reynolds nailed the character of wade wilson so well and was hysterical throughout the opening credits were so unexpected but hilarious this movie recognizes its place in todays film industry and plays along with it throughout with so many references to modern culture the thing i really liked about was how original its film making ideas were and how it was just such a totally different comic book movie in generalthe action is bloody but done in a perfect way to complement humor about that humor i was laughing my butt off almost throughout the film any scene with and colossus was hilarious the revenge story and the love story present in the film were presented in a great way with both being extremely funny it is also very extremely vulgar so be ready for it the only legitimate problem i have with was that some scenes are a bit too gratuitous when they honestly didnt have to be ed skrein is fine as the villain but he definitely could have been more menacingif you didnt like the movie thats completely fine but be able to justify that with good reason ive read a few reviews hating on claiming the film is too violent or not appropriate for my kids honestly what were those people thinking when they went in it was clearly labeled r and what did they expect from the movie after watching any of the trailers apparently they thought this is a perfect family superhero film just because it features a marvel character and then they call people who liked the movie stupidoverall this is a completely selfaware film that knows exactly what it is and what it needs to do to be a really fun action movie and it does it extremely well gets an a,comedy
i had waited 7 years for to get the movie treatment i love he is my favorite marvel character he was never properly portrayed in film until now you see with the disappointment of xmen origins wolverine just looked like baraka without a mouth this movie is a superhero movie like no other it is hilarious it is the we all know and love on the big screen the r rating was perfect for the film so they can get away with what ever they wanted this is fitting for as he is an irreverent character who swears a lot and makes hilariously crude and raunchy remarksjokes this movie is outrageously funny and every two minutes i was laughing my head off the opening credits in his perspectives was priceless there was never a dull moment in this movie this had it all violence comedy and a few overthetop but hilarious sex scenes dont show kids if you love you will love this film keep in mind this is rrated and not suitable for children take them to see captain america civil war instead its more age appropriate if you like irreverent comedies with a dark sense of humour then this is perfect for you,comedy
we now live in a world where a film exists an extraordinary film that is filled with fun easter eggs and references jokes that are hilarious and dirty at the same time everyone played their role perfectly ryan reynolds was born to play the merc with a mouththe plot of the movie is plain simple it tells the origin of how mercenary wade wilson became the fourthwall breaking mercenary called through flashbacks that happen between various events in the movie while the present plot is hunting down the man who made him look like the inside of a butt hole ajaxthe way the writers used the characters ability to break the fourth wall and talk to the audiences was amazingcould a pg13 cut of the movie ever work absolutely not this character is known to make dirty sexual jokes and have a gory fighting style this is not a movie for children they will be horrified and never blink again youll notice that this is a low budget movie even points that out in the moviethis is a simple review for an extraordinary movie with a simple plot that youll definitely enjoy,comedy
has proved to be a fantastic movie with very comical and gore y moments the montage in the beginning was well choreographed if you get what im feeling it was perfect because i love i first found out about him through marvel ultimate alliance then read comics about him then played his own game and now watched the movie the producers really pushed that ratedr limit and they did brilliantly of course they had to push it though i mean it was his 4d breaks were exceptional and hishis fiancs references were outstanding they cast a great villain and i hope to be able to watch the sequel since i was that entertained by the movie if you havent seen it then see it its a mustsee comedy romance action movie,comedy
is awesome and funny this movie really puts maximum effort into being great it was also funny when tried to hit colossus in every metal part of his body even his groin area it also has a good love story in it has been awesome and funny since the year i was born i have seen this movie twice and i like it another fact about is that he has a healing factor and not only can he heal wounds he can regenerate his body parts too it is possible that wolverine could do that too but i dont know he can probably do that too i have some comics you know also hes been a lot of comics with spiderman i cant wait till this movie comes out on bluray,comedy
i dont read comics i did when i was a kid and that was so long ago that i dont want to even think about it but ive always watched movies and hit a certain nerve in me in a positive waycomic book movies seem to be all about franchises nowadays building a universe setting up sequels setting up spinoffs setting up everything  and often forgetting to be a movie on their own like what arguably happened with avengers age of ultronim not surprised if is heading straight into that circus of brands and formulaic nothingness because at this point its clear how successful this movie was but i can hope for something better because this movie was actually fun to watchthis film is almost like a parody it is not only selfaware but painfully aware of the whole superhero movie business too expect some jokes about that in our main characters often say what the audience is thinking the fourth wall gets broken and sometimes the movie feels like its more of a weird mind game than a movie the humor doesnt land all of the time and sometimes its a bit forced but i got over it quicklywhile doesnt take many things seriously and it sure enough is not a serious movie it still seems to take itself seriously in what its trying to do and somehow it works rrated violence strong language weird sense of humor and this lack of restraint of course helps but there is a real heart to this movie that isnt defined by any of these things perhaps its the source material and the respect director miller writers reesewernick and actorproducer reynolds pay to it perhaps its the fact they wanted to make a fun movie not just something for brand recognition all i can say is that in a crazy movie like this i dont expect to see any heartfelt naturally emotional moments but i did this movie has a heart somewhere in itreynolds is very entertaining as the main character and right now i cant see anyone else pulling it off well done morena baccarin is good and the special mention goes to brianna hildebrand i had fun with her playing her role straight in a movie like this actors do a fine job and even the cgi colossus didnt bother me too muchone hour and a half went by quickly and i got my moneys worth a simple tight albeit a little shallow and stupid story that has fun with itself and the current state of superhero movies not once did i feel like there was a message being pounded to my head and not once did i feel like i have to suffer formulaic boredom in the name of cinematic universes fun fact no cities get demolished in this movie i have missed this kind of simplicity where stories dont revolve around the whole world ending not all comic book movies need to have the same threats same boring and grey 200 million dollar visuals of cities crumbling and luckily steers clear from all that stuff the ending felt very fitting too and overall i had a very good time in the theateris a weird example of how less is more and how at the same time daring to cross formulaic boundaries can be rewarding so i hope that they dont try to tame or try to recreate a formula out of it let it be what it is i dont even know what it is but i like it this way,comedy
a true spirit of simply awesome this superhero flick is a perfect example of how to make an introduction into fictional universe filled with super heroes its funny charming and perfect raynolds had truly redeemed himself from the green lantern fiasco hes an upgraded version of his wilder days and thats what we like he captured the spirit of the hero to the perfection i took two points off due to lack of proper antagonist representation imho same indian taxi driverwilder sidekick joke stereotypical teen and righteous collosus and few more glitches but overall this movie is a true fun also im having a bit trouble to see how will fit into marvel universe as the style is different never the less this one is a gem i want to see it again and i really want to see raynolds return to this role its his best so far,comedy
this was incredible i really dont know the history of the comic nor did i ever read it so i may be in the dark when it comes to how close it was to the comic books i really wanted to give it a 95 i was very skeptical to see it because i thought that it was a bit over the top comedically in the trailers and thought it would be too cheesy but i was wrong i think it worked very well with the story and characters the story line was good and i was throughly entertained with non stop laughs and still had the action you look for in a marvel movie it was very adult themed so i would recommend this for more adult oriented crowd but all in all i was very pleased with it i may even go out on a limb and say this is prob my favorite comic book adaptation to date and look forward to more,comedy
is one of the best fun sexy and action packed movies ever made ryan reynolds did a great job playing as it was smart wider and just a great movie for all of the fans over the worldparents this is not your normal marvel movie you should double check the movie before you take your little ones to see this it was a super wild movie that was just unfing believableis not your normal superhero he is like the antisuperhero of the marvel characters you will be blown away to see how good this movie is,comedy
2016 is a year full of blockbusters and comic book movies marvel and dc are the most popular here and they are both preparing spectacles for this year this is the first one out of six but i wasnt as excited about this movie as much as i was about suicide squad batman v superman civil war and even xmenapocalypse i expected this movie to be pretty good but i wasnt super excited and when i came out of the theater i was blown away this is the best superhero movie after the dark knight and the best marvel movieafter awful fantastic four reboot fox kinda got a bad rap but they totally knew what they were doing with this one screenplay is just awesome and i hope it gets nominated at the next year academy awards its full of clever 4th wall breaks and hilarious lines ryan reynolds fits the role perfectly and fans have nothing to be afraid of we already saw him in xmen originswolverine but he was criminally underused there and butchered to the point that at the end of the movie he was no longer thankfully it doesnt happen here and why would it it would be absurd if they did that in his own movie the villain is a great challenge to and is played perfectly an r rating also helped the movie a lot and if it was toned down it just wouldnt be as great as it is this way and it would butcher the character once again so it was a very wise decision to have an r ratingthis was one of my least anticipated superhero movies this year but it will probably end up being the best and i doubt any of the others will top this its so much fun and you wont be bored for a second and its very well written and also if youre a parent dont bring your kid if its younger than 13 or anyone who cant bear violence,comedy
if there was a 3 wordlimit to write a review i would say i love it this movie was almost flawless starting with acting and ending with highly sophisticated jokes about penises and anuses the only thing that bothered me however was the fact that everything from the very beginning was expected there is literally no turning points in this movie everything one expects to happen actually does happen however this does not change the fact that the movie was just amazing and i was pleased to watch itwas such a great comedy solid romance and a great action movie all in one it deserves a strong 810 but because im a huge fun of i have to give it a 910  i recommend this movie to everyone,comedy
i must say is the best movie i have seen since star wars the force awakens when i went in to see this with my dad we both knew it was gonna be amazing but we didnt know it was going to be this amazing i loved every second of it and me including everyone on the theater completely laughed their asses off every time a sarcastic remark or pun or joke was made because this movie was that funny now for the action it was perfect and gory just the way i like it there is a lot of flips kicks punches being thrown cute little drawings being colored and heads and hands coming off the romance is spectacular along with how much it ties into the drama not giving any spoilers but it all works and you know the pain hes going through when it happens this movie perfectly has comedy action drama romance and horrorkinda all represented in one movie i would recommend this movie to everyone i know and i know im going to see this at least 10 times more is definitely something you cannot miss definitely check it out even if you dont have time make time because there is always time for if i could i would give this movie 1210,comedy
special forces operative turned mercenary wade wilson whom after being subjected to a rogue experiment that leaves him with accelerated healing powers but saves him from dying of terminal cancer adopts the alter ego armed with his new abilities and a dark twisted sense of humour hunts down the man who kept him hiding in the shadows from the love of his life and nearly destroying his lifefox did it didnt they they only went and did it in the space of a year they gave us what must be the poorest comic book move adaptation with fantastic four or four to what is in my opinion the comic book adaptation that has not only set the bar for future movies in this subgenre but raised it so high the next few movies will have to do something very special to even equal the enjoyment has givenwith the hype machine in overkill for so many months this was in danger of falling down its own ego tunnel i cant remember hype for a film like this since snakes on a plane and when that finally came out expectations were so high it predictably disappointed and quickly vanished in its own afterburnthis works because its a labour of love for all involved reynolds has wanted to make this movie for what seems like forever and although he has had a knack of being in major comic book atrocities this is the role he was born to playimagine chevy chase via patrick bateman with the cockiness of tom cruise in cocktail and you have this the biggest antihero there is and he lets you know hes not your typical comic fodder all through the movie by breaking the fourth wall several times once even breaking the fourth wall in a fourth wall thus creating a sixteen wall scenariobut it works because the makers go for broke they dont pull no punches as they knew they were taking a big risk with making a violent profane laden sex filled comic book movie with an actor whose track encore is less than stellar hence the smaller budgetfrom the upstart its violent sarcastic sweary movie geek heaven and the film doesnt stop this until the hilarious end credit sequenceanother reason why the film works is that its just so very random from sampling michael jacksons beat it in the score or referencing early nineties pop culture that may go over most peoples heads or even spoiling other movies for the benefit of the films narrative it does whatever it wants to doif there is one negative about the film its that whenever skrien is on screen he reminds you of that blooming awful transporter rebootand it takes you away from this just a littlehilarious action packed and really nasty in places isnt just the best comic book movie ever made and i honestly mean that its probably the best action movie in the english language made in a very very long timei fear that civil war and suicide squad may not have the same impact now mr pool has entered the frayaction fans comedy fans film fans you really need to see this it really is that wonderful,comedy
its been a long time i can remember i laugh so hard for a movie from the very beginning to the end my friend even spoil coke to her chair cause laughing and have to enjoy wet chair for last 15 minutes we even bring home the laugh by discuss the scene and dialogue this movie could be called romantic too with very goofy kind way and the best part of this movie i totally forgot how dirty tragic violence and scary this movie is and enjoy it without feeling need to criticize itbut because this is an american movie with a lot sarcastic joke dialogue and popular culture reference you might be dont get the joke if you arent america and arent familiar with those unlike me and my friends who practically feed ourselves with those thing we just lol non stop there are few people in cinema just literally trunaroud their head to looked at us because we laughed so hard in a scene with faces whats so funny bout thatin the end of course dont bring your children unless you dont speak english cause there are serious sensors on subtitles in our country thats literally change the meaning for the whole dialogue oh wait now i understand why some people dont laugh like us lol,comedy
i liked this movie a lot because i was expecting it to be funny and be filled with action but it did all of that and then some i was surprised at how well made this movie is there are just so many great things about itfirst off the comedy is spectacular the opening credits start off joking with you and it is amazing after that you are constantly hit with jokes throughout the whole movie that make you laugh the whole time breaking the 4th wall in this movie was great as well there were some lines in the movie that were pure genius and any fan of the other marvel movies will enjoy them second i knew this movie would have action in it but after hearing that this movie was actually very funny i began to more interested in the comedy of the movie i did not know that this would be a great action film too also there was a very good love story in the film as well i was not expecting this either but this is where the film shines it is able to balance all of these aspects at the same time sometimes it even mixes these emotions together you could have a serious love scene with a joke put into it or an action scene that is funny at first and then becomes very seriousthis movie is just great and i am glad that they made it rated r because it allowed for the character to not feel constrained and quiet that being said this is not a movie for children no matter how much your kids want to see this movie do not take them other than that go see it it was amazing and i know you want to,comedy

the essence of finally on the big screens the story is as follows exmilitary and mercenary wade wilson ryan reynolds is diagnosed with terminal cancer but is a possibility of cure in a sinister scientific experiment recovered with powers and an unusual sense of humor he becomes and seeks revenge on the man who destroyed his life  the synopsis already know that the film is very clich and this is the greatest triumphthats the premise of the journey of the more fuc marvel anti hero the film begins with the most spectacular opening credits that could be seen leading the viewer to laugh even before you start the great triumph of the film is ryan reynolds incorporating he can bring to the public the essence of character with a perfect performance dictating the pace throughout the film another performance that convinced was the morena baccarin playing vanessa love the life of wade wilson it seems even film of romance other performances were erased and without much attention the direction of tim miller directing his first feature is perfect with action scenes and slow motion very much well choreographed and directed taking some scenes where it was not a good use of the characters the visual effects was one of the weaknesses of the film but also with a budget of only  58 million dollars may have been the best they couldso we can say that ryan reynolds finally managed to redeem himself after major failures adapted starring characters from comics green lantern and himself in xmen origins wolverine after long 10 years of waiting the dream of many fans was conducted see the mercenary chatterbox playing the fuck on the big screens of the better or worse it is rs criteria possible in your own movie even with all the difficulties of making a film with such a low budget we have a film worthy of and a real treat for fansim sorry by my english guys my english is really really bad d,comedy
super crazy fun movie it is just so unique it made me laugh so much on the opening credits i watched dozens of movies and i never laughed to a opening credit of a movie al tough the plot was clich and predictable the movie was so damn funny a lot of great and smart jokes that avocado joke made me laugh so hard not only the opening credits were funny but also after the ending credits we have a scene that was also funny i was going to exit the cinema but the employee told me to stay and that it will be worth it so i did and i laughed one more time and that scene convinced me that this movie is a comedy masterpiece it is a definition of a comedy although it isnt a comedy genrei watched it with my girlfriend on valentines day and it was the best valentines day movie ever thank you for a great and fun time i never expected that i would give a 10 to this kind of movie but did really deserve it and my last words best marvel movie ever,comedy
i have never laughed so hard at a movie before it was amazing but i was shocked at the number of children under 8 that was brought to see the movie i am so happy that ryan reynolds is such a huge fan and made sure he stayed true to the character he made sure nothing was left out i have been waiting for this for months 10 stars isnt even enough to rate this parents you cannot be upset at the theater or even those who made the movie blame yourselves for letting your children see this even after all the commercials stating from the actor himself that it is not for children guess this movie was just for us nerds ah just too amazing,comedy
already watch it last nighti am not really a fan of marvel but this is the next best movie to iron man in my opinion hilarious plus the effects are really top notch but not suitable for children if u are an adult u will have a good laugh watching this moviewham ryan reynold really suited with the character combination of emotion and funny really does the magic the storyline is simple but interesting to watch you cannot get more excited watching a film from the start other than it is a good movie to marvel franchise the song in the movie also will take you to the 90s and remember all the good old days,comedy
back in 2008 when scarlett johansson married ryan reynolds who i only knew back then as the sidekick from blade trinity the celebrity gossip sites another one of my guilty pleasures of that time praised that guy for having a typical canadian trait of selfirony back then it seemed like a good thing now eight years from then ms johansson is in the past and mr reynolds is by no means a sidekick anymore but the selfirony still remains and this time it found a fresh almost gargantuan outletthe genre of superhero movies is always at risk of catching a disease of repetitiveness and predictability which is no wonder considering those big manly chins that are constantly pulling you down so just like wade wilson at some point it had to start mutating into something fresher and more curious to retain the viewers attention it may be a pleasure to watch a superhero but its a much bigger pleasure when he is not exactly super or not exactly a hero tobey maguire might not be spiderman that every kid dreamed of becoming one day but his spidey was a person we all could relate to with his own flaws and imperfections a superperson whos still genuinely human insidethen it was time for the genre to mutate again to show that heroing can actually be fun contrary to christian bale and all the xmens sullen faces first it was kickass an amazing example of how great it can be to make the protagonist a total amateur and then of course green hornet with seth rogen taking the concept of a superhero to a completely hysterically ridiculously awesome levelwell apparently the world needs a hero again and since all the bigchinned roles are already taken by the likes of chris evans and chris hemsworth this time the filmmakers decided to go deeper and produce a completely new type of a superhero  one that takes nothing seriously himself includedtheres no denying that is good at being that type of a film with reynolds giving us a wisecracker whos both marveling at and deriding himself at the same time and with the entourage that from the opening credits rams home the idea that no ego will be left inviolable tonight feels like a hot standup show but with fists flying bullets buzzing and swords clashing all in a single bedazzling whirlwindhowever the first stun only lasts for about a half of the movie after which you start realizing that ryan reynolds indeed got this far not thanks to his superior acting method the gay jokes wear out the snarky remarks miss the spot and become annoying and the shallowness of the sidelines gets so obvious that even the constant breaks of the fourth wall to selfadmit it dont make it much better the only thing that keeps holding you is the villains who despite being made of cardboard by design hold their ground exactly because their typicality is authenticand that is whats wrong with the postmodern approach in attempt to bring it further on by parasitizing on the idea that there could be no further on at all eventually loops and bumps into its own rear and no matter how mr reynolds might enjoy his rear to be bumped into it doesnt compensate for the lack of heart he brings into this film which is even comical considering the obvious binding to the theater release on the valentines day and equally tragic considering that reynolds can in fact pull off decent roles like the one in mississippi grind sorry ryan but this time watching you was like listening to barenaked ladies the music is good and the vocals are decent but at some point you simply realize that the lyrics are just whiny and immature and that spoils all the fun i only hope that chris evans will bring that fun back because despite the big chin his captain america also has an equally big heartid give it 65 but since imdb only deals in whole numbers lets round it up for the sake of pioneering at something at least,comedy
i voted it a 10 why because it was exactly what i wanted it to be fun entertaining popcorn movieis it on the same level as the departed or the godfatherno but as a 1st movie about laying out the back story because not everyone knows or reads the comicsand introducing characters to the viewers it did a great job movies are like pizza its all preferenceso because i like my pizza with pep and extra cheese is not as good of a pizza that has baby truffles and goat cheese no they are just personal preference i felt the movie delivered so hence my 10 i loved itmovies get different ratings for different things and its about about preference and opinion just like comments on the board hereyou have the right to rate a movie what you want and say what you wantthe main reason i gave it a 10 is because reviewers like cedrick jones gave it a 2 which is absurd if anyone knows anything about he has the mouth of a 5th grade boy go see this movie its fun and popcorn makes anything better so heres my 10 to level out cjs 2 to make it a 6,comedy
is about a man named wade wilson who is subjected to a special experiment that leaves him with accelerated healing powers becoming the alter ego of now this movie really surprised me i was going into the movie cautiously thinking that the jokes might not be funny or the r rating would be there just because well now that ive seen it i can honestly say that this is among marvels best movies to start off the writing and the humor in this movie are amazing you can definitely tell that the writers spent so much time trying to stay true to the character of and they did an exceptional job the humor was also hilarious there are so many quotes that you can take out of this movie and there are so many moments that had me laughing so hard my favorite aspect of this movie was ryan reynolds as ryan reynolds was born to play he played the character so well that i cant imagine anyone else playing this character all the other characters including colossus and negasonic teenage warhead were exceptional one thing that surprised me the most was the love story if youve seen the trailers wade wilson has a girlfriend named vanessa played by morena baccarin and their relationship with each other was perfect the actors have great chemistry and their relationship was actually one that i cared about now one thing that the movie has been popular for lately is that the movie is rated r this is one of the only ratedr superhero movies and it is all for the better the movie has a lot of language sexual content and really strong violence the good news is that all of this was for the better the movie uses that rrating and makes the best adaptation of the comic if there was one thing in this movie that couldve been better it would be the villain while the villain isnt bad hes not the best i guess since everything surrounding it was so exceptional the villain just comes off as weak overall this is the best adaptation of a comic book character ive ever seen it is also of one of the best marvel movies ive ever seen i give this a 95 out of 10,comedy
at first glance many people think is just another marvel superhero movie and that couldnt be farther from the truth the main character is pretty much the complete opposite of a hero without being a villain he doesnt save the world or stop an inevitable doomsday his origins are dirty and grimy his jokes are dark and crude his motivation is selfcenteredbut im okay with that its a different take on what a person chooses to do with his superhuman abilities and i think that is what the world needed to see i highly recommend this movie to all marvel and comedy lovers but please dont take your children,comedy
it seems there truly is a first time for everything its borderline painful for me to admit this but i enjoyed a marvel movie i wouldnt have gone to see on my own but i was hanging with a friend for the weekend and he insisted on buying me a ticket what happened next was extraordinary i went an hour and a half without looking at my watch or wondering what was piling up in my inboxperhaps that was part of the movies success that it didnt push the 2 hour mark and that it wasnt straining like some perpetually frustrated fanboy to announce the credibility of comic book story lines to the world comic books are cool now too see theyre making movies with budgets of hundreds of millions of dollars which makes them officially accepted in the cultural zeitgeist no rather was made for less than 60 million the script was clever and tight and it focused on one of the strengths of the comic book format their absurdity and overthetop natureultimately its another revenge story but you can get away with following one of the tried and true plot templates as long as you put an original spin on it does this in spades with its buckets of irreverence a few moments of sincerity to provide contrast comedy that actually hits and some well filmed action also by shedding the pg13 shackles remained true to its roots and is another recent example of how film making for adults can still be commercially successful in the 21st centurymy biggest gripe with the movie is its look especially the background shots whenever youre outside like most modern hollywood blockbusters the environments have this weird washedout gray coloring to them thats about as far from authentic as one can possibly get thats no doubt a cost cutting measure relying on cg to fill in for well designed sets and difficult outdoor shots but the ugliness and laziness of these cheap backgrounds is pervasive in the frame spoiling what could otherwise be a spectacular looking pictureits not an amazing film but i liked it was well paced skillfully written it made me laugh and by being the antithesis of the last 15 years of lackluster super hero movies it became the first good comic based film since sin city,comedy
given so much hype had been garnered for this movie it built so much enthusiasm in me that got me in theater with high expectations however as the movie progressed the anticipation the enthusiasm started fading away and gave way to restlessness to finish the relentless ordealin parts is a good movie it has neatly done action sequences good cgi and nice humour thrown in between along the way reynolds looks fab when within the suit pun intended however everything to do with real guy outta suit is too tad dragging especially for a superhero movie i have never witnessed such a dragging back story which did not hold any interest for even a tiny secondfurther the story overall is totally lackluster sequencing of the movie is non linear which kinds of takes away the fun sometimes antihero played by another mutant is a damp squib with snore worthy ending after a certain point all the humor which was holding the movie in first few minutes of the movie starts becoming drabi have seen reviewers even comparing this movie with tdk and other superhero flicks its sad to see the herd mentality over so much hype for the movie which at best deserves a mediocre praising for its cgi fight sequences actress and overall attempt to bring out a kickassasanadult comic book caper movie,comedy
hood review deadpoolquick hitsit is rated r for a good reason  comedy sex violence bad language and wham the laughs roll in right from the opening credits which themselves are heelarious ryan reynolds did his thug thang in this one great performance and perfect casting i really didnt expect to like as much as i did the trailers and media blitz was starting to irritate the hell out of ya boy but this movie was downright enjoyable on all levels there were times i grimaced at a finishing move times i literally lold times i could not turn away from the action and times i was like wtf the overall story was a little lacking as it was pretty obvious that and franciss the bad guy backstory took a backseat to the slapstick humor and assholistic nature of but you know what not only was that aaight with me it actually was refreshing the producers gave us a lil bit then just hit the gas on the action and humor which came in very abundant flurries the movie moves very fast and straightforward all the time no pause and or detours also featured the best stan lee cameo to date the computer graphics were definitely on point though colossus looked waaaay different than in the other marvelfox jointssomething i noticed and not sure if this was done on purpose but had that sharknado bmovie feel to it the violence and comedy mixed together were so over the top that normally would have me like what man gtfoh but some how it just works in this movie this is a definite must see is a genius mix of elements that normally do not go together like the soundtrack for example wham and dmx nuff saidi give 5 ebts,comedy
the xmen universe expands a step wider thanks to the unusual mutated tones of storytelling compared to other marvels superheroes that surprisingly turns out very effective and brilliant despite a formulaic yet expected superhero plot the nonlinear narrative by slipping the several action sequences together with flashbacks added with the heavy adultrelated hilarious jokes throughout the film are wildly entertaining the film stays faithfully to the characteristics of  both humors and violence which are perfectly portrayed by ryan reynolds who is definitely the right actor to suit the character the romantic chemistry between wilson and vanessa is emotionally engaging and convincing compared to wolverine making it a great option for valentine outing changing his suit from green to red reynolds certainly has a lot of fun time in this nonfamilyfriendly superhero adventure and the overall outcome has made the classic shines among the other superheroes from the same studio,comedy
this review is going to be short because words cannot describe what this movie is from the opening credits to the postcredits scene if you could call it that this movie was brilliantany reader of the comic will agree that this is what a movie should be characters are handled in a way the romantic subplot is handled in a way the action you name italso the camerawork was good they held the darn thing still so you could actually see what was going on more action movies should do that have you ever noticed from my reviews that i hate shaky cam well i doas for this movie i cant describe what it is but i love it it is unlike anyy movie ever made and its great,comedy
this is the third of marvels recent comedic superhero movies the previous two being ant man and guardians of the galaxy and its the funniest one yet they might be on to something herethe humor is crude vulgar and sophomoric think family guy or superbad but its mostly hilarious and all of the meta and fourth wall jokes are pretty awesomethats not the only thing this fantastic movie has going for it the actions good the banter between and other characters is topnotch and the pacing is silky smooth the movies less than 2 hours doesnt have any dull or slow moments and it grabs your attention from beginning to the end they flawlessly incorporated fourth wall antics and from a storytelling perspective the plot moves along smoothly and flashbacks work well when this characters interacting with and guiding the audience throughoutand finally wed be remiss if we didnt talk about ryan reynolds its tough to overstate how challenging this role is the whole flick is good but its success relies heavily on a protagonist whos in 95 of the scenes and and spends a large bulk of that time rambling and talking to the audience and reynolds kills it hes so convincing its hard to see anyone else doing this roleso go see this movie they put maximum effort into it and its very entertaining,comedy
its really nice to see that studios listen to what the people ask forthe test footage that came out a while back showed the potential of a movie like this seeing how people reacted and made videos online the studio actually took notice and put it into production this is the only movie that nails the comics the characters in this movie all work well they have chemistry they redeemed themselves from that horrible xmen origins story all in all great movie never a dull moment go out and watch it if you havent buy it on bluray show support so that a super hero movie having r rating can still do well in sales,comedy

im gonna start out by saying im not a usual fan of super hero movies i can watch and enjoy the avengers like most but personally lately ive been getting fed up and sick of the abundance of super hero films on tv and movies released in theaters a lot of them are extremely similar and lack originality or something to set them selves apart as far as goes im glad to say it most certainly sets itself in a league of its own not only does it annihilate the 4th wall in many hilarious meta jokes it keeps the pace consistent and engaging by making non stop quality jokes and intense action unlike others im not very informed on many things in the x men world or the character of but it didnt take away from my enjoyment much if you are more informed you will probably enjoy it that much moreto give perspective on one of the reasons i liked it so much here ya go one of my favorite actioncomic book movies is kickass a brutally violent foul mouthed super hero movie and i loved every second of it from that same director kingsman was made a very good comic book adaptation with awesome action and great humor and even more coincidentally released exactly one year before by the same film company see the trend if you liked those two movies than this movie is more than likely up your alley or as would say right up main streetwanna watch a movie funnier than most comedies now a days here you go wanna watch a movie with better action than most movies now a days here you go there isnt much else i can say without spoilers make no mistake this a rated r film if you dont like violence language sex and what not than obviously this film isnt for you if you want to see an un conventional super hero film that did exactly what it needed to do then this is for you this film has already received insane amounts of hype not saying it doesnt deserve it but dont let it get to you too much the film isnt for everyone but maybe for more people than one would think theres a lot to love in and not much if anything i can complain about if it seems like your cup of tea dont hesitate and slam it back with everything it has to offer thanks for reading and enjoy the flick as much as you can because by the time it ends youll be wanting more,comedy
this is not one to bring a youngster along with or for anyone that is offended by offensive language it is funny and quite adventurous and like all marvel films stan lee has a short cameo it it is worth watching the credits cuz there are many cartoon like items while they run and like so many films these days there is a short scene after all the credits end they just want to keep you there but it is very cute ryan reynolds and morena baccarat are great in it they all are but i especially liked her i watched her in so much in homeland that its tough to lose when she is in the film i also really like the quick reference to one of the short little mutants as ripley in alien 3 when you see it you will know what i mean work the time and money to see and enjoy and laugh at,comedy
i remember the negative hateful reactions xmen origins wolverine got for what it did to the awesome character of who is very loved by the fans at the time i basically knew nothing about the character so i decided to look into him what i found was one of the coolest funniest and most entertaining characters i had ever seen after so many years i am happy to say we finally got the movie we deservedfirst of all ryan reynolds is perfect for playing the role of and he owns every second hes on screen the thing i like about it is you can actually tell he loves the character and most importantly he understands the character he is playing watching him in interviews just lets you know how much he enjoyed playing the merc with a mouththis is an rrated comic book film and it doesnt hold anything back literally it is violent funny meta basically everything i love in a movie and i mean it probably doesnt get any more meta than this and thats why works perfectly because it knows exactly what it is and what it needs to be and it expresses thatthe movie is told in a nonlinear way which absolutely works to its advantage because the plot is very simple especially as a comic book film so the nonlinear way of telling makes it feel original the thing i knew some people were worried about was if the love story was gonna work or not the answer to that is yes because everything that happens between and his girl feels real especially knowing her background and who she is and especially because it actually advances the plot of the movie building our main charactersure like most movies has flaws but they are minimal and i mean minimal it did not take me out of the experience for the most part the only two things that kinda bothered me were that they never really explain exactly what his powers are and considering he jumps abnormally high and does super inhuman back flips i think it should have been explained more although it is implied and it doesnt make any sense at all that the eyes of the costume show emotions and that he himself made a suit that is absolutely perfectly made and tactical but its so awesome and who the hell cares anyway the movie surely doesnt have to emphasize i am looking at this through a microscope because i loved every minute of moshe of the humor works but upon a second viewing it seemed to me that they were trying a little too hard to be funny at timesbut blew me away with its humor violence and especially the meta the scenes i loved the most were when they referenced something real or when it made fun of itself there are some clichs in the movie like the evil british bad guy and the comic relief character but the movie makes fun of those clichs i had a blast with from the opening credits to the postcredits scene i had a big smile on my face 96 of the time its a movie that understands exactly what it is and it executes the things it has to do perfectly is not only one of the greatest comic book movies ever made it is one of the funniest movies i have seen in awhile9610,comedy
worldwide and for years as well it has taken so long to get a film adaptation made for the big screen though the character was featured in the weak xmen origins wolverine the appearance of him wasnt considered worth it as his appearance had been altered and wasnt given the proper character treatment to win over the fans finally after years of development hell ryan reynolds reprises in the way that sticks true to its source material and the results are worth the ticket price and time to watchi wont give away too much on plot details but it does play out as both an origin story and a revenge plot that breaks away from the traditional superhero movie it charts the beginning of as a wisecracking foulmouthed and really abstracted antihero showcasing how he had earned his powers and what made him become this figure i think the plot itself is great and it doesnt drag itself once in the film and best of all it doesnt take a whole movie to establish the main characters origin unlike a certain film from last year coughing fantastic fourin terms of acting there are solid performances throughout but the best of the bunch would definitely be reynolds as wade wilsonthis is possibly his best performance in film to date though i have watched reynolds in other great films such as the change up safe house the voices and even buried but this role in particular is often seen and considered a redeeming role as previously he had played the role of before in xmo wolverine and of course the cheesy but bad green lantern for dc his delivery on humour is present throughout and when things get slightly serious he does what he does best and lightens the moment the supporting cast handle themselves as well as reynolds with game of thrones actor ed skein comic refief tj miller the more tougher female than ronda rousey gina carano and the lovely morena baccarin giving their best to keep the storys characters great only minor negative to say was the films villain wasnt given enough polish as to show why he was bad though we are shown why hes a threat to and was just as powerful as he was but we arent given a true purpose villain that wants to dominate the world but thankfully skein does give his best throughout in both terms of acting and stunt workdirection is strong from first time director tim miller he keeps the film moving along in a decent pace thats not rushed and the production value set for the film is quality assured as costume design visual effects and make up are all worthwhile and its script is pretty polished throughout with humour exciting action setpieces and the best 4th wall breaks meta humour ive seen in years the knocks at both wolverine gl and even the trouble to get a movie made are hilarious in particular overall is a blast of a movie that packs action comedy and superhero clichs into one and even pokes fun of not only itself but breaks the 4th wall in wonderful ways only a fault with its villain in terms of character development will leave you leaving the cinema in the most awesome way possible and stick around after the credits for a cool surprise,comedy
when you go to a movie and the opening credit make you laugh out in hysterics you know this movie is going to be one funny thrill ride has vaulted itself to the top of my list of best adapted comic book to move adaptations ryan reynolds could not have delivered wade wilson to the screen more than what he did everything about was awesomely funny with a side of twisted and perverted definitely not a movie for children and if you did let your child watch this movie you should be evaluated for common sense is for adults so please get off it should be kid friendly we have enough of those let the adults have some sick twisted fun,comedy
okey just omfg wow that was maximum awesomeness indeed finally it has been done a superhero movie for free minded adults it exceeded all my expectations for me its easily already the movie of the year 23 years ago i absolutely didnt know anything about now especially because of this movie hes my favorite superhero without doubt its hilarious violent dirty fresh unique and maybe even offensive for someone so yes its something like a liveaction south park where cartman is the main character d it reminded me as well parody movies from 80s and 90s you had to be always alert have a eye on everything on the screen because you never knew where the next spoof will hide himselfalso you definitely cant ignore the soundtrack which had many nostalgicretro songs for me this was like cherry on top,comedy
i knew a lot about before going to the movie my dad and sister are avid comic book readers and is a family favorite comic to readgoing into the movie you are automatically brought in by the gore and humor at first it was a little too gory but then it became so exaggerated that it seemed more humorous then gory stan lees cameo in the strip club made it all the better ryan reynolds was the perfect person to play this odd marvel character he was funny smart and quick wittedi definitely left the theater happy and wait till after the credits for a special message from in the car home my sister ranked it as the best superhero movie my dad put it in his top 3 while i agree with my sister,comedy

the film was dame straight from the start of the promotions all the film wanted to do is to entertain the bad ass audience from the start to the end of the film has it done it yes it does thanks to the promotion and advertisement team for giving us uber cool super mugssome may say the real hero of the film is its humour but believe me its not the biggest hero of the film is its screenplay the director exactly knew the pulse of the audience and did justice to itryan reynolds is of course the show stealer and morena baccarin looks gorgeous especially in the last 1 hour better dont go late to the show or leave the theater after the film ends because you are going to feel for it afterwards hoping to see more cool ass film making like this,comedy
im not a big fan of superheroes and i didnt enjoy other marvel movies very much but is another story this movie has a bit of everything comedy more like sexual related comedy but hey i think thats what youre here for action a very good story and last but not least love yes is also about love i know the movie felt kind of short though and thats just because i simply wanted more this is not the kind of movie that lets you hanging for nothing like other movies imagine a plot like the good guy is about to shoot the bad guy the good guy so weve come to an end one of us must dieblah blah then he eventually shoots the guy or he escapes in most of the cases well this does not happen in its just constant action story telling and comedy all of them combined ohand ive also seen boobs 1010 equivalent to 57,comedy
is definitely a comedy worth seeing i saw a packed screening and the people in the theater laughed almost nonstop and my dad admitted that it was a film worth watching again the action and special effects are loads of fun but beware that theres a lot of blood and gore invested same goes for the humorthe gags are often juvenile and crasssuch as sexual activity on a holiday or hinting at touching oneselfs so this is far from a family film is a great time at the movies but just expect more adult material from the typical average marvel film if theres one thing the movie does often it frequently breaks the 4th wall and its one of the really great things about this movie has everything you could ever ask from a movie and this is a strong recommendation for marvel fans and adults everywhere also stay after the credits and during the creditsit will make you laugh your head off,comedy
true it isnt batman or even superman still this new hero that i just discovered and watched named or aka wade wilson is still an entertaining and fun character to cheer for and like actually based on a marvel comics character the film rolls the dice and brings fun as seeing how one can be redeemed and fight evil while having feel good fun and joy the backdrop is really simple a former special forces guy named wade wilsonryan reynolds is the victim of a bad experiment and in the meantime hes transformed into and to go along with it he has obtained special powers and a very funny sense of humor while his alter ego has healing powers plus to spice things up on the side has a very sexy and raw aggressive girlfriend named vanessathe attractive morena baccarinwhos a sexy lingerie wearing lady whos good in bed to bad she has to become a damsel in distress by being held by bad guys and even having her mouth taped never fear is to the rescue overall not the greatest film of a hero still its fun odd and different all bringing for a good watching experience,comedy
as i sat in the theatre on opening day hearing roars of laughter burst from all around me at a scene i hadnt realized was meant to be funny i realized that this movie is great its not intelligent original deep or insightful in anyway obviously though it isnt meant to be its a film which targets people who like crude and obnoxious humour reminiscent of archer and succeeds in its entirety although i personally rarely laughed i came to terms that it simply isnt my type of film i appreciated that its fourth wall breaking self aware over the top humour was done perfectly for mainstream audiences ryan reynolds even gives a solid performance portraying an adequate amount of emotion during his origin story while remaining light hearted and comedic during the majority of the film i could dull this review down by naming countless minor flaws i found through the films runtime but that would be pointless no one cares this is an entertaining flick which its target audience is sure to love,comedy
actually went to see the opening premiere at midnight this morning and it was awesome the movie is first of all a treat for the fans but i think it will also appeal to the people that are getting tired of the superhero genre or dislike it ryan reynolds shines as and has really redeemed himself from his other superhero outing on screen from the opening credits to the very end the movie fires off jokes and oneliners at the rate of a machine gun it is a very good homage to the comic book series and the breaking of the fourth wall only disrupted the flow of the movie once for me then again it was in a way that was also done in the comics so i cannot actually fault it if youre worried about sex scenes or the violence well it is in there but honestly most of the stuff you see in the trailer is in the first 20 minutes of the movie after that its a lot less kudos to ryan reynolds and tim miller for bringing this adaptation to the big screen because i loved it and im not even a fanboy for the the comics either,comedy
11 february 2016 film of choice at the plaza dorchester tonight  ryan reynolds absolutely nailed this part the witty one liners and pop culture references had everyone chuckling throughout the plot to put it bluntly was average but you almost didnt notice as it was completely overshadowed by the superbly shot action scenes complete with blood gore and lots of humour reynolds plays wade wilson an ex special forces soldier who has turned to mercenary work to make a living when up he is finally settled in a flourishing relationship and life seems perfect he is diagnosed with a terminal illness as a last resort he turns to a shady underground organisation that offers him a life changing way out what follows is a tale of desperation and revenge as he tries to reverse the effects of the operation the whole film was a complete load of fluff but with lots of humour action and a killer soundtrack and i absolutely loved itmy favourite marvel film to date,comedy
i had a really fun time in the cinema watching this but i feel people are hyping this to ridiculous levels the script is really simple and not that memorable the way they told it was original but not that great also the jokes are funny but in a crude 9gag type of way bunch of pop references dumb and dirty jokes that will get outdated fast the acting and characters arent bad but arent specially good i couldnt really connect with anybody i kinda felt colossus was the most fleshed out character the other just felt like clichs the movie looks really cheap the color grading is absolutely terrible and the cgi goes from bad to decent the action isnt that great also 90 of the best action scenes and gore appeared in the trailers i had fun and laughed a lot watching this movie but it felt more like a stand up show than a real movie it looked like the filmmakers were only worried on making the public laugh and didnt care about making a great movie but its still a lot fun just not that good,comedy
we turned this off after about 15 minutes it really is poor quality full of smutty teenage gay jokes and badly scriptedi fully agree with the many low score reviews on here this is a low quality film best enjoyed by 12 and 13 year old boys who know no bettera real disappointment for the marvel seriesappalling i have never written a film review before but this is so bad that i just felt compelled to inform othersyou have been warned,comedy
was billed as a superhero movie for adults i was skeptical about that claim because im still not convinced that those two terms arent mutually exclusive ive seen it now and as near as i can tell adult really means that its got a dirtier mouth and more graphic violence which makes me despair a bit about the state of adulthood in america but i will say that i enjoyed it much more than any superhero movie in recent memory because its actually funny and doesnt take itself seriously but thats also fairly faint praise because ive pretty much given up on superhero movies and cant even remember the last one i sawryan reynolds can be very funny but he can also be very annoying and hes about equal parts both in this film the movie has a potty mouth that is mostly used to clever and witty effect and some gratuitous nudity is always aok with me but what kept me from really enjoying this film was the casual violence much of it played for laughs i guess this is where the adult thing comes in because i just cant find myself enjoying the gun fetishism in a movie like this the actual gun problems in the real world are too immediate and too concerning to me to be able to relax into the fantasy of a movie like this and my stomach curdles at the thought of the whooping and hollering that i have no doubt went on in audiences of this film as the bullets and the blood flewand though there was talk however brief about this film actually getting some oscar attention that talk was ridiculous nothing about this movie was that goodgrade b,comedy
i didnt really find it funny the humor seemed very gimmicky after a while since a lot of the jokes are 4th wall bending i didnt find it really that clever they put through a lot in this movie and they like to show his pain because i guess that would make the audience feel sympathetic towards our main character however it doesnt really feel uncomfortable for the viewer at any point i wouldve liked it if they added some actual anguish and not just saying this is terrible but i joke about it facing losing your life to cancer is hard enough in itself i felt like the film tried to get it more powerful and effective by piling more and more things on to their character but its really how the characters react to a certain situation not the severity of the situation itself for the character they built and the amount of tragedy there supposedly is there is really not that much emotional reaction that they are able to actually get out it doesnt go very deep into the world that they are in either i didnt really get a fullness feeling out of it so fourth wall breaks dont feel very outrageous at all,comedy
this movie successfully mixes comedy romance action and drama in a very simple story stays true to the comics and overall its almost perfect the effects the compact story the humor and the non linear way to tell this story are definitely the highlights of the movie although i would liked to see crazier the voices were not present which seem to affect character insaneness perception another tiny flaw was the lack of those characteristically stupid and complex plans that somehow work still this small missing parts do no affect the overall resultone of the best comic book movie of all the time a solid 10,comedy
was a pleasant surprise to me despite having some predictable plot points which are quite common to see in many movies not only in those inspired by comicbooks i think does the right thing by not taking itself way too seriously and keeping a decent level of self awareness and while i m not exactly his biggest fan i simply have to admit that ryan reynolds did a remarkable job as portraying this character in way that manages to be twisted and strangely endearing at the same timeyes the humor is pretty juvenile but its effective and it serves to its purpose the crazy darkly humorous tone of the film stands in stark contrast with the seriousness of the xmen filmsand such contrast works incredibly well in my opinionim not sure if this is the best marvel film done to date but is certainly the most entertaining one being a fun ride from beginning to end a violent raunchy and crazy ride but fun anyway,comedy
if you casually dip in and out of the comic genre is a superhero you may have heard the name somewhere on screen before but probably forgotten however if you know your comics then you probably salivated at the prospect of seeing the merc with a mouth going toe to toe with wolverine in the xmans origins movie then you watched it and uttered words that no selfrespecting spell checker should let me typebasically the makers of wolverine origins completely messed up putting it mildly and the fans were not amused yes ryan reynolds was actually a pretty good choice for the gobby antihero but then they pretty much cellotaped his mouth shut and completely reinvented his character in the worst way possible it actually makes a nice change to see a studio admit they totally got it wrong and do something about it even if the decision is largely governed by moneyand that could have been that however luckily mr reynolds himself campaigned to bring a truer representation of the source material to the big screen and amazingly it happened and im so glad it didis a superhero movie you probably guessed that  you have the man in a mask who you pretty much know is going to go out there and beat the baddies and save the girl yadder yadder yadder however what also is is a comedy that being said  its not a spoof its a tongueincheek little number which has better action scenes than most action films and better comedy than most comedy filmsim almost tempted to say that its a film that anyone can enjoy i can certainly see both men and women having a good time watching it however it definitely is a film for men and women whereas marvels current cinematic universe is kind of geared at kids and us kids who never grew up there is plenty in that no parent will want to explain to their little darling again dont let that fool you into thinking that its all toilet humour  lets just call it adult humour and leave it at thatbasically is great ryan reynolds is mouthy but never annoying and totally owns the role as it should be when he plays the titular character the supporting cast all do their bit but its himself all the way please let this be the start of a franchise its probably a little too much to expect to see him crossing studio picket lines and ending up in the marvel universe where he  truly  belongs but we can always hope if nothing else im well up for a 2 outing,comedy
 it is the first of eight comic book movies whose will come out in this year 2016 it is part of the xmen francaise which had its ups and downs over the years to summaries is the best meta movie ive seen for a long time and makes justice to the character of as well as the superhero movies as a whole the movie is full with gore  fun excellent fourth wall breaks even one sixteen wall break and the metahumor was perfectly in mod with the today world by far this movie open this year superhero movies with an explosion and silences all the haters who talk about superhero fatigue go talk you fools about young adults movie fatigue to conclude go to watch you will not be disappointed like with him previous incarnationwho everyone wants to forget,comedy
before i went to this movie i had seen a trailer with an unexpected expletive unfortunately the rest of the movie was much the same im not a prude or killjoy but i thought marvel movies was above this i understand is an unconventional character and obviously the director etc had this great idea of making a really cool totally awesome movie dude that appeals directly to the 15 year old mindalas im 44 and except for a few interesting fight scenes found it rather dull i suppose hoping for anything slightly intellectual or even a real story was a very misguided idea on my part my wife felt exactly the same we love the marvel movies mostly as the story lines have some real bite in my book the worst marvel movie to date green lantern was better,comedy
is not only the funniest movie ive ever seen its also the best the jokes are hilarious the theater was full of laughter even from the very first scene the laughing continued until the after credits bit and proceeded out the doors and into the streets everyone loved it and on top of that the action was fantastic the cinematic shots were nothing short of a masterpiece and the dramatic stills and narration only served to maximize the experience the character of was also very well written he was funny whilst also remaining complex and emotional overall if crude jokes gore and overall silliness is something you look for in a film go see oh and make sure to bring your brown pants,comedy
well im glad to say they didnt ruin at all the delicate balance of meta humor ultraviolence and romantic drama ran the risk of becoming an amorphous combination of blood and vulgarity without any character or texture fortunately the film captures the spirit of the character pretty well accommodating his contradictory aspects in an ingenious structure of flashbacks monologues and flash forwards which rarely stumbles in its relentless advance to what probably will end up being a successful franchise or subfranchise because is set in the same universe as the xmen movies like the participation of a pair of mutants proves in order not to ruin the constant and abundant surprises of i will refrain myself from mentioning all the things i liked therefore i think it will be more efficient to mention some small complaints i have against it the screenplay is very well built and developed in a way that the spectator receives constant doses of action humor and drama director tim miller and coscreenwriters rhett reese and paul wernick play with time in order to keep things on a constant movement not only visually but also narratively and as a consequence every fight explosion and chase contributes to the development of the characters and the general story however that general story feels a bit light when we realize its thematic austerity dont misunderstand me the screenplay is very funny with an adequate consistency and internal logic but i would have preferred it to be more ambitious genuinely satirical instead of selfreferential and the villain feels too generic and insipid speaking of which i finally fulfilled my fantasy of watching gina carano in a super hero film pity that it wasnt as wonder woman but as a simple sidekick of the villain with some good scenes but few prospects for the future another complaint the special effects sure the superhero films experiment a frequent digital fatigue but in the case of the problem is the quality instead of the quantity one of the digitally created characters doesnt work as an actor even though it has some solid battles during the third act and a chase with many vehicles has so many cybercrashes that it seems a mediocre cars video game from the 90s the render is perfect but when things lack of mass or inertia they automatically feel fake and they occasionally damaged the exciting and very entertaining experience i had with a bit finally the actors make a competent work in their roles highlighting ryan reynolds and morena baccarin their romantic interaction feels sincere and spontaneous giving the film the emotional axis which avoids it from being a cynical and monotonous selfparody like it happened to kickass 2 in conclusion redeems 20th century fox for the fantastic four fiasco and it definitely represents a step in the right direction respecting the character without trying to change or improve him during his transition to the big screen,comedy
if youre a hardcore fan you will want to watch this about 10 times if youre a just a movie fan then you will absolutely love it anyway its the most accurate comic book movie to date it has everything comedy so many laugh out loud moments action sequences that are also cinematically amazing and theres a love story in there too which doesnt fail to bring the emotions among the comedy and action in the film this is seriously worth the watch in a cinema with all the fourth wall breaks it makes it so much fun to have him look down at you and deliver a punchline or clean the camera it gives you a different cinema experience which is definitely refreshing to all the other movies lately lastly the post credit scene is also definitely worth waiting for with the nod to ferris buellers day off,comedy
comic book movies for adults is like the problem american car makers finally solved quit trying to compete with japanese auto makers and bring back muscle cars now adults can have content too can be as filthy mouthed and cut as many heads off people and shoot as many people as he wishes and we can all cheer and root him on and on as this doesnt have any really super spoilers other than one if you or anyone close to you has cancer be prepared to have a new favorite f superhero even if if one comes out beating this dread monster of a disease i am glad it is i hope the movie makes 5 trillion dollars ,comedy
ok first i didnt expect that this movie is vulgar and violent and of course it will be like that this is you know what i mean this movie everything n balance great actingactionjokesvisual effect and of course ryan reynolds who born for that guy is before i just feel bad about colossus and his voicei just dont like it and this movie we have new mutant we never heard about it negasonic teenage warhead like say whaaat  that is the coolest name of course he is talent and abilities very cool last thing and he is one of the best part of the movie after credit scene ooh you are the best,comedy
speaking as a fan this movie is just as good as i could hope for seeing foxs track record as latethe movie itself is pretty straight forward which the trailers essentially told you the whole movie thats not to say that it was bad but it did take an unusual narrative structure to tell its story to help stand apart from current marvel and dc filmseven the easter eggs and breaking of the fourth wall help to enhance the movie in the sense that it knows what it is as a movie and what movie universe it is set in because it helps to drive the movie forward and even point out some of its own plot holesthe r rating is well deserved in my opinion it is not for kids take the violence of daredevil sex scenes of jessica jones and mild emotional tones of the dark knight trilogy and you get deadpoolin the end it may be a fox produced movie set in the xmen universe but its so different of style youd think it was set in the marvel cinematic universe highly recommended,comedy
second times the charm as fox redoes in his very own movie after the debacle that was xmen orgings wolverine back in 2009 again played by huge fan of the comic ryan reynolds but with a much better understanding of what it is that makes wade wilson so special for his fans this proves to be exactly the movie that we were expecting however that is not to say that to enjoy this you must be a knowledgeable comic book fan or even a fan at all the audience is properly introduced to the character his world and his peculiar set of values in a way that if you pick up any new mutant story tomorrow you will know exactly what to expect from the merc with a mouththat is the same that you are getting in tim millers feature directorial debut violence profanity fourth wall breaking pop culture references comedy and non stop fun this might not be a masterpiece but that is not what its supposed to be nor was it trying to what it will most likely end up being is the most fun comic adaptation of a year that is filled with them and that is no small accomplishment highly recommend it just knowing before hand that this is in no way like the disney marvel movies probably best to leave kids under 13 at home helmed by miller most definitely with some input by starproducer reynolds who got the best out of the cast this is not the hero we needed or the hero we deserved its the ass kicker we wanted,comedy
is definitely one of the most original creative unique films superhero or not ever made and it completely shattered all huge expectations i had so what matters to saythe story is really really simple its an origin story with a revenge story but the narrative is told in a really fun way inducing a lot of curiosity and investment and being this simple is what actually makes the screenplay so good because it as time to do s much more like comedyits a comedy with action not the other way around though theres plenty of action and the pace is super fast theres insane action scenes with epic showdowns though the film is very small scale and once again this is what makes it so good because it goes against everything you are used to seethis is one of the most consistent films ive ever seen from the very first second where you watch a credits sequence bound to be a classic setting up the mood in the most perfect way possible to literally the last one where you have a post credits sequence that can top the one from the avengers because of how it plays with the concept and the audience it constantly delivers and is constantly perfect i can count on one hand how many films all comedies in history made me laugh so hard and constantly and i dont think i ever saw an audience laugh so much in a theater ever the humour is without equal with a million jokes i really cant imagine how someone could come up with so much great stuff for the entire film the writers really deserve a lot of praisethe film jokes about everything literally about fox how it was made the marvel films its system and clichs tons of other movies ryan reynolds itself anything you can imagine its a pop culture galore and you will probably enjoy it a little more if you know all about it though the best part is that its designed so that you can enjoy it even if you dont knowits a festival of violence for sure and it earns its r rating ryan reynolds owns the role and basically gives an unforgettable performance and the rest of the cast is also quite incredible and the one that can actually be at the same level as reynolds is the amazing morena baccarin the visual effects are great but not perfect and it could have benefited from a bit bigger budget for this but it isnt the most important thing not by a long distance the score is really great though not what it could be and i felt that it didnt add much to the film actuallyis the ultimate anti superhero film a game changer that will actually make the people behind superhero movies to open their eyes and take things to a new level its super fast super energetic with a style without equal mostly thanks to breaking the fourth wall and dark humor approach its surprising as it is different from everything you are used to see in a superhero film its a laugh festival that you have to make sure to wear the yellow pants so no one can see you its a film were you are instantly invested and in love with the characters that no matter how comic and violent it is it has a huge heart and everyone from the writers to the director to the cast should have all the praise possible for creating such a perfect film given that this is bound to be a huge success and the second xmen trilogy is ending its a foregone conclusion that a new era is about to come one where will be in everything,comedy
i had high expectations for this the trailers looked awesome and it was r rated when was the last time a good comic book movie was r rated answer 2012s excellent dredd ryan reynolds gets to redeem himself after the disappointing deadpoolinnameonly from 2009s xmen origins wolverine although nobody blames reynolds himself for that as it was clearly the writers and studio instead with this film we get the we always wanted fourthwall breaking constant quipping and the aforementioned r rated violence reynolds is perfect in the role banishing memories of green lanterns and mouthsewnshut mercs of the past one a side note i much prefer this colossus to the one in previous xmen films stefan kapicic provides the voice for the motioncaptured xman and he really nails the character brianna hildebrand as negasonic teenage warhead was lots of fun too add to that a fantastic soundtrack and one kick ass final action scene and this is one hell of a good time after the nonevent comic book movies of 2015 weve got our first winner out of the gate for 2016 and in a year where well see not one but two films with heavyweight superhero smackdowns this one may have already beaten both already im going back to see it it at least twice more bring on the sequel oh and i wont be getting salt n pepa out of my head any time soon uh here i go here i go here i go again girls whats my weakness men okay then chillin chillin mindin my business ,comedy
is directed by tim miller and stars ryan reynolds morena baccarin tj miller and ed skrein first off when they finally say their doing this movie i was so excited for it but i was also worried how will they handle this amazing and funny character i was 100 wrong they made fantastic better than fantastic everything thing was done so well the acting action comedy storytelling everything ryan reynolds is truly this whole movie he did an amazing job born to play this role tj miller was great too i feel like they could of used him more but he was still funny the villain was good nothing special just a good villain the action scenes were fantastic fast and surprising very funny too the only negative i had with the movie was the plot its be done before and everything like that but it didnt very hurt the overall experience of this amazing move also some of humor didnt hit as much they probably wanted too but theres not much of that overall was the movie that fans wanted for so long had everything they promised and more great action and even better comedy even if your not a fan of go and watch it you will not be disappointed,comedy
i just came from watching and its the first time in such a long time that ive been needing to write a reviewwas such a great movie it truly lived up to the hype not since guardians of the galaxy have i seen a superheroes movie play true homage to the original content is all about the jokes the fun breaking the 4th wall and not taking itself too serious and this movie has all of that the casting is also top notch ryan reynolds was born to play as he is quite similar in many aspects and the fact that he makes fun of himself in the movie for being too pretty genius overall id say that its been the best 12 dollars ive spent in a very long time,comedy
fans of have waited at least 7 years for the merc with a mouthto get his own film and finally we have it but even better is after the wait it delivers ryan reynolds is perfectly cast as and his dedication to getting the character right forms a true portrayal of a character that is very hard to get right as we learned 7 years ago is hilarious bitingly smart and paced like the foul mouthed energizer bunny from hell in an interview reynolds said this film has been in production for 11 years it would seem that the long wait helped the film because by the time they finally made it everybody involved wanted to get it rightis genuinely hilarious film by that i mean there are multiple times where everybody in the theater laugh hysterically the film is even funnier for those that love and know all about comic book films because it makes snide comments about the studio and the genre all throughout fans of the character will appreciate the fact that doesnt pull any punches its hilarious from the opening credits to the post credits scene on top of that reynolds comedic chops are perfectly complemented by the foul mouthed antiheroit shouldnt come as any kind of a surprise that is a meta film as the characters trademarks are breaking the fourth wall and poking fun at other comic book characters the film manages to avoid being clichd because of its meta film approach and while not dodging all clichs it winks when it uses one for those that have seen or genuinely obsess over comic book films the film is littered with snide pokes at the genre and a warning for those interested these pokes come early and often the film is witty to a fault and honors the character perfectlyfrom the hilarious opening of the film to the post credits scene the pacing of the film is frenetic the film begins with a bang and brilliantly tells its story in a nonlinear format that keeps the film from ever feeling slow it would have been nice if the low budget hadnt been so noticeable despite the fact that it gives plenty of fodder one thing that seemed poorly done was the colossus character because hes featured in the other xmen films as a completely different character in look and personalityin the end lovers of the character will love the film because its faithful to everything the character embodies the film is smart funny wellpaced and builds off reynolds performance to make a genuinely entertaining film the film has a few small flaws that are few and far between but overall succeeds in respectfully bringing the merc with a mouth to the big screen note that this film is very mature but when looking for a great film for an adults night out this film is perfect,comedy
ive been waiting this movie since i watch the trailer i actually dont know what to say or explain but if youre a big fan of marvel like i do youre gonna like this movie the story line its so classy simply and entertaining god i really enjoyed this movie last night and all the audience was so in love with this movie i see them laugh not like uugh laugh but this is so dang funny man satisfied for sure i hope they will continue with dp ii every minutes in this movie is a thing and ryan reynolds killed it you killed it man but this is not just a funny movie of course when i watched this i feel like touched too the love is in the air the dp love everyone i think i will watch this movie again sorry not sorry woohoo,comedy
in fact this movie doesnt really need a critic because its a fact that this movie was perfect in every aspect and im talking as a nondcmarvel faninsanely great comedy with great jokes at the right moment  specific and interesting spoofs  acceptable sex scenes and nudity  decent violence for a rated superhero movie  a bit of gore to give us that extra taste  decent use of bad language  epic action mainly at the very beginning and the very end  great comic adaptation  creative story displayi could pass all day describing all the positive points of it though on the other hand i cannot find a single negative side of it even those credit scenes were very well doneoverall besides being a great superhero movie it also is a very good comedy and action movie and  i dont doubt that this movie can be considered the best super hero movie ever made until nowi give 10 stars and in my opinion it does not deserve anything below 9 talking as the general audience,comedy
this movie meant a lot to me in so many way i fell in love with this character about 10 years ago and have long awaited a movie presence of him as you can imagine i was quite disappointed by his first silver screen appearance in xmen origins wolverine where he was more of a baraka hybrid however this film made sure to stay true to its comic book heritage the first time i saw the film was via a competition in which i got to see it 2 weeks before the uk release date amongst a few of the actors i was pleasantly surprised by how well the story was told explaining the origin but yet getting straight to the action ryan reynolds did a fantastic roll as a producer but a better roll as an actor he captured wade wilsons personality so well making him likable but yet fearsome at times the tone of the movie frequently changes from comical to serious and sometimes even emotional this helps the film not feel overloaded or intense all the jokes said by are very apt and even come straight from the comics itself like the sharpei gag that was a very nice touch which im sure went past the non comic book readersthe rest of the cast added great support while not being too distracting i found a growing interest in colossus as a character someone who i felt never showed his full potential on screen in the xmen films on that note it would of been nice to see more xmen characters involved which still does not make any sense to me as fox studio has the rights to use them unless it was done on purpose himself does reference that issueseeing the film again on the release date allowed me to study it and make note of certain things i might of missed but all it did was cement the idea of how much i love this film it did not become repetitive it still felt fresh and funnyyoure probably wondering why i did not give it 10 out of 10 well at times i felt the film needed a secondary storyline to help build a gripping narrative however that might of been problematic from the way its story was told hopefully the next time graces the big screen again there will be an opportunity for it to do soi think it took the mistakes from last depiction to really appreciate this film as the ultimate superhero movie,comedy
its been almost a week im still in shock i feel imdb has let me down for probably the first time i watched this movie on a private screening with my gf no one else bought a ticket o  this movie is surly a work of teenagers at some stage of their growing up the acting is okish the punchlines are embarrassing there are moments when you thinkfeel this movie could turn into a masterpiece in one twist of event but then it just never happensi would only watch this if zapping on tv on lazy afternoon and then i would also not watch the whole thing as zapping to anything else seems a good idea at several childish moments throughout,comedy
ryan reynolds is a good comedian and morena baccarin is always one of the most beautiful women ever unfortunately for me both gemini and married the movie is simply goofy fun dynamic crazy at moments offbeat and entertaining full of good oneliners jokes really arent as bad as some of the reviewers suggest here if we take the whole context into the account the highlight of this movie is not exceptional sfx but humor essentially this is a mockery but who says superheroes cannot be fun as many observed here not for children and language is a minor issue here still exceptionally entertaining and i watched it with many smirks on my face lets say intelligently fatuous just the way i like it worth watching several times to catch all the details yup its fast paced go for it,comedy
first of all i am not a fan of comic book hero movies and i hate action filmsthis one is both but i absolutely loved it why its funny i watched comedies and i didnt laugh once but this movie made me laugh all the way its funny its packed with humor good music and romance i judge a movie by the feeling i have after watching and this one put a big smile on my face made me feel good and i never really liked ryan reynolds now go figure psone of the fellow users put the fans of this movie into some categoriesi find that very offensive besides im a middleaged mother of three and my favorite genre is horror and psychological thriller so i dont think i fit anywhere go see the movie,comedy
never mind all the fuss about the movie being unsuitable for kids parents would be very stupid if they generalize all movies with costumed characters in them as movies suitable for kids finally received justice in treatment for a movie this movie kept it staying true to the characters whole aspects the fourth wall breaking the smart mouth the crazy comedies and all the nicely flowed action though it seems that the studio put some distance to the wider xmen franchise by only showing the groups name and references without any cameo from the previous movies in itself has already been a great fun,comedy
to be honest i had high expectations because the main character is presented as a funny smart and insane guy in the comicsbut to my surprise i wasnt disappointed at all tho it is one of the movies that will last for 4 years max because the jokes sort of relate to todays trends like internet hashtags and similar but i would definitely recommend watching it and i am sure i shall watch it again anytime soon the plot is one of a kind sticks to the main subject and doesnt bore you with random fillers the very beginning with the cast names is already hilarious enough and so is the ending scene credts in my opinion they tried really hard for this movie and gave us what we wanted as fans the next movie i am expecting is suicide squad i guess they have competitors dont they  good luck ss,comedy
follows wade wilson as he gets diagnosed with terminal cancer and enters a program to hopefully cure his cancer soon everything goes awry and he becomes immortal and horribly disfigured after taking some time he goes after the man responsible in an attempt to get his powers reversed and becomes the antihero deadpoolthis movie was great lets start with the acting ryan reynolds redeems himself for xmen origins and then some with this amazing performance he has the comedic timing and acting chops you would never have expected from him given his previous film work hes the thing that really holds this movie together and its great morena baccarin is also great as wades girlfriend and eventual fianc veronica ed skreins ajax also known as francis is a kindof onenote villain well get to that later but he does a good job in the role making up slightly for the transporter reloaded tj miller is a riot as the comic relief and brianna hildebrand does a great job as negasonic teenage warheadthe writing done by writers rhett reese and paul wernick who also wrote zombieland was spot on the movie continuously throws jokes at you left and right and even if some dont land the ones that do make you laugh extremely hard even after my second watch i still found myself laughing at quite a few of the jokes its a movie that you definitely need to watch again to be able to catch more of the jokes and more about the moviethe score done by junkie xl and also the general music choice was great i particularly like the song maximum effort the use of songs like angel in the morning x gon give it to ya and careless whisper were all warranted and really enhanced the experience i think my one issue with the film as a whole is basically the villain he feels a little onenote as we only ever see him through eyes except at the beginning of the movie i wish he had been given a little more development and had been a more compelling villain as a whole but really this is a minor nitpick in a great movieoverall is a fun time at the movies if youre looking for a film that you and some buddies can just have some fun and laugh around at this is most definitely up your alley the acting the score the writing and mostly everything else was fantastic go see it if you havent as its a fun time but dont bring the kids seriously they earned that r rating i want that 2 now please,comedy
there arent many good moments in 2009s xmen origins wolverine but ryan reynolds turn as the motormouthed special ops agent wade wilson was one of them naturally because everything in origins is awful they cut him from the picture early on and when he returns his mouth is sewn shut scott adkins replaced reynolds and the character was clumsily referred to as both the and weapon xi everything that could go wrong did go wrong with the studios treatment of the character and the last 6  years have been trying to give the merc with a mouth who also has a devoted following from his fourthwall breaking comics the movie he deservesdirector tim miller has accomplished this feat with which may be a little rote when it comes to rebooting the character into a fresh origin story while still getting in some jabs at wolverine the movie the xman and the actor but is an absolutely delight when it throws reynolds into the blackandred suit and has him slicing and shooting his way through hard rrated mayhem although the movie cant really do much with its thin love story its enough to carry us to what we really want filthy insults a charming mix of clever and crude humor and a blooddrenched bloody good time moving through a series of flashbacks the movie slowly gets us up to date on the story of wade wilson reynolds a former special ops soldier who now makes a living by being a bad guy to worse guys while at his favorite bar wade meets and falls in love with the thin and thinlydrawn vanessa morena baccarin whos just as messed up as he is however their bliss is shortlived when wade gets cancer and seeks out radical treatment from a shady figure who ultimately leads him to meet ajax ed skrein a mad scientist who wants to unlock wades mutant genes and turn him into a superslave to the highest bidder that sends wade out on a mission of revenge and also with the hope that ajax can reverse our antiheros disfigurementwhile wade certainly wont be winning any beauty pageants any time soon the film wants to sell us on an unbreakable love between him and vanessa thats also so fragile that she would go running if she caught sight of him so when tells us that this is a love story its hard to take him one of his few serious statements seriously but the character does need some positive motivation and his love for vanessa is just enough to balance out his overpowering rage and insanity which is where the film takes the majority of its joy the love story angle is basically a minor halfhearted apology for the ensuing foulmouthed glorious bloodbath and it almost makes me wish we could just skip ahead to 2 where everyone is on board with this character because reynolds miller and screenwriters rhett reese  paul wernick know him inside and out this is almost the best adaptation fans could have hoped for and while hes shackled to an origin story that sends us jumping back and forth in time its the only way to get the film out to an energetic start if the script had gone chronologically most of the audience would have probably tuned out before things got really goodbasically whenever wade is in full regalia the movie is electric from the brilliant opening credits to the clever closing joke is deadon with its sense of humor and incisive wit and while it doesnt thoroughly skewer superhero movies or take note of the current climate it tends to nail any target in its crosshairs including 20th century fox hugh jackman and others theres nothing meanspirited in the movies tone we just get wrapped up in the characters irreverence is just about everything you could hope for from a movie given the boundaries of a its an origin story b it has to bring in people who are unfamiliar with the character and c its upending traditional superhero tropes even with these restraints the film is often an absolute blast that had me rolling over with laughter again and again its a shame we had to wait so long for to mouth off again but hopefully hell be serving up some shortchanges in the nottoodistant future,comedy
2016  ryan reynolds morena baccarin tj miller ed skrein stefan kapicic brianna hildebrand leslie uggams dark and tongueincheek adaptation of marvel comics cult comic book hero reynolds filling out his quota frankly as a hero cmon buddy give some one else a break  a mercenary who becomes invincible after being tortured into mutation after being diagnosed with terminal cancer and in a last ditch effort to be cured  who seeks vengeance while dispatching sardonic quips and bloodletting with mad skills yo directed with lan by tim miller and a tadtooinlovewithitself meta screenplay by rhett reese and paul wernick has more hit than miss brio with style and over the top brio than your average origin flick baccarin adds sultry sexiness as the heros hooker with a heart of gold and millers deadpan dork sidekick much needed guffaws snarky and fun to a certain extent and some killer opening credits and closing ones too the stuff in between is just gravy,comedy
what a way to start the comic book movies of 2016 huhfirst of all ryan reynolds shines in the role truly shines he is and i cant think of any actor that can match what he did in the film second this is rated r and going in i was expecting of course a lot of violence nudity etc and that aspect of the movie didnt disappoint me at all it thoroughly goes all in with that and i really enjoyed it the humor was so executed effectively and was really sharp for most of the time the action was good for the most part especially in the beginning and right at the end this is a fast paced movie so for most of the movie i wasnt really bored scoresoundtrack was awesomewith the things i didnt like with movie it was mostly the antagonist and the second act i didnt really care for the villain for his character was empty and lacked background for me the things we learned from wade wilson and his back story while was fine in the movie it does take away some of the energy from the film itself it started so strong that the madness does backtrack a little bit that being said there were some strong fun to be had during those points of the movie overall this is a pure and genuine comic book movie that doesnt hold back from all the craziness and enjoyment dont take the movie way too seriously and youre going to have a great time,comedy
going into the film i was not sure because of average critic reviews but boy were they wrong this was the most awesome gruesome brilliantly funny and clever superhero movie i have seen in a long time there is no one on earth that could play pool better than ryan reynolds and im not sure where the stories going to go but i can smell a quick sequel be careful to watch out for the many references to pop culture as well as many other movies oh and by the way for your own sake stay after the credits it is brilliant with a hilarious cameo as a dj in a strip clubbrothel stan lee steals the scene as well as the references to other movies it is also jampacked with xmen and other marvel movie gags so rewatch them so you can get full enjoyment although you could argue that besides there is no other real backstory or character development for any other characters which is partly true but this movie is a hilarious splatterfest filled with gags and multiple forthwall breaks that is not meant to be taken too seriously and for a movie that comes out the same time zoolander 2 it blows it out of the water oh and just to add this had some of the best advertising and trailers leading up to the film that i have ever ever seen yeah so go see it asapps this is not your ordinary date movie just to let you know,comedy
ryan reynolds best performance yet god was he made for this role it just suits him so well if its not obvious yet i fg loved this movie and place it among my all time favorite superhero movies a guardians of the galaxy and avengers granted the story was way less grand no eminent threat to the globe and mankind as a whole but the cast and the manuscript just brillianti definitely recommend this to others although you might not want to take yungsters or ur grandma as has the movie has some serious gore and adult jokes in it d,comedy
this film has finally corrected the mistakes made by the origins version of it was the perfect blend of hilarious humour and brutal fight scenes i have been waiting for this movie for what seems like forever and i can honestly say it will be my favourite all time film guardians of the galaxy definitely set the bar high for humour for the marvel universe but then came a long and honestly made gotg look like it tried to hard i love this movie watch it seriously do not miss out on what is the best film ever made of a comic book,comedy
this is going to be the kind of film that gets better with every watch some jokes i almost didnt catch and considering how many subtle touches there are im sure there are things that blew right past me good thing i intend to rewatch it over and over again i have to be honest and say some jokes didnt land with me because id heard them a hundred times in the trailers but dont for a second think the best jokes were wasted the humor evolves throughout the film waking you up during the opening credits and building from there as you jump back and forth between the love struck wade wilson and the post cancer cure wade wilson this style of story telling worked really well in terms of giving us lots of bang for our buck evenly across all three acts while still being able to tell us what we need to know about originryan reynolds makes this film tj miller is kind of just tj miller which is usually fine because no ones better at being tj miller than tj miller but as a really big fan of weasel yes such a thing exists i was disappointed that writing wise they sidelined his canon purpose in life but i have to be fair and say the changes worked for the story i couldnt get enough of leslie uggams as blind al and brianna hildebrand as negasonic teenage warhead was so damn cool and we better get more of her in this universe but back to ryan reynolds not only was he born to play this part but thank the film gods that he was a producer when that was announced shortly after the test footage leak i was so relieved is mostly masked for the film and what a joy it is to see the scarred comic nut job come to life on screeni had people in my group who werent at all familiar with before this and it was fun to hear them enjoy the film and talk about it afterwards with lots of praise and energy any fan will cry tears of joy to see this property handled better than we could have dreamed,comedy
thanks to fox bringing marvels mercenary with the mouth to life and got him right after xmen origins wolverine ryan reynolds is amazing as he acts like he always want to be a marvel superhero the fourth wall breaks are hilarious as well as interacts with the audience its like hes actually talking to us during the movie the rest of the movie is just amazing with its incredible action sequences funny pop culture references and what the comics are all about the villain nothing new though hes like this mad doctor who wants to make experiments on people but i will give him credit that he can do some awesome fights with wade this movie is just one heck of a thrill ride of awesome visuals descent fight scenes and some pop culture references and fourth wall breaking to make every fan exited,comedy
2016 is the first superhero film to arrive this year and sure has a lot of competition from giant blockbuster superhero films such as batman vs superman 2016 and captain america civil war 2016 do to its risqu rrating full of violence foul language and awkward sex scenescomments it seemed that had a lot to possibly loose or gain especially for 20th century fox and their xmen character rightseven though is not the first rrated superhero film ever made the punisher 2004 and watchmen 2009 to name a few it is the first to push full on marvel style fun with a raunchy rrating the film succeeds in being fun entertainment while also staying true to the character of deadpoolryan reynolds completely redeems himself as wade wilsonafter the underwhelming and dull xmen origins wolverine 2009 and proves that this is the role he was meant to play his snarky immature humor hyper active personality and especially his voice help make one of the most lovable or maybe unlovable to some characters in superhero cinema todaythe other supporting characters dont have as much to go on as aside from colossus whom shines more here than in any past xmen film the rest of the cast seems to just be there for the story elements a villain henchman or woman girlfriend and best friend this is a film however so wouldnt want any other characters stealing his showis well filmed and the way he breaks the fourth wall feels natural and not out of place director tim miller may not have a lot on his film resume but he proves that he knows this character through and through with his techniquethis film is great entertainment and proves that you dont have to be associated with a pg13 rating or disneymarvel studios to make a successful superhero movie it will be interesting to see how affects the future of its xmen franchise and other superhero franchises in the years to come especially now that the 2 is being made im hoping that studios take this as a lesson in making a true character to the comics not just making an rrated film for the sake of an rrating,comedy
it is evident for around 5 minutes of gavin hoods disastrous xmen origins wolverine 2009 that fox were onto something with their casting of ryan reynolds as the gobby mercenary wade wilson aka that was until he had his mouth sown together and turned into a super weapon before he could resemble anything like the character who had garnered a legion of loyal readers in marvels comicbook world talks of a reboot were in the air even since and despite reynolds public support of the movie and obvious fan anticipation it felt like it would never happenwith fox now piecing their beloved and highly lucrative franchise back together following days of future pasts resetting of the timeline deleting hoods movie and brett ratner atrocious xmen the last stand in the process the merc with a mouth finally arrived to glowing reviews fan adoration and a boxoffice taking that was beyond anyones expectations the early trailers teased that the character would be at his foulmouthed sarcastic best and although is set firmly within the same universe as xaviers school for gifted youngsters it certainly doesnt follow the same rulesis all about and so the plot can be summed up within the same sentence the climax essentially plays out throughout the entire movie with ryan reynolds alreadysuitedup hero ambushing a gang of bad guys on a freeway and taking them out in various gruesome ways we flash back to his time working as muscleforhire in new york where he meets escort vanessa morena baccarin at a bar and the two fall in love wade soon learns he has aggressive cancer and without vanessas knowledge volunteers for an experimental treatment that he soon learns consists of torture at the hands of ajax ed skrein who hopes to awaken latent mutant genes in his subjects he escapes the lab with the ability to heal but permanently disfigured with a plan to take revenge and win back vanessaa lot of success has been put down to its r rating and the film certainly flaunts its freedom to make dick jokes and kill its characters in a variety of gruesome ways while this may be the case to some degree it seems that people forget is most importantly offering something different in an alreadyovercrowded superhero market while the filthy sense of humour does grate at times especially whenever wades friend weasel tj miller is on screen is anything but the traditional brooding superhero with the weight of the world on their shoulders he is selfish and self absorbed yet motivated by his love for vanessa repeatedly breaking the fourth wall and informing us that he is fully aware of his role in the movie when he is dragged by xmen colossus stefan kapicic and negasonic teenage warhead brianna hildebrand to professor xs mansion he wonders whether it will be patrick stewart or james mcavoy awaiting himbut the lowkey approach although refreshing also shrinks the movie the fragmented narrative offers a slightly new take on the origin movie but take this away and the film still falls into the same genre trappings theres the love interest the lifechanging experiment the forgettable bad guy  all tropes covered in a hundred films before it so without an enticing plot to sink the teeth into a lot falls on the charisma of reynolds as a character intended to provoke a strong reaction thankfully reynolds gives his best performance a role worthy of his natural screen presence and slightly idiosyncratic delivery whether the humour is for you or not it certainly made me laugh out loud throughout you have to admire director tim millers belief in such a risky project and it will hopefully open the gates to the possibility of more adult superhero movies in a genre always in need of fresh input,comedy
watching the movie is a complete waste of time it should be totally avoided the rating of more than 8 is completely weird it does not deserve a rating of more than 2 that too because of some 1015 minute of violent action scenes and thats it watching this movie is like watching a failed experiment of the producerdirector of mixing kickass and xmen is failed experiment of borrowing pool of old super heroes but the movie is plain dead to watch to say the least starting movie is somewhat good for say 15 minutes and after it is xmen in kick ass suit and very boring and slow save your time and avoid this one,comedy
toilet humour at an all time low posing as comic creativityfor those who like to hear the f word and mf word in every sentence sometimesreferences to anuses as a change and like their bowel movement on toast for breakfast then this film should be enjoyablesurely film makers should know that gay humour just doesnt work on screen well apart from those who like to hear the f,comedy
ryan reynolds got the role he was born to play funny from the beginning to the end i like the movie references like  dont make the suit green  because of the poor success of green lantern,comedy
a good movie not at all worst superhero movie in existence,comedy
hilarious from beginning to end all of these low reviews are from people that must never see rates r comedies or action movies not only did it show an antihero xman but it successfully blended in a love story as well as showing a convincing origin story yes theres sex language and violence but none is inappropriate for a mutant anti hero that is in love and wants to become normal again ive heard worse language that is unnecessary and out of place in many action movies more ill placed and horribly long runs of violence in movies like the matrix sequels  which by the way for the most part i enjoyed  and horror movies and inappropriate sex scenes in all of the above in this movie everything fits which is rare its rated r so common sense tells you this isnt a kids movie and was never meant to be there are a lot of xmen movies id never watch more then once mostly because they have become repetitive and far from unique this was a refreshing change for people like me that are not comic buffs and need the whole back story explained to me from someone who is i would say if youre have a bad day and need to laugh watch this movie it will not disappoint no matter how many times youve seen it,comedy
there was a time in film making history where movies were much more family oriented wholesome for both children and adults that isnt to say there wasnt already a separation between children and adult films though adult films were approached more conservatively and were cautious about how they were presented that approach has been lost today in society as morality is being forgotten as something of the past and the future is immorality this is as a filmryan reynolds was undoubtedly the perfect choice to play the iconic character the foulmouthed sexually active vulgar and merciless kill dudes left right and center mercenary the character represents everything that used to be considered wrong and immoral to humanity to sum up focal points the graphic violence is gutwrenching all throughout although some if it is fun the humor as funny as it can be sometimes is crude and vulgar sex is active in this movie very active whats more shocking coming from a catholic perspective is how this is what society calls entertainment obviously this film is not geared towards children as anyone opposed to this viewers opinion would say and while that may be true it is also false how can anyone say isnt geared toward children the film definitely not when his costumed appearance is already attractive for them as well as the fact that he is portrayed in cartoon shows and video games already geared toward a younger audience this film overall represents how ugly we have become as a culturethat isnt to say the films not without its good moments this is the reason for the 5 star rating the action can be very impressive to see how it was filmed the humor at certain times is clever and is delivered excellently there is one character who stands out way more than himself and that is the character of colossus who ironically represents everything thats right in the world trying to remind everyone of morality and being correct though that isnt explored for much in the film that being said with the upcoming sequel about to be released in may it is clear it will be no different than the originals standards are lost in the film industry disappointingly but there are still several individuals who need to be protected from the lies of the world and that is the most vulnerable the children they must be protected from films like this because until the one up above returns our culture doesnt seem to want to learn this truth,comedy
2016 is an interesting movie because its marvel and all but its not at all your typical marvel hero movie if youre going into this one thinking its going to be like iron man or spider man or something then youll be very shocked its not really a superhero movie more like a comedic revenge action movie with some romance mixed in and the content is also very different a lot more explicit r rated but ya know that stuff works and fits this one i really like that this movie ventured out and did that because it fit the tone of the whole thing ryan reynolds was a great fit for the lead character he delivers all the hilarious lines in his own way and it just works i cant think of an actor that would have done a better job with portraying this particular role the entertainment is so fresh here from the witty script to the well orchestrated action sequences all the other cast members are great too the villain especially i loved the movie and i think anyone thats a marvel fan and doesnt mind edgier content will love it too,comedy
i really dont get you guys every bad review is like oh this movie is absolutely awful because of all the dick and fart jokes jesus christ get over yourself and stop taking life so seriously while scrolling through i even saw someone who was a fan of the x films say he hated collossus in this movie it must of been because this one was true to the comics and not the same guy from the trash xmen movies if you love xmen and youve been disappointed with everything from the last stand to apocalypse this movie is probably up your alley oh and you should probably check out logan too cause that movie is amazing,comedy
ill keep it short and simple this movie is a hilarious and welcomed twist to the super hero genre people reviewing it 1 star out of 10 are acting like this movie kicked their dog into speeding traffic yall need to lighten upthe world could use more rated r super hero movies like logan and movies that arent afraid to show the gritty side of antiheroes ive watched many interviews and heard from many people online that they think that this movie sticks very closely to its source material so those people complaining about the humor in the movie are probably just really complaining about a highly popular and established marvel comic9 out of 10 easy,comedy
its perfect enough said this movie is so good i cant stop watching the first scene over and over again just look at any other marvel movie out there and youll find no movie as good as this one except for the dark knight granted it has the same plot as many other movies revenge quest saving your girlfriend bla bla bla the comedy the constant fourth wall breaking trashing other marvel movies for their mistakes especially ryan reynolds previous performance as the green lantern and of course characteristics that makes the whole movie so epic delivers a movie unlike any marvel movie made before,comedy
i really love this movie its very funny and i have watched it many times i love the actors and dialogue i especially enjoyed the fact that there was a lot of swearing and joking unlike other superhero type movies that ive seen overall this is a great movie and i highly recommend it to people who enjoy this kind of movie,comedy
when i watch this in theaters i love it ryan reynolds as is gold like good comedy good action and got right this film is definitely better than fant4stic 2015 and in my conclusion is why they got this movie right but got that fantastic four movie wrong like why is that at least its an apology to that one train wreck he have in 2015 but this film is what i would recommend,comedy
this movie from the start is great the backstory of a normal guy who turns into a ugly immortal just got me hyped up to watch the rest of the moviethis movie has a great story and great action the movies jokes actually make me laugh,comedy
the first act is explosivethe third act oddly depresses me but still is exitingthe first time i saw this i didnt think it was that funny and i was seeing it with a friend and i just somehow knew that there would be a unicorn at some point lol,comedy
ok guys there is something bothering me and i think its time i should get it off my chest and share with all the users hereso here it is i am seeing some propaganda and negativity on the launch of valiant comic universe film bloodshot and more films that will follow that propaganda and hate includes hate on vin dieseldirector dave wilson and other cast members and specially valiant and sony pictures studios like i was reading a article full or hate on this worst website named tv over mind and the article was can vin diesel bring popularity to bloodshot and the moment i clicked on it and read the full thing on that website it was mentioned here as a external site it was full or baseless ignorance filled hateful rant of first time directors that why bloodshot will fail as a film or stupid ignorant things like who in the world knows vailant comics and first time director would not work or failso here is my answer to those idiots is this film why people forget that this film one of the biggest hit films of this decade and most popular is directed by a first timer tim miller now the guy has also directed terminator dark fate which is about to release soon so why this ignorance on these blogs and review sitesjust look at how insane this film was r rated brutal and got best action cheesy but yes lovely i understand the criticism but somethings are beyond criticism its like hate for no reason why is that and hey the movie is not even released yet and those people are comparing bloodshot and valiant with marvel and dc saying it cant compete i mean common they are dead wronglook at what this film did biggest box office collection so i think the only way any movie can shut the mouth of haters is box office draw and collection so this hate on vin diesel is wrong and that website should be ashamed for writing that dirty article and that author tom or whatever his name is or waspure wannabes floating on internet typing anything the want talking about being cynical they way the put hate on others and vin diesel i would say they are the once who is cynical and hateful got same hate because of people like thatand vvn diesel is not cynical at all even if he is hes got every right to bethese wannabes also said that it cant be compared with classic like robo cop or the crow how the hell is trash like robo cop is a classic its garbage a cheap wannabe copy of the terminator hell it is not even in the league of terminator someone should tell those juniors before writing the article and trying to damage the movie and companies who are making itthis is some big frustration these guys have it and it dont go awaythe hate on sony is because of crappy spider man movies they need to drop the licence right on those and let disney make them since they now own marvel and fox the hate for sony is about to end as bad boys 3 is about to hit the theatresits golden days are coming back and bloodshot will shut the mouth of haters just like did vin diesel is the biggest draw at box office so saying it not he is not wont change the fact that he is the biggest action hero and biggest box office opener in the world with or without the franchiseso guys beware of that propaganda against bloodshot and also this or any other director who is directing for first time or any new comic book film companyvin diesel is popular and world famous so he doesnt not need to bring any popularity to bloodshot it will come automatically he dont need to do over marketing or any other nonsense its diesel timeso haters can go to hell for spreading negativitypropaganda and hate and nonsense as for its a classic and bloodshot will be another classic just wait and watch 710is a cool awesome film people need to see this before running their mouth about others this is a examplefor bloodshot dave wilson said that in his own words let try not be be marvel or dc or any other lets make our own world and he is right valiant will make its own audience hey i am a marvel and dc fan and now valiant so why the hateand those guys who are saying that who the hell in the world knows valiant nobody in world knows and hating on it well their dreams are about to be shatteredeveryone knows valiant and soon the whole world will erupt when the see bloodshot on the big screenforget the hate dcmarvel valiant all are good in their own way no comparison should be made thats what i say because they are different unique and great in their own way,comedy
 brilliant an incredible performance on so many levels he is insanely funny and also touching at the same time,comedy
one of the best telling movie story ever just hated the ending it is just too casual,comedy
i laughed once throughout the entire movie i dont get the hype,comedy
its just garbage do you wanna hear a whiney brat whine with some naughty words any potential in the love story is wasted because its so wafer thin i love you is about the size of it that and but im ugly which is a whiney bratty thing to saydo and the action is silly its gory but its silly so i dont care about that eitherif the jokes were funny i could forgive all this i like dumb comediesi like the focus being on the jokes try watching fleabag thats how to do fourthwall breaking not the occasional pointless gag and if anything proves that super hero movies are fundamentally for children its that the violence here which is definitely not suitable for children is fun and silly because cutting your own hand off is funny isnt violence coolsuper hero movies glorify violence in the worst possible way this at least shows blood but that is faint praise its such garbage,comedy
has the minimum tension and worries even while doing the dangerous missions and thats the greatest comedy of the movie his style of speaking is a comedy too,comedy
ive absolutely no idea why the censor board have tagged this movie a rated there are certain a words which are uncensored and certain beeped if youre planning to show an a rated movie and we know that its a rated and we are okay watchinglistening then why censor the scenes beep the words its just a poor poor way of making an amazing movie look dullanyways this is a must watch ryan reynolds beautiful beautiful actor thank goodness he is not a green lantern is way better but beware guys its an a rated movie peace out,comedy
i regret that i forgot to write this sooner and tonight i remembered how good this movie was i dont see this one as comic storyhas everything good directing good filmography good writing good acting good story also it has comedy tragedy action dirty stuff narrator himself etc etcthat said there is barely any film that has all the elements possible and still work out great when a team of film makers try to induce many of these elements in one work they most likely ruin their own work and it comes out very tacky and unpleasant but not in this oneat first i rated it 9 but tonight when i thought about it in my mind i gave the perfect scoreeven though it uses so many cliches it still has a high level of creativityalso i very much liked that is not another as a figure of spesch a hero  who doesnt killi must say this film was so good that a comic character whom was not a popular and even infamous and unpleasant character became one of the most popular and likable characters,comedy
funniest superhero movie i have ever seen it is a guaranteed favourite of mine and always will be the choice of actor had not made this choice any harder due to it being the one and only ryan reynolds a personal favourite of mine 1010 i would give it 1110 if i could my absolute favourite movie cant be beat,comedy
great comedy great gore great everything love it every time i watch it,comedy
hardly give films 910s the only other films ive given that to are space odyssey and back to the futureis an interesting film to study in theory this film should be a total train wreck with a form of comedy that is hard to nail i think what makes make this work is that the fourth wall jokes arent the only source of comedy being there is slap stick character driven and visual comedy to boot i feel that entire story is a fourth wall break seemingly every character acts in a strange and vile way such as wades girlfriend reacting how anyone would after seeing wades face instead of power couple youre still beautiful line being thrown in she instead reacts how someone actually would playing a standard trope for a joke by making the characters more nuisanced the fact that the plot is very predictable as well which though is a down fall of the film is the entire point and why i prefer this one over the sequel as it just sticks to a standard superhero storyoverall though the reception of this film can be seen as mixed in my opinion this is one of the best superhero films ever and though it will fade into obscurity due to the new instalments in the fantastic mcu i will always remember this as one of my favourites,comedy
script here we can appreciate the value of a good onelove is a beautiful thinggowatch itno better marvel nonsense,comedy
comedy was good and actions were impressive liked it very much but i still think that they could have made some things better,comedy
hilariousamazing castingryan reynolds is perfect for the rolegreat intense actionsets up a lot of possible sequels,comedy
heres my review of so needless to say ryan reynolds was great as more of a type casted persona like capn jack the movie has great camera scenes without too much explosions like a michael bay movieit turned out to have a steady cam which shows you exactly what is going onthe role of dark humour and smirk comedy is hilarious i bet zach galafaniakas couldnt have stood a chancethe thing which made feel like i was punched in the tummy thrice was the fact that the dumb indian censor board had to cut off the scene where kills 3 guys with a bulletand the supporting characters were really great and the pop cultural refs and slapstick humour had its place in the end is a notable movie in the golden age of superhero movies and of all it has a great story with awesome characters and the guy who played the recent transporter sucked like anything if you ask me if you could take your little cousin then this is no movie for him and i mean it and dont blame me if your little cousin becomes frankenstein jr,comedy
this movie is absolutely hilarious ryan reynolds is great as an apology letter for in xmen origins wolverine the unconventional origin is great with the flash backs from the bridge battle the action is great ajax is more of an eh villain but i think that is the point the bridge battle is great along with the final battle also the soundtrack is awesome did i mention that it is hilarious,comedy
is a funny action film that doesnt fail to entertain with that being said the second act is slow with a lack of action and jokes the movie never becomes boring but it could have been more fast place like the usual marvel action film,comedy
amazing character amazing movie amazing cast creative ideas lots of fun excellent editing fox totally made this one right it is just everything you may expect from a movie ryan reynolds is the only one who can act as wade wilson as good as that,comedy
the review title says it all a load of pumped up trash with a smell like summer roadkill,comedy
if youre a fan of ryan reynolds honestly even if youre not you are going to love the comedy in this movie he brings such a unique aspect to comedy i just love him the movie itself is entertaining and the story is also quite good as a superhero hes quite cool and surprisingly good in the action sectorwould definitely recommend ,comedy
this movie was unbelievably funny tugged at your heart strings a little plus action packed marvel has never disappointed me at all but takes it to a whole new level i loved it,comedy
poking fun at other superhero franchises with fast paced and heavily ironic one liners delivered courtesy of ryan reynolds however theres still the action and plenty of tounge in cheek humour  some of an adult nature enjoyable nothing too taxing and still formulaic enough to obey at least some of the rules,comedy
what a great movie definitely revived the career of ryan reynolds,comedy

fast funny and gleefully profane the fourthwallbusting subverts superhero film formula with wildly entertaining  and decidedly nonfamilyfriendly  results,comedy
not terrible but certainly nothing to get too excited about either so much green screencgi that it is not much more than a modern day saturday morning cartoon the lead wade wilson is former army special forces who uses his skill set as part of a group of do good mercenaries he meets a woman has nonstop sex in a shallow relationship falls in heat oh love with her and then finds out that he has incurable cancer a group of bad guys sells him on an alternative cure that works he can heal himself of anything and it also gives him other superpowers but it leaves him horribly disfigured the rest of the movie he chases the men that disfigured him and from the shadows stalksfollows the lovelust of his life lots of bloody gore and some ta action lots of cheesy witticisms the female lead has surprisingly ttt tiny tatas that are remarkedly floppy for being so small they hide these flaws with hands and clothing i will leave the impossible to believe love story ending to your own thoughts,comedy
this movie tells a familiar origin story and the villain is the same warped megalomaniac youve seen in every superhero film since superhero films invaded our theatres but the writers found a way to make this story seem fresh mainly by poking fun of superhero movies throughout the film by writing an ultra powerful character who is in a sense a dick the writers have brought new life to an incredibly formulaic storyline isnt a perfect film but it sure is a lot of fun,comedy
everyone kind of played up the severity of this films obscenity    which i actually found quite tame partly because i was expecting it overall a film filled with selfaware references fourthwall breaking and snarky comments was a fun ride much like selfaware films are supposed to be,comedy
now this is one of my favorite marvel movies of all time i remember when first saw this on dvd and i was amazed how funny this movie was and ryan reynolds was perfect for the role of i was also amazed of how much action this movie had and i love all the characters in this movie they were are funny is still perfect marvel to me im going to give a,comedy
how does one know when a civilisation is doomed when a film like makes 363 million dollars at the american boxoffice and 783 worldwide thats when the film is a wretched experience  the result of what might happen if a sixth former were to be given a couple of miles of film stock all the money in the world and then told to go shoot something it is a violent unpleasant circus a mess of postmodernism a disturbing freakshow of special effects and the grotesque  i am staggered that there exist people in the world who do not think that the film is a badly judged poorly made piece of repugnant exhibitionism which saps the soul and dulls the mind decades ago a film like the mask demonstrated that you dont have to be rude to be funny now informs us that you can be almost totally irredeemable but coolindeed not since the mask have i seen a lead physically interact with the fabrics of a cinematic universe as intently as does here at various points in the film in no particular order the lead will do all of the following fastforward the movie insult other offscreen superheroes break the fourthwall within a fourthwall breaking flashback stick chewing gum to the camera and then later actually pan the camera away using his hand so that we may not gaze upon an especially violent momentwe all smirked when we first saw pulp fiction and heard a character literally retune the radio over the opening credits but very little of any of this is as clever as it thinks nor is it especially groundbreaking  films as diverse as man bites dog and breathless had been experimenting with these sorts of tropes years earlier while the putting of it to a series of swordviolence just reminded me of killbill man bites dog to which probably owes the greatest debt for instance even includes a scene whereby the tyle psychopath the camera crew follow around quite literally edits a scene of the movie himself so insinuating that it is he who is putting the whole project togetheris about an exspecial forces soldierturnedstreet punk named wade wilson who is portrayed by ryan reynolds wilson mooches around collecting debts and sorting out problems amongst the scum of the city  in his own words he is a bad guy whose job it is to mess with even worse guys his best friend weasel tj miller who owns a local tavern and his girlfriend is sexworker vanessa morena baccarin this was all before he suddenly contracted cancer and had to undergo treatment something he did so through an organisation headed up by a shady suited individual who looks conspicuously like max keiser but the organisation was not quite what was advertised and following complications which disfigure him he becomes the character of a red tracksuit sporting superfreak extremely wellversed in katana blades and with little else on his mind but revengeand that is broadly speaking the end of it  the setup is an excuse for a series of scenes depicting little more than bloody carnage each as spectacularly dull as the last what is the point in verbally mocking superhero films and the action genre if youre just going to fall into being a mindless one yourself as a lead is an incredibly simplistic character  doing under his new identity more or less what he did under his old one only on a bigger and bloodier scale nothing really characterises him  he shares no duality with a villain as there is no real villain merely a fellow punk who worked at the medical facility with whom he had a few crosswords the character made invulnerable during the treatment results in there being no suspense to any of the setpieces what are we thus even watching is there a statement being made about violence in popular culture or otherwise was there a remark in there on americas healthcare system that i missedsad though it is to say films such as are where mainstream american cinema finds itself big brash and bombastic but with nothing actually to it the film left me feeling empty i was sad when it ended but sad for civilisation and cinema  sad that there were people out there who genuinely thought the contents of this piece were what people wanted to see and might make for a substantial filmgoing experience is there a better example of a film which might act as the epitome of our societys slow inevitable culturedeath than tim millers 2016 effort here todays age characterised by fatuity and crudity is perfectly positioned to produce the miserable experience thatis that it garners such awesome praise and makes such vast amounts of money is surely the signal that what we were warned about all those years ago has finally come to pass,comedy
might be the most original and innovative comic book movie yet not innovative in terms of the story or most of the characters but in the execution and the title character now i was not very familiar with before this film i first learned of the characters existence when playing the video game marvel ultimate alliance ever since ive seen the character hypedup like mad in the geek community which surprised me considering i didnt even know of the character until recently at that timethe first attempted to bring this character to the big screen was in xmen origins wolverine which did not go over well to say the least they didnt seem to get the character at all i didnt even know much about then but i knew enough to know they dropped the ball in portraying him this film feels very much like an apology for that train wreckwell apology accepted was an extremely fun and exciting film on the surface it seems like another superherorevenge movie like the punisher dirty harry deathwish and so on but thats not the caseit sounds incredibly formulaic on paper but it all comes down to execution which this film does right it doesnt take itself that seriously this film is as much a comedy as it is a superherorevenge flick in fact its more of a comedy i think its great how this film can poke fun at all the clichs of these kinds of films and at the same time embrace them this movie reminds me of the anime one punch man in that regard and it works for many of the same reasonsthis time around the studio truly nailed what the character is from the costume to his dark sense of humor there is no doubt were going to much more of in movies in the future which im fine with its great that marvel isnt the only studio that is taking more obscure characters and making them mainstream i might have to read some comics nowthe production values are great as well the action is top notch the violence is on point the effects are great and its competently shot they even got two xmen in the film which i did not see coming but they turned out to be welcome additions that brought some good humor and action scenes these xmen look more comic bookesc than the xmen in any of the xmen movies thus far in fact this might be 20th century foxs first comic book film that is the closest to being a comic book yet the closest being the first two official fantastic four moviesthe film has a couple minor issues for me theres quite a lot of raunchy humor in the film which i didnt care for while i know its a part of character im not the biggest fan of that type of humor i think its the lowest form of humor second only to fart humor but fortunately there were plenty of other jokes to offset it most of the other jokes hit particularly the fourth wall jokesoverall is definitely the film the character deserved the film is not for everyone if youre squeamish or dont like raunchy humor this is probably not for you if you know what youre getting into you should enjoy yourself,comedy
a good movie in xmen seriesi really really liked and you know what i didnt expect to seriously i was never a fan of the character in the sense that i hardly knew anything about him and the humor as well as the violence seemed forced and overdone in the trailers still i remained interested in the film i just never expected it to actually be good  until the reviews arrived after most critics unexpectedly showered this newest superhero movie with praise i went in cautiously optimistic but still fully prepared to hate the filmthe first thing i noticed was how inventive the storytelling is the film throws you into the action from the first moment literally the very first moment and then it goes back and forth in brilliant and unexpected ways to slowly unspool the story of this insane  but oddly charming  antihero flashbacks and fastforwards can be annoying as hell but when done right they can help render even a somewhat simple story fresh and exciting and thats exactly how felt to me right from the start like a fresh if somewhat dirty jolt of energy,comedy
green lantern totally sucked but actually was ok and im happy for ryan reynolds to actually have a good movie there are a lot of good fight scenes one liners and references to a ton of other movies and literary sources casting was good special effects were good what i didnt like was time travel they never get it right writers dont understand it you cant use it to resolve all your problems thats called deus ex machina and thats a bad thing,comedy
marvel must stops making movies like this i really expected it to actually be bad,comedy
all the comments and critics should be ignored when a movie like this drops exept for one that vanessa acually survived that fall theres no any normal human being can survive this the other shock that she didnt get hurt i get that we have to accept that its an xmen movie but out of law of the original xmen movies but things like that we cant always acceptit has broke whatever law that shouldve been considered in a movie even in a comedy one,comedy
i am fairly sure that briannas character is megasonic etc not negasonic i could be wrong,comedy
this movie was brilliant a film that makes fun of its self and everything around it a very clever movie,comedy
people thought this movie was going to be an overhyped poorlymade marvel film but turned out to be one of the very best marvel films ever ryan reynolds as has got to be one of the best casting decisions of a marvel film along with hugh jackman as logan the supporting cast in this film was brilliant the film laughed at it self but we loved that i dont think they will be a better marvel film for years to come,comedy
is it this movie has all the drama action comedy and yes romance you can imagine nestled up really tight in a warm cozy bundleryan reynolds shines as the main character who through a lab experiment gone wrong becomes an immortal fighting legend and so it goes he must take revenge on the ones that did it to him and so he doesthis movie has blood and guts and action to knock your socks off the comedy is what sets this movie apart and it graciously gives us everything its gothighly recommended9 stars though it may deserve 8,comedy
i am not a superheros fan but i really liked this movie and this superhero he is funny and nice and has a good goals he is just lovley one you cant feel this movie is violent oir dirty like other and youll understand the story even if you dont know anything about superheroes,comedy
ryan reynolds does another great job as a superhero his first movie green lantern really showed how great he was as a superhero i hope gets to meet ryan reynolds green lantern ryan reynolds should totally where the green lantern mask more i wonder what the green lantern mask feels like 10 out of 10 movie would recommend watching green lantern with girlfriend if you love herps how much for the green lantern mask,comedy
this is another one of those movies that try to be fresh in its genre which it does achieve but try exceptionally hard to sound witty and unfunny which it didnt achieve and instead end up being downright annoying sure there are parts that i really enjoyed but with the amount of hype this had i expected it to be the movie of the century try kickass if you want an actual laugh out loud experience this oooh im different from all superheroes because im arrogant and funny and quick witted character didnt work and its not because i didnt get or get offended by the humour sometimes it was funny and cool but 910 the jokes just made me roll my eyes nice try though oh and it is incredibly violent throughout for your average superhero viewing so be warned im not sure if that made me like or hate the movie more it was just an added feature that did nothing to fuel a reaction from me,comedy
is breezy and fun and more jokes land than not and it openly derides the usual moralizing of superhero movies instead gleefully pursuing brainssplattering violence and profanity,comedy
29 september 2016 im reminded of wil smith in hancock 2008 which was more of a superhero crime drama than a superhero dark comedy action as nevertheless perhaps its the contemporary times of change and loosening of societal morals that the gutter talk of sex and swearing like young boys and late night comics within a superhero movie was inevitable while the dark humor is creative and at times refreshing it really seems more like a stand up comic night with a lot of rrated oneliners even noted the absence of a lot of superheroes in this movie the fusion of comedy action and then a severe transitions to romantic drama along with the constant cynicism much better presented in hancock made for a jarring experience with a movie without a consistent tone along with a lot of kill bill deathdealing and deathdefying action this movie seems more like a testosterone action entertainment thriller for boys rather than anything really seriously award winning the one redeeming element of the movie was ryan reynolds delicate and remarkable performance,comedy
isnt my gen comedy at all  but good movie and story,comedy
production is great but almost all movies nowadays have a good production this is definitely a different than in originswolverine also i wouldve understood if they really want to get this character from the marvel comics on the screen that is too talkative and breaks the 4th wall but almost every character in this movie is partly a comedian for me it was too much i prefer serious movies and parts were good but overall this was over the top and honestly i got headaches from this movie cause its exhausting to bear a forced comedymaybe its a good movie for bingewatching but not my cup of teai guess its good they introduced the funny character now for future marvel movies where he would only play a small part id prefer that or maybe i just need to let this movie sink in cause i dont think i hate the character they presented its just it was too much at one point,comedy
is a lot of fun the humor is quick and the jokes are quite entertaining however once you look past the shock value and the selfawareness you realize that the plot is pretty standard superhero fare i also felt like this movie relied too much on grossout comedy to evoke reactions from the audience rather than being clever i liked this movie but well see how well it holds up after subsequent viewings,comedy
this film is a bit of hit and miss the opening action sequences make you think it will be another boring action flick with lots of onesided fights it then delves into a humorous account of how the protagonist came to be and his mission that follows it has some laugh out loud moments mixed with some absolutely cringeworthy moments its surprisingly gory and the violence can be cliched reynolds does his best with the script put in front of him overall a fun watch and recommended if you havent seen it yet,comedy
a different kind of superhero movie with a very irreverent lead character who is excellently portrayed by reynolds although the plot is formulaic the film is different enough in style to stand out and has plenty of well put together action scenes which are entertaining to watch humorous throughout with lots of injokes mature jokes immature jokes and references to the marvel franchise but its not always as funny as it thinks it is,comedy
like guardians of the galaxy this movie introduced me to a comic book character i did not know about at all i instantly feel in love with this hard core hero he may be ruff around the edges but this shines through as realistic to what you might expect in a mercenary like this movie portrays i did not like the graphic part of his origin i hated seeing him tortured by his captor ajax ajax gets his comeuppance so it made the whole ordeal vital to the dramatic effect of how becomes the we all know and love,comedy
i loved it but then again im a teenager who loves these kinds of movies and i would understand why some adults would hate this movie its too much for adults to handle all the blood and language is a lot for someone born in 1980 also some people will judge this movie and compare it to the comic keep in mind they where low on money and had a low budget so they couldnt perfect it just my opinion watch the movie twice once to take in the action and the other to listen to the story thats what i do when i dont understated a movie i go back and watch it again but this time i listen to the story some people say that this movie has no story and thats ok all they did was watch it once judged it and never spoke about it again heck they probably never thought about the movie after they typed bad movie and no im not being paid off to put in my positive review the only thing i didnt like was the villan he could of had a better back storythanks for reading,comedy
theres not one bit of this film i didnt enjoyperhaps its my sense of humour and to be honest you really need a sick one for this puppyryan reynolds really is at his best in these roles his constant wit and non stop nattering just makes you wanna punch him in the mouth while laughing at the same timehes basically an experiment gone wrong and i was dubious to see it as im not a big superhero flick fan but this one is different its crude but he gets away with it hes really a person you dont want to look after youre kidsthe story doesnt drag and every bad situation reynolds makes light of it i dont want to say to much and spoil it but i would recommend it to anyone old enough to watch it with a very open mind and i think if you like a break from the norm then dont miss this onespot on,comedy
i really was a good experience to watch a new way of an actioncomedy movie i really loved it but it had some unsense thing first one is why the hell was searching about ajax by saying where is frances and nobody knows that name except for second one is how vanessa was alive after that great fall third one is doll from xmen origins and now with the things i loved first one is the great humor second one is the good violence third one is the sexual references and nudity the fourth one is colossuss cgi the fifth is the good action scenes it is not boring at all so i love this movie,comedy
best adult super hero yet funny witty 4th wall breaking action comedy so happy finally got its own franchise tim miller did a great job directing this film and ryan reynolds could not play this character any more amazingly than any other actors he is so dedicated to his role and ryan has become rated 90 because they cut a lot of great jokes and scenes from the movie sadly,comedy
is everything i love in a superhero antisuperhero but the witty dialogue and editing along with ryan reynolds being completely perfect fot this role i hope the keep putting out more and more there are plenty of comics to allow that so far i see a 3 i like superhero action but this has that and more this is a true 1010 if i could give more stars i would,comedy
former special ops solider and now a mercenary wade wilson ryan reynolds is enjoying a passionate relationship with vanessa morena baccarin on the day he proposes he collapses and discovers that he has very late stage cancer desperate he agrees to undergo a mysterious procedure that will cure him and also make him a hero but the procedure actually involves activing his latent mutant genes following extensive torture left for dead wilsons mutant healing factor saves his life and allows him to pull on a red suit call himself and strike out for revenge the plot is only half the fun though less than half in fact with the shackles off and a relatively low budget mitigating much of the risk is a violent foul mouthed actioncomedy with reynolds and writers allowed to crack jokes about their careers the state of superhero movies and other facets of pop culture as breaks the fourth wall and speaks directly to the audiencethis was my third or fourth viewing of the film watched ahead of seeing the sequel if i am truthful some of the lustre does start to come off after a few repeat viewings some of the more accessible comedy moments the trailer ones particular  like angels superhero landing gag are all a bit too familiar now its interesting though that the selfreferential style of humour has permeated outside of to become common place in the subsequent films of the mcu if not quite to the extent that it does here plot wise its all fairly straightforward despite some time jumps in the first two thirds of the film for the budget though the action scenes are pretty strong particularly the scenes involving a downed helicarrier at the conclusionstill good just overexposed a little now chuck on another two stars if youve not seen it before,comedy
when a teenage with a very well developed sense of humor is diagnosed with multiple variants of cancer he receives an offer he apparently cannot refuse one which could allegedly cure him not long after a series of treatments he receives regenerative superpowers which hes about to use in a way only he canin this first installment of were presented the origins of the notorious character how he was before getting his powers how he receives them and how he uses them in good or evil treated with plenty of humor determined to make the viewer laugh with every occasion it tries to be as entertaining as possible even attempting to introduce emotion drama and suspenseunfortunately the final result isnt as expected as far as the story goes it isnt anything mind blowing or something just ok the characters are ok as well with little complexity or implication doing little to make the overall experience great the special effects are also ok leaving a somewhat sensation of mediocrity unfortunately for me the fun part also left to be desired as it seemed to be trying too much and finally not realizing muchas an overall experience it managed to maintain interest to avoid boredom and be sometimes funny but it ended up as an average movie,comedy
ive finally got round to watching this after keep getting told just how good this film is by so many after the slew of comic book films which just feels relentless this was a kick up the back side to the whole genre not since dredd has there been a comic book film which is for adults instead of the repeititive fare we are getting elsewhereis superhero who denies being one and is totally unorthodox shunning all the morality of the standard hero his name is known he takes off his mask he kills villians without remorse he swears and breaks the screens fourth wall all with a cheeky and crude motormouth this is a loveable rogue of an action herothe action is violent but i really liked it and really makes fun of the whole genre with quips all the way through we have a bit of an origins story here to give us some background to the character whom i never knew about before he is simply the antithesis of the average comic book hero and all the better for it heregive it a try if you are ready for a bout of adult humour  violent comic fare i was and i liked it admittedly the quips could get tiresome in the length of a movie but our hero is still funny throughout,comedy
wildly entertaining is a fair summary really but heres the thing dialing up the cartoon violence or infantile humor or detached irony has a downside this movie spends so much time winking at the camera and making fun of itself that you start to wonder why you are even watching its as masturbatory as the jokes themselves granted you remember why you are there every time you laugh your ass off which happens frequently but im not sure where this franchise or superhero movies in general go from here at some point storytellers have to care if they want audiences to care stillid watch it again in a heartbeat,comedy
after ryan reynolds appearance as wade wilson in xmen origins wolverine it left a bad taste in everyones mouth reynolds seemed determined to do the character of justice and was gunning to have this film greenlit by fox for ages until the test footage was leaked resulting in a mass reaction from fansthe film is an absolute pisstake and completely selfaware with fourth wall breaks throughout faithful to the character of reynolds is having the time of his life as wade wilson wisecracking the entire time and taking swipes at himself the xmen series and hugh jackmanthe story follows wilson hellbent on revenge after inheriting mutant abilities by the sadistic francis played by ed skrein goes on a manhunt to take out francis and save his partner having been kidnapped by the former acquainted with colossus and negasonic teenage warhead who are dubious about actions they face francis and its fairly selfexplanatory from theredespite technically being part of the xmen series this film is much more crass vulgar and humorous and thats part of the charm its reynolds redemption as and its certainly not the enda bythenumbers but enjoyable flick,comedy
so im pushing 50 years old i ask my 21 year old coworker what he thought of this film im glad its not just my age group that thinks this movie is pure garbagelisten if you have to use the f bomb in every sentence then you probably dont have an original thought of your own and zero creativity and if you have to inject genital jokes and sexual innuendo into every scene you border on disgusting and lacking total taste and classthe saddest part of this whole film is that i actually went about an hour into it before i turned it off ryan reynolds should be ashamed of himself honestly ive lost complete respect for him as an actor and as a person there is no justifiable reason for reading this script and then accepting the role unless of course hes desperategood movies dont need profanity and constant sexual innuendo to be good this cant even be considered a movie but total crap,comedy
ok so i went into this movie knowing that it was going to be very immature and dirty and i left the theater not laughing as much as i wanted to if you are a person who loves sexual humor i dont you will enjoy this movie a lot more then most people not going to say that there isnt other type of humor but it is mostly is sexual the story was very predictable there was no big turns or plot changes in my own opinion i left the theater liking colossus more then the action in the movie and the special effects and the fight scenes were on point they were very fun to watch and enjoy and sometimes left you cringing at the amount of gore and blood so to sum up why i gave it a 6 out of 10 well it gets the 6 points for being good in action scenes and special effects they seemed very realistic and made a good watch like a super hero movie should be i did not give the 4 extra points because it was to predictable the script was cheesy at times sometimes it lacked a bit of seriousness when there should of been also this is a superhero movie which means it should of been available for all ages now i cant bring this movie home and have my family watch it i hope in the second one they tone it down also if they could make a clean dvd version would be nice that way children could watch it,comedy
joyfully and audaciously pokes fun at other superhero flicks while being one in itself the films rapidfire humor self referential gags and ballsiness satirize not only superhero movie clichs but also movie clichs as well yet what holds it back from greatness is its superficially structured story unimpressive cgi action ineffective resonance and bland onedimensional characters excluding the titular charactertries desperately to stand out and to not be seen as just another superhero movie well outside of the self referential humor pop culture references and the always funny the film becomes exactly what it is so afraid of being labeled as just another overthetop oversaturated and superficial action extravaganza the only thing that saved from being another mediocre excursion into the marvel canon was its nonstop jokes and compelling freedom to do whatever it wantedcould have been great if the writers put the same amount of time effort and creativity into the plot and characters as they put into their jokes the characters were just same old same old clichs particularly the forgettable villain the character motivations behind getting revenge were silly and almost absurd like seriously he signed up for what happened to him also the movie does not suffer from the occasional save the world plot but maybe just as unoriginal it suffers from the save the girl kill the bad guy plot the worst sin of all is that even though the movie pokes fun at these clichs it still ends up being guilty of them with all this said is still an enjoyably funny fast pace superhero flick that most will like for its new and refreshing humor,comedy
this is the movie ive been waiting for for years i have never picked up a comic but i know the character and i feel like he is just so relateable for me hes super minus the hero hes the everyman a mutant free of the restrictions of morality politeness and other such pretentiousness wade wilson starts off as a cocky type and after becoming virtually unkillable he becomes the cockiest most assholeish lets annoy the hell out of everybody before killing them mercenary ever he is juxtaposed perfectly in this film by colossus played here as a hilarious goody twoshoes endlessly annoyed and disgusted by ways and the charmingly deadpan and sarcastic negasonic teenage warhead and he faces off against a 200 pound sack of assholes called ajax who is virtually unkillable as well its pretty typical sounding but the execution is where this movie really hits home for days god does this movie rule lets get down to brass tacks the plot consists of his backstory and his mission of revenge against the people who turned him into a mutant a former special forces soldier turned mercenary he finds true love with a beautiful barfly named vanessa but soon their life together turns dark when he is diagnosed with cancer out of options he turns to a shadowy organization with promises of not only health but something beyond being human its here that things turn horrific but its only to further the plot really the real draw of this movie is the comedy and hilariously raunchy oneliners from our hero and his whole persona in general is so goofy and off the wall that hes impossible not to like ryan reynolds owns this role inside and outside of the suit almost every joke in this movie hits only maybe one or two fall flat but this is a minor quibblethe odd thing is with the offbeat type of humor that it has this almost feels like a cult classic because of its quotability not unlike fear and loathing in las vegas but this is the rare type of cult film that has actually scored huge at the box office as well maybe some people were expecting another typical marvel movie and boy were they wrong this is something very different and definitely not for everyone personally i think this is one of the funniest films ever made though zamboni guy its me margaret that liam neeson nightmare again this screenplay is amazing maybe even oscar worthy the script is also full of heart and has the ability to surprise with so many comic book movies these days you know pretty much what youre getting before you enter the theatre not so with its absolutely unique in its offbeat tone and the story is also very compelling despite some characters being a little onedimensional but i think the director made good choices of which characters to humanize to fit the tone of the film tim miller keeps things energized from start to finish the comic momentum almost never quits and the action scenes are brilliantly shot and edited in this very kinetic and visceral style the musical score also hits some really funny notes with some nicely placed hits by dmx wham and neil sedaka amongst others how much do i love this movie ive already seen it twice and im seeing it again later this week never before has there been such a perfect blend of raunchy comedy romance action comic booky goodness and endless selfreferentialism this movie doesnt care what the masses think it exists to give a severedhand middle finger to the glut of overly serious often mediocre comic book movies from recent years it even makes fun of its own budget cuts by fox studios and makes endless jokes about that terrible first wolverine movie and hugh jackman who was in fact a big part of getting this movie made this movie is so much fun see it see it right now or youll be on naughty list,comedy
im not a comic geek until appeared in the wolverine origins film id never heard of him apparently fans were incredibly outraged at that portrayal and frankly as the new is supposed to be almost identical to the comic version i can now see why reynolds is supposed to be a big fan and it really shows the humour starts right at the beginning with a brilliant title sequence that sets the scene the audience is almost a participating player in the film such is the level of breaking the fourth wall its not so much broken as reduced to rubble and crunched under feet i wasnt sure if id take to that but it was just brilliant this is the superhero film for adults that weve been waiting on yes theres a lot of swearing but its really very in context yes there are hints at dps supposed sexual interests but thats presumably for later films i loved the referencing of the other xmen films i loved the poking fun at other superheroes i loved the humour and even the violence was so well choreographed that it was fun rather than horrific and it was very tongue in cheek which is probably a sexual reference somewhere as well i loved remarks like smells like a franchise it was just so ott and funny that the audience was laughing out loud as indeed was i a couple of times i now know the backstory to and am looking forward to him taking his rightful place among the best of the superheroes i will definitely get it on bluray when it comes out i expect it will break a whole new set of records when it comes out and i look forward to the second instalment my only fear is that any followups cant possibly maintain the humour the insanity and the sheer pace of the jokes and oneliners that this film brought reynolds brings his agame and blows the x men out of the water,comedy
no its not a superhero movie its the most hated movie ever turn into an awesome antihero movie to start with nobody wanted to make this movie until someone grew some balls to and it came out fantastic the only part i disliked was when it ended because it was too short for me i couldnt get enough it fulfill all my expectations and more they did everything so amazing and detailed that i felt i was reading the comic once more and for all those little ball sacks lifeless and twilight lovers the ones that reviewed this movie as bad obviously didnt read the comic or ever heard about it are all those little kids that went to the cinema because it was popular sad kids you cannot rate this movie as bad if you have a little brain it had everything in it plus the insanity so kids stay away from this movie if you cant appreciate it you might want to watch twilight again thank you,comedy
i wish i could give this 100100 i went to see it with my friends yesterday and we couldnt stop laughing i first heard about when i was 9 and i first heard about a movie in 2009 and have been looking forward to it ever since was it worth the wait yes it was the action was perfect we finally got to see colussus with a russian accent ryan reynolds was perfect as the sinead oconnor jokes were hilarious and the limp bizkit joke even the opening credits were hilarious i really liked francis the bad guy i would go see this movie again i really liked the first scene where hes in the taxi with the indian driver the 4th wall scenes were brilliant and i love the low budget jokes the after credits scene is just amazing and very funny i am very excited for the sequel where we get to see cable we finally got to see on the big screen for the first time the very first time the first time ever we have never ever ever seen him on the big screen do you hear that gavin hood,comedy
i watch the trailers several times before the movie came in cinema i thought it would be a great action movie but thats all nothing else but then the biggest surprise happened from the first seconds of the movie to the last minute best comedy ever i laughed so hard that i lost phases of the movie the movie is great has it all and it was the first time i heard about  whatwhos that superhero me watching the trailer and i was not curious to search about him until i watched the movie i couldnt imagine other actor than ryan reynolds big up for a great play,comedy
no spoilers in this review i loved it and would like people who see it to not have it ruined by some guy blabbing about what happens in it go see it for yourself if youre not the kind of person who can enjoy a hard r movie though be warned  it is on the edge of nc17 language nudity sex violence immorality torture check check check it really earns the r ryan reynolds is perfect in this part he nails the character is fastpaced funny ultraviolent and incredibly crude also clever archly satiric and possibly the best comic book movie ever made at least its right up there among the best that completely delivers on the essence of the pacing is also very tight with the exception of a few slower scenes which seem to be there to allow the audience to rest up a bit the selfreferential stuff was brilliant just brilliant they even took some potshots at star ryan reynolds a couple delivered by ryan himself if you enjoyed kickass this is kickass on steroids and too much caffeine,comedy
lets face it for me 2016 is probably my most sceptical year in a very long time even though there are some big movies coming out like batman v superman finding dory and fantastic beasts im not sure they will turn be the best movies of the year and was one of them for mei dont know much about but all i know that hes immortal like wolverine he has a dark twisted sense of humor and he constantly break the 4th wall i think ive heard enough to enjoy this film at first i was worried about this movie why because of foxs last superhero film being the biggest trainwreck in many years you know what movie im talking about yeah you do but after hearing all the buzz from critics and audiences i finally managed to watch this movie and all i can say is pure perfectionhonestly this is probably the best superhero film since iron man 1 this is a really different superhero movie with a lot of brutal and crazy action and gut busting moments ryan reynolds is the right actor to play as wade wilsonhe was brilliant the rest of the cast is also brilliant ed skrein tj miller brianna hildebrand theyre just great this also has a lot of fantastic movie references that i just laugh my head throughout the plot is highly different fast paced and original honestly i surprisingly didnt find any flaws with this movie this is one of those flawless movies that just came out of thin air like gravityif youre a big fan of superhero films please dont miss it really is the best superhero film since iron man 1 i never thought can be as good as any other superhero films can be and as for the scorenot sure what score i should give this film even though i dont have any flaws with this movieoh well gets a 1010,comedy
one of the best adult comedies i have ever seen from the opening credits through the end i was laughing full of ribald humor and a bit of gore definitely not for kids 17 and maybe very mature 16 yearold teens but please nothing younger i loved the total disregard of the fourth wall had great physical comedy elements especially when they were used handinhand with the action sequences never thought i would laugh so hard even during gory sections on the combat scenes the male actors are superstuds the women are super babes and the action and humor are nonstop warning full frontal nudity male and female i plan on watching it again and buying the dvd as much fun as blazing saddles a must see,comedy
ryan reynolds is back in the one role he was meant to play all this time i cannot state enough the positive impression he made in the otherwise awful origins movie despite his extremely limited screen time he was just perfect for it unbelievably perfect for it i never imagined there would be any semblance of a meaningful romance or emotion and yet here it is somehow through wade and vanessas sex scene montage through the years holidays you get a real sense of two people loving each other even at its most gratuitous the sex in is more soulful than the vast majority of other movies even if its not particularly romantic sex when they find out about wades illness as well there is a little exchange that genuinely broke my heart by exchange i mean he narrates over it but its hugely tellingunconventional storytelling surprisingly relatable romance check and check two things i never expected to find in a movie but what about what i did expect humour i expected a lot of humour you know what i got i got a lot of humour i dont watch a huge amount of trailers and rarely ever more than one per movie but while many studios like to parade the best jokes in the trailers managed to get away with just teasing the worst ones theres a whole lot more in the movie and theyre a whole lot better too yes its very crude very very crude and yet its more than just laughing at dicks because dicks are funny hurr hurr hurr theres some genuine wit and thought put into these jokes its far from the only source of laughs as well some of the biggest laughs it got out of me were from its selfawareness the movie knows what it is knows what its a part of and pokes a lot of fun at it theres a number of jokes poking fun at the origins movie the xmen wolverine himself but also hugh jackman the fact xavier has been played by two actors reynolds stint as green lantern its hugely aware not only of the universe resides in but also the universe in which the movie resides its inescapable with trademark of breaking the fourth wall and addressing the audience directly breaking the fourth wall inside a fourth wall thats likesixteen wallsthe other thing you expect from is gore completely overthetop gratuitous gore certainly does not shy away from blood and gruesomeness its the bloodsplatting r rated affair everyone hoped and dreamed of for all this time and yet i can understand why on the gore front at least it didnt get a fullblown 18 on this side of the pond its definitely no tarantino flick theres beheadings broken bones headshots as well as wades own gruesome transformation but theres no spraying of blood or guts hanging over the floor or any of that kind of gore youd expect in a saw movie in fact when it does get bad tells the camera to look away leaving only the power of suggestion to fill in the blanks is it a gory movie yes is it gratuitous i wouldnt say so nofinally ill just touch on the acting a moment mainly to lay unbridled praise upon ryan reynolds shoulders he has been completely dedicated to making sure this movie happens and that he remains in the role his small appearance in origins as wade wilson was probably his best performance and hes managed to tap into it again effortlessly for hes just an effortlessly funny guy the jokes come tumbling from his mouth as if hes spitting them out one after the other he never stutters or stumbles the only downside to is that he has a mask over his face so his facial expressions get lost but lets be honest that was never reynolds strong point the supporting cast are pretty great as well especially morena baccarin as wades girlfriend vanessa they share perfect chemistry together and she never drifts into damsel in distress mode so there we go after all these years finally got his own movie and he was actually done justice its gory its crude and its completely hilarious i am so glad that i was wrong about this movie although no matter how bad the previews made it look i would still have watched it either way i would definitely recommend this to anyone who likes dark or crude humour or superhero flicks but i would definitely not recommend it to anyone under the age of fifteen blood crude language and full nudity are commonplace i mean like seriously why do i feel i have to write that if its a 15 you shouldnt have to ask whether its appropriate for a twelve year old the answer is obviously no otherwise it wouldnt be a 15 anyway i give a very good 810 bring on the sequel,comedy
first off i dont think there are any spoilers in what im writing but just in case i ticked the boxid just like to start by saying that as much of a scifisuperhero movie fan i am i am not a comic book reader and never have been so ive gone into this movie with no preconceptions about what the movie should be in order for it to do justice to the comicsone thing it is worth noting although i would be surprised if anyone didnt already know this but if you are expecting a regular superhero movie with mega set pieces and cgi effects that are cutting edge then you are going to be disappointedthe film has clearly been made on a tight budget the effects are in some areas less than what youd expect from a run of the mill actionhero movie also some of the action is less elaborate than what you might come to expect from a marvel productionthis being said thats not a criticism in fact it only makes the movie more appealing to audiences who are a little fed up of big budget movies that wow you with effects only to leave the story somewhat lackingof late a fair number of these kinds of movies fail to meet the mark theyve clearly had millions spent been years in the making and are visually stunning but they often lack a certain quality if like me this has been your opinion of a large number of movies like this over the last 10 years then youll be pleased when you see deadpoolryan reynolds couldnt be any more perfect for the role combining his van wilder style humour with that of a guy who would do anything for the one he loveswhat i loved most about is the fact that its blatantly not taking itself serious the raft of injokes is enough to tell you that the people making this movie care more about entertaining the audience than appeasing studio executives this probably explains the movies birth and the time taken for reynolds to get the backing to make the moviei am personally a fan of reynolds sense of humour for some i imagine it could be a little over the top while i can see why this might make some of his roles a little lovehate its the perfect tone for this movieits been a long time coming for a superhero movie that just does what it says on the tin entertains makes you laugh and generally ticks all the boxes the one liners and quips are perfectly executed and the action manages to stay at a level to keep everyone happyas ive already mentioned the budget constraints do show in places but despite this the team behind this movie make do with what they have and manage to make a film that will be a classic and a much loved addition to peoples collectionthere is likely to be a sequel but i cant really see the chance of appearing in an ensemble xmen film due to the tone of this film and his character to be honest though im not sure thats a bad thingi for one cant wait to buy the bluray and see the outtakes and blooper reel,comedy
this movie is pretty enjoyable for all the peoplebut there some geek jokes that are not for everybody to understand besides thatits funny with a good actor going through the character and you can feel that passion its a low budget movie still one of the best movies marvel has done colossus has a great participation that he deserved a long time ago if it could have been better yesthere are some things not so positive like the villains but heywho cares rocks,comedy
to me is the best and original marvel film till date with most required vulgarities and dck jokes these jokes was very important to the merc with mouth ryan reynolds really was born to play and his timings was perfect the action sequences so violent and unflinching and the humour so crude and twisted the real superheros in this film was the writers even though its bit ridiculous i am dreaming about the fight between and wolverin sad about hugh jackman or joke fight between and spiderman he he nothing about the film just go and watch with your lover its pretty romantic too thanks to whole crew for this and we really love you,comedy
people can whine all they want about the mass production of superhero movies for me its like a childhood dream come true as a kid i always dreamed of movies that are being made today and i will never grow tiredwith the foul mouthed vulgar tortured funny unpredictable and semi sane antihero that is maybe we perhaps will see a slight change in superhero movies just like nolans batman trilogies did is the polar opposite of a superhero and not exactly what ull expect the movie is first and foremost a comedy and the funniest movie ive seen in a long timeif your not acquainted with he kills chops off body parts curses and annoys people for the fun of it the movie is quite original and doesnt take itself serious with a lot of movie references good one liners and offensive humor u are officially warned it is r rated for a good reason the plot and story is pretty weak but the movie itself is so thoroughly done and consistent that it doesnt really matter since it is an origin movie the sequels will probably be even better now that the origin story is out of the way fans will not be disappointed as it stays pretty true to the comics i strongly urge people to watch this at the cinemas i want more movies like these made and hopefully one day well see a decent spawn movie be made then all my childhood dream heroes have been put to life i would also love seeing more anime be put to life but hey a man can dream cant he,comedy
when a movie was first announced it sent the fans into a frenzy but things were little pessimistic considering the content would be too mature and too ugly for a comic book super hero and a possible r rating could actually be cutting off a large section of the target audience this resulted in a development hell for over 10 yearsfinally the reins were transferred to tim miller and ryan reynolds was roped in to play the eponymous role was the first of its kind superhero who comes in with an inbuilt sarcasm trigger and knows how to use his superpowers both selfishly and irresponsibly well you can say therein lies the charm of it allwade wilson ryan reynolds is a kind of mercenary who helps teenage girls get rid of their stalkers he runs into vanessa carlysle moreanna bacairn an escort and they both hit it off instantly they move in together and start making love as much as they can and finally year later wade proposes to her which vanessa readily accepts their joy is shortlived as wade is diagnosed with terminal cancer he chooses to break up with vanessa as he cannot bear the thought of her being stuck with him vanessa refuses wade is soon approached by a recruiter jed rees of a topsecret private program which promises wade to cure him of his cancer but also give him super powers as a bonus wade brushes of it as a joke but then one night leaves a sleeping vanessa and enters the programthe program is run by ajax ed skerin and assisted by angel dust gina carano who run a series of tests on wade bordering on gruesome tortures and finally insulted in a verbal battle ajax reprograms things in such a way wades cancer is pushed to go as far as it can go triggering the mutant factor leaving wade with a disfigured face and strong super powersfaking his death wade goes in search of vanessa but comes to a conclusion with his disfigured she may not accept him he stays clear of herhe soon dons the red costumes names himself based on a death guess game which his friend runs in the bar goes after ajax aka francis as the latter had once commented he has the power to change the formers face back to normalmeanwhile on tracks are collossus stephen kapicic and negasonic teenage warhead gina carino who want him to join the x men teamthe movie is one hell of a laugh riot and a roller coaster ride of gruesome violence and curse words ryan reynolds is a wow as and brings the character to lifemorena baccairn is enchanting with her trademark smile and it is gina carino as the teenage warhead who gives the movies most funniest moments her dead pan expressions are a riottom holkenbergs music complements the movies theme as does the crazy credit sequence in the beginning of the movietim miller has been successful in getting the comic superhero to life and at the same time should have opted for a more dangerous villain than francis ajax all in all the movie delivers what it promisesi was just a tad disappointed because of the weak villain but yes i would recommend it to anyone who would want their superheroes delivered a bit differently,comedy
the movie is funny violent and above all good the value of entertainment here is very high has a simple story but well executed and well explained it leaves no doubt to the viewer ryan reynolds is really fine he passes the whole essence of the comic character to the film the flashbacks are funny scenes but they break a bit of the movie rhythm break the excitement of the previous scene when you were seeing wade wilson as mentioning that gina carano is a bad actress she has no charisma at all and in all of her scenes she has a  little smile  on the face  breaking the climate of acting another downside is that because of this simple story the film seems vague as if it needed something else to fill like more action scenes or characters delusions after all is full of iconic scenes and good actors especially the brazilian actress morena baccarin who is great it has great special effects and cgi and an excellent edition great film with explicit violence and bad taste jokes a good tim miller work which i will probably watch again,comedy
i must confess i went into with low expectations i like the character and felt like ryan reynolds was good casting but the february release date had me a bit nervous tack on the lackluster commercial campaign with what seemed like forcedlaughs and i have to admit i was a bit nervousafter seeing the movie you totally get why the commercials were so iffy all of the best stuff was completely inappropriate for a commercial this one goes all out full throttle for that rrating and thank goodness it did what a tremendously fun film with a surprising amount of heart the love story is quite touchingalso i think this may be stan lees best cameo yet very good movie look forward to the sequel,comedy
i just seen last night and i have to say it was pretty entertaining first and foremost the you should be a shamed of yourself this is crude and disgusting humor type of people only have themselves to blame for their poor experience this is who is im 100 sure those people had no idea who was and thought honey lets go see a lovely super hero movie tonight they should be the ones ashamed of themselves for not doing research on a character they had no prior knowledge ofnot to mention the r rating should have sent up some sort of red flag ps marvel studios the guys who have a hand in the captain america thor iron man movies werent the ones who made this film again it just shows the ignorance of some of the reviewers reviewing this filmso moving past all of that and focusing on the positives of the film id like to start off by saying this movie does the character justice its funny violent off the wall and downright entertaining my theater and i were laughing at just about every wise crack and joke made in the movie my buddy who had no idea who was even said that he thoroughly enjoyed itthere were a lot of subtle jokes in the movie as well that require you to have previous knowledge of past ryan reynolds filmstake the movie for what it is entertainment personally i got exactly what i paid for and i couldnt have been happier if youre a fan of then im more than confident that youll be a fan of this film as well,comedy
not wanting to give too much away this film was absolutely epic and second only to the kick ass films which are epicunlike those crappy 12 rated marvel films this contains sex drugs profanity  bare knuckle violence its spiderman on steroids the oneliners jokes  sexual innuendo was funny as hellthe laughs in the film were great too as well as the bloody uncut violence the actress was fit as hell too bites fist this film truly is adult content not for under 15s it wouldve been better an 18 it was that epicthe storyline was good as well  the chop  chaining scenes were great not to mention the post end credit scene which you have got to stick around for this film is overall an epic film you must go see  forget about the 12 sht you thought was great this is along the lines of kickass films bare knuckle violence bloody sexual  full of babes  tts910,comedy
right from the opening credits itself youll find yourself realizing that this is the kind of superhero movie which is definitely different is party time for action junkies and reynolds may just have found the role that makes his careeri just love the he can never be serious in marvel  after wolverine is the second superhero i have ever loved  super action and super humour everybody is gonna love it dont look for spoilers we have to admit is batman and superman and xmen  has the singular virtue of being funnier than weve been led to believe a superhero film can beirreverence and dgaf attitude is admirable isnt the avengers hes a oneman show and that one man deserves at least one more show or at least one more cock joke,comedy
if you dont know who is then why are you reading this go find a comic or two and read up on who this antihero with the mouth that just wont quit really is then go see the movie and read some of the reviewshaving said that this actually turned into a valentines weekend date for my wife and i we needed to get out of the house for a bit and i said that id like to go see but i wasnt sure shed like it i mentioned it had ryan reynolds in it and showed her the trailer so she said sure lets go for itnote that my wife likes the marvel comic movies as well as action movies and language doesnt offend her we both loved the movie  she kept trying to remember all the oneliners from the movie there were so many of them morena baccarin was perfect as the girlfriend and when wade proposed to her with the ring pop  and pulled it from where  way too funny also using the head chopped off from one of the guys hed killed as the weapon to take out another bad guy  and then using it as the dot on the i in francis  yet at the same time this never really felt like it went too over the top this was more like how real world people would end up being in a world with super heroes and mutants of course breaking the fourth wall all the time was good tooone thing we discussed afterwards is that the humor was paced out well you knew you could laugh and not miss something else was there a huge amount of violence with blood and brains splattered and was there an assortment of nudity yeah  you dont go into this movie thinking youre going to see captain america this is  probably what shehulk would be without the comic censor codeoh and like i said my wife and i both loved the movie and its one we wouldnt mind seeing again for the action the humor and the sheer fun of it and of course you do get stan lee as well  i think he probably enjoyed this cameo most of all,comedy
superhero movies always navigate a very narrow furrow that can easily slip into self parody or unintentional laughs what is impressive about is that it tests the edges of both mainstream superhero movie franchises and the validity of comic book sacred cows marvel was ever the more fun comic house than dc and as a comic book was a melange of underground comic humour and coolly wrought ultraviolence from british comic books all of this is present and correct in a film that absolutely knows it is a reboot  and tells you  breaks the fourth wall into jokes about the fact it knows it is a movie and contains genuinely funny and poignant moments that the film plays ultra fast and ultra loose with the medium yet makes you care about and want to see further adventures of this on the big screen is testament to what hollywood long thought a risk for year the most profitable comicbook adaptation was the mask more films should have been made like it and here us why go see it with a big crowd and enjoy youll laugh youll cry youll want chimichungas,comedy
warning contains spoilers2015 to be honest had some underwhelmingass movies eg spy kingsman and age of ultron not that any of them were terrible in the least but just didnt have an edge or personality in terms of strong comedy and characters that made them memorable for the amount of time it takes to fap to the latest suicide squad trailer which looks to be mindless fun spectre and fantastic 4 i found myself not seeing but instead the inside of my closed eyelids so yeah i had mixed thoughts on what this movie would really be like and what it would provide outside of some genuinely wellthoughtout gags and cgi stuntsso there me and my stepdad a addict for what i prefer to call crack comedy on steroids and gritty violence sitting amid a growing crowd in the cinema having last week watched the hypnotising the revenant and about to see a hilarious satire of not just superhero movies but a film to go down in history as the kick ass of this decade the opening 30 seconds had several in the audience choking on popcorn kernels in their fits of laughter and also shows amazing choreography the action is obviously the best part of the film adding in great physical and well physical gags into the mix the story is kinda already been done a cure for a disease for our main hero only to be put through something equally harrowing in fact though it doesnt directly show it it definitely comes off of the kick ass films with loosing his sense of pain and wielding two sabre like swordsok so lets get down to why i love this movie to death for example theres a scene very later on in the film where the villain francis asks to spell out his name it plays out throughout the film and you think its just going to build to nothing but the he looks down off a building after says hell spell it out for ya only to see he literally has spelling franciss name out  in dead bodies that had me laughing on the floor and that kind of stuff along with the jawachingly funny dialogue is all through the movie little touches here and there its this that can lead to dozens of rewatches every single second the films trying to throw a joke at you and the majority of them hit bullseyes what can i say that probably hasnt been or is going to be said about this movie already the actors in this film are beyond great the scenes where the majority hero is dealing with cancer are taken pretty well with his actual transition into becoming mutated a pretty few scene but what really shines in quirky remarks weve all seen this kind of nottootakenseriously setup before but the jokes given and the way the characters work off of each other keeps you entertained from beginning to end gore sex humour gags reference and of course quick and bloody action from a gritty superhero film i couldnt love his film more my best advice to anyone whos reading this is to see this film in a large cinema with a packed audience the reactions will be almost as funny as the filmnitpicks villain was pretentious and not very intimidating though the stereotypical treatment was probably intentionalending was anticlimactic  could have just used more gags and better pacingwhatever did happen to that dufflebag910  if you like hot fuzz or kick ass the first one youll adore this one most inventive and memorable film ive seen in a while,comedy
almost no spoilerswith one of the best marketing strategies ever the movie paid off the intro is one of the best like ever man its weird that this movie has been in development hell for almost decade and a half and needed that leaked test footage to gain interest by people and being noted by the producers ok  the movie is totally heavy r with lots of gore and nude lots of dirty jokes a few fourth wall breaking gina carano was great in the role cant say the same for ed skrein though the guy is just forgettable really the time when the sequel comes out people wont remember him and a little bit other thing that i didnt like was the way too much references for movies way too much there is even an reference for an old 1986 action classic movie that most people would not even understand that it is forhighly recommend it to go see it at the theater it is worth it 910  for now could go higher after a few more viewings in the future,comedy
probably the best superhero movie ive watched so far i cant express so much with words but oh me oh my the movie was awesome to the nth degree there were never dull moments the fight scenes were great the story was nice the love story was nicer  and was pure awesome did i say awesome again yes i could say awesome over and over again if it was meant for i could talk all day to my friends about this movie the dialogues were cheeky and funny colossus was just great himself too definitely one of the best movies on its genre ps this is my first review for a movie ,comedy
marvelfox what an amazing movie and a great way to start the superhero genre movies for 2016 i was really surprised for how well made is this movie as you know this movie budget is only a little over 30 million dollars and they did a really good job with it unlike fantastic four which cost fox 120 million to make and it was just really really bad is a very tricky character but ryan reynolds was born for this part loved his work also what i really liked is how they handled colossus way better than the older version  i dont want to spoil anything i just really recommend this movie for every adult to watch and support for us to keep getting some flavor in our life,comedy
so i just got out of my second viewing of when marvel studios first kicked off i prayed to god this would happen one day a movie as has been my favorite character since the early 90s with his appearance in new mutants so the movie made me very excited and very terrified because this could have just been the biggest fail well it wasnt everything by ryan was perfect and i mean perfect is ryan reynolds he nailed it the costumes where great they really bought him to life with the animated eyes really awesome the humor was perfect perfect for an r rated movie in style well timed and extremely witty the movie is very very very violent which i kind of gathered it would be but even so you found most of it funny   the jumper punches at dc and everything else through it where amazing its very rare these days you sit in a cinema and everyone is laughing this movie is violent funny smart and exciting everything you expect from when you read the comic and now its on the big screen 1010 cant wait for the second,comedy
if you casually dip in and out of the comic genre is a superhero you may have heard the name somewhere on screen before but probably forgotten however if you know your comics then you probably salivated at the prospect of seeing the merc with a mouth going toe to toe with wolverine in the xmans origins movie then you watched it and uttered words that no selfrespecting spell checker should let me typebasically the makers of wolverine origins completely messed up putting it mildly and the fans were not amused yes ryan reynolds was actually a pretty good choice for the gobby antihero but then they pretty much cellotaped his mouth shut and completely reinvented his character in the worst way possible it actually makes a nice change to see a studio admit they totally got it wrong and do something about it even if the decision is largely governed by moneyand that could have been that however luckily mr reynolds himself campaigned to bring a truer representation of the source material to the big screen and amazingly it happened and im so glad it didis a superhero movie you probably guessed that  you have the man in a mask who you pretty much know is going to go out there and beat the baddies and save the girl yadder yadder yadder however what also is is a comedy that being said  its not a spoof its a tongueincheek little number which has better action scenes than most action films and better comedy than most comedy filmsim almost tempted to say that its a film that anyone can enjoy i can certainly see both men and women having a good time watching it however it definitely is a film for men and women whereas marvels current cinematic universe is kind of geared at kids and us kids who never grew up there is plenty in that no parent will want to explain to their little darling again dont let that fool you into thinking that its all toilet humour  lets just call it adult humour and leave it at thatbasically is great ryan reynolds is mouthy but never annoying and totally owns the role as it should be when he plays the titular character the supporting cast all do their bit but its himself all the way please let this be the start of a franchise its probably a little too much to expect to see him crossing studio picket lines and ending up in the marvel universe where he  truly  belongs but we can always hope if nothing else im well up for a 2 outing,comedy
the name itself sounds pretty stupid and it doesnt get much better than this the name means nothing like some inside joke that no one gets it comes across in the movie trail like this is a hip character but in the movie he comes across more like some unemployed loser who youd expect living in his mothers basement geekingout practicing fighting sequences and sewing his silly costume it is hard to imagine something with such a big budget and hype turned out to be a complete and utter waste of time it had zero entertainment value the character appears to be intended to be a sort of rrated version of a hero when it is more of a poorly created watered down version of agent 86 but with unfunny lines not sure who the intended audience for this is but simply having a superhero use profanity isnt funny or interesting his motives make no sense and this movie is filled with overly long fightingaction sequences that are boring,comedy
this film could not have been any better mostly because 20th century fox believed they would fail with an r rating so they gave them a minimal amount of money and a minimal amount of time that being said because i felt someone had to they succeeded anyway as a character is perhaps the most brilliantly simple character in the marvel universe he is immune to death likewise his characters true gift in the sense of entertainment is his unique 4th wall awareness is the only character in the marvel universe to know he is in a comic book that has always made him different from anything else out there in terms of dc or marvel this film was fun the casting without taking the time to single out ryan reynolds who seemingly was born for this specific role was great the supporting cast and antagonists blended well morena baccarin was hysterical beautiful and wellmotivated ed skrein was a sufficient antagonist who played a onedimensional character by design with enough tenacity to help you thoroughly despise him brianna hildebrand was great playing the quintessential teenager though for whatever reason with different mutant abilities than her source material counterpart possibly due to the time line divergence in xmen films ryan reynolds was perhaps the most comfortable of any superhero in any superhero film though he is actually both playing and based on a character who is an antihero his quips were delightful as stated this is the role he was meant to play when he was actually permitted to talk for his portrayal karan soni was another supporting cast member of many who did a lot with a very small amount of screen time as dopinder the reoccurring cabdriver cgi colossus was forgivable and though physically a figment of some computer programmers imagination an amusingly wellwritten stereotypical russian immigrant tj miller was excellent his character was comic relief in what is a comic relief film but it was all the more entertaining with his contribution gina carano as angel was an unfamiliar face to me but she owned the role well and provided a decent secondary antagonist to skrein this film didnt surprise me or attempt to surprise me and in this rare case that is perfectly acceptable the breakdownaudio experience 85 it really didnt mesmerize in the sense of original score but it didnt really have to the soundtrack was great and somewhat catharticvisual experience 88 it was better than the budget should have permitted with everything timed well amusing easter eggs for the keeneyed fan and enjoyable physical comedy by the parties involvedemotional experience 90 it wasnt intended to be an emotional rollercoaster its a comedyactionscience fictionsuperhero film for adults any attempt to force it would have ruined the film and they make a point to let you know that while blatantly mocking those who hide such remedial attempts at deep soulsearching content the 90 is for being exactly what it said it would standing up against the studios filmhacking hands even when it meant a lower budget to work with and for providing quality entertainment without spitting in the base demographics faceoverall a great film for those who enjoy explicit and violent comedies violent superhero movies and a film that can be so juvenile on purpose it magically becomes brilliant congrats to the cast writers and director for their part in making the second highest grossing rated r film in movie history just and i do mean just after passion of the christ at the time of this review recommendation if you fit the previously stated demographic i recommend you see this film if you havent already i would strongly advise parents not to permit their kids to see this film knowing full well they probably already have without you knowing if the question was even posed,comedy
i had zero expectations for this because growing up i never cared for the comic book character and the previous version of that character in the dreadful xmen origins wolverine also played by ryan reynolds was nothing to get excited about but this was actually a very entertaining movie with lots of action and humor i think its one of the rare comic book movies that has just as much if not more appeal to the mainstream than to the fanboy set ryan reynolds is funny and charming and i immediately wanted to forgive him for his past cinematic sins the movie plays to his strengths as the likable frat boy van wilder much better than his last attempt at launching a superhero franchise green lantern the rest of the cast is decent although this is reynolds show all the way he controls every scene and thankfully has a good chemistry with all of his costars the action scenes are very nicely done as well although the movies climax is a little flat the only real negative is that the cgi colossus is pretty terriblelooking thankfully his role in the movie and how he plays off reynolds and others provides lots of laughs still he looks like a big cartoon and that is a little distracting anyway this is a fun movie that doesnt take itself seriously and gives the audience some great popcorn entertainment definitely worth a look even if you dont typically like these kind of movies,comedy
is a spoof of marvel comic book characters directed with panache by tim miller rich in oneliners such as life is an endless series of trainwrecks with only brief commerciallike breaks of happiness this had been the ultimate commercial break which meant it was time to return to our regularly scheduled programming it is apparently based on the marvel comics character by the same name is a fictional antihero initially was depicted as a supervillain but later evolved into his more recognizable antiheroic persona is a disfigured and mentally unstable mercenary with the superhuman ability of an accelerated healing factor and physical prowess he is known as the merc with a mouth because of his talkative nature and tendency to break the fourth wall which is used by writers for humorous effect and running gags even for those saturated with the endless expensive overblown repetitious marvel comic films that flood the market making billions of dollars this film is funny not only due to the comedic writing of rhett reese paul wernick fabian nicienza and rob liefeld but also due to start ryan reynolds inimitable talent for admixing silly banter with heroic handsome good looks and fancy footwork very briefly because there isnt much story this is the origin story of former special forces operative turned mercenary wade wilson who after being subjected to a rogue experiment that leaves him with accelerated healing powers adopts the alter ego armed with his new abilities and a dark twisted sense of humor hunts down the man who nearly destroyed his lifemuch of the success of this film is due to the cast  ryan reynolds of course but also a brilliant role for ed skrein as ajax tj miller the every glamorous morena baccarin of homeland fame as vanessa gina carano as angel dust leslie uggams as blind al etcthe film does go overboard in noisy destruction and massive killings and foul language but hey this is a marvel comics outing  so you expect something different entertaining if a bit too long,comedy
as a long time fan i had mixed emotions going in to this part of me felt reynolds would come through as merc with a mouth but then could this be as atrocious as their first attempt at bringing him to life now before we get into the movie let it be said any parents who brought their kids to this movie and left offended well your an idiot this movie stays very true to the pool and had me laughing through out the movie whether hes flipping colossus the bird with a severed hand or making colossus puke during an inspiring speech its bang on these are things he would do in the comic no doubt about it and nobody is safe from his ridicule nobody all kidding aside i truly enjoyed this movie the supporting cast was great other than gina carrano whom i feel was lackluster the only real beef i had with the movie was that it could have used a better main villain which im sure they will make right in the sequel im not too worried about the lack of xmen because this isnt their movie this my friends is about the regenerating degenerate i recommend this movie to anyone even people who dislike hero movies great fun,comedy
this is a very good film would like to review this as a five star is excellent it is a must to go and watch if you havent already seen it it is one on the best maybe the best superherovillain film not going to spoil it if people havent seen it already but all i can say is go go go go go go go and see this film its awesome ive watched it like five hudread times people really need to see this im getting exited about it already and thats just talking about it i mite just go and watch it again its awesome ps whats with you have to write as least 10 lines man my fingers are killing ah ah im joking i could talk about this film all day every day till the end of days and even then i could still talk about it at the end of days ah aha,comedy
mercenary wade wilson ryan reynolds falls in love with escort girl vanessa carlysle morena baccarin but soonafter discovers that he has latestage cancer when a strange man approaches wade saying that he can not only cure his disease but also give him incredible powers he is sceptical but eventually undergoes the treatmenta long and agonising process that scars his entire bodyunaware that the people conducting the operation intend to use him as a weapon for hirefrom the ironic opening credits to the inevitable postcredits sequence is an absolute blast a sidesplittingly funny hyperkinetic and incredibly bloodthirsty superhero movie for those fed up with normal superhero movies this one takes everything expected from the genre and subverts it creating a deliciously dark adventure in which the lead character imbued with invincibility doesnt want to be a hero he simply wants revenge as sets about finding francis the man who caused him so much pain and melted his good looks he takes special delight in countless outrageous acts of extreme violence pausing to break the fourth wall with witty remarks aimed at the viewer this selfawareness only adds to the funwhile not the best superhero movie ever as some people claim that honour still goes to days of future past its a very close second i loved it 910,comedy
about time we see an adult comic movie   there are too many people around that live under too many rocks and without getting too political on the matter i would like to say booyeahabout time we see people getting chopped splattered stabbed shot at in single file 3 in line head shot etc  all the above and all those one liners that brings out hilariousbut all excitement aside i had to drop 2 points on the movie because it just didnt quite hit the mark for me dont get me wrong it had all i wanted in a comic movie but i would of liked to see more of the other superheroes from xman and others with that said i am hoping that the sequel if there is going to be one will have more story and other heroes  villains in it lets hope fingers crossed xxxxother then what i have mentioned before i feel people are down voting for the simple reason its that they dont know who or what is or about but for those people that do know of him and about him then its definitely a must watch hilarious  awesome  unbelievable  funny  and more   about time we have an adult version of a comic best yet i wish all the other comic movies actually showed the brutality of the fighting scenes just wish this movie had more of iti am wondering though if they do bring other comic heroes in the mix will they tone down but i would like to see wolverine ironman  the hulk with i think that combo will be hilariously funny,comedy
this is my first review here done because this film is great if you know what youre getting intoa lot of people just dont get it isnt a superhero he isnt a nice guy hes not even a serious character hes a parody his entire persona and his comics and other media are all built around satire marvel has literally pushed the envelope with this character he started off as a serious supervillain but eventually became and antihero the further they went with him the crazier he got and the less his comics made sense but theyre not supposed to make sensewith that in mind the movie is pretty much a live action version of the comics extreme violence dark humor and even stupidity abound thats how is hes literally a joke treat him as such and youll be fine the movie also breaks through the fourth wall as do the comics and other things such as the video game this is all part of cracks about the stars marvel fox and pretty much everything else that isnt supposed to be known by the characters abound talks directly to the audience again this is how the comics are theres not much of a plot here youre shown origins which are similar to the comics only changed slightly otherwise its basically a revenge flick and something of a love story the plot is very basic but thats how the comics are in fact often doesnt have a plotso this movie is basically going to appeal to two types of people fans of the comic and people who like satire with heavy elements of dark humor its also very violent and contains nudity and sex if youre like oh look its a marvel movie i loved this and that from marvel must be another one of those you probably wont enjoy the film aint like other marvel comicsoh and if you took your kids to see this and were appalled by the violence language and sex thats on you the mpaa exists for a reason and they gave this film an r rating for strong violence language nudity and sex take two seconds to do some research before taking your kids to see a film my sister did which is why my 12yearold niece hasnt seen this film,comedy
to start i am a huge fan based off a comic book standpoint however i think we were all a little mad with a certain situation that occurred in xmen origins wolverine however fox recreates in a hilarious and smartly adapted way in this near perfect movie it basically ignores everything that went wrong with origins which is a really good thing ryan reynolds is the perfect fit for the role and brings him justice after what was done to the character before all the side characters in the movie are pretty great too the only thing that really bugged me was the storys villain ajax similarly compared to many other marvel films the villain here is pretty underdeveloped and it would have been a little better if the film would have explored his character a bit moreoverall is smart fun and a hilarious movie that anyone including comic fans and noncomicfans can enjoyrating a,comedy
firstly congratulations to 20th century fox for finally making a decent marvel moviei know next to nothing about just the basics but that didnt stop me from being very interested in seeing this major major kudos to the advertising department for the amazing ad work leading up to the moviethis is the role ryan reynolds was supposed to play instead of that horrendous disaster that was green lanternits funny its crude its very bloody and very violent and i loved it it also has an amazing soundtrack featuring saltnpepathere were some cgi scenes that looked very rubbery quality youd expect out of something like sharknadothe cast and characters were very soso reynolds and karan soni dopinder were the best with leslie uggams blind al brianna hildebrand negasonic teenage warhead and stefan kapicic colossus rounding out the better cast and characters the villains ed skrein as ajax and gina carano as angel dust were very mediocre bordering on boring and you have to wonder if its due to the small roster of villains fox have or they just wanted dull villains so the major focus goes to deadpoolif i remember correctly daniel cudmore who played colossus in the xmen films was asked to play the character again in the film but he turned it down why the hell would you do that colossus spoke and was in more of this movie than he was in all three xmen filmsanother thing i loved about this film was the constant jabs at fox marvel green lantern reynolds himself the skewed timeline and many many morean entertaining film that i will most definitely be seeing again buying when its released and eagerly awaiting the just announced sequelchappy thinks watching a guy in a suit turning that other guy into a fcking kebab has never been more awesome,comedy
i actually bought tickets for this movie when it was released but after watching 5 minutes i couldnt stand anymore the nonsense and dehumanization it promotes like blood and absurd and humiliating ways to kill people that is not funny is stupid after heard the noise from a lot of people saying that the movie was good i decided to give it a second chance and maybe try to watch it with a different perspective but it was the same there is nothing good i could say about the movie it is just really stupid i dont understand how people can say they like it not judging but kind of sad to think about thateven worst to know i live in a world where there is a second movie of this,comedy
in essence it is a parody of comic films but he himself is one so you can not parody something but create an equivalent i am absolutely sure that the cinema is over the fact that a masterpiece is created from time to time does not mean anything because the masterpiece does not win the billions and they are lucrative like this despite some really successful hits i can not understand how this movie won so much audience and so much money i repeat the cinema is over otherwise ryan reynolds is a nice artist but there are better movies i love parodies but this is a pure comic book a bit more unusual but a comic so my rating is rating  3,comedy
it will probably be the most unpopular opinion from me but its the most honest my introduction to happened in the early 90s when i was looking through the xmen action figures at a walmart and saw the character for the first time it looked cool but i dismissed him as another generic character that looked less like an xmen and more a gi joe villain that would probably lose to snake eyes that was then and now he has his own film and i still dont understand the appeal i like the style and the gore factor i even chuckled at some of the jokes of the film when it comes down to the movie itself i just couldnt get into the character of wade wilson i thought he was annoying and loud throughout the whole thing i didnt see anything unique about the fourth wall break as its been done to death and better in films such as fight club and ferris buellers day off the insane world created for the film is more appropriate for a japanese anime on a sugary high the villains are just there for to have an excuse to kill and the people he interacted with have more to say than our titular hero i felt like i was watching a superhero film directed by a guy that wanted to impress quentin tarantino after watching kill bill for the first time but didnt realize he was better off watching shogun assassin instead i dont necessarily think its a bad movie i think its a funny romp on the superhero genre but shouldve focused more on the satire than making penis jokes and references no one understandsis unique but is not as smart as it wants the audience to think it is this is ryan reynolds saving grace after so many failures and stinkers at the box office one comes to think will this film series be the only thing that will keep him from making straight to video or put him in obscurity ill admit i enjoyed the elements of it but thats just it there are only elements to enjoy as the rest of the movie is a loud mtv film with too many bells and whistles and not enough meat if you want a good laugh stick to the naked gun series if you want carnage and blood stick to the best of 80s actioni give it a 7 out of 10 it works when it has to despite its annoying character,comedy
awesome action packed movietotally enjoyed the commentary and breaking the 3rd and 4th wall how many times do you see a movie and just want to yell did you see that or  i cant believe thisor you are wondering what is going on in the characters head favorite movie i have seen in a while look forward to the next one you have big shoes to fill,comedy
one of the best films ever made the writing combined with the delivery is what sells this film im drunk and being such a film fanatic i can even tell how good the writing is really smart and straight to the point the amount of fourth wall breaking that everyone did expect for genuine humour and gory action is what is and therefore what ryan reynolds is its everything you need in a film to be honest i have more favourite films than this to be completely honest like the dark knight and whiplash but to be honest hits me at a different level which is the reason why i review it 2 better not be a flop cause they have a lot to live up to,comedy
funny dark humor very sarcastic about superhero movies in a way hollywood does not use to be as there are jokes all the time not all of them are nice but many are the first half hour is excellent the rest of the film is nice but does not keep the same level there are also some too obviously predictable scenes the main villain ajax is a major drawback as a much better actor was needed to be casted for this important role the usage of visual effects is extreme but very well done with interesting outcomes as the opening credits and scene show violence is also extreme and not taken seriously in a way tarantinos films are the main examples,comedy
the opening credits are very funny its an unusual marvel movie with swears and more it is definitely different it has intense blood sure there are some sexual parts that i didnt watch because im pretty young but other than that it is very cool different and very funny i just saw it for the first time a few nights ago and i sure did like it and as i said the opening credits are so funny starring gods perfect idiot a hot chick gosh gets me every time i was laughing on the inside while i was writing this anyways the movie was intense and funny all at the same time i liked it very much swears blood thats everything i like thank you marvel for making this movie,comedy
total waste of time this movie was so bad that its even difficult to comment or think of where to beginthe description is also a bit misleading it should say a trashtalking 2nd rate wannabe mercenary who thinks vulgarity is humorous is subjected to a rogue experiment that leaves him with accelerated healing powers and a quest for revenge due to a facial deformation side effectconstant unnecessary foul language and vulgar nonsense preteen type comments from this empty headed nonhero loser is mostly responsible for turning a potentially decent move into nothing more than a trashy preteen  teen film that teens arent even supposed to watch but maybe that was the whole purpose of this waste of resources to begin with but then again even a preteen would find this movie lame,comedy
ryan reynolds is indeed the perfect anarchic motormouthed regular guy turned vigilante crimefighter the constant gags humor and referential jabs are just as overthetop as is the brutal action and violence putting these writers together with this director made a movie that will be mentioned forever by far one of the superhero movie i have seen even my wife who is not a superhero fan laughed cringed sighed so much that this has converted her to a superhero fan definitely not a kids movie although they would love it too cant say it enough awesome from the beginning to the end keeping and eye for a sequel to this outrageous movie,comedy
wow this movie really blew me up i was not expecting this at all having a life and not being a nerd i had no clue about this character i love him finally someone that is not a product of the hollywood crappy world of illuminatithis antihero is exactly what i would be if in a similar situation i might actually be even more crazy this guy is simply not accepting the weakways of the batman superman and all the man series that follow the laws so that the criminal can still get out and make more lawyers work hey even losers need money the fact they use a dishonest job to get it is only part of the horror but then again they are stupid humansto me is the real hero of earth when he gets a criminal that criminal will not do evil again with batman and superman he would be back out on the streets within 2 weeks they use the law you know that thing for some losers to make a salarythere is plenty of action laugh in my case at least and yes violence if you dont want violence watch the smurfs or tinkerbell the comments from made me laugh the whole movie i like his disrespect of the caped boy scouts which i agree with i loved the vulverine ones it took me 5 minutes to stop laughing it is so true big knives instead of fingers but cannot even scratch a villain wimp freddy krueger was scarier and more efficient than vulverineto the people that did not like the movie i can say stick with your twilight crap for the real movie amateurs this is a must it will show you that you can be a bitch and a hero,comedy
right from the opening credits itself youll find yourself realizing that this is the kind of superhero movie which is definitely different in fact it wouldnt be wrong to say that it is a muchneeded shot in the arm for the superhero genre in general while there has been no shortage of comic book hero adaptations into film in recent times is one with a difference for one it breaks the fourth wall  that barrier between the film and the audience this results in the kind of viewer involvement that is both endearing and extremely refreshing youll see yourself laughing out loudly throughout the whole movie it catches you from the start till the endive rated it a 810 because of the basic storyline although thats not what this movie was made for i would say it could have used a better one,comedy
acknowledging the generic nature of your film is one thing but its only a halfstep towards avoiding being generic at all for all its offthewall innovation is still a perfect fit for the marvel movie mould take a wisecracking superhero with a helpless sexualised love interest a 2dimensional british villain and an assortment of bizarre sidekicks and sprinkle with explosions spelling this template out in the wacky opening credits is not defence enough against its conformismattempts to subvert longestablished marvel standards through breaking the 4th wall  a technique which loses its potency in constantly occurring seemingly more often than actual dialogue  and its absurd jokes this at least is a success  irreverence piles up as sexual abuse victims drug addicts and cancer sufferers are all thrown under the bus in the name of offbeat humour nonetheless inevitable cringeinducing superhero epigrams make appearances too popculture referencing is another tenet of marvel films and this manifests itself abundantly to the delight of marvel aficionados in the audience superhero films have always cornered the market in specialfx budgets and cinematography and is no exception the action sequences really are breathtaking the violence fortuitous the aberrant 15rated certificate is made full use of with fbombs and gory lacerations littered like bullet casings throughouteven though it punches above the level of previous marvel features still suffers from the usual pitfalls of plot holes predictable story arcs poor emotional pacing and stock characters what redeems it is its superior sense of humour irreverent tone and subtle boundarypushing in the form of 4thwallbreaks and gratuitous violence,comedy
the perfect movie i was waiting for seriously ryan reynolds is the perfect choice for must watch movie  yess please watch in theaterstalk about vfx very high quality visual effects did in this movie in less budget as they saidwatching ryan reynolds playing as is so much fun i just loved it there are lots of easter eggs in the movie  yeah in post credits scene talks about sequel omg i can wait for itthere are crazy stunts in the movie lot of drama we got all full package entertainment is the first movie then oh boy what they will feed us in next movies of if they madea big ryan reynolds  fan this movie is 100 worth to watchthank you ryan reynolds  team,comedy
the debuting director tim mller manages to show great shots of action e give the right rhythm to the film using the man of steel way of telling origins stories the movie balances between the super hero origin story and his mission to take down the villain which is very badly built the tone of the film is broken only by its antagonists they cant be taken seriously and dont represent a big threat the jokes are very well placed and are a delight to the public especially the ridiculous amount of bad language since is a movie for mature audiences the sex and violent scenes dont hold back and seen to be enough to hold the movie more than that wasnt necessary wades friend credited as the comic relief is not that funny himself is above him in this matter about the x men himself makes a joke about that the studio couldnt pay the other xmen members giving space to a cgi colossus and the young mutant negasonic teenage warhead both perform great action scenes and serve as a support for the merc with a mouth the movies makes jokes all the time with everything imaginable full of references of the pop culture the xmen universe and super hero movies in general even ryan reynolds himself the movie even counts with a exciting post credit scene it worth wait in the theater for a while,comedy
is by far one of the best movies to come out of marvel cinematic universe if you have read any comics previously you would know that wade wilson is loaded with humor his humor in the comics and his personality is perfectly portrayed through ryan reynolds in this film which is why it has a rating r definitely not suitable for children but perfect for the big kid in every adult you will laugh your  off in the cinema for the full 108 minutes even then remember to stay for the post credit scene you will want to see it plus be on the lookout for the infamous stan lee cameo as known to be in most marvel films one of his funniest,comedy
i saw starring ryan reynoldsgreen lantern bladetrinity moreana baccaringothamtv spy ed skreinthe transporter refueled game of thronestv gina caranoin the blood haywire and tj miller transformersage of extinction cloverfield this is the first super hero movie of 2016 and they knocked it out of the park they really captured the spirit of the comic book character that made his first appearance back in 1991 in new mutants 98 from the opening credits you can tell this is going to be a different kind of super hero movie ryan plays aka wade wilson aka the merc with a mouth he got that last nickname because he is always making jokes sort of like spiderman on speed ryan also played wade wilson in xmenorigins wolverine of course this being the origin of you learn how he became including how he got the name moreana plays ryans girlfriend and tj is his friend that also runs the local bar that ryan hangs out at ryan is a former special forces mercenary that finds out he has cancer and gets an invitation to participate in an experimental procedure to cure it ed is the administrator of the socalled cure which does cure the cancer and gives him the healing factor of wolverine but in the process it mutates his body into a freddy krueger lookalike ed and his lab assistant gina have plans of turning ryan into a super slave for the highest bidder but ryan doesnt plan on cooperating there are several cameos including a couple of xmen and stan lee pops up in a strip club there is a scene after the end credits so dont leave too soon its rated r for violence language and sexual contentincluding nudity so do not take the little impressionable children to this one and has a running time of 1 hour  48 minutes i really enjoyed this movie and would buy it on bluray,comedy
having seen all of the marvel movies this is a refreshing movie that had me laughing throughout many parts of the showing you have to be quick to caught many of the one or two words lines that keep you looking for more that makes you laugh your either going to love this movie and give it a 4 or 5 stars rating or your going to hate it and give it a one star luckily for me im the 5 star person violence is throughout this movie so for the weak minded go watch zoolander 2 hello for the 1 star reviewers its rated r so you better expect that its not a thor or iron man movie this is the 2nd marvel that surprised me with ant man being the first but i loved this movie much more than i expected,comedy
dude eat a duck pen of ork long duck ive got to write more lines for this to qualify as a movie review is this long enough no ok today was a good day i saw and dissected a pig i even got a pun in now i hear you askingtheres no pun here here it is i was talking to this girl about our biology test and when she said she was glad we did not have the urine system on it i said as follows yeah that would have been poss o  1 haha lolz i think this is long enough now ok great bye byewell its not yet long enough and i think i should say something about the movie its really cool go watch it,comedy
i have to say that this movie is one of the worse out there it is zero stars for me i am a fan of xmen and the marvel universei have seen all the movies so i decided to watch this one based on the 8 star review from the imdb the reason i was avoiding it is because i really did not like the character as it was presented in wolverine origins  a film i really enjoyed watching the character should remain dead because he was awful not only they did not leave him there dead they decided to make a movie about himthis movie is supposed to be special because he is an anti hero who cares of course the movie is special because it is absolutely garbage no one should watch it i can not even explain how awful it is how on earth this movie got 8 stars i think the reviews are paid reviews it does not make any sense i could not watch it until the end because it was hard for me please dont watch it,comedy
i actually thought i had a dodgy dvd and the directors commentary couldnt be turned it off i was cursing my mate dave turns out thats part of the filmis excellent crazy action intelligent comedy fast paced romance spoiler alert it actually ads to the story and well written characters only let down is the villain hes sort of rubbish but that didnt affect the overall enjoyment of the movie looking forward to more of these maybe a family affair with burt reynolds as the villainhighly recommended,comedy
definitely one of the best superhero movies ive seen so far both in comedy and action scenes the only thing i do not quite convince me was the villain but come on this film was intended for nondemanding public and most of all for fox redeem the error in xmen origins wolverine also can say that the jokes and references in the movie were fun almost bust of laughter however there are scenes that can become dull when viewing all the action but are necessary to understand the story behind his clear way also the scenes with the xmen and references to possible encounters with other xmen are great and give us a good sign for the future of finally i say its a film to hang out and have fun not expecting much behind,comedy
the antihero engages in four main activities body slams body impaling shoot emups and wisecracks probably the last one is what gives its primary trademark although the wisecracks are not necessarily directed to other characters throughout the film which was true of the original marvel creation stops what hes doing looks at the camera and speaks to the audience in true kevin spacey style he even breaks further walls when he references the studio who financed the film and how they couldnt afford other xmen charactersthe film begins with a kind of cgi still of one of the action sequences with unusual credits instead of the typical starring suchandsuch the opening credits say things like starring gods perfect idiot for the star and a british villain for the baddie and my favorite directed by an overpaid tool instead of naming the talent this was actually one of the cleverest parts of the film wade wilson ryan reynolds has donned a costume using the name and is on his way to meet his englishaccented nemesis hes in a cab on his way to meeting the guy who corrupted his face and body his face looks like freddie kruger of a nightmare on elm street fame crossed with a topographical map of utah according to his sortoffriend and bartender weaselthen we flashback a couple of years before wade wilson became he was your friendly neighborhood roughemup for hire if you were in bad company of people who were even more amoral than you you could hire wilson to rough them up or possibly eliminate them depending upon your needs wilson hangs at a bar of strange and very wicked characters who makes the guy wanted in 12 systems in the bar at mos eisley in the original star wars seem like a highclass gentleman wilson takes care of business there and a constant betting pool is shown on a blackboard at the back of the bar people actually bet on whether a regular in the bar might be killed weasel even bets wilson would be the victim there wilson meets the love of his life vanessa morena baccarin and they begin first as a sex couple but eventually fall in love with each other until wilson finds out he has terminal cancerhe explains the situation to weasel telling him he has el cancer in more parts of his body than he can count then he meets a strange man who claims to be part of a government operation to make those who are terminally ill into better and stronger people sort of the 6 million man for mutants he goes to the clinical where he meets ajax real name francis ed skrein who informs him that this is not a governmental agency at all but rather an independent operation they make new people out of terminally ill patients then sell them to the highest bidder as mutant slaves ajax injects wilson with some kind of mutating drug which wont create a bodily reaction unless wilson is subjected to all kinds of torture the last one does but it changes his skin and face into the equivalent of pale hamburger the only positive effect his cancer is cured he is able to leave the clinic under a rather complex set of circumstancesthen wilson tries to find vanessa but he is reluctant to face her because of his changed looks he then moves in as a tenant of a blind woman name of blind al leslie uggams he wants a cure for his disfigurement and creates the red costume and adopts the name looking for ajaxfrancis he batters and slashes people in the most horrendous of situations looking for ajax but referring to him as francis ajax realizes hes on his trail and in retaliation he kidnaps vanessathis film is reasonably wellwritten and i liked the breaking of the fourth wall with comments witticisms reference pop culture such as im gonna do to your face what limp bizkit did to music in the late 90s or  i had another liam neeson nightmare i kidnapped his daughter and he just wasnt having it at first he tells us the film is a love story but later contradicts himself and says its really a horror moviethe storyline is pretty basic as far as superhero films go baddie does something horrendous to the hero and kidnaps girlfriend and hero has to save her within the larger framework is a whole series of very violent action sequences which are definitely not for the feint of heart in some places i thought the violence was a bit overdone im not too fond of lots of impaling throughout all sequences are very offhand and even tongueincheek witticisms the jokes to the audience made some of the more violent scenes a bit more tolerable but some scenes were quite over the top particularly the initial action sequence still a relatively original and alternative take on the superhero genre he even admits at one point hes no hero no kidding,comedy
 staring ryan reynolds and morena baccarin wade wilson is a former special forces operative who works as a mercenary in new york city heis diagnosed with terminal cancer and is subjected to a rogue experiment that leaves him with accelerated healing powers adopting the alter ego  marvel knocked it out of the park with this one  is one of the best movies of the year  it has action  comedy  drama it has it all reynolds nails his role as in the head he has the attitude the look everything there was no flaw in his performance in this one  i give this movie 4 stars all across the board  this film will leave laughing your ass off while giving you quite a few oh crap moments as he kicks the life out of  well just about everyone  this is definitely not a movie for anyone under 16 unless you dont mind them seeing non stop violence and countless swearing  but not only was this movie absolutely one of the best comic  superhero movie but easily the movie of the year  so i recommend this to anyone looking for a fun watch even if your not into comic movies you will love this one,comedy
is one of the funniest movies i have ever seen for a long long time every thing about this movie was made to make you laugh from the first minute to the ending crediti have read reviews claiming that there is no proper story in the moviefor those people i say who cares as long it makes you laugh because the main purpose of this movie is pure fun and some times this all what we need yes i am a big fan of nolans movies but also some times i need a movie like for a relief and laughso please guys dont mix things together and try to understand and appreciate each movie genrealso i found some reviews saying that annoying because he talks too much the funny thing is in wolverine xmen origin people complained that he not talking at all in a matter of fact fans knew that has a big mouth and its part of his character the thing was done in the movie right and actually he has the biggest mouth ever and every line in his dialogue was really funny,comedy
i watched this today and had a good time it wasnt really more or less than i expected top 250 quality hmmm iffy the marvel franchise really needed something rrated like kickass and this seemed to do the job i got a kick out of the 4th wall jokes i like movies that poke fun at themselves i thought the pacing was good except for the sexromance scenes there were some funny moments but it dragged sometimes there and felt too much like movies from around 1980 where sex was inserted whether you liked it or not i would have had a less trouble with this but some fool brought a girl into the theater who couldnt have been more than 8 years old i can appreciate bawdy humor but thats the stuff for grownupsfor the most part the writing is good characters are fun opening scene is very creative cgi is what i expected seems to carry the spiderman dark humor just raunchier for those who gave 1star reviews im going to get dr forrester and pearl and make you sit through movies until you give better ratings gigli anyone,comedy
witty sarcastic humor tons of great and heavy luls action sequences characters music flashbacks quotables one of the best movies gawd i loved weasels fondness of ahahaha one of my fave characters in the movie there were some things that werent explained that much like when wade told vanessa that she might not accept him but who wants a lengthy explanation at the end of the movie maybe when done creatively tho anyway i really love this movie wish i can watch more of this genre i enjoyed every moment and i loved the humor and vulgarity no dead air ryan reynolds is the perfect choice for he sounds sarcastically great too energetic which fit the character perfectly love it i thought there was really a need for vulgar explicit language bec its not when its too timid undoubtedly one of my favorites must watchwatched on apr 2 sat,comedy
spoilers this is not a romance movie bloody violent and full of nudity is not a movie for the weak no matter how many billboards television commercials or people saying how great it is it is by no means a romance movie however it is a great movie if youre up to vulgar scenes obscure language and plenty of wellplaced fires the scoring of the movie was based on a scale out of five wellplaced fires in the movie there is a significant role that the wellplaced fires play due to the nudity content the well placed fires aid in keeping the film rated ri found to be hilariously funny throughout the whole movie the relationship between wade and vanessa showed to be one of shady vulgarity and plenty of sexual contact although like most couples they had their arguments at some points yet they still show a strong affection toward each other when tragedy hits them hard wade sets on a desperate attempt to rid him of his cancer this also meant leaving vanessa behind as he set out to become a superhero as he gets wheeled into an eerie and dark socalled hospital wade meets ajax later known as francis and gets his first taste of torture in their attempts to make him a superhuman while they said they would make him a superhero their actual attempt was to create wade into a human with super abilities they would then sell wade into slavery due to the fact wade talks back a lot and sasses everyone with his sarcasm and humor ajax becomes very annoyed and tortures him even further to the point where he becomes known as becomes obsessed with one thing in mind finding francis and making him fix the mess hes become overall i feel like the directors did a great job with turning this comic book character into a well thought out movie i loved the comedy throughout yet it still had a feel of sadness romance sass and action definitely earned its way to five out of five well placed fires,comedy
is a fun movie ive never seen the comics or any of the other films and television programs with the character so didnt know what to expect i was admittedly a bit confused at first as the movie didnt play out like a typical superhero movie it took a while to adjust my expectations and i have no idea of who colossus and negasonic teenage warhead are supposed to be but assume they are new xmen recruits but my lack of familiarity with the franchise didnt seriously impair my enjoyment the acting is good particularly by reynolds and skrein special effects are excellent although a bit heavy on wire work for my tastes fight choreography is excellent the vehicular carnage was adequate to the task some interesting minor characters including the taxi driver soni the pizza guy dayne and colossus a few of the snappy oneliners were not as effective as others but most were amusing makeup effects and cgi were excellent overreliance on jiggly cam shots for my tastes although they disguised much of the jitter with slow camera movements but the movement is noticeable in many shots and distracting in some ryan reynolds definitely carried the show with a great combination of wit and physicality im definitely looking forward to the next installment reportedly due in 2017,comedy
the film that has it all the humour the pace the direction the acting all 100 perfect is like someone who was resurrected into another species whatever you do to him kill decapitate torture him he will still carry on and succeed his missionryan reynolds is now one of the funniest and most intimidating marvel character his role from green lantern to this has improved 995 i mean what film but this would you find an uproarious and hysterical protagonist the only r rated film has redeemed itself this film is extremely inappropriate at times and is strongest on his comedic behavior when it comes to battles the only reason why i left the other 2 stars is because i thought this film was too inappropriate and had luckily kept its 15 rated uk the sex scenes were very unsuitable for even 12 year olds a bit too graphical on it the majority of the characters in seemed all right at times and i thought it could do a bit better with its action sequences considering it is a r rated film so it should include more graphical violence his thoughts on revenge were very funny especially when he used the dead bodies towards the end of the film to spell out the antagonists name which suggests how serious but hilarious he is i liked his ideas on revenge considering he was chosen to be in an experiment to cure his cancer problems so i must admit he did his job well satisfying filmthe film that includes graphical humour and images,comedy
the superhero movies certainly arent on the top of my list of genres got to admit that i found one of the most enjoyable superhero movies ive seenthe film really revolves around ryan reynolds as the lead character deadpoolwade reynolds is made for this role and it is very similar to the way that robert downey jr plays iron man the plot really plays second fiddle to the wise cracks of and this gives the movie a feel of a comic no doubt this will become a franchise but something tells me its this original that i will enjoy the most check it out and enjoy,comedy
heads up this review might contain some spoilersi understand why this movie gets negative criticism you cant please everyone at least not with such movie as not to put it on pedestal and praise it to heavens but this piece was done smart and wittyif you hate f words and cursing all around youre watching a wrong movie if you like black grim humor sprinkled with sarcasm you wont get half of the things plus if you dont have some basic knowledge of superhero genre you might not get half of the things wikipedia helpsbut if youre all in that you can expect smart and well done jokes that just abuse this movie in a good way and makes you ignore super plain and flat love story behind it you just want to see more of and the movie keeps on giving having in mind that this movie can appeal to those that arent involved in craziness of this character it shows the character as central char not some side merc that gets handled by other superherosi was never really a fan of prior the movie i found him annoying and forced hype around the movie didnt help either at this moment i cant say i adore and that im on a hype wagon for second movie but reynolds performance did splendid job from acting script even cgi and in the mix its awesome movie whole family can enjoy,comedy
lol thought he died in the wolverine movie they can do anything now oh well this one made up for that one in droves thank you ryan for doing your best and simply being the same character in the most your movies hey if it aint broke dont fix it haha this is a movie for adults so you people who bring their kids into the theater and walk out all bitter jack holes its rated r what more to you want porn come on at least 3 couples with kids left when i was watching the show and in true fashion my popcorn found its way to them enjoined the movie need more people in it next time but since it made the money they wanted the next one will have no expenses spared hopefully,comedy
merc with a mouth clowns in his own movie after his cameo appearance in xmen origins as mercenary wade wilson which also rather contradicts this filmryan reynolds finally has a monster hit in wisecracking his way through and breaking the fourth wall multiple times the film also serves as a origins tale which disguises the fact that this revenge saga has a thin story wants ajax ed skrein the british villain responsible for leaving him with a deformed face after experimenting on him to unleash his hidden x genes and who has now kidnapped his girlfriend pursues him with the help of a few xmen that foxs budget allowsthe film was made by first time director tim miller who sets his stall and tone of the movie with the flippant opening titles as marvel films go this one is rude the violence more visceral the comedy a bit hit and miss as reynolds makes fun of the xmen and marvel in general including the disney marvel films even finds time to make fun of a handsome actor called ryan reynoldsi found the film amusing but the plot was weak and the budget was low which the director was disguising with his own slicing and dicing reynolds though found the right tone,comedy
first of all i would like to make a statementthis is the best movie ive ever seen in my entire life its got a whole bunch of elements related to comedy drama action romance and much much more this movie manage to bring one of the most hilarious fictional character from marvels universe to life in a terrific way ryan reynolds is absolutely incredible as he just fits the character as if they were one i went to the cinema without much of an expectation and got out singing and laughing so hard the soundtrack was amazing the action scenes were incredible well done with a lot of details the comedy was just superb the script theres no words to describe how good it was plus this is the first time a character ever spoke to its audience at least in my universe of cinema experience and it was just awesome this is a must see for anyone who enjoys a good comedy or a good action movie or a good romance or a good drama or a goodwell this movies got it all just watch it,comedy
has been a film i have been looking forward to for a few years now but i was always worried about its execution but fear not this film is fantastic the premise of this film sees an ex secret service soldier with a wicked sense of humour transformed into a mercenary on the hunt for his creator ryan reynolds has been lobbying for this role for a few years and he has succeeded in his redemption this is the perfect role for him because of how much he loves the character he is the loudmouth outlandish character that you totally want out of but he also brings some humanity to the character morenna baccarin plays the love interest vanessa and she was a really good character in the film her chemistry with reynolds was brilliant and it really helped me by their romance ed skrien plays the villain in this film and fair play to him because he does a good job even though his character is quite clich he really worked for this film everybody else was great collosus negasonic teenage warhead weasel and angel dust also really added allot to the film the story of this film is very simple but it plays on the simplicity for humour and it works also the flashbacks documenting rise was great stuff the script is one of the most unique ever written probably in film history the humour is great with so many in jokes and some well placed drama however sometimes the jokes just dont hit because they were in the trailer the style of the film is brilliant the combination of humour and action really works and this film needed to be the rated r film that it ended up being overall this is a fantastic success of a film and i so want a sequel,comedy
after the disappointment appearance in 2009s xmen origins wolverine the merc with the mouth returns with a vengeance 2015s shows that movie character resurrection is indeed possible based on the marvel comics character of the same name and directed by tim miller this ratedr superhero film is a rarity most superheroes movies tend to be pg13 to fit larger with the general audience doesnt do that its lives on the gimmick of having extreme graphic violence nudity  sex and harsh profanity as its selling point using overthe top adulttheme super hero type humor similar to films like 2010s kickass  2010s super as its calculus the 20th century produce film is by comparison a lot more raunchy than its xmen counterparts or its marvel studio produce film rivals however i felt that the film doesnt go far enough to use the rated r subject matter enough to make the paperthin story of revenge seem very compelling its only use as a joking matter somehow they were able to made normally extremely uncomfortable taboo subjects like incest rape and murder somewhat too lightheartened as jokes than tools dont get me wrong i like how the movie use its break the fourth wall meta humorous style but its only surface deep honestly if you cut it away all the fan service the movies plot is pretty damn generic like 1990s action movie generic i know im probably get heat for this but i just thought maybe they would do just something more intense or sophisticated it remind me too much of a low brow version of 2005s v for vendetta without the political philosophy and social commentary let again i actually do enjoyed the small scale of the story and scope it is a refreshing break from all the overused saving the world plots we have had and will have coming down the pike i would definitely move that con to a pro however i cant say the same about the marketing campaign in which trailers are making seem like a romance movie yes most of the film focus on him falling in love with a formerprostitute vanessa carlysle morena baccarin only to find out that hes been diagnosed with incurable metastatic cancer however its here where the movie veers from romance into an oddly done revenge film that wade wilson aka ryan reynolds honestly mostly cause damage to his self offer for a chance of survival to be experimented on and tortured until his body mutates and heals itself wades sarcasm and caustic wit become too much for his experimenter dr ajax ed skrein who ends up torturing wade until his skin looks burned and disfigured after escaping from the clinic wade feels too insecure to approach vanessa and reestablish his relationship with her only to instead reinvent himself as with the goal of getting dr ajax to reverse the treatment if you really think deep about it all of this problems is because wades somewhat annoying and obnoxious personality not the weaksocalled british villain despite the frail origin story and how he came to be one thing worth saying is that ryan reynolds was born to play this loudmouthed acidtongued antihero with the ability to crush heads and crack up audiences hes charismatic exuberant and largerthanlife which isnt easy considering how much of the film he spends either in a fullbody costume voicing a cgi character or beneath heavy prosthetics with his action skills athletic build and wellhoned comic timing reynolds made the action scenes so much more impressive than its honorably seem i just wish the movie would mention or use comic book power of teleportation i guess the carries devices like the magic satchel that grant him that power and holographic disguise was a little too much to sink in for the general mature viewer i guess it was also decide to be cut so to make the movie more selfcontained and leave some room for any future films on the weapon x project power in this film is from his own innate mutation rather than derived from comic book wolverine character btw another thing that seem to be missing from this movie is vanessa carlysles mutant powers where in the hell is her shapeshifter or power mimicry powers i guess they didnt want anything too much that didnt seem normalcy since they had the xmen cameos from colossus voiced by stefan kapicic and negasonic teenage warhead brianna hildebrand already bringing the superpowers part to the script also when exactly did colossus and meet they never establish that its too bad that we didnt get to see any other xmen characters like cable or genesis from the comics im hoping for sure to see them in the sequel to this maybe a disney own marvel crossover as well who knows anyways instead we got tj miller as wades only real friend an arms dealer named weasel but he comes across watchable than super hilarious i wasnt a big fan of his work not sure how his star power rose over the years i mostly find him mediocre as best as a comedian however we do get to see an actor hugh jackman and marvels editor stan lees cameo also an after credit scene so thats something not to miss anyways while im not the biggest fan of i have to give the movie a lot of credit in making a film the fans of the comic book series wanted all along overall i enjoyed every moment of it a watchable superhero movie indeed,comedy
i have so much to say i wish i could make a you tube review okay i have been a huge fan of for a long time when i was in fourth grade i read my first comic book which was classic the pg one i immediately fell in love i looked everywhere for a movie and was sad ti realize there wasnt one my love for grew throughout the years and i bought more and more merchandise when the wolverine movie came out i hated it and they made so wrong that i a huge fan didnt even know it was a year ago i hear rumors about a movie i see the test footage i immediately started a petition which failed but i want alone with this the main reason it wasnt green lit yet was due to fox worrying about the r rating it obviously was going to get and we now know that to be quite true of an issue but they finally got working on it i even made my parents promise to take me the day came opening day february twelve i come in with so much excitement and a shirt and i was sad really sad that it ended so soon it was a fantastic movie that gave me what i wanted and more but i never wanted it to end the opening credits were hilarious produced by asshats and the way that everything was slowed down reminded me of the opening for zombieland the jokes in my opinion were funny and people who say that he never stopped talking have not read the comic because you dont get the nickname merc with a mouth fir no reason the way they did the origin was perfect the music was great the way how they put the love interest in danger made it suspenseful and when he shot ajax completely ignoring colossus made me laugh so hard i definitely touched myself that night people who were butthurt by this movie obviously had no prior knowledge on because in this movie was they came in thinking its just another marvel super hero movie that i will enjoy and has the same format it is not dont go with your parents the sex scenes can be awkward finally if your kid is under fourteen dont take them it is not appropriate for them you dint deserve a refund and no dont give a pg13 version they dont have to watch every super hero movie that comes out all in all with the small budget of 58 million dollars with a shooting length of only 48 days and the main software using being adobe premiere cc they made a fantastic film that lived up to my extremely high expectations i already pre ordered the movie and it is by far my favorite movie nine out of ten chimchangas because it left me wanting more,comedy
i have been waiting for this movie since first teaser this is real masterpiece me and my friends had so much fun watching this movie story screenplay  direction were excellent every scene is carefully directed when u watch this movie you gonna love each and every moment of the movie this movie certainly reached my expectation the character is very well displayed just like in the comics to talk about acting ryan played a massive role in acting even though most of the time he will be under mask the bonding with character is great so much fun stuff this makes us watch movie again and again i really miss 3d but it doesnt matter anymore this movie is great i really recommend to everyone,comedy
i saw on the premiere and i had high expectations for the movie to say the least i left the cinema with no regret or dissatisfaction after the intro where they write the honest titles for the cast and producers such as starring a hot guy and other hilarious things i couldve left the movie then and there satisfied i love that he breaks the fourth wall in the movie and it makes the movie thousands of times better when we first were introduced to colossus and negasonic teenage warhead and thought oh wow we are in the xavier mansion well probably see some big xmen characters but we never did and then later in the movie says big house youre in weird that we havent seen any other xmen characters its like the producers didnt have enough money to have the big actors so funny i cried about 5 times during the movie because of laughter ive given the movie 10 out of 10 because i cant give it a higher review of course it is not for everyone so dont bring your 7 year old child to the movie,comedy
i just loved  and thats saying something because i walked into the theater with very high expectationsif at all i have complaints they are minimal  one that it would have been amazing to see the inside of mind  after what they have in the comics i thought that would be a given everything else about the movie was classic deadpooli loved the easter eggs  whether it was the green lantern card at the opening credits or the scene after the movie ends  but i guess my favourite scene was probably when he starts his dialogue with the cab driver when colossus and ntw were in itthat scene completely cracked me up as did most of the scenes loved the little floating cartoons with broken hearts as well    an absolute mustwatch,comedy
remember xmen originswolverine2009 well this movie tells you totally forget that and watch this instead cause it tells the origins of has it meant to be told the merck with a mouth named wade wilsonryan reynolds discovers he has terminal cancer but is offered by someone to be apart of an experiment is told that it would cure is cancer and give him superhuman abilities but after it horribly disfigures him wade soon embarks on revenge with his newfound skills has deadpooli believe that fans of the character will not be disappointed is supposed to be an incredible over the top cocky character and if you have seen blade trinity2004 you know ryan reynolds can play that to a tease not only a marvel movie but a satire of a marvel movie pokes fun at all those superhero cliques ryan reynolds is clearly having fun here so is the rest of the cast its not hard to imagine that was a lot of laughing during the filming you clearly see it in the acting the effects are incredible and the action is over the top but this is a movie expect nothing more or less it has hard r violence just by saying this is not a kid friendly marvel film i was very entertained by thisbut if you are easily offended you should probably stay away from this,comedy
is very good haha haha i enjoy movie funny make laugh russian colossus warhead mega sonic huge ackman mask tiny baby hand unicorns wtf stan lee at strip club cable in sequel keira knightly playing cable valentines day me so lonely colossus vomiting funny xmen jokes soundtrack hahahahahahahahah will recommend good film haha hahaha one legged try so hard avocado sex careless whisper why the red suit haha green lantern jokes f words sex montage fran cis hahanegatives film finished sadness want moreby jeff,comedy
if theres one thing does it is entertaining the audience it breaks the fourth wall constantly which any howtowritea screenplay book would surely suggest not to do as it defeats the illusion of the movie to do this but this is not just any movie this is deadpoolryan reynolds is the perfect choice of casting to play the titular character his quip constantly hits the audience blow after blow to prove for a very likable superhero though he wouldnt call himself a hero he may be in the suit but it is his voice acting which really captures the essence of you can undoubtedly hear the sarcasm or the attitude that comes with all of his one linersthe movie is balanced in the sense that it flips back and forth between chronology rather than have all the exposition packed into the first half hour and follow the character on a linear path to him becoming the super human he becomes instead we have to ask questions as an audience and promises he will reveal the answers in flashbacks or rather with intercutting within the filmsadly pretty much all of the cool action is revealed in the red band trailers of the film which has us wanting more surprises which we never get overall the film seems to only have 2 key action sequences on top of that meaning this film is more about the origin story than it is about delivering theatrics although that is probably the point since is the first film please let there be sequels another disappointing aspect is the fact that the cgi for the character colossus is not that greatis a fun experience and it will have you asking whether all the fourthwallbreaking makes it a more enjoyable experience as a marvel movie3040,comedy
a sprinkle of smartassery some very cool camera work and a wacky overly comic book styled tone the opening credits had me in awe and the movie didnt let up these elements it kept up with the feel from start to finish this film was clearly a passion project and it shows the people behind this film have a love for the fans that came to see it opening day have love for and now the movie will introduce new people and welcome them to have love for filled with clever metahumour and wit this is the definition of a comicbook movie future marvel and dc projects should pay attention here the action is insanely fantastic i sat there simply impressed by what they accomplished in a movie that at first was probably considered something to not take seriously but this film holds up just as well against the other avengers films in terms of action and special effects from over the top physics which result in goons and bad guys being taken out on a whim by the merc with the mouth himself as well as a few xmen friends to the comedic as well as noncomedic brutality present throughout the movie isnt afraid to be violent which is actually quite an amazing thing henchmen kicked and punched sliced and diced shot and blown up and generally murdered in all sorts of creative ways throughout never restrains from violence  it embraces it wilson is portrayed with quickfire wit a sense of silliness but also a dark side wilson is quite a tragic character and the film should be praised for presenting this the comedy behind comes from misfortune and sadness he is a tortured soul a broken clown if you will the characters motivations are actually quite realistic and we see that this is a determined character with purpose this film is a revenge story and an action film as much as it is a superhero based comedy and there are some real moments to feel for which brings me to the love story which i found to actually be quite compelling there are certainly quite a few crass jokes here there and inbetween however to the core of the film portrays genuine heart and i think thats what really makes the film yes its a comedy yes its satirical of other superhero films and yes its wacky but its also a genuinely good film on its own the movie never drags at just under two hours i wanted it to keep going the pacing is absolutely perfect never once slowing down too much or becoming dull or uninteresting holds your attention and makes you care even when he is decapitating dudes left right and centre i do have one subjective flaw that i should probably mention though some of the jokes just fall completely flat and some feel like theyre just being gross and tasteless simply for the sake of it and due to the film makers freedom yes the film gained its american r rating but relax however i went in expecting this and most of it did its job well is a human being rather than a cartoon despite his personality the film was also so fast paced and quick cut that by the time one joke was said another was about to be and there was a fair share of fantastic jokes and humour throughout the tone of the film and titular character was pretty spot onthe real great thing about the movie is that it portrays correctly at this point ryan reynolds is renyolds fits into his role as a superhero icon among hugh jackmans wolverine and robert downey juniors ironman his comedic timing dedication to the role and faithful performance result in perfection the other characters set in this oddly dark as well as cartoon like world come in forms of different relationships to there is his love interest venessa whom matches wilsons personality she is much more of a normal person though so its toned down as she isnt a super human or anything however the characters compatibility is believable as they are both wiseass people who joke around with each other have vague and unhappy pasts and both feel strongly for each other ajax his nemesis of the film who is played very straight he is not an amazing character with lots of depth of personality however he is what the film needs out of a villain and gets the job done you dislike him in the way that you are supposed to and you do want to see reign victory over him is a character that you root for and a movie that you sit in astonishment at though at parts it may be silly never strives from admirable you care about him as much as you laugh with him and the film manages to maintain an extremely interesting and difficult balance is the definition of an unbalanced character could have easily gone wrong the minds behind the film have earned a welldeserved praise first time director tim miller knocked this one out of the park as well as writers rhett reese and paul wernick the film is vibrant and energetic its pure fun and doesnt take itself too seriously but manages to be able to when needed the film is stylish and oddly in a good way personal its deserving of praise fast paced and anything but conventional its far from boring funny and contains some really well done action and set pieces i enjoyed it from start to finish i finally got to see my hero done right on the big screen and i very much look forward to future instalments involving 1010,comedy
it was glorious sadly i saw kids in there im talking 57 years old that movie is definitely not for little kids the promotional stuff even said so and bad reviews on crude humor gore perverted jokes what do you think is about he isnt a goodietwo shoes character he is not a hero he is an antihero if those parents throw a fit ill fight them that movie is a glorious example of and how he behaves and speaks it was great better than great and for those same parents that throw a fit if your kids got the jokes in that movie then you have bigger worries than your bad parenting choices just sayingoverall i think they did a great job capturing the essence of any fan wont be disappointed id give it an 1110 but the rating system doesnt go that high,comedy
yeah yeah yeahits nothing like other superhero movieswhere hero fights the villain and wins at last for sure either by sparing his enemy or saving a friend its nothing like batman and green lantern its a movie complete in itself first half of movie in the middle gets a little bit boring but as soon as intermission approaches it gets bit more interesting and the second half is really very nicethe best part of the movie came after the creditsif you are going to watch the film in theatre wait for the marvel teaser which comes after the credits you will die laughing seriouslythe dialogues in the movie are too awesome and you will really like it but its not for the parents to take their children with them of course it is an a rated movie with a loads of adult dialogues which seriously require lot of humorits also a good movie if you are going with your valentineof course a love story too brilliant acting by ryan reynolds it is decent and at its best comparing to other marvel movies it is bringing freshness to a bit mundane superhero world and the best action scenes that i have seen so far in any movie of marvel universe finally best action comedy and it deserves an applause from the audience,comedy
i loved this movie no hype all truthi was worried that the movie might have been oversold but had to see it anyways does not disappoint in the slightest 4th wall breaks check politically incorrect check potato chips checkthe only thing negative i could say on the movie would just be nit picks i watched this with my mom who is in her fifties and she loved it it is fun for all ages yes all ages viewer discretion advisedspoileri would let my boys watch it though i would have to leave till sex scene plays i could cover their eyes instead but not sure if i should let them hear the audioend spoilerif you are on the fence about the movie as a warning we will be setting fire to the fence so hurry up and watch deadpool,comedy
so the movie starts and the crew members are introduced or rather described i start laughing and the rest is history i had to collect myself once the movie got over why did i have to collect myself once the movie got over  well i was in splits and the mind was blown  you would find pieces of me everywhere in the theatre i never wanted this movie to get over the only bad thing about this movie is that it gets over  and the fact that the protagonist is diagnosed with cancer otherwise there is only heavenly awesomeness in every scene pristine heavenly awesomeness is perhaps the most shameless unpretentious and blunt superhero ive seen off late his jokes are audacious and alarmingly beautiful his reflexes are the stuff of legends and if you are in his bad books youll be scared of his jabs he is a mutant you see and his alter ego wade wilson has an intense sex drive which is satisfied in possibly some of the raunchiest and innovative ways there could be so when mr wilson gets diagnosed with a terminal disease all hell breaks loose because he is kind of insecure that a zillion nice things would get compromisedi am not going to make this review unnecessarily long all i can say is ryan reynolds has more than made up for his green lantern stint by playing his character is the sole reason why anyone should watch this movie isnt just a bad ass he is a bad ass with a good ass,comedy
if you are in relationship watch if youre single go watch its that kind of movie2016 with full of superhero movies lined up this movie kicks off the year amazingly well make way for the superhero of gen next its fresh its fun and its a marvel epicsome of the action scenes are mindblowing well for us watching in india we dont have the liberty of seeing those extreme killing sequences and the inappropriate vulgar content even if you are 18 that sucks it really does so be prepared for few mute moments throughout the moviefor all those who are probably seeing for the first time or kind of getting load of this marvels hero is a comic character from marvel universe who suffers from cancer undergoes some experimentation and comes out as the most badass character you will ever see unlike other heroes he is violent cruel and cares least about human ethics and morals and hell still be super cool for all little boys who want to see this movie well you cannot doesnt want to see you grow up came watch the movie contains highly vulgar dialogues and hence the rrating coming towards the credits believe me you would not want to miss out the fun better be seated till the very end and thank me later d,comedy
the basic plot of is a boys girlfriend gets kidnapped by the bad guy and now he has to save her but there is another part the revenge part is driven to take down the man who has made him who he is right nowthe directing was done by tim miller this was his first movie he directed miller did a very good job at directing especcialy because it is his first movie the cinematography was pretty enough it wasnt really mindblowingly good but still it was nice to look at the pacing of this movie was really extraordinary it was really fast paced and that fitted the theme of the movie very well to come back on the directing again there were no shaky cams i absolutely loved that they didnt use that these things can ruin a movie the fight scenes were also well edited you could follow everything well the costume design was also pretty good i thought that the costume looked true to the comics and the rest was good as well the set design was good too now the cgi this is the part were you can see that they didnt really have a big budget the eyes of were cg and you could tell also collosus looked a bit too cg for me at least and now one of the best parts of the movie not regarding the acting and script the soundtrack this was really good its not music i will start listening to but it fitted the movie well very well actually the violence was very good too as i have said now shaky cam etc but it was very good choreographed too i am glad this movie got a rrating the blood and gore were very good in the moviethe acting was very good but lets start of with the best casted person of the entire movie you guessed it ryan reynolds this man was born to play deadpoolwade wilson he absolutely blew it out of the park you cant always see his face because of the mask but the voice acting and body acting was great on its own he was like hugh jackman playing wolverine absolutely fantastic straight out of the comic book series his character also had a lot of development then the next person is the best friend of wade wilso this was a man called weasel weasel was played by tj miller what i liked very much between those two was the friendship it was very convincing tj miller did a good job portraying this character now another person who had great on screen chemistry with ryan reynolds was morena baccarin morena baccarin played vanessa vanessa was a prostitute before she met wade but when they find each other in a mercenary bar they fall in love she is the one that gets kidnapped i liked her character now a man who is less liked by ajax or as likes to call him francis ajaxfrancis was played by ed skrein i am happy for him that he had this movie in development after the disaster of transporter refuled because he was very good in this movie the only really problem i have with this villain is that he didnt really have a motive to hate deadpoolwade i know wade was pretty annoying against him but isnt it a bit overreacting to kidnap his girlfriend you can also say that he is just crazy and i cant disagree with that point but overall ajax was well acted the next two person i am going to discus helped getting vanessa back these two are collosus and negasonic teenage warhead collosus was voiced by stefan kapicic he was good the russian accent made his character more funny in his own way negasonic teenage warhead was played by brianna hildebrand she was very good she was a typical teenager with some awesome superpowers the next two person was just funny to have in the story the first one was blind al the person who lives together with she was funny and well acted and now the last person i am going to discus was played by karan soni he was the taxi driver he was funny as well and acted good too i left out the actress of angel dust on purpose because i dont really have anything to say about herthe script this was a very good part of the movie it was very funny the jokes all worked even the hidden ones and with hidden ones i mean movie references and comic book the dialogue was very good as well they managed to slide from a very funny tone to a more serious tone very well i am glad that ryan reynolds got the chance to change stuff in the script i think that that made the script a lot more funny another thing that was pretty good which you can see as a part of the script was the opening credit scene this was very hilarious als the image you get at the end was funny a cool part of the script is the story telling we first see a in a cab willing to find ajax but than at the end of the fight scene we go to a origin story i think that this was very original and well handled the fourth wall breaking is a bit unusual at first but you will start to get used to it the jokes are as ive said very funny but i think that there might be a bit too much jokes in it there are also a lot of clichs in the movie but due to the good acting directing and funny jokes i could see past thatoverall is a funny movie it is also a great directorial debut i would definitely recommend watching the movie,comedy
if you found the trailer funny you will like this movie it is supposed to be a hip edgy notyourordinarysuperhero film in other words a guy who makes jokes like oh i left the coffee pot on in the middle of a fight scene ok maybe you find that funny ryan reynolds did not work for me i liked those jokes at 13 and would have thought him ohsocooli did like a lot of the movie it was one of the best comic book romances the support heroes were charming and funny the villains were interesting and fun to watch the action was top notch with extra realism the structure with how the story was told workedbut the jokes were not funny i have no problem with crude or adult jokes and did not find it too crude at all maybe i just dont like ryan reynolds on screen in interviews he seems like a decent guy the supporting friend guy from silicon valley hbo was also typical and unoriginal,comedy
the film was about wade wilson who is a mercenary who had a dishonorable discharge from the special forces who fell in love with a stripper which they had a relationship then he came down with cancer in his thyroid prostate and brain he went to his mercenary bar who he then had a shade agent named agent smith approach him for a shade clinic that could cure him and make him a super human he went the clinic but it turned out he was being recruited for a mutant genetic torture clinic to see if his powers would come out after months of intense torte he was put in a tube to be suffocated if he lived he would become a super human if not he would die he did become super human which his powers were agility super healing and among other disgusting things but it came at the price of horrible skin that makes him look like quote on quote a old avocado had sex with a older avocado he then went on a killing spree to find francis who was the scantiest who made him become who he was then he tried killing him but the x men got involved and stopped him so he then had to find him a second timethe film was directed by jj abrams the actor who played was ryan renrylonds who then he played the character well the actors who portrayed then were every realistic but in a way too realistic in there humor bemuse the humor was very raunchy and very sexualized so it was very funny but too real the story was very easy to follow surpassingly the scenes make sense in the flashback once again surprising yeswere backgrounds realistic yes and were the hair styles costumes cars and houses realistic surprising yes did the music define the mood yes very much epically in the sexualized scenes it is meant for high schoolers and college student demographic i would give it a 35 out 5 stars,comedy
previously ryan reynolds had portrayed green lantern which i remember enjoying but i later found out others had not knowing that i have to say that me and my movie theatreworking friend really enjoyed him here as a wisecracking costumed hero from marvel comics who swears kills and is mainly after the guy who did something bad to him he also has a finelooking girl played by morena baccarin who seems a perfect match for him this was quite a funny actionpacked movie we both enjoyed the beginning credits were really funny and if youre familiar with a certain john hughes movie you really shouldnt miss the after credits sceneso thats a high recommendation of deadpool,comedy
this flick had some pretty funny dialogue penis and poopoo humor action and heart a smart mouthed former military mercenary with an attractive girlfriend gets bad news and tries to change his fate a organization tracks this guy down offering him promises lots of violence and halfway through the movie god was cursed and the rating got dropped good story line and the effects were all right other than the swearing my only other disappointment was too much stinky and defecation jokes that started to wear a little thin after a while this is a movie that a modern day sodom and gomorrah would be proud of ive lost my respect for marvel and ive lost my respect for disney,comedy
 reviewi have to admit after watching this movie i believe i am becoming a little fatigued with these comicbook movies and or maybe i just wasnt excited enough to see this movie ive watched all of the advertisements and ive seen all of the trailers i wasnt anticipating this movie as much as hardcore fans the only reason i paid a ticket to see this comicbook movie is because almost everybody on the freaking internet has been ranting raving and losing their minds over this movie seriously almost everybody on the god forsaken internet has been telling me how good and funny this movie is here it goespositives1 i laughed two or three times2 the love story was engaging i admit i got a little tear eyed3 the action scenes were well choreographed4 the action scenes were slightly well directed5 ryan reynolds nails it as deadpool6 the final fight scene got my adrenaline pumping7 the guy who played colossus did a fantastic job keep him 8 gina carano is hot personal notenegatives1 i was bored a majority of the runtime up until the end i almost wanted to go to sleep2 action scenes could of been shot better give me more wide frame shots hold the camera still and stop the fast editingoveralli didnt really have a major problem with this movie the truth is i just dont care about i would watch this movie again if someone wanted to see it for the first time if was on tv id watch it however id never add this movie to my personal collection final grade  b,comedy
former special forces operative wade wilsonreynolds hilarious is lending his services to those who need it for small fries  but dont call him a hero when he learns he has cancer pretty much everywhere he goes along with an experiment that may bring out his mutant superpowers if he has any it leaves him able to heal any injury while also rather unattractive he fears his romantic partner vanessabaccarin sexy charming wont want him anymore and tries to find ajaxskrein easy to hatein the right way who was in charge and who claims he can reverse the effectsa straightforward revenge story complete with a love interest leaves this just mainstream enough to satisfy the studio heads and lets writers reese and wernick as they did with zombieland play around with every single other genre trope subverting our expectations and delivering an enjoyable ride to those just coming in as well as those all too familiar with the comic adaptation the cool swift action isnt big enough to compete with captain america the winter soldier its the first movie in the xmen franchise to refuse to add several detailed abilitiesleaving it rather bland with both sides just being incredibly strong and it is very much an origin flick while theres no teleportation we do get dual desert eagles and katanas and theres acrobatics all over the place and this does justice to the nonstop barrage of pop culture references and irreverence of the merc with the mouth the fourth wall breaks are kept sparse enough to have the most impactthere is a lot of strong language a moderate amount of brutal bloody disturbing violence and a little nudity in this i recommend this to anyone who has a dark twisted sense of humor 810,comedy
so is incredible this really is the comic book movie we have been waiting for this film is an incredible adaptation of the ever so popular dirty mouth antihero that is and it is not only an incredible adaptation it is an incredible film tim miller did a fantastic job on this film and you can really see how much fun they had making itryan reynolds was born to play this character his performance was incredible it was energetic charismatic and you could tell that he was having the time of his life playing this character and he really brought this character to life he played the emotional parts well and his delivery of the jokes was stellar every performance in this film was great there were no weak performances at all they all delivered their lines perfectly and there was no stale performances they all worked well as these characters the cgi was good for the most part there were times where you could really tell it was cgi for example the scene where ed skrein francis is on top of his base i guess its his base and it looked like a video game the action scenes for the most part were great they were fast paced and very violent people get ripped in half lose their heads and it was incredibly fun to watch however in a particular car chase scene the editing was very quick and the scene became very chaotic and it was quite hard to see what was actually happening but overall its fantasticthe cinematography was good nothing special the best shots were the close ups on face whenever he went to say a one liner and there were some very good slow motion scenes that were very well shot the camera was still and you could really take in the action there is practically no shaky cam therefore allowing us to actually see what the hell is happeningthis movie is hilarious it has a lot of raunchy humor that doesnt go over the top and probably 80 of the time is hilarious there are also a lot of funny references to other comic book characters and films that were really well done my personal favourite being when colossus is pulling him and says dead or alive youre coming with me the humor is both smart and incredibly raunchy my most clever and funny scene in the whole film would have to be when he is fighting in the car and then says have you seen this man whilst holding up a picture of himself as a taunt to the enemies it was so incredibly well done and ryan reynolds delivery of the line was perfectthe fourth wall breaks are also fantastic every time he talks to the camera it always has a purpose and isnt just some stupid gimmick in fact the best fourth wall break is actually the end credit sequencespeaking of credit sequences the opening credit sequence was fantastic instead of saying directed by tim miller it says directed by an overpaid bleep at least as far as i can remember it says that stupid imbb you cant swear this movie just takes the bleep out of everything and its great oh and also the stan lee cameo is great dont want to spoil it but it involves naked womenthe main story is told in a very cohesive and interesting way instead of doing what most comic book movies do where they tell it in a linear narrative where it shows the origin at the beginning and then reaches the point where he is a fully fledged hero this starts of straight into him being a badass cuts to the origin and then keeps cutting back and each time it cuts back to badass to wade wilson there is obviously talking to the audience and its great but the main story is actually rather interesting i love his origin story and the love story that the film is basically about is actually really good you care for the two of them it is sometimes cheesy but thats the point this is we are talking aboutso overall this movie is emotional heartfelt funny fun clever and overall a really entertaining movie,comedy
overrated total stupid crap ridiculously unfunny  is definitely the worst created super hero ever a joke a silly spoof of much better in fact brilliant characters such as deadshot played brilliantly  with heart by the legend will smith  deathstroke is boring annoying crap  one of the worst films ive ever seen my god  people hate on the brilliant suicide squad absolute idiots,comedy
husband put this on last night not my kind of film at all but i was glued after 5 minutes id heard it was great but was under the impression it was a 12a so when the violence and swearing started i was like wait this is an adult filmanyway i like adult films so no problemois actually an amazing character yes his humour is slightly teenage boy and i never laughed out loud but i was amused husband was in hystericsthe romantic element was quite sweet his lover is beautiful and charming and i really liked heri am a die hard horror fan with no knowledge of marvel super herocomic stuff so for me to have enjoyed this says a lotvery well written acted and thoroughly enjoyable fun,comedy
has been much talk of the 2016 calendar year since the film became a huge success at the box office and was critically acclaimed through several critics throughout in spite is a superpowered revengeseeker who like many superheroes is quick with the wisecracks however what makes this film stand out is its obvious hard rrating they let reynolds make a ton a unnecessary and profane jokes throughout though it works and many of the gags and one liners we hear are quite clever and makes for great entertainment ryan reynolds really makes quite a turn as one of his passion projects he had for years but is now finally coming to fruition besides the lead character the supporting characters bring energy to the film and are great in watchingthe fourth wall breaking is part of the films uniqueness which is something we have rarely seen in superhero films and in it really does add another great layer the film isnt too long which works out great because it doesnt feel like it drags at anyone point compared to the typical superhero film in todays age which are usually always over two hours long has been compared to kickass and in some ways to hancock 2008 film starring will smith however as an overall film is greater as a second time around watching 022517 this film gets better the jokes are are clever and the fourth wall breaking is what makes stand out looking forward to the sequel,comedy
okay i wasnt sure to expect from this movie after all it is a comic book movie excuse me graphic novel but i enjoy those if theyre wellmade i enjoyed this one it is funny and the acting is simply superbbut its also crude rude and largely insensitivein a good way this is not a movie for kids and shouldve been rated x x as in youre going to be trying to explain stuff for several months afterwards if you make the mistake of letting the children in on it ryan reynolds is a hoot and everyone else seems to be pretty much having a great time feeding off the energy he brings on everything else geez i cant really think of anything i didnt like about this movie except for the slightly guilty feeling i got after wallowing around in the offkilter humor and goresomehow manages to capture todays urbane cynical point of view and turn it into something positive that in an of itself is a neat trick just put the kids to bed first no matter how much they whine,comedy
we saw this at home on dvd from our public library i am not familiar with the source comic book the movie is rated r for a good reason the main character has a very filthy potty mouth but it fits his character plus a few shots of barechested womenthis is an origin story ryan reynolds is wade always a bit of a loose canon at his favorite bar is a list on a chalkboard a predicting who will be the next to get killed wade is with his girlfriend when he collapses at the clinic his doctor informs him he has cancer but in three places he doesnt need  his brain his lungs and his prostatehe meets a man who says he can fix him wade has no choice and submits he ends up being tortured in various ways it is an attempt to make the hidden beast in him come out when he finally escapes he is disfigured but has gained some pretty impressive strength and fighting skills plus his cancer is gone he cant go openly as wade anymore so takes the name deadpoolhis nemesis is ed skrein as ajax and his girlfriend is morena baccarin as vanessa can he defeat ajax and get his girl backthe action is impressive including the opening ultra slomo shot of and others in a rollover car accident on a bridge and where appropriate the deep bass worked over my subwoofer and rattled the wallsoverall a very entertaining movie for those who can get past the constant filthy language reynolds is very good in what amounts to a dark comedy,comedy
firstly i would like to state that it is completely hilarious reading reviews with one star because the movie had foul language and sex scenes or that someone had no idea that the movie was inappropriate for their 9 year old kid is rated r and with 3 minutes of research you could have determined if this movie was for you or not with that being said i will not delve into the plot but the acting and writing were fantastic ryan reynolds nailed this role if you are easily offended by violence language or nudity this is not the movie for you but if you have a sense of humor and want to be entertained for 2 straight hours you will love this movie,comedy
its rare when a comic book character especially a marvel oneis captured in such raw and punctuated beauty that it makes you pause at the perfect homage of modern actors and score old persona the glib tongue and cheek repartee of ryan reynolds and morena baccarin is priceless the story line is perfect and i really am glad they didnt kid it up and turn it into an impotent farce as in all super hero movies they open with french opening aka they throw you into the action yet the director does it in a very unique way the moving camera in a still frame shot of a yet to happen action scene is both hilarious and brilliant lots of little easter eggs as the scene unfoldsthis movie was the epitome of wit and slap stick i literally fell out of my chair lmfoing all over the place reynolds delivers his jokes so effortlessly and so fast you really dont catch them all until about the 3rd watch definitely adding this one to my favorite movie collection,comedy
greetings from lithuaniaif you are tired of all marvel capt america type of superhero flicks 2016 offers probably the best antidote imaginable the movie itself is one very fun ride which finally doesnt take itself to seriously and mocks everything and everyone  and does this truly funny its is rated r but it is not gore fest back in the 80s and 90s r rated movies were much much bloodieroverall is a one highly enjoyable ride at running time 1 h 40 min it runs smoothly and almost every scene has something more interesting to offer then your average one in a year marvel movie flick thank god this one wasnt made by them because we wouldnt have this bold and highly unpredictable in the way it flows picture and while the true marvel fans could be left disappointed that it doesnt play by their fan boys rules everyone else will be highly entertained,comedy
overall a very enjoyable movie breaks the fourth wall as expected and tells a lot of jokes however the film loses points for having a weak villain ajax is weak which is obvious for someone whose superpower is not feeling pain sounds more like a disease than a super power honestly and he dies from one shot to the head it does however have some great action scenes ryan reynolds did a good job as wade wilson but to be honest he plays himself in like every movie it is truly a rated r movie so having children watch it isnt advised as it has some hardcore banging and jokes not appropriate to little kids colossus was alright and the negasonic teenage warhead was alright as well talking to the audience was really fun to watch overall a good movie,comedy
wow i have never really been a fan of superhero movies but then again is even a hero i think this film is definitely one to go and see there is humour romance and some bad ass action scenes what else do you need is played by ryan reynolds who did a fantastic job at his role he was able to represent the hero we know from the comics just as witty just as different i think the humour in this film would defiantly budge up the age group tolets say50 a lot of the jokes personally reminded me of inappropriate dad humour i have already heard that there is likely to be a 2 as if its only been out 2 months the main aspect of the film that i found the most creative was their interpretation of a clique superhero movie by getting to narrate the clique scenes in a cocky attitude maybe the film way more entertaining i would give this film an 8 out of 10,comedy
this was super fun made of low budget and they said that in the movie too you have to have a little idea of other xmen movies prior to watching it the jokes were awesome the trademark marvel postcredit is even better if you want to have a good laugh then this movie is for you ryan has done well after the debacle of his previous superhero movie green lantern oh there is a joke on this too you can find if you listen every dialog carefully you might not have seen an antihero with such sense of humor ryan is the perfect cast for the role his comic timings are great you might get disappointed with the action scenes as those were not as par with other xmen movies but he is and he fights on his own unique way the content is for adults so watch it with friends and colleagues not with your family unless you have a cool family p,comedy
somewhat obviously is not a great movie in the sense of having a lasting impact on the art of cinema but it is a very well executed and entertaining film that combines action comedy and romance very successfully the strength of the film derives from its well aimed ambition it doesnt try to be anything it isnt but does well everything it attempts in no way does this film transcend its genre but it does quite adroitly play with with the genres limits and conventions on the whole the film is irreverent and crass but there are some surprisingly well done sincere moments that give the proceedings some emotional resonance while i liked the film very much im probably just the kind of person for whom the film was made for if unlike me one shies away from graphic violence juvenile banter and crude language it might be hard to enjoy the other things that this film has to offer,comedy
snarky sarcastic inappropriate mildly racist van wilder is back and hes able to regenerate body parts its unclear whether hes immortal  would he eventually die of old age in this super rough hardr capeandtights comic saga the implausible combination of pretty and muscular ryan reynolds kills 90 people by his count and yet somehow is the titular hero by comparison ajax the name mr clean was copyrighted the main baddie only tortures people who did after all come to him and puts damsels in distress the movie mixes ranch comedy with torture porn and reservoir dogs type violence into a volatile concoction that will have many of the millions who bought tickets leaving the theater early while clever at times  particularly any time tj miller is on the screen  the movie has only a nominal plot centered around mostly uninteresting and unlikely origin story couldnt the techniques be refined to produce mutants with superheroes on an industrial scale sure the process is painful but so is cosmetic surgery and people line up for that  ryan  presumably stepping in for a part written for jim carey  presents another major issue mostly around the fact that his handsomeness is so overwhelming that the latex mask he wears still leaves him more attractive than your high school prom date also note to the special effects team ever time reynolds turned his head right or left the mask bunched and gaped like a 60s creature feature in short a mess but an entertaining and sometimes witty one,comedy
before we dive into this review i am going to give you a little history of this movie to sum things up it was doomed from the start it was stuck in the back of foxs the company behind this movie shelf for more than ten years ryan reynolds the main star was trying to get this movie made for ages and it didnt get the green light until an anonymous person released the test footage online for those of you who dont know a test footage is a small scene in the movie that is designed to convince the heads of studios to give them money or permission to make a movie kind of like an audition for the play the footage was released on september 2014 and due to overwhelming fan response the movie was given the go ahead however the director had two options either make a it a blockbuster pg13 action with a large budget which would hypothetically draw in a larger but upset the fans or let it be a rrated movie which turned out to be a way better choicenow that we have gotten through the history of the movie being made i shall give my honest professional opinion it is amazing coming from the guy that has waited about two years for this movie i was more than excited i was thrilled writing this blog is very hard because i have to try to push my geek fandom away and treat this gem like another regular movie so here it goesactors this cast had a lot of really good rising stars ryan reynolds definitely stole the show with this but what can you expect for a guy whos been training for the role for more than 10 years the supporting cast was average the comic relief guy tj miller himself had a lot of good jokes and gave a pretty good performance morena baccarin plays the love interest and she does a good job with what she is given which isnt much the villain ajax whose is played by ed skrien gives a great performance but again the character itself is a stereotypical comic book movie villain the rest of the supporting cast is great because of their ability to create levity in any situations which is what drives the movieplot the movies main goal was to give the audience a different kind of superhero movie which it certainly did however there are still some things in the movie that are questionable when it comes to the plot the movie is not funny it is hilarious the plot follows the average superhero movie that isnt a sequel the origin story if you ask anyone if the scenes where in costumes is better than the scenes when is not in costume i can almost guarantee that they will say yes i know i will the plot is explained through in costume followed by flashbacks to the origin story the origin story at best is necessary but would still be a great movie if he didnt have one the plot is very shaky and all over the place but when it comes to this movie the greats jokes and action sequences blot out the plotoverall the movie sells itself and it is almost certain that there will be a sequel however the thing to watch out for is now that is successful a lot more comic book movies are going to try to copy its success mark my words the next few years will certainly see the change in comic book movies i personally welcome the change to the comic book franchise,comedy
ive always loved brash humorous violent and not giving a f ive been a fan of his since i was a little kid fansnof his have been waiting for this movie for a long time and now that its had its theatrical release and is finally available to own i think it was well worth the other wait ryan renolds is the best pick they could have chosen to play wade hes always had the perfect mix of humor and sarcasm which old pool has in abundance and thank god they stuck to the comicsversion of insteadof the horrible wolverine origins version this movie has everything in abundance humor violence etc just as anything relating to should before this movie even came out there was a lot of controversy surrounding its rating since it would be the first r movie marvel ever first out making it impossible for a very large young fan base to see quite frankly i dont see what the big deal is sure the f bomb in one variation or another is dropped constantly throughout the movie along with the usage of sh but thats not really anything these days as for the violence some of it is over the top as its supposed to be but its not really that bloody or gory and except for a few scenes there really isnt any sex or nudity although there is some talk of masturbation but again thats not really enough to warrant an r rating so except for the constant swearing i dont really see any need for an r rating but in my opinion to date this is the best movie marvel has ever done,comedy

but was awesome it was great to find an actioncomedy that assumes im an adultits dumb its profane its utterly silly and i loved every minute of it literally right from the opening credits is there a story in there yeah i guess but its really just secondary to constant smartalec riffing if anyone was considering writing a marvel spoof screenplay dont bother frequently bites the hand that feeds it and skewers the label as thoroughly as anyone could hopebreaks the 4th wall frequently and even parodies that device by breaking the 4th wall in a flashback while breaking the 4th wall thats like 16 wallsdo not take kids this movie revels in gratuitous violence graphic language and juvenile humour and makes no apologies for any of it this is an r rated movie and comes by it honestly if youre good with that though the odds are good youll laugh your butt off,comedy
ryan reynolds much hyped antihero finally bags his own feature film seven years after his firstappearance in xmen origins wolverine 2009 and it becomes the latest box office phenomenon both domestically and internationally what are the odds it is against firstly its rrate manifestly shows the guts to forfeit the increasingly important profitwise chinese market the same as last years mad max fury road 2015 and still profits secondly it has been dumped to a lousy february release signifies either that the production company doesnt have high hopes for it or much more commendably a leftfield strategy to ignite the heat from the rock bottom last but not least its modest budget estimated 58 millions is significantly lower than any major studio superhero commodities which promises a higher rate of return and indicates a new franchise is in the offingis director tim millers feature debut and it punchily and timely injects a paradigm shifting novelty into hollywoods mainstay genre where marvel and dc comics reside from the stopmotion and selfmocking opening credits backing with angel of the morning viewers are induced to get enchanted by this unorthodox and loquacious mutant his trademark breakingthe fourthwall at one time it multiples up to sixteenth interactions are tremendously entertaining not to mention the ceaseless gags its teasing victims vary from pop culture comic book characters showbiz celebrities to the protagonist reynolds himself salacious innuendos pulpy slaughters and gallows humour which all dampen the pretty dark and grisly happenings of how wade wilson a mercenary suffers from cancer eventually becomes a defaced superhuman with impeccable healing powerssurprisingly the plot itself is a conventional boymeetsgirl boyleavesgirl then boysavesgirl threeact and the british villain ajex skrien has no ambitious agenda to destroy the world or humanity he is simply sadistic and enjoys beating the pulp out of his opponent or being battered since he has lost all the feelings where recovery ability makes him a perfect rival noticeably due to its budget the movie doesnt involve too many exorbitant wtf visual spectacles and action pieces are quite numbered only mutant allies are the preachy colossus voiced by kapicic and a young sinead oconnor lookalike negasonic teenage warhead hilderbrand still he beats ajex who has just one sidekick angel dust carano the girl who can fight but cannot act yet the outcome is mostly rewarding especially when viewers appetite has been pampered with too many bombardmentsreynolds spares no effort in showing off his ripped bod and pulls off unusually audiencefriendly character it is a longwaited recognition and hopefully his career will steer to a new direction wades love interest vanessa baccani whose mutant background has been omitted here is the only one who plays with a straightface to at least verify the slightly uninspiring storyline whereas tj millers weasel triumphantly upstages others with his competence as a constant purveyor of comic reliefthe sequel has already been put on the agenda so as a trendsetter sets up a new doublewining both wordofmouth and box office performance template for studio franchises and a high bar for its followups lets wish it is not just a flash in the pan,comedy
as always its what you dont see in the trailer that kills a film in case its the sappy moments that drag it down you know the ones where the music gets all sad and youre supposed to feel that this is important and dramatic as if you had some pavlovian response much time is wasted on unnecessary long origin story instead of spending time with we are stuck with wade and you just wish it would return to the action againbut whats the weirdest part about this film is how basic the plot is what would typically be a half or even a third of a typical superhero plot is the entire story in this film and when you learn how small the budget was you kind of have to wonder did they simply not have enough money for a big scale action filmand of course your enjoyment of the film will depend on your tolerance for crude juvenile profanity that becomes old really fast the problem is that its so overused in this film that it looses its punch towards the endthats about whats bad about the film but it has plenty of good to make up for it the humour for one thing as this film seems more like a parody than a legitimate superhero film ryan reynolds plays it perfectly so much that you can forgive him for a certain other superhero film the first 20 minutes or so are made of pure awesome as its the type of action that should have been the entire film and theres an adventure time watch yes im including thisoverall i ended up liking because its good parts shine over the flaws but after a film like mad max fury road last year i cant say im not a little disappointed,comedy
this from someone who likes superhero stuff in general a peurile sense of humor peurile cartoons peurile themes unintelligent tripe,comedy
honesty dont indeed how this work became so famous i dont see anything good in it extermelly overrated,comedy
come on one star what you did you think going into this did you not even read a little about the film you were about to watch this film has like its eponymous lead defied all odds to get where it had to goa piece de le resistance of humour violence and good old fashioned storytellingbest valentines day movie ever,comedy
the movie is watchablebut it is not a super hero movieit will not bring us a feeling of super hero movie after watchedthis movie is not like a marvel nor dc filmit is a normal film only positive  fight scenes main negative  more unwanted scenes in flashbackfightingwith 3 members overall one time watchabledont expect it as a marvel film mark610  ,comedy
fast funny and furious summarizes well the three elements that combined in the right dose make this movie such a success fast  action packed at the right pace fun humour all over witty humour gross humour cheeky humour white humour sexy humour intellectual humour smartass humour you name it it is in there furious  violent to the extreme no concessions to the sensitive stomach but funny violent if that can be said the movie also has a great script great characters awesome dialogues spectacular action scenes amazing staging and production great tempo crazy fun credits a good ending awesome music just when it is needed and the right length the result is one of those superhero movies that will delight both superhero movie fans and people who like me arent usually into the genre or into superviolent moviesreynolds really shines in his role of because in a way his personal humour is that of and the character fits him like a glove i honestly think that all actors are perfect in their respective roles really well castit is really refreshing finding a superhero movie that doesnt feel cookiecuttered that addresses adults with respect a movie that feels fresh and modern that is not only entertaining but well filmed well acted and wellrounded overall  a superhero movie that is actually very goodim looking forward to seeing the second installment if its as good as this i am buying a ticket to see it in a theater not on dvd,comedy
finally an adult superhero movie totally worthy of its hard r rating ryan reynolds is pitch perfect as the titular antihero with nonstop wise cracks and a potty mouth he more than carries the film which is very very funny tim millers direction and the action sequences are equally hyper violent and thrilling as well as the supporting cast which is solid too but again this is reynolds movie all the way and he more than makes up for the train wreck that was green lantern back in 2011 so yeah is pretty great its not perfect but this unconventional superhero love story works on almost every level and if youre in the mood for a good time id suggest giving a try,comedy
i really want to watch this movie since it came out but i didt have the chance to watch it from the teasers trailers ive seen im really hyped o watch this movie but thankfully i already watch the moviethe movie is a slow phase movie it took an hour before i got in to the movie but after francis and first fight scene itstarted to get on me speaking of the fight scene i really love francis and first fight scene its well choreograph the shots is amazing and the seti feel like the teasers and trailers ruined the movie what you see on this teasers and movie is what you will get on the movie what you see is what you getthe thing that i love on this movie is that its very different from every super heroes movie from breaking the fourth wall from the goofiness i really love the character probably the track choice is the best thing on this movie the track choice is good it definitely fits the character also from the time adventure watch hello kitty stuffs it deafeningly fits the characteri think is a amazing movie especially from a superhero movie its very different but like what ive said the teaser and trailer ruined the movie and i took a long time to get me in the movie but still its a must watch movie i will give 810,comedy
former special forces operative wade wilson ryan reynolds takes part in a rogue experiment which on the flip side gives him the ability to heal rapidly but on the downside this experiment leaves with permanent and unsightly scarring to his entire body when wilson is left for dead by ajax ed skrein after the experiment has been completed wilson makes it his mission to gain revenge on ajax and becomes  wilsons masked alteregowithin the first few minutes of this film i had an inkling that i was going to like it the opening credits are amusing and quite imaginative i particularly loved the directed by an overpaid tool captionthe opening segment of the film where were introduced to  the fasttalking crazed antihero are probably some of the best moments in the film and reynolds is clearly at his best in this film when he becomes i have to be honest and admit that i did find it a bit jarring when the film cuts to the origin story which ultimately took on a much more serious tone this isnt a bad thing as the origin story was interesting enough but i still found it a bit of a shock to my system at first due to how impressive and explosive the opening few minutes of the film werethe story itself is rather weak and in some ways it seems ironic that the film spends so much time sending itself up and making fun of itself only to then have a rather clichd and predictable plot line and outcome the turn of events in the final third arent bad and there are still plenty of amusing moments but given the fact that it seemed to have some imagination to it i just expected a bit more thats allanother slight problem with this film lies with wade wilson although he is an antihero when he becomes he is also an antihero when he is wade wilson himself the problem is that before he becomes he isnt a particularly likable person and i did feel that sometimes he got what he deserved this in some ways made him a rather unlikeable character preaccident meaning that it was harder to get behind him when he became his alterego i personally feel that a good antihero should have some likability or a reason to root for them in order to be successful and i never really felt that way about or wade wilson but like i said the sense of fun that the film brings means that these things dont cause that much of a problem that being said though when reynolds is this film never lets up and is an absolute blast to watch the sending up and parodying that it offers is imaginative and very funny the fourth wall stuff is pretty amusing  although it does get a bit repetitive if you liked kickass then i think that this film will be right up your street therefore despite a thin story and a rather flawed protagonist this film is funny imaginative and selfaware enough to more than compensate for its very minor shortcomings and is something that i would highly recommend,comedy
i just watched the most talked about movie of 2016 deadpoolwell honestly i m not that much impressed the movie was good in sense of humour but not enough to rate it that highryan acting was generous he put much effort to make big revenue out of it its like i have watched kickass movie my review is based on comparing this with other comic movies like xmen series or wolverine it should be more realistic to make sense the wade character was very different then wolverine wade characteri like the starting and ending of the movie thoughi m really disappointed may be because of my expectations were too highbut i guess who am i to complain looking forward for x men series or polverine ,comedy
i saw the movie like 1 month after the releasethis means a couple of my friends hyped me up for this also very awaited movie when the movie started i was ready for some good dirty jokes and a funny story but i can already tell you the storyline is pretty bad and cheap like the jokes i dont say this because its not my kind of humor because it is but because the jokes were easyi went to see it with my girlfriend persuading her she will like it i disappointed her and the movie disappointed me instead of watching the revenent i made the bad choice of not wanting to wait until i can see later i regret it a biti am not saying it was a total failure but i think they could have made it a lot funnier with a real story  not the story about his girlfriend the story of him seeking revenge is like watching an old superhero storyline with simple good moments than bad moments and finely good moments againi can understand some people think this movie was a success maybe i had just too high expectations,comedy
story  310  things just happened but dont know howwhycomic value  other than other comic chars in this movie are not so convincing  looks like they just wanted to introduce new guysperformance  810  they acted their best action  310  scenes only made to get a good trailerscreenplay  310  what were they thinking  it was just a flop show dialogues  310  someone just created a hype so big i just fell into the trailer trapdirection 610 it was a nice one but no good screenplaygraphics  810 they are good,comedy
thjis frick this movie is the bees knees i enjoy the comedic humor and slicing off of arms oh theres a bit of violence but nothing children cant handle i watched this valentines day and i believe that it is a perfect date night chickflick is the perfect baby daddy and my pug would agree she loved ryan reynolds and the guy who swallowed the cigarette lighter however we do not condone smoking its bad childrenpugs over drugs from the studio that inexplicably sewed his fing mouth shut the first time comes fivetime academy award viewer ryan reynolds in an eharmony date with destiny ladies and gentlemen i give you me deadpool,comedy
is a movie that i was extremely anticipating because i loved the character id played the 2013 game which i enjoyed very much and i quite enjoy the comic of as well i was skeptical about this movie because of the earlier fox box office bomb fantastic four which was a huge disappointment and with a first time director you can never know but when i walked out of the theater for the first time i knew that i had seen my second favorite comic book movie ever tim miller and ryan reynolds captured everything good about and added more ryan reynolds give his best performance in his career because he was so passionate about playing this character that he channeled everything he had there was not a single thing i disliked about this movie colossus and negasonic teenage warhead were both fantastic in the movie and actually very funny tj miller proves that he is a master of comedy with the funniest role ive personally seen from him also being the case for ryan reynolds ajax i thought was a compelling villain for a first time movie and i thought was played well by ed skrein gina carano i thought was good in this movie and was a good actor for the character shes playing for the comics angel dust morena baccarin was also good in this movie portraying wade wilsongirlfriendwifeoverall this movie was fantastic the movie that fantastic four should have been but ironically was not overall this movie was more than anything else,comedy
this movie was one of the few movies i can say a child should not see at all ryan said he wanted to do this movie making it rated r was a big thing i give him that muchthe only thing i hope for in the next film is to calm down on the cursing i get it its hes meant to but at the same time he curses too much i think almost every other sentence has the f word in it aside from that this movie was excellent if youre not a fan of or marvel sex violence misogynistic themes dont watch this do us all a favor and keep your terrible comments to yourself no one wants to read them i saw a handful of people calling the movie bad and giving it 1 star youre nothing more than a words im not allowed to say and need to grow up oh no this movie offended me stop being a victim to everything and grow up go ahead and tell tumblranyways dont take my word for it go see the movie yourself or wait till it hits red box and snag it,comedy
 but this one is different its certainly not for the kiddies with its sex and violence but here are not a bunch of all for one people with super powers trying to save the world you have one guy for whom things have gone terribly wrong  metastatic cancer in multiple organs hes promised a cure but is doublecrossed by the guy who promises to save his life and instead receives super healing powers the bad side  his face and body are disfigured by scars by the treatment the worse side  he is to be made a slave and enrich his healer so after breaking free is off to find the guy who did this to him and get him to undo it  he claimed he could in the meantime hes not averse to killing everybody who worked for the guy if they cant answer the question of where he iswhats so marvelous about this film is that is so human whats fantastic about it is that he is a smart mouth extraordinaire its like house md meets iron man he doesnt want to save the world he wants to pound his tormentors into the pavement and the film is constantly making fun of itself when meets the xmen he mentions how they could have afforded more and better xmen with a bigger budget  a little swipe at fox studios which had no faith in this project that will probably net them a billion world wideand finally who would figure that a girl who takes her clothes off for a living would be tess trueheart highly recommended but only if you have a tolerance for all of the stuff that comes with an r rating,comedy
although we might all agree that the comic book superhero genre has been handled well by marvel studios in most of their movies and occasionally by dcwarner fox and sony i think we didnt have many nearly perfect adaptations yet that capture the source materials feel perfectly and completely nail the characters in such a short list  probably lead by nolans batman trilogy  came in to claim a special place specially after such an unspeakable crime against the character in xmen origins wolverine this movie not only mends that destruction but also gives us a that really feels like he just came out directly from one of his comics this movie feels like a comic and thats the best compliment we can offer a comic book movie being one of my two favorite comic book characters ever i admit i was immensely hyped im waiting for this movie since before it was even a real possibility i certainly have a few minor issues with the movie but overall its everything a movie should be ryan reynolds was great and probably had his best performance ever and the script was brilliantly tailored as if made by wade wilson himself in all honesty id rate this movie as a high and steady 8 i admit that the little edge that pushes it to my 9 is happiness in finally seeing my beloved character so brilliantly portrayed,comedy
its everything i had hoped it would be i am so happy that this movie exists this is one of the best examples where the voice of the people lets something amazing like this to happen so proud of everyone involved seriously this is one of the best superhero movies ever ryan reynolds is absolutely the perfect choice for a live action in fact he plays the part so well when he puts on the mask i genuinely had a hard time not thinking of him as wade wilson one of the rare moments where a comic book character is done right if youre a fan or like superhero movies this is definitely something youd wanna see,comedy
this is viscerally great bloody comedy rated r has refreshed the genre of superheroes surpassing to its most strong competitor marvels guardians of the galaxy initial credits say the absolute truth star ryan reynolds is listed as gods perfect idiot firsttime feature director tim miller is described as an overpaid tool the writers are referred to as the real heroes here evidently adventure is full of blood and jokes and obscene topics not wasting any second to perform one of those jokes wade generates an experience more intimate with the audience breaking the fourth wall hundreds of times it was great certainly this film carries the label of the first film r marvel with honor sweat love passion and many swear words rhett and paul wernick rheese real heroes are the guilty of creating a script full of humorous moments that generate irresistible laughter led for the fabulous sarcasm by ryan reynolds if you liked the formula implemented in g g you give a pleasant surprise to improve the formula imminently with sarcasm indirect and direct messages for himself other superheroes and even to the own production company project hosts two mainly innovative elements chosen by its writers in delicate and precise way the first was how the same anti  hero put his origins and the second was the constant breakdown of films four walls but these were only the bases to solidify the film based on the 1991 comic by rob liefeld and fabian nicieza tells the story of wade wilson a bad man who receives a bad health diagnostics this leads him to take apparently wrong decisions making him literally a monster but giving him a superhuman abilities and unimaginable ability to cure  all dinosaurs feared the t  rex  wade wilson the film uses various and consistent moments not fundamental to the advancement of the plot but necessary to maintain the close relationship wade  audience which include two participants of the xmen or to an elderly blind who want to assemble her shelf several years ago the comic writers looked the small and complicated in the xmen origins 2009 shameful ryan reynolds participation they told him immediately that if at some point in their lives they would have the opportunity to make an own anti  hero film the main role was immediately for the boy good choice writers his enthusiasm sarcastic is what makes he exudes all the features of the character even achieving to see his pansexuality and light homoerotic this guy is eloquent funny professional hes be perfect to play the antihero more unconventional of the universe director tim miller and the rest of the team are the magnificent companions to decorate the work of the main actor i admire the work done by miller to lead such a project of enormous magnitude it is one of the directors of the moment and it will continue to be for a while more there is something that does not make very happy to the public the film is all innovation and new things but plot central romantic tends to break for timeperiods development fluid film can choose a subject a little less clich love story for valentines day strategy more profits it is an action choreography  interspersed with a fresh narrative and adding the best reviews of the mercenary its a marvels masterpiece at one point the film can become an action film in a horror movie in a film drama in a romantic film in a thriller film is truly multifaceted having the majestic power of overcoming its premise in the cinema is essential sadly we can not say that will be marvel film last for older but if you can say that merc with a mouth has done excellent and textual words of super is will turn into a fung franchise a film that parade perfectly between the thin and dangerous line of comedy  superheroes and fantastic bad language  defends and gives a fresh air to the superhero genre so congested,comedy
is one of the most funny irreverent and entertaining movies ive seen in a long time its easy to compare with antman because of the humor but is much more adult much more biting more dirty more sexual and features poop and fart jokes in other words right up my alley is the fartier mans dennis milleri dont even like ryan reynolds wait now i do and weasel tj miller gets to banter with in a way that reminds me of the brutal barbs my highschool friends would throw at each other over lunch the weakest points dont even really ruin the movie for example the transporter refueled dude plays a silly villain whos little more than a sadist without any interesting qualities and the completely unnecessary appearances of colossus and ahem negasonic teenage warhead do nothing but set tables for movies that will perpetually issue until the end of the world as we know itmuch has been made of how violent is but its really nothing compared to the gore of a tarantino flick and the breaking and breaking and breaking of the fourth and sixteenth walls is nowhere near as annoying as you would expect it to be this violence and fourth wall breaking is supposedly sic all true to the fanboys of the comics so fine and even hints at his growing mental illness something hopefully expanded upon in the future it would also be nice to see tony starks alcoholism become part of the moviesand you know what else clocks in at 108 minutes not the overlong 2plus hours you get so often these days and no false endings or dillydallying around the movie is tight and there is never any time to stop to wipe the blood off your face,comedy
i think we all knew was gonna be good i didnt know what they were gonna change and i think im still a bit disappointed when they modify things unnecessarily like weasel turning into a bartender or being a mutant but overall the humor is definitely there the directing is great for such a low budget and the story is overall quite good only lacking a better villain maybe but since isnt really a hero he doesnt need that strong a villainfor comicbook fans they may regret that there is no dr killebrew no mention of weapon x that in the end get vanessa and that shes not a mutant etc but as for being faithful to the comics they will see blind al a funny relationship with the cab driver classic wade making fun of the xmen breaking the 4th wall etc although the numerous trailers spoiled a number of jokes theres still a good barrelful of them left so you can laugh the whole movie origins are also well showngiven the low budget for that type of movie the action scenes are quite amazing too it is fast paced so maybe thats why you cant tell but it doesnt have to blush compared to the xmen movies the easter eggs like the green lantern photo are great too and if you were wondering why negasonic is there like me well its purely for comical effect so is colossus and his funny russian accenttheres obviously gonna be a sequel and in the credits its mentioned its gonna be with cable i dont think they can do the big story arc there is in the  cable comics theyre gonna need the avengers movie budget but im curious to see what its gonna turn like keepem coming,comedy
a colleague at work told me that this was going to be a flick i would like i do like comedy but mostly us humour isnt my thing but i must say this surely hits itwhat i did knew was that it was all about a superhero but theres more than that my summary says it all the character is annoying as hell and thats the reason why you start loving him the effects used are stunning some situations are as funny as hell his small hand and his and i surely did laugh with the sex scenes that occur with some holidays the halloween part and the teeth while giving his girl oral sex well you must just see it and here we have it ryan reynolds as does give the best he can and its an excellent performance and did we ever see morena baccarin more sexy than here as a stripperbut not only the acting is above mediocre as are the effects also references toward other actors and flicks are funny and the score used well for the people grown up in the eighties it will be a ride down memory lane if you go watch it be sure to stay until the end credits are over because you will laugh it out again and he surely tells you the truth about cinemas after guardians of the galaxy 2014 and antman 2015 another excellent superhero flick but this one here with an excellent twist yeah i likegore 05 nudity 15 effects 55 story 45 comedy 25,comedy
i like to keep it short this ones for the people who dont have time to read huge reviews this film is your classical action movie with a comedy twist well more like comedy suit because your pauses between laughing are no longer than 10 seconds not a single boring scene is present in the movie the plot is really good the characters in the film are legendary and comedy is priceless if you are fan of memes and sites related to them like 9gag this film is like made for you breaking of the 4th wall never fails to amaze me in here especially that subtle announcement of the upcoming sequels in the middle of the film actors did an amazing job ryan is brilliant soundtrack is pretty good lovely usage of mr sandman  x gon give it to ya and careless whisperer lowkey one of the best comedies ive ever seen,comedy
i have to admit i never heard of this comic character so i went to see this movie with excitement and curiosity and was treated to the best comic movie since the original iron man unlike the iron man sequels and the other thor captain america and disappointing avengers flicks this movie sparkles and is not so cookie cutter ryan reynolds is terrific in the lead with many witty comments including a few at his expense making the is movie fun and original plus the r rating allowed this movie to move into more adult direction than the other marvel properties i found the story fun while the action was well done and it seemed everyone making this movie enjoyed themselves and did not phone in any performances and i hope to see more r rated comic book adaptions while seeing less of the cookie cutter and after seeing this i look forward to the sequel because i totally enjoyed it,comedy
like many others i have been eagerly waiting for the movie to arrive i watched every trailer signed up with the corps and happily gobbled up every bit of promotion they threw out and did the movie live up to all the hype in the end in my personal opinion hell yes it didstraight out of the gates the movie propels you into the world of the merc with the mouth the opening credits alone are as unique and hilarious as they come having me as well as the entire theater in stitches im sure we all knew exactly what we were getting into however i dont think we imagined it would start after only ten seconds i personally am a fan of how the movie was pieced together starting in the present and then having tell the events leading up to his current predicament in my opinion it didnt take away from the story at all quite the opposite in fact it really helped the story move along and it also kept me interested with what was happening the love story that lay behind all the blood violence foul language and crude humor was amazing there is one line from the movie in particular one of my favorites which provide a good example while vanessa is thinking of plan a b all the way to z im trying to memorize the curves of her face or something like that i loved every character even aja i mean francis and i thought every one of them was well acted however out of all of them colossus has to be my favorite besides seor pool of course here is this giant metal russian man who also happens to be extremely polite tries all he can to be helpful and is just all around likable hes like guardian angel or at least he tries to be the humor in this movie is very smart nothing is off limits when it comes to who he pokes fun at the studio other characters in the shared universe even directly at reynolds himself this humor truly captures exactly who and what is sadly the jokes that played during the trailers did not have the same effect in the movie itself its probably a case of being burnt out because who didnt watch the trailers repeatedly even something as simple as changing a line of dialogue in a scene would have done wonderswith that one gripe aside the movie is great its exactly what i wanted and what i expected also this movie is rated r for a reason to the people who think that its a soft r you really need to have your mental health checked,comedy
i will admit that i was skeptical at first about going to see but man am i glad i did this was by far the best movie i have seen in a very long time and i watch a lot of moviesunlike most movies out there perfectly combined action and comedy and i will say both are out of this world great fight scenes and choreography not too gimmicky and definitely not too serious and yes theres blood but its not overdone like most movies these days and as for the comedy its actually funny no hilarious regardless of your sense of humorkeeps your attention throughout the entire film and will have you begging for more you are surely in for an exciting and wickedly awesome ride truly a must see ryan reynolds is no other actor could have done it better but definitely leave your kids at home and be sure to stay after the credits the post credits scene isnt too important but still,comedy
im glad this movie was made and who can we thank for this ryan reynolds the handsome awesomedude reynolds kept pushing for this film for like a decade before it was finally greenlit the studio did not believe in this but reynolds never gave upwhat we have here ladies and gentleman is one of the funniest films in a long time it is so over the top hilarious at times and so imaginative you actually sit there watching the film and think to yourself that there actually might be hope for hollywood yeti got to applaud marvel though you can say a lot about the movie industry the last 10 years which seems to be filled with super heroes but marvel really know what they are doing making one great film after another further building on their franchise and heroes it is something dc isnt even close at replicatingbut this is also where comes in at the perfect time it is a satire which makes fun of all the superhero movies but at the same time it is in the same universe that is truly amazing it takes balls to do this the intro sequence alone gives you a heads up how much guts it took to make this filmthe film isnt perfect few are but it keeps on making you laugh and have a good time all the way through and it is amazingly creative this is a well written film and the direction is rock solid mind boggling to think this is millers first film absolutely amazingand of course it has a lot of grown up language going therefor the r rating which just adds to the total experience by a huge amountand as a bonus you get an absolute gorgeous morena baccarin i have been a fan of her all since firefly and she has had her ups and downs since then but mostly ups and here in this film she shines and are delivering a performance that fits her role so well i cant think of anyone who could have done it better ryan reynolds on the other hand is only in this film because he is handsome this we all know thanks for making this film guys thanks for taking risks thanks for daring to stand up for something and see it through even if big studio executives are working against you this was a very fun movie to watch and i want you to make more810,comedy
i cant without a doubt say that this might be the funniest movie ive watched the comedy is amazing and not for the fans but for everyone not even knowing who is and for those who knows i dont think the comedy could be more fitting and awesome as everyone keeps saying ryan reynolds was perfect for this role and after wolverines movies disaster of a this was just amazing ive known from before and i know what type of comedy and personality he and his stories have has a very unique personality not like wolverines anger or xaviers deep voice with cool headedness his style is very unique and very challenging to live up to what with the creative jokes and comedy but i cant believe how this movie might even brought that up even one more lever its not that huge blowing multitrillion dollar airships and cities kind off superhero movie but more a movie that is more down to earth with a huge twist in it called who keeps making fun of his and others franchise all the time by doing what he does most braking the fourth wall i would deeply recommend anyone to watch this movie and especially for those who know who is,comedy
i went into this movie so pumped and ready to see kick ass once you see the opening credits you know what youre about to get into it speaks for itself note this isnt your average superhero movie if youre 13 and havent seen any rated r comedies you probably cant see this one pros action was great actors were great humor was really good and the 4th wall breaking was pretty funny and really fit for a movie like thiscons i thought the villain was a tad forgettable didnt really stand out that much and i never wanted the movie to endoverall deserves the 1010 rating i just think a 9 is a little too low,comedy
aka the merc with a mouth made an appearance in wolverine origins played by ryan reynolds the bits with reynolds had him without a mask but still the sassy attitude he later appeared near the end a bastardization of the character this time played by scott adkins this guy was known as weapon xi the next evolution of wolverine im still not sure because that film was a mess of epic proportions the use of in this film is a travesty and fans were obviously upset reynolds who has been a champion of the character for years now has tried and tried again to get a feature film going he has finally succeeded and now we have a proper version of the character one that fans seem to love and reynolds is actually happy with is not your ordinary comic book character for starters he knows hes a comic book character the film version knows hes in a film he knows about the previous version of and even the previous comic book character reynolds played the green lantern i feel that some people may have had enough with the super hero genre but much like guardians of the galaxy is just unique enough to breathe some fresh air into an already bloated genre wade wilson reynolds is a mercenary for hire while at his best friends bar he runs into a beautiful woman vanessa played by morena baccarin they instantly hit it off and fall in love he pops the question expecting a long loving life with the girl of his dreams things dont seem to work out for him though as he is unexpectedly hit with cancer hitting the liver lungs prostate and brain not wanting to drag her through the heartbreak of watching him die he vanishes while gone he is presented with a new experimental program that could cure his cancer and make him super experiments never go accordingly to plan and is now born a mutant with healing properties enhanced strength and scarred skin making him one of the ugliest men alive now hes out for revenge to get the man who did this to him and hopefully make him right again had an uphill battle a hard r rating an unknown character outside of fanboys and ryan reynolds a guy who desperately needs a hit the film only got the greenlight due to an extremely positive reaction to leaked test footage which has made it into the actual film and it seems even more people want to see the film because it is doing extremely well does this mean well eventually see an influx of r rated super hero films maybe but i doubt any of them will have the pure fun and energetic charm that reynolds brings to this picture reynolds is a perfect he brings the character to life with the spot on comedic timing and self awareness he brings his usual improv swagger to the role if youre familiar with his comedic roles prior it is on all cylinders here with the r rating hes able to let the risky profanity filled one liners fly some might feel its a bit too much at times others will say it fits the tone of the film perfectly that r rating is well deserved as well the film is full of profanity nudity and extreme violence people are decapitated skewered burned crushed blownup and pretty much anything else you can imagine this film is not kid friendly despite the fact that there were a few children under the age of 14 in my showing despite the violence in the film it is indeed very cartoonlike cuts his own arm off cgi blood sprays on the face of another character then he eventually grows a new arm most of the film sees bad guys simply be shot with precision from the man in red with a somewhat modest budget for a superhero film of only 58 million the film waits to use the majority of that budget for the last act the film jumps back and forth between the present and the past as for as origin stories go its pretty run of the mill experiment gone wrong and hero seeks revenge seems almost like wolverine and a lot of others the familiarity of the film didnt bother me because it had a lot of fun with it a lot of films feel held back by their origins story isnt one of them despite some of the juvenile humour is a lot of fun a lot of bloody violent profanity filled fun,comedy
i dont celebrate valentines day but it was heartwarming with getting to see ryan reynolds performance of is moving charming and swinging with sexy arrogance since alex delarge malcolm mcdowell thank you marvel thank you thank you thank you it even has the feel of watching creepshow in a sense but thats ec were talking therehere its marvel definitely inspired me being an artist and is now an addition to my collectionps  the rrating really gave this movie more flexibility in their expressive nature more free than what youd find in most movies that dont even dare show passion,comedy
deeadpool is hands down the best marvel comic film to date this time they got it right everything youve ever wanted in a comic to live action film is in so many hilarious scenes throughout the film with one in particular in which jokes about the marvel studio couldnt afford more than two xmen which include colossus and negasonic teenage warhead theres an abundant amount of violent scenes with many that were hilarious bullet in the aliterally ryan reynolds was awesome as he can now be forgiven for green lantern theres no doubt in my mind there will be a sequel but how they will top this instant classic is beyond me i just hope they dont rush to do so feels like a breath of fresh air in the genre lets hope other studios take heed and began to create future films that supplement us diehard fans which has done with ease im may be stretching it a bit by saying this butwas absolute perfection a marvel achievement,comedy
its been sometime where there was a movie u go watch and enjoy and not to think about too much this is one such movie where the mood that is required for the movie relax and enjoy buddy mood is set by the end of title cards directed by an overpaid tool d as much as hilarious with the black comedies for a parody it also contains elements for making a story line unlike many other movies failed to do most of the voice overs interacting with the audience did work but few of them where very anticipatablebut who cares p   but overall whether or not you are a comic lover this is a movie that you can laugh out enjoy and relax watching this movie not the one you would want to miss ,comedy
theres a lot of rough wisecracking in this fast moving film i saw this movie with my wife who liked it to my surprise though not as much as the young crowd we saw it with they apparently knew a lot more about the story than we didim not familiar with the comic but i recognize the style and its pretty raucous and bawdy the kind of thing i would have especially liked when i was younger ryan reynolds is a great choice for the lead as he handles the fast talk as if he might have come up with the dialog himself more of a surprise is morena baccarin who plays love interest vanessa ive seen her elsewhere but didnt recognize she could be so lively a sex partner and love object i thought she was miscast but i was wrongspeaking of casting like all good heroic tales there has to be a good villain and ed skrein someone i dont recognize fits the bill nicely as ajax a mad scientist of sortsbut for me the best part of all were the action scenes where moves are a thing of beauty assuming a real person executed them that guy deserves to be recognized and honoredall in all a fun entertaining time at the movies,comedy
finally we have a decent xmen origin story with plenty of heart spirit chemistry and good connections with the original source the baffling thing is that we receive this gift in the form of the most incoherent and random marvel character in the entire universe the character that least requires an explanation gets the most structured and most engaging fox marvel film since xmen 2 but of course the behindthescenes licensing drama and the infuriatingly small budget compared to what the storyline demands entangle the film quite a bitryan reynolds might be the only man in the history of film to totally mess up a cinematic character and then get a second chance at getting it right by starting entirely from scratch with the rated r guaranteed and a looser approach to reynolds knocks it out of the park with a much more accurate performance and one with plenty of depth and sympathetic pull his chemistry with the rest of the cast reminds you why hes much better unhinged and uncut waiting adventurelandreynolds has actually been the main catalyst at making sure that he helped right the wrongs caused by xmen origins he helped fight to keep the r rating helped increase the already small budget to make this a reality and has helped craft the flood of social media hype the hard r rating was the biggest requirement in making this film work the story and mannerisms of are not for the faint of heart is far more in the realm of spawn as opposed to fantastic four in terms of adult contentthe script is formulaic in nature but fresh with crisp dialogue great oneliners constant shifts in timeline and plenty of fun sidekicks to be entertained by sadly because of obvious budget constraints we are treated to only two major action sequences the first one overshadows the finale by a long shot not a single major xmen cameo throwaway villains and most of the time being spent on the creating of as opposed to the anarchy that follows 10 years of production hell and dozens of rewrites could doom most screenplays but rhett reese and paul wernick do a great job saving whatever was leftthe biggest achievement of is how closely it resembles the source material and personality despite getting less money if you enjoy in the comics youll enjoy him here as welleven if the eccentricity is toned down just slightly enough to keep the plot structured the action is intense the injuries are gruesome the humor is dark and crude and the movie never really takes itself seriously fourth walls go down it reveals its own production setbacks within the film and it has this kinetic comic book flavored energy that hardly ever slowsit might be a case of less money  more freedom but the lack of funding really tarnishes the movie part of the glee of in the marvel universe is his wild interactions with other characters especially the xmen but to put in the same supposed marvel universe as the xmen and then refuse to have any of the popular characters join in on the fun is baffling and infuriating even worse is that we have longunused xmen like gambit especially and cable available in a tragic case of the production team having more faith than the studio itself the limitations arent obvious but become apparent once the final act rolls in and you are left desiring more chaosas a risqu adult version of the little engine that could this was a comic book film that was supposedly doomed expected to fail and was released with minimal hopeonly to be saved because of the strength of the marvel brand the incredible onlinereynolds marketing campaign and a legitimate effort to stay true to the source great cast great energy and great humor is restricted because of fox and the ridiculous guidelines everyone has been forced to follow since disney purchased the property can become a successful franchise as long as they are willing to tie him closer to the rest of the xmen and marvel moviesand as long as we keep the same dedicated staff dont expect pure unadulterated crazy here but do expect a great blend of crazy heart and entertainmentwrapped together in a limited budgetmost importantly this is much much better than xmen origins wolverine,comedy
let me explain i like comics i like some of the latest superhero movies that have been coming outbut i am sick of all the superhero movies coming out i mean its nonstop really the same stuff over and over sometimes numerous movies about the same superheros oh yeah and constantly recasting the same superheros with new actors and rebooting themsothis movie rocked the superhero movie world ryan reynolds doing what he does best being a hilarious bad ass while kicking ass and taking names a long overdue movie finally released for all fans and nonfans alike to enjoy by experiencing the epicness yep which is comedy and action as well as suspense all at the same time throw in a bit of romance and lots of nonprude yep situations as well as innuendosblunt remarks and you have the awesomeness that is the movie deadpoolas i stated people have been waiting for this movie a long time and its finally here its amazing and it delivered a well done to ryan reynolds and everyone else involved,comedy
ill get this out of the way i know very little about the character and what i do know doesnt really interest me all that much i admire that he is different from the majority of comic book characters but i personally dont enjoy him or his stories that being said im in the middle of the pack on this one i certainly didnt love it as much as most people but i didnt hate it if you go into as a fan you will come out a bigger fan its that simplemy biggest gripe is with the generic action story its your typical revenge movie from a story standpoint slices through henchmen climbing his way up the latter to the head honcho who kidnapped his girlfriend weve seen this before and it seemed comicbook movie fatigue was setting in as he was dismembering henchmen left and right yes the killings were more graphic than normal and basically narrated while fighting but that didnt really hit home with me maybe had the movie had more interesting villains and raised stakes the movie could have been great it all felt a bit too simplistic at times but luckily this is we are talking about and he spices things up as he goesobviously the comedy is the high point of the movie oneliners jabs at other superheroes fourth wall breaks metahumor etc this is what will make the movie so popular and memorable i found a lot of amusement with the comedy aspect of the movie opposed to the action and actual story not every single joke lands its always rough knowing a scene was supposed to be funny but it wasnt but based on the amount of them in the movie there are bound to be plenty that hit home the jabs at reynolds past roles were great and so were the jokes involving the xmen it was a little refreshing getting a different movie than most comicbook based movies even if this did have some minor similarities and the meta humor only made things betteri would be shocked to see a comic book fan not like everything i know about the character which isnt much seemed to be full on display if you think the trailers to this movie looks funny then its almost a guarantee you will find the movie a riot if you are on the fence like me you could do much worse it might not be the perfect action or comedy movie but its the perfect movie,comedy
that is a very difficult thing to say these days with everyone being a copycat originality alone should demand at least 8 starsincredible movieone of the funniest movies ever made if you are a comic fan like me you will be very happy with this movie as a comics fan you always wonder if they can get it right this was the character ryan reynolds was born to play dont be surprised to see this movie exceed box office expectations every person in the theater was laughing almost the entire length of the moviealthough this movie is inherently an action comedy it also has its appropriate moments of being seriousjust the right amount to get you invested in the charactersi am guessing anyone not giving this 10 stars is either too old or too uptight with their prudish sense of humor make no mistake this movie has some of the most crude humor imaginable and if youre a prude goody two shoes there is plenty of rude crude humor to make you turn awayeven though your younger teenagers will want to see this movie and love itit is not appropriate there are some very explicit scenes and some of the humor is too adult in nature,comedy

this review may be incredibly biased as i am a massive fan of comics both marvel and dc i watched on its opening night at the midnight showing being among the elite movie fans who stayed up late to see a movie on a weeknight i had high expectations for this film put quite simply this movie blew my mind its humor worked every time and i along with the rest of the audience laughed to the point of tears consistently the action was well shot and kept me interested and the movie finally does respect to the character the acting is goodenough but ryan reynolds really shines through you can clearly tell everyone was having fun the whole time during filming and that made the film even more enjoyable it should be known that this movie is about so it really does earn its r rating the language in this movie is consistently crude and the violence is as gratuitous as one may expect overall if you know what youre walking into you will love this movie stay for the 2 aftercredit scenes,comedy
is a funny film from start to endthe director tim miller did a fantastic job in his career hands down to the movie this is the best marvel comic movie made by a nonmarvel studioryan reynolds character is superb he really did a good job and his performance was quite funny and amazing action sequence are fantastic especially the introduction fighting ed skrein gina carrano etc their part very wellthe movie 3d render and visual effects are stylish and superb i appreciate all the crew members of the film to making a wonderful movieall in all is a amazing film with lots of fun and actions,comedy
when a movie makes the entire audience laugh from the opening credits until the very last postcredits scene you know its definitely deserving of some awardsthe sarcasm and rapid fire witty comments that are strategically placed through the entire movie in sometimes unexpected but still very natural ways coupled with the been there done that vibe of clearly trying to poke fun at other action and hero movies is done exactly right the nonlinear story line coupled with a level of violence and sexual material were not used to from the pg13 hero movies and a huge amount of sarcasm and wit gives it almost a quentin tarantino meets ben stiller feel and its absolutely awesome there is nothing quite like this movie and itll probably open up a whole new door for copycats considering this is the directing debut for tim miller i think he hasquite the future ahead of him in directing,comedy
after a disastrous outing in xmen origins wolverine is back with a bang in this insanely funny  violent entry the tone is set right from the word go with opening credits like a british villain a hot chick a moody teen  we are introduced to right during the action sequence on highway which we have been seeing in trailers after slaying goons  blowing a few heads we jump back in time  get to know how wade wilson was transformed to after the origin story we return for more chases and fights is a foul mouthed jerk a rude crude fighting machine breaking the fourth wall constantly theres plenty of gory violence with heads blowing  hands chopping is funny  frequently hilarious with fun poked at his previous green lantern role wolverine  even a jab at studio for not providing enough budget as far as story is concerned its predictable  there arent any surprises but surely its very much entertaining  fun to watch as for nudity  sex scenes it was censored here in india so cant say much about it but there is a scene where naked is fighting ajax  we can see his ps also some hilarious moments in sex scene montage between venessa  wade in the end its a different kind of superhero story  exactly the kind of movie we wanted,comedy
i finally did a firstdayfirstshow that too on a weekday in the company of borderline underage kids fittingly enough it was the most irreverent superhero film of all time  my friend dropped out at the last minute so i had an extra ticket with me at first i tried selling it but that didnt work so i gave it to this college kid for free he turned out to be quite the expert on comic books so it was not a bad deal at all an important bit of info he shared with me was that is a marvel ripoff of deathstroke a dc character who is no 32 on igns list of superheroes their stories super strengths etc are identical but sense of humour should set him apart i think we will find out soon enough when suicide squad comes out will smith plays deathstroke in that movie coming back to the movie it follows a simple storyline  hero is a bad guy turned good guy who meets the love of his life and instantly gets terminally ill to ensure hes around for this girl he secretly and goes under the knife of some very questionable folks who promise him another chance in his friends words he ends up looking like an avocado had sex with an older avocado but in a nasty way and many other gross hilarious references thus he stays away from her and rest of the story is about finding the guy who did it and getting even in style forget the minimal storyline and this movie is so much fun because of the witty overboard and overtly sexual humor which does justice to character at the cost of being rated a being rated r is really good because you dont have to pull back on the colorful language and all the amazing headshots pulls off throughout the movie of course the censor board for inexplicable reasons still mutes all the f words and p words despite giving the movie an a rating i am not sure if there is any nudity or topless scenes either censor board screwups on the language and sex scenes notwithstanding  most of the actionviolence seems to be in place this is a movie made up of several memorable moments just because of how ridiculous and entertaining they are the same time1 triple headshot  okay this one was censored i know because i have seen it many times in the trailer and the senior citizens of the censor board removed it from the movie completely arbitrary the build up to this is has only 12 bullets left and more bad guys to kill he ends up wasting bullets on one guy who hes angry with and then realizes there are three more guys left standing to make up for it he aligns their heads in his sights and gets a triple kill almost the third guy gets a slow bullet stuck on his forehead or maybe its because he just has a thick skull he pulls out knives and gets skewered by with swords like a kebab 2 innuendo and swearing  a ridiculous amount of sexual innuendo pervades every minute of the film including the fight sequences sadly the swearing which is integral to the film has been censored i recommend watching an uncensored blueray version to fill in the gaps the censor board gets all the same words from me which they muted out from the movie 3 silly superhero references a taking a dig at marvel tells colossus and the little x men girl looks like its only the two of you in this big house the studio doesnt look like they could afford another xmen character b when the super strong villains side kick does a superhero landing he says shes gonna to do a super hero landing and after the landing its bad for the knees you know c has a stapled on wolverine mask on his face when he reunites with his girlfriend which she pulls off anyway d refers to profx as the old bald guy 4 other interesting characters  colossus is nice with a strong russian accent or is it eastern european indestructible metallic body and a morally astute attitude towards people around him he keeps giving unsolicited advice to the teenage girl and also to which both promptly ignore blowing away the villains head despite his dramatic batman like speech makes him pukethe movie belongs pretty much to ryan reynolds a witty script and some really cool action sequences looking at the bigger picture marvel seems to be going so many up on dcwarner its becoming ridiculous avengers guardians of the galaxy antman daredevil jessica jones and agents of shield and i dont know how many more on the way dc on the other hand seems a little more traditional and laidback with its movies and tv shows arrow and flash just dont match up to daredevil and jessica jones in storytelling action or in character development batman is still my alltime favorite superhero and its evident that all of the other dc characters are just piggybacking on him i look forward to the suicide squad and justice league but i cant help feeling that marvel is slowly but surely taking over mindspace of superhero fans hopefully marvels success drives dc  warner to also focus on heroes other than batman and superman and sets up an epic showdown if not in the same universe but at the movies,comedy
it was about time wed reached the saturation point in superhero genre there were way too many generic origin stories and sequels from both marvel and dc every superhero movie nowadays is either about a cookie cutter villain who wants to take over the world or about a cookie cutter villain who wants to take over the world and show up in the sequel and the heroes either weep gloomily man of steel or try too hard to be funny ultronwe needed a superhero who gets the bullshit out of the way and knock people in the balls for fun we needed a superhero who doesnt mope around in his origin story we needed a superhero who impales bad guys with dual katanas and most importantly we needed a superhero who asks if youre going to touch yourself tonightwith no attempt at a hyperbole i can tell you that the era of the dark knight is over is here and things will never be the same againdirected by tim miller is a raging exploding subversion of superhero films and by subversion i mean it grabs you by the collar shows you how most superhero movies suck and nimbly demonstrates how things can be different when some brain cells are put to use by filmmakers the opening sequence a slow freeze frame zoom out of a car crash plays out like an honest credits skit where the producer is called a rich asshole and the writers are called the real heroes of the filmthis is the kind of film is  self aware selfreferential and in full hollywood bashing mode nobody is spared  not even the producers of this very film where makes fun of the lack of budget the film doesnt shy away from thrashing rivals studios as well in the scene where its time to turn a human into a mutant with a sci fi experiment played by ryan reynolds who also played green lantern asks the evil scientist not to give him a shitty cgi suithis love interest morena baccarin isnt the delicate blonde haired damsel in distress  shes as demented as him and their disturbingly lusty relationship is played out as love no schmaltzy upside down kisses in the rain here  the woman wears a strap on and proceeds to bend the superhero heresuch insane subversion is feels like discovering treasure and now that youve seen the shinier side of the genre its going to be difficult to come back to the straightforward superhero movies when spends the whole movie telling you how youve been watching shitty movies until now your expectations for batman vs superman and the future avengers films dissipatesits like tasting belgian chocolate waffles in belgium  you cant go back to bandra nutella waffles after that or like eating a pizza in milan and realizing dominoes tastes like turd or like wearing silk underwear and realizing you cant go back to cotton if the point still isnt clear in your head you need to schedule a meeting with deadpoolthis movie is written by the same guys who wrote zombieland and their wicked sense of humor is infectious the more surprising part is that this is director millers first film with the kind of visual artistry mayhem and grasp on humor on display in this achievement is the equivalent of the taj mahal being built by a guy who held a rock cutter for the first timeis foxs guardians of the galaxy and its opened a whole new gateway for the superhero genre whether you have a date or not make sure you celebrate valentines day at the multiplex playing this movie its a love story after all with lubricated strap ons is be a very rewarding cinematic experience that is refreshingly different from any other superhero movie before it,comedy
well i saw the film and i just have to say that its perfect for a filmthere are a lot of complaining that the film is lazy stupid childish well i just have too say that is deadpoolhe is just a lazy guy with super powers doing what he wants when he wants he is childish naughty full of stupid jokes and a giant perverted so if you dont like that kind of film if you dont know like 34 of the people in the theatre were i watched please dont say that the film is badif the film is 100 like the source material the film is perfect,comedy
after the brilliant marketing this movie had i had unreal expectations i was afraid i will be disappointed like with so many other movies this didnt meet my expectations it was way bigger than that i loved every minute it is action packed it has a love story i cried from laughter i absolutely loved the references was making throughout the whole movie i loved the xmen mutants and i loved the villains and i definitely loved the craziness of this antihero i must confess i havent heard of before the marketing team made their magic but after this brilliance of a movie i am definitely starting to read the comicsand the after credits scenes so awesome way better than any other after credits scenes from other marvel movies all in all it deserves to be watched more than once this is a movie that youll be sorry if you dont go and watch it,comedy
first of all i love comic book movies so im pretty biased to begin with but that been said i really enjoyed this a lot ive always thought ryan reynolds was a great choice for ol dp he started out great in wolverine origins then some genius had to improve  on an already great character by making him unrecognisable from his comic book counterpart i mean whoever thought the merc with the sown up mouth was a good idea should seriously get their had checked thankfully does what he does best in this movie run his mouth and kick ass spectacularly its pretty much nonstop action and laughs from the get go reynolds has redeemed himself with this as far as im concerned his motormouth fits perfectly the rest of the cast are pretty good too the villain is nothing special but not terrible either the costume is spot on as is the humour and i would enjoy sitting through it again im sure only bad things i can think of is the movie is a little short or feels like it anyway and as i would have liked a little longer and wouldve liked his healing factor showcased a bit more when alls said and done though its the best non pg 13 comic book movie ive seen by far,comedy
truly is the role that ryan reynolds was born to play and this movie is an utterly phenomenal adaption of the propertythe movie remains remarkably true to its source material there are fourth wall breaks within fourth wall breaks jokes at the expense of the actors playing the characters at the expense of the cast and crew the movie and comic book industries in general comic book movies in particular the history of the star in comic book movies and more the movie was clearly made for adults although possibly not oriented towards our most mature and adult sides it is utterly unsuitable for children both in terms of graphic violence sexual innuendo graphic male nudity and hilariously scarring depictions of self affection even the end credit stick figure graphics include content that that is hilariously unsuitable for childrenas a long time fan of the comic books i was immensely happy with the movie it was everything i could have hoped for from a movie it was low brow offensive violent adult humor done extremely well i think however that even for someone who is not an existing fan of the comics  the movie stands alone well as a brilliantly funny and irreverent spin on the comic book adaption genre and in light of the news that a sequel has been green lit  it seems like a fantastic launch platform for a phenomenal franchisei highly recommend that every adult who has ever appreciated super hero violence or laughed at a penis watch this movie at the first opportunity i cant wait to watch it again,comedy
is directed by first time director tim miller and stars ryan reynolds ed skrein morena baccarin and stefan kapicic and tells the story of a former special forces operative turned mercenary who is subjected to a rogue experiment that leaves him with accelerated healing powers therefore adopting the alter ego deadpoolits unbelievable to say but fox did it they made the movie i could only dream of everything was perfect to the last detail from the opening credits all the way to the ending i was surprised to see that they took extra effort in putting in all these small but hilarious details it really is a relief that i can say that succeeded i just had so much fun watching this film and the audience in my theater loved it too even the six year old in my theater loved it he just kept on laughing and cheering it was amazingryan reynolds is amazing as the guy nailed it from the jokes all the way to the famous characteristics it was spot on and the banter between him and colossus was just perfect im glad to hear that reynolds is returning to play in future installments as far as im concerned he wants to play foreverthe directing by tim miller was phenomenal very impressive for a first time director he inserted all the fourth wall breaks in brilliant ways the action scenes were filmed stunningly and they were breath taking im eager to see what he does next rather it be another film or something complete differentthe biggest praise i can give this movie is that i wanted it to keep on going i just didnt want it to stop i actually felt sad when the credits started rolling well im definitely going to see it again and my rating might go up a notch witch would make it a perfect 1010is a hilarious action packed and most of all an entertaining film you wont be disappointed also be on the lookout for a very hilarious end credits scene,comedy
former special forces wade wilson ryan reynolds is the good kind of mercenary his best friend is bartender weasel t j miller he falls for equally irreverent vanessa morena baccarin their warped love story is interrupted when wade gets cancer agent smith recruits wade for experiments francis ajax freeman with his sidekick angel dust gina carano turn wade into an immortal ugly superhuman wade takes on the identity of as he hunts down francis for a cure xman colossus and his grumpy trainee negasonic teenage warhead try to recruit into the xmensimply put this is funny ryan reynolds is built to play this smartaleck crude character from two guys and a girl to van wilder his early works show his truest persona its unlikely anybody else could play quite as well this is a nonstop fastpaced 4th wall breaking no holds barred style of comedy i guess a minority could object to its crudeness there is a monotone to this style thats why the funniest moment is the cabbys second ride it comes out of nowhere the shock and awe of it is hilarious i like negasonic and colossus gina carano again proves that shes no actor morena baccarin more than makes up for it all in all this is funny and an actionpacked superhero movie with a solid story,comedy
this is the must see film of the year so far it is witty action packed well acted and has the sexy ryan reynolds at the helmthe contrast of the journey made by wade wilson into against that of and his vendetta against the evil baddie francis is extremely well done his sense of humour throughout the film together with the excellently shot action scenes make it a very enjoyable movie to watch this film gets away with a lot being set against the sad back story of why wade wilson chooses to embark along this journey in the first placethe only warning i say is that this film may be a little too violent and sexy for younger viewers who are used to the more traditional marvel films older viewers however will revel in this change to the normal marvel formula,comedy
please dont even watch this piece of dog poo i fell a sleep somewhere in the middle and i feel great about it boring movie for 10 year old children ryan r is the most annoying actor of this century i will never again watch a movie with him in it its a promise i make to myself stupid hollywood machinery trying to make us all deadstupid with this piece of crap i watched it only because of the high ratinghow the hell is it more than 8 no wonderstupid ass new generations are being raised by movies like this so they dont even know better what a waste of timeim lucky i fell a sleep during the movie,comedy
i have to admit i was excited to see this film i was expecting so much from a movie rated 85 on imdb after seeing it i am confused how this movie could be rated as highly as others like the matrix for instance which was an incredible and original film this film was nothing like it was touted to be its your basic violent revenge story i kept hoping for the novelty to show up it never didhere is the idea in a nutshell you have been wronged and have no power to do anything about it but now thanks to hollywood you are invincible and getting your revenge using unlimited power and killing without remorse the smart dialog made me groan the predictable storyline bored me eventually to make the film more interesting i started making bets with myself could i guess the next cute line being in the same roomtheater with an actor who has a cute remark every few seconds for two hours straight was mind numbing when a film is rated r you expect it to be targeted to adults this had its violent content yes but violence and cuteness only go so far eventually you need an interesting story with that r rating comes an obligation to elevate the material watching this movie was like watching a video game and video games are for children,comedy
when it comes to the merc with a mouth i never read a single one of his comic when i was younger nor did i ever seen first cinematic outing in xmen origins wolverine so when i heard a movie was being made my interest was peaked so i went to my local theater in february of 2016 watched the movie and i absolutely loved it from its great writing and humor and awesome action scenes to its brilliant casting is a truly awesome comic book movie that is never afraid to take advantage of its offthewall craziness and meta humor and use them to its advantage rather than go dark and grittythe film begins with an action scene with in action and then cuts back to two years before where wade wilson a mercenary for hire meets a prostitute named vanessa and they soon become lovingly committed one year later wilson pops the question to vanessa and she says yes but wade abruptly collapses and is diagnosed with terminal cancer later on a recruiter from a topsecret program approaches wade and offers him a chance to cure his cancer wilson at first refuses but decides to undergo the treatment at a laboratory he encounters ajax and angel dust who inject him with a serum that will rouse any dormant mutant genes and expose him to weeks of torture and pain to trigger the genes but without any success afterward wilson mocks ajax resulting in him being put into an airtight chamber that puts wade on the edge of suffocation after ajax reveals his true motives to him wade attacks ajax and is subjugated impaled and left to burn to death now with a disfigured face and revenge on his mind wilson adopts the name and must find and kill ajax and save his girlfriendtim miller manages to pull off the impossible with a movie essentially built on fanservice that doesnt pander to or talk down to the fans in any way because miller is shrewd enough to understand that is so much more than just oneliners and gore and sure the story can come across as a bit shallow and unreal but much like guardians of the galaxy before it the real heart of the movie lies in the emotional and character rhythms which are delivered in spades by miller and the writers the way the film tells its story and roots itself in actual pain is compelling and miller is never afraid to show it by lingering on the tangible and tearjerking agony of wades cancer and the effect it has on his relationship with vanessa as well as the multilayered torment he puts himself through in order to cure himself by a genetic mutation program which gives him his abilities and turns him into the man we know and love yet underneath all the katanas and meta humor the movie is really a love story that never seems to devise from that and unlike certain other comic book or even action movies where the token love interest always seems to be thrown in just for the hero to save the romance between wade and vanessa feels natural and real rather than tacked on which is always wonderful to see not to mention the two have wonderful chemistry making the scenes they are in together feel all the more real the storytelling here is creative by chucking us into an action scene then cuts back and forth in excellent and surprising ways to tell the story of this crazy but oddly likable antihero usually flashbacks and fastforwards can get tiresome but then theyre done right they can help make a simple story feel new and thrilling given how beloved is such a beloved marvel character making this movie was a massive risk much like guardians of the galaxy but with the right director writers cast and crew the film works so perfectly that its impossible to see the movie working any other waythe humor in is one of the reasons this film works so well with lots of inhumor references to films like taken and robocop visual jokes and vulgar jokes that never come across as too raunchy unlike other modern comedies there also are some hilarious jabs at reynolds previous outing as in xmen origins wolverine like when ajax threatens to sew wades mouth shut or when wilson says not to make the suit green or animated which is a nice jab at green lantern one of my favorite jokes is when colossus is taking to meet with professor x and he asks him if james mcavoy or patrick stewart is the most recent professor at the institution watching as well as wade wilson cuss like theres no tomorrow take jabs at other superhero movies among many other comical subjects as well as kill multiple henchmen is nothing short of exciting and always leaves the viewer with a high smile on their face every single joke in this movie works and not once did the humor not make me laugh my ass off rhett reese and paul wernick knocked it out of the park when it comes to the humor and the writing the music here is fantastic ranging from salt and pepa to chicago it makes perfect sense that theme song is dmx or at least it feel like it should be his theme until careless whisper by george michael kicks in which feels like the writers took a page from guardians of the galaxy in terms of using certain songs to fit whatever mode the director wants something suicide squad could learn a thing or two from when it comes to using songs that dont fit the scene when compared to most other big superhero movies when it comes to action setpieces doesnt have much to show for it due to its tiny budget but that doesnt mean the action scenes arent exciting plus seeing fight scenes be kept to a minimum is a stroke of luck in a movie like this especially when so many action movies nowadays are being destroyed by awful shaky cam rather than use polished and balanced shots with one of the worst offenders being taken 3 but thankfully doesnt suffer from that trend as the action shots always feel clean and smooth but were never left hanging when it comes to the fight scenes as the action is quick ultragory and extremely stylish with the opening scene of slicing and dicing guys like sashimi and the counting down the bullets scene is joys to watch and the final fight between and ajax is outstanding in every possible way tim miller and cinematographer ke seng do a fantastic job crafting efficient and greatlooking action scenes that seem to evoke tarantinos kill bill in terms of goriness and styleas for the casting it all around fantastic to the point that its impossible to see these actors play any other role in any other movie apart from hugh jackman christian bale chris pratt and robert downey jr and several others ryan reynolds has proven himself to be one of the finest casting choices for a comic book superhero and is the jewel in the crown as reynolds obsession for this character gives us a careerdefining performance that is instilled with a talent of making even the most crass phrase shine with spirited charisma more so than most other comic book actors reynolds makes every single beat of madcap humor furious rage and pain come so natural that theres an eerie feeling of his being lifted straight out of a comic book playing the role of wade wilson and as a cross between peter vankman from ghostbusters james bond and john mclane from die hard and nailing it every single time  morena baccarin is perfect as vanessa matching reynolds in delightful crankiness steering just shy of hot fanaticpixiefantasysweetheart typecasting by maintaining just the perfect amount of insane as well as being a lot better developed than other comic book love interests without being the clichd damsel in distress or being a token love interest tj miller is reliably hilarious as wades friend weasel and steals every scene hes in ed skerin brings plenty of arrogant muscular cruelty to ajax which makes him feel a lot less generic than most other action movie villains while gina carano works well as angel dust leslie uggams is deliciously amusing as blind al stefan kapicic and brianna hildebrand bring their a game as colossus and negasonic teenage warhead allowing for a ton of humorous banter and help keep the action bouncing all the way to the endhonestly what else is there to say about that other people havent said already its just an allout funny and actionpacked movie that does something different from the traditional superhero movie formula and turns it on its head little word of advance this film is not for kids or anyone who is easily offended is a hard r movie and wears it like a badge of honor so avoid showing this movie to little kids also be sure to stick around for a postcredits stinger that just might get you feeling a little gritty so go see this movie if you havent already youll have a hell of a time watching it,comedy
finally a superhero film that urinates all over decorum and well on just about everything else really especially other marvel characters talking about which i must say i am seriously impressed that marvel has once again been able to make something out of very littlethis is for all intents and purposes just another revenge film theres nothing particularly original about but with snappy foul mouth and clever dialogue a frenetic pace fantastic visual effects and an opening sequence that will blow your socks off this rates as one of the best examples of what hollywood can achieve if you allow certain individuals to run free with their passionin ryan reynolds played the titular role for laugh out loud entertainment morena baccarin is gorgeous and delivers her sometimes equally foul mouth rants with glee i think its fair to say that everyone in the film appeared to have had an absolute ball tipping my hat to the director tim miller for his directorial debut the opening scene alone almost had me in spasms its exciting to see such talent coming out of mainstream hollywood loved the soundtrack loved the visuals loved the sick humour loved the lead actors but i didnt really get the role of those xmen characters its ok that was a minor quibble overall fantastically entertaining film and must be seen on the big screen,comedy
i saw a couple of weeks ago after finally giving in to all the hype as i figured i was not terribly impressed this movie is about the caliber of the mid2000 marvel movies eg the punisher daredevil etc i think a lot of people are buying into it because they like the character im not a fan of the character or the movie yes it was reasonably well made but it just wasnt interesting and it had an extremely predictable plot i suppose one can argue that ryan reynolds was good in this movie as such perhaps hes the redeeming element but it still just wasnt a very enjoyable film for me510 starsand definitely dont take the kids,comedy
theres a lot to like about it has a good cast humour and action what is lacks is a good scriptryan reynolds is perfectly cast as comedy is where reynolds shines and this film is as much a showpiece for his off the wall politically incorrect and often ribald comedic talents as much as it is an action film the jokes can be crude but they are well timed and often rather clever the action scenes are not half bad eitherthey also mix in gallows humour that works well in the context of this film where suffers is in the scriptingstorytelling department the incessant oscillation between past and present disrupts the natural flow established early in the film the result is an annoying experience where you start to buy into the storyline only to have it broken again and again by uncomfortable segues into past worse still the background scenes presented are often emotionally sugary drawn out and frankly at times rather boring this film would have been much better served by getting the background out of the way up front and in a more abbreviated fashion the franchise shows promise it would be nice to see a second film thats more focused on reynolds humour and the jokery action scenes as these elements really define the antihero character i rate the first cinematic outing a six out of ten and mostly for reynolds chuckle worthy performance,comedy
what did do right very nearly everything this might be the only superhero film since the genre exploded that is a true 100 labour of love ryan reynolds and tim miller fought tooth and nail to make this film happen and make it happen the way they wanted it to and the way the fans wanted it to is insanely entertaining it is ridiculously gratuitous in all the best ways youd expect it crosses into the xmen world so its a nice break from the whole avengers world although it gets mentioned as well it is dark twisted hilarious gory unique insaneevery time i didnt think it could impress me more it does i was worried reynolds sarcastic humour would be overused and it isnt i was worried it would have a weak story and it is anything but every expectation was met and no glowing review was wrong this was quite simply a great time at the movies it also has so much to it and the script is so fast and clever and with the pop culture references and easter eggs i am certain i could watch this several times over and walk away with something different each time it might have given gas to a genre described by steven spielberg so accurately as the western of this generation that is slowly losing steam i think best of all they did it on a very moderate budget and yet the special effects stunts and cgi are some of the best i have ever seen period nothing is held backi have always liked ryan reynolds i know hes a good solid actor because hes proved he can be versatile however he was born and bred to play it was like was written with him in mind 20 years ago hugh jackman singlehandedly made wolverine come to life and now reynolds does the same for but this isnt just a superhero who kicks the crap out of people though he does plenty of that there is an actual story here wade wilson has some serious depth to his character and reynolds is clearly very passionate about this character in order to be this amazing character he needs a near perfect villain and they find that in ed skrein who is fantastic as ajax the two of them have a deep rivalry that works on a terrific level and unlike some villains who are out for world domination this rivalry is personal morena baccarin is decent as wade wilsons love interest she wouldnt have been my first choice but i never cared for her on homeland as a character so maybe im biased she is still decent and their chemistry is solid the supporting cast also truly shines in this film without characters you just want to see more of karan soni stefan kapicic tj miller and the excruciatingly underused but fascinating addition of negasonic teenage warhead played perfectly by brianna hildebrand this is also the first time ive seen gina carano who is just awful awful awful at acting be tolerable in a role but mostly because she is reduced fortunately to a thug whose purpose is to fight with colossus still carano needs to stop getting cast in anything everdirector tim miller really knocks this out of the park sometimes a new director proves themselves in such a way that they can set themselves for life and i think will be millers homerun his style the depth of story hes created here the incredible special effects and the way he uses the characters and actors and hes just made something so incredibly deeply entertaining this is one film that lives up to the hype and is a must see but is such a far cry from other marvel films out there and definitely not for the youngsters 910,comedy
delivers action comedy and a fun entertaining twist on everything an antihero movie should be based on the famous comic book published by marvel comics this film tells the story of wade wilson played by ryan reynolds as a former special forces operative turned mercenary wilson becomes involved in an experiment that left him with healing powers which creates his alter ego his mission is to take down the man who nearly destroyed his life action packed with a dark twisted sense of humor this film surprised me tremendously and was ridiculously hilarious directed by award winning tim miller this film brings everything imaginable to an action film reynolds did an amazing job and was as funny as ive ever seen him he has played a wide array of characters in his previous films and continued to do so in with such an amazing director cast and the magic of marvel this film did not disappoint,comedy
id hate to say this but was overrated yes it was a fun movie but its hardly as good as what the other reviewers have said ryan reynolds does suit the role but i feel that the story was lacking it seemed like the story was written simply for the sake of having the opportunity to make a movie and have some wise cracks a movie should tell a story even if it is a comedy rather than writing a lame story so that they can make a movie and sell some merchandise dealpool is an assassin but i think he could make his kills more stealthy and less gory the main villain was not really a boss i couldnt work out whether this ajax was the head honcho  he really seemed to be a second in command type funnily enough himself remarked that the studio could only afford to x men if the xmen were interested in recruiting him i am sure that they could have spared a couple more of the younger xmen to help him out it just seemed lame so in conclusion i am not saying it is a bad movie but please stop giving it 9s and 10s that kind of score should only be reserved for the dark knight trilogy,comedy
i wanted to see this movie as soon as i saw the first trailer and when my friends saw it before me that made me quite jealous then those same friends took me to see it and for the next 1 hour and 48 minutes i was completely amazed the action was executed perfectly the plot was on point and did not straw to far away but the best part of the movie i would have to say is the script the script in this movie was great like most fans know is known for his funny diolouge i was afraid that wouldnt be allowed to say half of the things that he did the script was perfect and there is no other way to put it i highly recommend watching this movie as soon as possible due to the fact of it being the best movie of 2016 thus far,comedy
look this movie is the best i just wanted to say done right i heard there was going to be a pg13 scriptbut i am so so glad that fell through there is so many funny fourth wall breaks witch i will not say because of spoilers i was also really happy with the costume i mean it is like this movie is just ripped out of the comic books all in all this is a must watch movie i also wanted to say the actors were meant to play these rolls now this is kinda the spoiler part so if you have not seen the movie please do not read are you ready so at the end comes out in a robe saying oh you have not left yet and than what really made me happy is that he said cable is going to appear in the next movie movie 2 here i come,comedy
as an avid fan of the character and a fan of ryan reynolds i was completely blown away by this movie this would literally be my favourite movie ever i loved everyones performance on this masterpiece ryan reynolds is literally so that is perfect ed skrein shows a truly emotionless bad guy but in a very good way moron baccarin plays a lovely hilarious and badass leading lady in this tjmiller is perfect as weasel and him and ryan have some of the most funniest moments in the movie brianna hildebrand plays a likable but moody teen and stefan kapicic as colossus just seems like such a great guy and wants to do good and it is the polar opposite of and he has one of the best scenes with gina carano plays an easily angered super strength mutant as well as one can and it has one of the best stan lee cameos ever the opening credits are perfection themselves the structure of the movie works so well with this character the humour is spot on probably 999999999 of the time and the action is absolutely amazing and brutal which works perfect in the movie and doesnt feel to gratuitous and the script is amazing with much thanks to paul wernick and rhett reese who did an amazing job and a great huge thank you to tim miller who does a mind blowing job for a first time feature film director and i cant wait to see how his path turns outonly one problem with this i now have to wait for the inevitable 2to sum it up best movie ever,comedy
is highly unique and also highly entertaining in so many waysthe storyline is pretty interesting as you start falling into it from the very beginning and it goes on like not other superhero movie does plus it has a great sense of humor in it couldnt expect more from such a cool character and its movienormally there are more than 5 superheroes in these kind of movies but has pretty much only 5 thats a little bit expected because of the reason that its centered just in himself but as i said being unique is the first thing that makes this movie specialand also the fired shots to disney and marvel were really fun to watchas far as the rating goes the movie absolutely deserves 9 out of 10 great stuffalready pumped for the second one,comedy
this movie was great really worth the money and time to go see it when this comes out on dvd or netflix its a must see or get movie very funny with a lot of twist you couldnt really guess what was going to happen next like you most movie but thats why its mainly a good movie to see the director and everybody did a good job in creating this movie thats why i gave it a 10 out of 10 itll have you dying laughing by the end of the movie hope to see a part 2 if there is a part 2 you know ill be there the first day it comes out most people who say this movie isnt great doesnt know anything about movies cause this was a master peace i recommend seeing it before it leave theater so you can get a full experience of the action and everything that was going down in it,comedy
we didnt need to have a movie with a exceptional story or at least i didnt i was perfectly happy with a movie that had making jokes and killing people in a by the numbers revenge movie but this film went way beyond that this was just supposed to be another kick ass movie but for me this movie can compete with the r rated spy thriller known as kingsman which i also gave the same rating as this film this film has some great action stunts good blood and a lot of death defying stunts but that isnt what makes it a good film this film also has a heart and it wears it on its sleeve it is the most romantic film for a non romantic movie it beats out pepper and tony in the iron man movie and can compete with the relationship between peter and gwen in the amazing spiderman it really is a film that can break boundaries this film also keeps the spirit of alive giving us a perfect interpretation of the character there were a few minor differences from the character created in the comics such as the multiple personalities and i am pretty sure wade wilson wasnt crazy before the weapon x project happened that being said it was still good enough for all of us fans of the character to really have a good time with him wins,comedy
if it seems familiar i used the same title for another ryan reynolds film waiting its kind of the same story trying too hard to be witty and failing to be funnyi went to the movie with two girls both oblivious to who the was supposed to be or the filmographic history of both actor and character most of the jokes flew right over their heads as for me i expected those selfreferential quips to be drowned in a sea of actual funny which was somewhat lackingalso about its rratedness not that much it could have easily been pg13 with some sex jokes added for a character that was supposed to have been through hell and back the psychological horror was severely missing and that is what rrated means not that poor prudish americans have to hear about sex existing and seeing some random blood on the screen of course that is probably because until a late phase of the movies development they didnt know it could be rrated so i will cut them some slack i am excited though that it proved to studios that being a little ballsy doesnt mean people wont flock to see it expect all superheroes movies from now on to be a little edgy after getting over the brooding phasebottom line you know when a song is making fun of a specific genre but objectively is part of said genre so it it brings little new to the table beyond proving r can make money fun as it was my favourite scene was morena baccarin in nude i know i should have started with that,comedy
this film is totally one of a kind is that type of movie u just feel like watching over and over again thrill comedy action this movie has it all the acting is greatat first i was a bit skeptical but now i cant imagine anyone better then ryan reynolds as this is not your typical super hero film so u most have an open mind in order to really enjoy this the only problem with this movie is that its too small and gets u really hookedbut its ok they are going to make 2 they say it after the ending credits so its oki would rate this movie a 910 oh and by the way i cant wait for sequel its gonna be awesome,comedy
is one of those great achievements in movies it wont win any oscars but it will win cash lots of it and itll be well remembered as one of the best films of its time because its fun ryan reynolds is his delivery and comedic timing is superb and he makes it clear this is not a superhero movie is not a superhero hes a merc for hire hes paid to kill people itjust so happens that deapool has a reason to have a conscience hes got s soft spot for the little guy wade wilson is a mercenary who is hired out for work killing people but he finds love with the lovely vanessa and he feels like his life is now complete he has love he also has cancer in the lungs prostrate and brain so in order to extend his life he submits to a shady operation designed to cure him what they want is another weapon the operation is cruel its inhumane and its designed to create stress to activate wades mutant healing powers thanks to a mixture of a serum laced with wolverines blood during this stress wade becomes disfigured and he escapes vowing to kill the people who did this to him hes immortal but in pain hes also got a grasp on the world few others dont he can break the fourth wall and he is literally insane as well sense of humor tends to move towards the black parts of life but he is funny that sick sense of humor is what makes the movie the story takes a turn for the worst when the thugs kidnap vanessa and force to come to them with the help of two of the xmen goes into battle determined to kill and maim the bad guys  thats it the story in a nutshellthe story works because of reynolds he is he waited ten years to make this movie and that was time well spent because they made a movie that is one of the best in the superherocomic book genre it does not take itself seriously and avoids the clichs  has to be seen on a movie screen to be appreciated and watch it without kids  this is not a movie for the little ones,comedy
right from the get go this film had me laughing and kept me going throughout this film is one of my top ten films of all time and it really shows a lot of time and effort went into it there is plenty of action which was entertaining the fourth wall breaks are creative and funny the characters were believable and funny ryan reynolds was perfect for the role just like robert downy jr was for iron man in terms for problems for this film there are very few there was some cut content which was in the trailer but not in the finished film but these are just a few jokes and one liners i would highly recommend this film to anyone as it is a brilliant new laugh out load action film and a true comic in a film,comedy
the dialogue and the uncut action definitely make this movie worthwhile is an unconventional character as he constantly projects his facetious fourth wallbreaking humor while asserting his presence as the antihero the character has an acquired taste and thankfully his attributes were perfectly portrayed on the big screened skrein the actor playing ajax is guiding his path to stardom the best scenes of the movie were with ajax and wade wilson together specifically the scenes of wilsons transition into a superhero witty remarks from wilson combined with the stonecold language from ajax resulted in impeccable acting and dialoguewith that said im not sure if the movie lives up to the hype even a few of the comedic scenes had me scoffing and rolling my eyes im a fan of the rrated dialogue though i found a few of the jokes to be stale and ignorant this movie met but did not exceed my expectations the plot does not thicken and instead it drives a predictable storyline of vanessa wade wilsons lover being kidnapped which then sets up for a climax that i found to be rather standardthe biggest accomplishment for this movie is that it served as a solid steppingstone for the sequel,comedy
a very good movie i was really tired of bad superheroes bad plot ridiculous scenes which exaggerate the comedy in an awful way the new spiderman saga thor 2 iron man 3 avengers the last movie of the fantastic 4  no matter if kate mara is sue etc but this time was a big surprise for mefortunately for us this time a suitable version of a relatively good or at least no a really deranged one was chosen for the big screen and creates a credible superhero with very human and understandable motivations and most important this is a superhero which is not an idiot who thinks that bad guys deserve a second chance that is what you really like in a movie like this a real hero even when sometimes is not really super,comedy
ive seen four times and i could watch it another four times freshman director tim miller zombieland scenarists rhett reese and paul wernick along with funny man ryan reynolds have forged a marvel superhero origin epic like none youve ever seen if youve got a skewered perhaps even morbid sense of humor you may enjoy this swiftlypaced slicklymade scrambledup saga about a guy who shares something in common with hugh jackmans wolverine of xmen fame mind you is not a runofthemill superhero with role model potential he has a foul mouth a perverse sense of humor and his body heals itself rather quickly becauselike his fellow xmen he is a mutant he wears a red spiderman style hood with patches over his eyes everything about qualifies as not only refreshing but also uproarious slaughters sacred cows instead of the typical opening credits that identify the actors and technicians behind the scenes we see brief descriptions for example director tim miller who has only made two short films is referred to as an overpaid tool jokes about others 127 hours liam neesons taken trilogy and the xmen franchise twentieth century fox owns both and xmen so they can get away with poking fun at their own properties ryan reynolds ridicules himself too the former green lantern star cracks jokes about shunning a green superhero suit after he submits himself to a passel of unscrupulous people to cure him of multiple forms of cancer furthermore he entreats them not to make the superhero suit animated like the green lantern superhero suit i thought green lantern was tolerable but i hated the cgi villain meantime despite its predictable formulaic narrative suffers from little else reynolds was born to play wade williams lets not forget reynolds played a milder incarnation of in 2009s xmen origins wolverine the character dishes up deliciously funny lines as much as i would love to quote those clever quips the profanity in them prohibits me so youll have to hear them for yourself is loquacious to a fault but everything he utters is hilarious comparatively the villain gets in only one clever line a lot of moviegoers are going to be quoting and some of those witticisms may eventually wind up in everyday conversationnow let me pause and provide a pithy plot synopsis before i resume my praise in the third paragraph wade williams ryan reynolds of ripd is a former special forces commando with 41 confirmed kills to his record he lives in new york city and hires himself out to resolve other peoples problems kind of like a sort of equalizer wade discourages a pizza delivery man jeremy style dayne of words and pictures from stalking a girl when he isnt working wade hangs out with other lowlife mercenaries at an obscure barsister margarets home for wayward girls run by his best friend weasel comedian t j miller of our idiot brother who doubles as the bartender later he meets a girl at a bar vanessa carlysle morena baccarin of serenity who works as a server at a strip club and they realize that they are made for each other they share a similar sense of humor enjoy kinky sex and seem inseparable until wade collapses mysteriously afterward they learn to their horror that wade is afflicted with terminal cancer no sooner has wade been diagnosed than a welldressed little guy in a suit and tie jed rees of galaxy quest approaches him with a business card and an alternative form of medical treatment that will enable him to survive and emerge as better than better wade accepts this nebulous offer against vanessas wishes at the clinic our hero encounters two unsavory characters a tall shady gent posing as a doctor ajax ed skrien of the transporter refueled and his female assistant angel dust gina carano of haywire who looks like a linebacker for the dallas cowboys ajax explains that they will expose wade to a cocktail of serums and torturous treatments that will prompt his mutant powers to appear and destroy his cancer of course they cherish no such illusions about helping wade out miraculously the treatment succeeds in curing wade and he emerges from this hideous obstacle course of treatments as literally indestructible the downside is that he looks just as hideous he looks like a walking talking pizza with a shaven head but he is incredibly strong resilient and heals in light seconds after succumbing to the worse wounds eventually he adopts a suit to conceal his hideous appearance and searches for ajax so that the dastard can help him recover his good looksif you walk into expecting to see xmen captain america iron man or thor youre going to be severely surprised indeed inhabits that outlandish universe but director tim miller and ryan reynolds have concocted a subversive saga that is not only rrated but also not suitable for teenagers the montage of pansexual practices that wade and vanessa indulge in may alienate prudish spectators and wade rhapsodizes about the joys of masturbation after he makes the transition to indestructible wade tracks down evil ajax and kills each of the villains accomplices when they fail to inform on him now were talking body count galore with slicing up his many adversaries when he isnt riddling them with gunfire you can take your kids captain america and batman but you should draw the line at or they will be asking you interesting questions that may challenge your responses ryan reynolds was made to play and ed skrien as the british villain is truly heinous naturally girlfriend vanessa is a damselindistress but there is nothing remotely innocent about this dame with a tattoo on her breast tj miller has some of the best lines in that discretion prevents me from quoting after superhero movies will never be the same,comedy
i died of laughter the entire movie it was fing brilliant and i loved every minute of it many movies have those oh its one of those boring parts that take too long this scene is dumb and boring moments had none of those i was entertained all the way from the moment the commercials ended to the instant that the postcredit scene ended and the lights went on in the theater i want more i will be buying the dvdbluray combo the instant it comes out because we all know that theres gonna be a bunch of deleted scenes on that st and i want more only being beaten by star wars has become my 2 favorite movie franchise you could make like 5 sequels and the hilarity would never get old,comedy
a pg18 rating for a marvel superhero movie and the best marvel super hero too its safe to say that i had my expectations way waaay up and i was not disappointed is hilarious filled with action the plot is fast and has no dead spots you will also love all of the characters and hate all of the bad guys now the main bad guy was pretty much evil for the sake of being evil so it would be nice to give us a bit of a back story on that and on his evil assistant as well but then again this wasnt that kind of movie the movie does not follow any of the comic plot lines and i read all of the comics now lots of the characters from the comics are in deed in the movie but their roles and background are mostly changed even the origin story is reduced quite a bit however this is fully understandable since the movie has limited length it would simply not be possible to fit everything in there so not only can the movie easily stand in the genre by itself with people who never read the comics will have no problems jumping in but compared to the quality of the comics it does not lag behind either for me this is the first big hero movie from marvel where i had no problems deciding on the rating 10 out of 10,comedy
when i heard of the early screenings of i automatically jumped on imdb to find out what some of the early viewers thought about it one gentlemen said it contained filthy obscene and crude language and actions in every scene it was shockingly dark in humor i cant believe this was a marvel character i am appalled at what the movie industry considers entertaining another lady exclaimed the fact that this film has already been given an 89 is quite frankly disturbing and one of the many reasons god doesnt talk to us anymore yes ladies and gentlemengod all i could think was what kind of scenes exist in this movie that would shock even the lights of whathisname and whogivesashh this movie must be extremely offensive hyper sexual and vulgar i mean for fks sake even god stopped talking to us i must watch it and i did d all i can say is theyre right about the vulgarity and hyper sexual scenes theyre right about the crud jokes and excessive violence theyre right about everything what they fail to mention is the rest of the story this story is really kind of sorta sweet in a twisted kind of way some of the best scenes in this movie were when wadeand vennesa wades girlfriend where together it was a really nice love story between the two of themonce you get passed all the sex which granted was a lot for a 2 minute montage the supporting characters negasonic teenage warhead whom im going to call ntw from now on and colossus were perfect for this movie colossus was like a giant metallic teddy bear trying to change antiheroic ways and learn the way of the xmen ntw was your everyday emo girl with nuclear power the repertoire between and ntw was perfect as was the constant nagging of colossus trying to stop from killing eeeveryone tj miller plays the bartender and wades best friend every scene hes in is hilarious basically this was a laugh out loud violent twisted and very romantic story this is not a nice happy pg13 action movie like antman okay this is a fun r rated action comedy that takes it to the next level i havent laughed so hard in the theaters in years seriously go watch it or dont honestly its not for everyone if you want to go to the movies for a nice pleasant chuckle kind of time its best you go watch something else you dont want god not talking to you over a movie okay,comedy
let me start off by saying that i know close to nothing about besides the fact it is produced by marvel that being said i absolutely loved this moviethe jokes are adultbased so if you are sensitive towards that i would recommend you to not see this movie but if you love dark humor go ahead and watch it you will not regret it there were many scenes where i laughed so hard my chest began to hurtwhile funny some scenes were surprising and made me feel uncomfortable one scene in particular is when francis freeman ed skrein tortures wade wilson ryan reynolds while it is a focal point in the movie it left me pretty shook up the nonchalant attitude francis had torturing wade had me legitimately angry towards him and increased my support to and his goal of destroying francisthere is also full frontal nudity and a pair of mans butt cheeks and lets not forget the sex scene so beware of that before bringing the whole family for family movie night,comedy
is a perfect film for the new audience as well as for fans there couldnt be a better choice of actor for role other than the guy ryan reynoldsseems like it was his destiny to do this role grin emoticonmovie does fulfill fans desire for 3 years of wait but as i know how this character is my expectations were too muchbut still the movie is completely hilarious and most comedy superhero  well hes technically a mercenary  this movie did start with a comic note and maintains to keep comic and dark tone at the same time  the way a movie should have been the use of fourth wall break is done in a appropriate waythe character might start talking to the audience anytime he feels like  of course is known for 4rth wall break  and he did it in a good wayviolence level is high so its not a movie for weak hearted or childrensbut for people like us its a perfect moviedont forget to wait till post credits scenebest things action fourth wall break comedy origin story jokes  dialouges colosus post creditcant give it less than 9510  hope this doesnt add me to naughty list but i had to do it ,comedy
this is my review for spoiler freeif you dont know who is he is a wisecracking mercenary named wade wilson who is very aware he is in a comic book ryan reynolds is perfect for the role of the merc with a mouth under the direction of newbie director tim miller this is the film that have been waiting forcast ryan reynolds ed skrein morena baccarin and tj millerplot a former special forces operative turned mercenary is subjected to a rogue experiment that leaves him with accelerated healing powers adopting the alter ego its an origin story and a very good onethis hilarious action comedy is filled with funny wisecracking jokes that will leave you crying with laughter probably every five minutes among the hilarity there are ultraviolent action scenes with wisecracking jokeslet me go through some points of why i think this is the marvel film to see this yearviolent action scenes the strong bloody violence makes this the perfect film for any marvel fan what else can i say about thatfourthwall breaking the joy doesnt stop there with the action and sex references there is also amazing fourthwall breaking that is just relentless the film certainly delivers even from its meager 50 million production budget certainly less than other marvel movies this is ryan reynolds at his best he is perfect for the role as the canadian antihero its certainly a lot better than 2011s green lantern starring the same actortim miller made this film well and will probably go down in history as one of the best marvel films all time this action packed comedy is rude funny and full of violence in my opinion this is by far the best film of 2016 so far and i recommend it to everyone seriously you will endlessly be laughing with joy 1010 is not enough of a rating for this film must see cant wait for the directors cut later this year,comedy
ill admit i may be biased because i can not stand ryan reynolds i dont know who thought that he would ever be a good actor there are a number of actors who have no sense of characterization they are the same in every single movie rr is always dishing out the same poorly delivered attempt at deadpan sarcasm one filmok two filmsget a clue third film and casting personnel should be fired for even considering onetrickpony talent i should have known better going into this but i wanted to give it a fair shot as expected his acting got old in the first five minutesas for the movie itself the plot was acceptable i like the idea of a rogue lab however the storytelling is completely disrupted by the constant stream of flashback sequences its as if they did it intentionally in an attempt to set a guinness record rrs narration and incessant breaking the 4th wall is just annoying and the subplot of bringing in the two x men is too weak to even be considered contrived i have no desire to revisit this title,comedy
reallife link a movie about love id say it shows that when someone truly loves you they are ready to sacrifice themselves and do anything for that person and if someone loves you the looks wont matter this however can only be believed if that person is already in love with you and your looks changes after because i personally find it hard to believe that in the beginning looks like dead pools wouldnt be repulsivecharacter analysis characters are not deep enough even wade is shallow it is like he is two characters the one who sees everything as fun when he is in the costume and the angry one out of the costume the character is just not believable wade should have had a better sense of humour when not wearing the mask if they wanted to make him seem as one and not two characters what ruined this movie for me despite having a good storyline and plot is wades constant talk to the audience however i did like the scene when he said its like the studio couldnt afford more than than two xmens it just didnt feel organic and natural even though the aim was to make it funny,comedy
i know from talking to people about this movie that so many people who watch it think it is amazing when really as comedy movies go this isnt a good one in particular it has a few good action scenes and thats why i gave it 6 stars but if it was just meant to be a comedy then i would give it maybe 3 stars if it was luckyit definitely isnt appropriate for children under the age of 15 or maybe 16 because it has an unnecessary amount of filthy language some pretty mild violence which probably shouldnt be an issue if youre kid is mature plus some sex and nudityso basically you can watch this movie for entertainment but its not very good for a comedy movie,comedy
lets say what it isnt1 intelligent 2 articulate 3 moving 4 rib tickling funny 5 hilarious 6 deep and meaningful 7 philosophical 8 the meaning of life 9 the meaning of anythingit is a1 comic book of a superhero  antihero  misogynist 2 written for those that want a laugh 3 an escape from any reality 4 anything serious 5 to avoid a blizzard outside 6 totally away from any serious comic scifi such as xmen 7 a bit tedious after a whilepersonally i watched 34 of it and gave up its juvenile humour dressed up in a veneer of adult satire i found it boring and gave upyou may love it its like marmite,comedy
how can i describe first of all is not the kind of guy you would want introduced to your respectable parents he is rough he is vulgar he has no ethic whatsoever and hes superficial at the end of the date you would all end in jail alongside him while hes eating a pizzabut this antihero side makes him so attaching and so charming in the same time hes so refreshing compared to his xmen buddies driven by justice and compassion while he clearly doesnt give a damn at all this clash between two philosophies is a great source for hilarious scenesthe huge dose of humor is by the way welcomed because is really violent as well some scenes despite being funny are also quite gory a lot of people die in the movie most of them in a very violent way but the lightness which comes from makes them more enjoyable to watchbut most of all the movie is allowing us to see the huge comical talent of ryan reynolds he bears the movie on his shoulders i can feel he has so much fun impersonating and he shared his fun with his partners this is making a feelgood movie despite the huge darkness of the scenario even the big villain is funny in his way910,comedy
id heard the buzz about the movie and read the gushing reviews but it takes a lot to get me to the theater in the dead of winter and i ultimately decided to wait for mr pool to arrive on bluray big mistake boasting more belly laughs than any pure comedy ive seen in years this is a movie i shouldve seen with an audience i love that communal joy with a group of people when a movie is hitting all the sweet spots its so rare and i regret that i missed it herethe laughs i expected everyone id spoken to said it was really funny that it worked so well with the stylized action was a bit of a surprise but not a total shock what did surprise me though was just how invested i was in the characters the film does a great job of making you care about wade wilson and hes easy root for here hes not a perfect man when we meet him or when we leave him far from it actually but he and vanessas love story reminded me a bit of rocky and adrians from the original rocky theres that moment when paulie asks rocky what he sees in adrian and rocky says that she fills gaps paulie now utterly confused asks rocky what he means and rocky replies gaps you know i got gaps shes got gaps together we fill gaps wade and vanessa are two damaged people who just sort of fill gaps the humor and the action may be its calling card but the heart of this film is that love story and thats what holds it all together theres also a really great villain in ajax who is as cold and ruthless as any i can remember seeing certainly in a comic book movie too often i find that im ambivalent toward the bad guys in these kinds of movies see captain america civil war but here i was actively rooting against ajax i mean actively ed skerin was great as was the entire cast reynolds was born to play wade wilsonand i wasnt surprised that thisbeing somewhat of a passion project for himsaw him deliver but he gets a lot of help from morena baccarin who is just exceptional tj miller leslie uggams and his would be xmen compatriots brianna hildebrand stefan kapii as negasonic teenage warhead and colossus respectively both were critical in bringing out the best  and worst in deadpoolfunny exciting moving yes moving is a refreshing entry in the crowded somewhat fatigued comic book movie genre,comedy
very few times have i ever fallen headoverheels for moviein its opening credits such was the case for i mean when the credits display directed by some tool i knew i was in for a good timedue to a complete loss of any kind of imagination recently movie goers have been inundated with every movie imaginable concerning marvel and its super heroes most have been huge disappointments some were meh and very few were actually entertaining had me from start to finish i mean cmon who could not like a character by the name of negasonic teenage warheadit is a story about a former special ops mercenary wade wilson played remarkably well by ryan reynolds he is trying to get out of the business but as luck would have it he just cannot seem to break free he falls in love and when he finally musters the courage to pop the question receives some awful news even the villain in this movie was a cut above the rest ajax who seems to have a narcissistic personality was completely bad ass he was also superbly played by ed skrein who if memory serves me correctly was formerly in game of thrones his sidekick although not named was one tough broadthis movie lasts 108 minutes and is rated r for nonstop graphic violence language simulated sex and nudity other reviews i have read list graphic nudity i do not even know what that is if youre nude youre nude theres nothing graphic about thatanyhoo i cannot recommend this enough if this site had half stars this would definitely garner a 95 from me enjoy yourself,comedy
ok let me make a confession when i first head i felt the guys who come up with things in marvel ran out of ideas and names i watched the movie quite reluctantly and boy was i in for a surprisethis has to be by far the best x men movie to date a very unique opening sequence followed by some mindblowing action sequence enough cannot be said about the action and choreography amazing action coupled with punchy onelines and super cool slowmo scenes the humor in the movie is dry and sarcastic and really well written some may not agree the dry wit adds a very realistic and natural dimension to the character and makes you connect with him the one liners and wisecracks is almost continuous when mr is around and when he is not on we wish him back just so that we can hear him mouthoffnegasonic and colossus have limited role in the movie except towards the last big action sequence but this movie is all about the casting in ryan reynolds is spot on and i now i cannot imagine anyone else playing deadpooloverall a superb movie a solid 910,comedy
i believe the movie was outstanding due to the fact that it had only a 58000000 budget to work with the movie itself did almost 6 times that amount plus filming in only 48 days that is extremely impressiveno tip my hat to everyone on that one well done the only shrug with the movie is that i do like the fact that they put colossus in the movie but they could have put another side superhero instead of someone nobody really knows but overall im glad there making a 2nd movie hopefully they put other xmen characters in it besides cable and colossus i believe they should somehow involve with the upcoming movie infinity war part 1 even if its for only 1015min or even a cameo,comedy
 some minor spoilers ahead i must admit that i am not a comic book fan i have only a passing interest in the xmen series and stories of the genre this wisecracking goofy fun character was the most entertaining one of the whole bunch certainly not for younger kids and that right there might be part of the charm it was made for an adult audience nothing was too heavily dumbed down or cleaned up no high moral ground here it was witty and gritty and those aspects were almost nonstop the repeated breaks to the 4th wall directly addressing the viewer gave an even more fun aspect to it the film did a serious and job of putting the story forward and at the same time didnt take itself too serious the film right from the opening credits tells you to sit back and enjoy the ride the laughter started almost immediately the intense and complicated action started right on its heels and the wisecracking was peppered throughout repeated events of leaving the guns and ammo bag in the cab reminded me of the infamous blue snack bag from the middle that was always forgotten the film is continually referring to and making fun of other projects like green lantern in the dialogue the chemistry between ryan and morena was palpable if there was no actual spark offscreen yes i know they are both married to other people then extra kudos to their acting it looks like this might finally be the vehicle that ryan reynolds can have a genuine success with the man has been in a lot of films and most of them ended up through no fault of his being big budget awful hes a good actor and very talented just bad luck that they have been less than good films other excellent actors like eric bana and edward norton could not save the hulk movies so this is hardly something new ryan is an actor that just comes across as a guy that you really want to like and its sad that it took this long for him to find a film that lets him succeed as to another co star tj miller talks and looks way too much like ryan reynolds in this to the point where i thought it was him playing a dual role so in summary if you can handle rapidfire wisecracks violence action and strong language this will be sure to keep you entertained as with many films these days watch through all the credits for an easter egg at the end if you get the blu ray or dvd the extra scenes are fantastic and funny too,comedy
another marvel masterclass and hopefully many sequels to come from a true comic main character reynolds plays the role perfect not almost perfect but just perfecti would have l loved more of a background story on wades past people will argue that xmen pullverine origins covered this already that he was an awesome mercenary but that character seems to have been voided from the marvel world and a new fresh comical vigilante appearsonly con in the film was that if you had already watched the trailer more than twothree times youve seen a fair bit of the funny bits of the movie already but most of your time through the film the scenes just laugh out loud,comedy

ever since the abomination that was xmen origins  wolverine fans have been dying to see a true and honest adaptation of the super vulgar megaviolent merc with a mouth aka and thanks to a fortunate leak of test footage in july of 2014 the day finally came much to the delight of myself and fans around the world simply put there couldnt have been a better more faithful and more entertaining film put on screen is one of a kindthere are many things that make well and each and every one of those things are alive and well in the film pervasive language check overthetop gory violence check breaking the fourth wall absolutely perfect costume excessive sexual content and the greatest if most mature sense of humor in all of superhero history check check check and check the undeniable dedication of source material from the films writers and director tim miller is felt heavily in the movie and theres nothing that the comic book faithful wanted more watching and his alter ego wade wilson swear like no tomorrow crack countless jokes pertaining to other superhero movies among other hilarious subjects and plow through bad guys with studious amounts of gore is down right fun to watch leaving me with a smile on my face the entire time the camera was rolling the character of himself is arguably the greatest adaptation of any superhero or antihero if you see it that way in cinema history a testament to the unrelenting passion of the superhero genre fan base fox may have destroyed the fantastic four but could not have been brought to life in a more absolutely perfect waynow the man behind the mask outside of maybe robert downey jr as iron man and hugh jackman as wolverine ryan reynolds has proved to be one of the greatest castings for a comic book hero ever reynolds pushed for this film ever since his first portrayal of in the aforementioned pile of garbage that was origins  wolverine wanting more than anything to properly display the character without a sewed up mouth the marketing campaign for the film alone cemented reynolds into this role for as long as hed like with every ounce of character played spot on by the man who once played green lantern which he jokes about in the film he delivers his lines perfectly acts like the total nut job that is makes you laugh out loud and also is able to pull at your hearts strings occasionally few actors can so closely resemble their comic book character and ryan reynolds as wade wilsonis one of those actors the plot was as good as it needed to be diving into origins through flashbacks showing how wade wilson transformed into the wise cracking mercenary while maintaining the action and humor that the movie is all about along with reynolds supporting actors morena baccarin vanessa tj miller weasel stefan kapicic colossus and antagonist ed skrein ajax all provide great support to the film whether its weasels comedic relief to an actioncomedy vanessas love interest colossuss wonderful action or the awesome villain that is ajax the cast is great and helps reynolds along the way of dominating the screenis easily the most raunchy hilarious and mature rated character in marvels roster a character few ever thought would receive the film he deserved not only did he get his movie but its an instant classic the attention to detail in the characters source material perfectly showcasing the extremities of lead the way for ryan reynolds to own the role of wade wilsonand wildly entertain from the opening credits literally to after the credits role literally is a love letter to the fans and what once was a strong cult following has turned into a global phenomenon reserves its right as one of the best comic book films of all time 1010,comedy
honestly they completely missed the whole appeal to yes he was a merc with a mouth and yes he continually mouths off and breaks the 4th wall for maximum effect not every 2 seconds like this flick does to all those people complaining about his constant chatter and dick and fart jokes ruining the movie well i bet youre the same people that complained lord of the rings movies ran longthe real appeal to dp is that he never actually wins yeah he kills the bad guygal but in the end he always realizes that nothing has changed and his life is still sh despite the fact hes done everything rightwhen he gets the girl and has a happy ending you know some focus group somewhere had way to much say in the script,comedy
hey everyone its connor once again i have officially seen three times in my honest opinion is one of my top 5 favorite marvel films of alltimeryan reynolds redeems his superhero status and then knocks it out of the park playing the merc with the mouth his performance is both timeless and outrageously hilariousmorena baccarin is great as wades love interest vanessa as she captures the kinky funny girlfriend scheme perfectlythe film touches on all aspects that i wanted to see action sadness romance redemption and pure badasserythe music in this film also is awesome from juice newton to chicago to wham it gives the film a ironic yet fitting feelthe only aspect that i can pick out that the film lacks is the budget setbacks these are extremely minor and you cannot tell but i can see the little details and the funny thing is the film jabs that toois unlike any comic book movie ever made because it gives us a giant superhero middle finger stereotype movie but with its own fresh concept that is flourishing in the box officeoverall i loved this movie i give a solid 910 highly recommend this movie to anyoneover the age of 13 at least,comedy
now you may be wondering why someone who saw this awesome movie opening weekend is writing a review now the very simple answer batman v superman sucked i wrote a bad review for it and it made me want to praise a recent comic book movie that didnt suckever since that abomination they called in xmen origins wolverine i became a pretty big fan of the real i own and have read the entire  cable series and the merc with a mouth series and absolutely love them i will admit when this movie was announced i didnt know much about early 90s which is what the movie was based on but i did know himselfnow for the review this movie was perfect from the opening credits all the way to the ending credits they made me laugh they were creative and its even funnier if you know how the opening credits came to be look it up i dont watch comedies very often but how i judge them is simple how much time out of the movie do i spend laughing my  off in the answer is the whole timebetween breaking the fourth wall pop culture references and references to other movies both marvel movies  ryan reynolds movies the only way you cannot laugh is if you have no sense of humor or a clean one which is boringas for the story it is origin story long story short wade wilson gets cancer hes made an offer he cant refuse well he does at first and in curing his cancer he becomes horribly disfigured he then goes on a revenge mission to kill francisajax he doesnt like the name francis my only real complaint to the story was much like ironman 3 it jumped around a lotwasnt chronological thats just a personal pet peeve though probably wont bother everyonethe characters  the mercwithamouth out for revenge vanessa  wades girlfriendfuture babymama weasel  bffweapons dealerintel guy colossus  the big cgi metal guy from the xmen negasonic teenage warhead  the moody teenxmen protegee francisajax  british villain who turns wade into an abomination angel dust  francis righthand woman who does most of his dirty worksummary the movie plays out in such a way that it will please action fans comedy fans comic fans and honestly probably anyone with a messedup sense of humor if youre okay with swearing inappropriate jokes sex and lots of blood this is the movie for you if not well then thats too bad youre missing outfinal verdict i would give a full 1010 instead of 910 if not for these 2 things 1 the nonchronological story like i said just a personal pet peeve 2 i saw it opening weekend as well as the following weekend and it wasnt as funny the second time im not saying it want awesome a second time im just saying that when i buy it on bluray i cant watch it too oftensoon i gotta leave some time inbetween viewings so the jokes arent fresh in my mindgo see this movie and buy it when it comes out it deserves every penny its made good job foxmarvel,comedy
i am happy to say that is an okay movie it ranks alongside an adequate school play  or a good musician in the park  or a mcdonalds cheeseburger it satisfies your hunger for 90 minutes and is almost instantly forgotten a lot has been said about sex violence and profanity giving it an rrating and making it unsuitable for kids i agree that kids shouldnt see the movie but not because it will haunt their dreams or corrupt their morality the action is so cartoonish in one sequence in fact cartoons actually appear on screen that it can only be taken with a grain of salt ryan reynolds performance reminds one of jim carrey circa liar liar hyper snarky sarcastic and overplayed to the hilt reynolds breaks the fourth wall early and often  at one point when told that looks arent everything he replies yes they are do you think ryan reynolds has had a career based on his acting ability in another fourth wallbreaker he notices that there are only two xmen characters at the huge xmen mansion leading him to say youd think the studio could spring for a few more xmen  reynolds has fun with the character and does make it his own morena baccarin is very appealing love interest and the two xmen counterparts are adequate of course this is a marvel albeit fox film so there is the wiseass sidekick named weasel here played by tj miller and in other recent marvel projects played by elden henson netflixs daredevil michael pena antman ty simpkins iron man 3 kat dennings thor  thor 2 marvels writers have obviously locked the stock wiseass sidekick into their word processors and wont let go of them at least millers variation isnt quite as annoying as hensons which caused me to scuttle daredevil after less than a halfhour the villains are pretty standardissue ed skrein appears with no backstory no motivation and lacking only a pitchfork and pointy tail to tell us that hes the superevil bad guy his character like cannot be harmed in any permanent way making them a pair of terminators duking it out until one can figure out the secret formula i figured that had to go highlanderstyle and cut off his head hence the swords to kill him but apparently not is an amusing exercise but lacks the memorability of the best comic book films after seeing the dark knight rises i literally hummed the bane theme deshi basara for two weeks i remembered the epic handtohand battle in gotham with everything at stake the army of cops vs the army of villains after batman begins i couldnt wait to tell friends about the amazing cast the new batmobiletumbler and pictured the great scenes over and over avengers had moments that brought down the house when hulk smashed loki and uttered puny god or when he punched thor right out of the frame great comic book movies leave a taste in your mouth for weeks to come you go back and revisit them over and over doesnt offer these things theres no score of note pardon the pun or songs to remember no set pieces to memorize no toys to run out and buy its simply 90 minutes of motion with an occasional chuckle it was like watching my kids play soccer  it was fun and made me grin but now that its over  whats for dinner doesnt aspire to greatness but satisfies just enough to make it a mild diversion,comedy
i love science fiction movies already and this movie is very funnywit and sense of humor was a good movie single bad side open there were scenes this film will be followed mostly children superhero for that film and it will be a bad example the film came to me a short time had a longer time it would be nice and theres something i wondered producers would be nice if the explanation does this film will be more xman or did join the team avengers did or will be second i have a problem why i can not write turkish comments i dont know do you read my writing i have my superhero story scenario i want to make movies but i have no money anyway no one cares,comedy
there is no other hero like created and invented in 1991 by rob liefeld and fabian nicieza from marvel comics character had fast become on of the most memorable heroes of this universe his unique and vulgar sense of humor with his awareness of being just the comic figure made him favorite marvel mutant for many readers however the reasons of success of the comic novels was also the causes of reluctance of creating the movie based on them nowadays when you cant find much blood or brutal violence in superhero scores and there is no single imprecation in them its hard to believe that the movie like could succeed in any way especially if it was rated as restricted on the cinemas repertoires how movie about mutant would earn big money without young viewers its impossible right right fortunetly fox have taken the risk to find out about thatall of the superhero franchises always have the same problem screenwriters can not dare to show as something new and original so we get the next stories like lets save the world guys we love such movies but to be honest  we have been a little tired with new productions like avengers age of ultron or fantastic four we needed something fresh something absolutely new film with new conceptions in showing the story and thats how we get deadpooldirected by not well known tim miller movie doesnt even much care about the plot itself because it isnt so necessary in this case its just the origin story connected with romance in order to release the movie during the valentine weekend of course the fact that film is quite short it takes less than two hours to hit to the end credits can make you sure that you wont fell boring at any moment every single scene is full of ribald jokes gallows humor and untypical marvel eastereggs breaks the fourth wall to the ground humiliate hugh jackam like he was his favorite villainhe even humiliate himself who could stop him from doing that who would daremillers score is one of the best comic adaptations of all the time it doesnt only fit to original stories perfectly but also show them from the new perspective its also a great evidence that superhero kind movies do not have to be imitative predictable and based mostly on the same ideas although the plot in may seems to be chaotic screenwriters rhett reese and paul wernick they both have worked on 2009s zombieland have made a impressive work by connecting black comedy with love story and also xmen franchise and its really crazy mixture but its the movie about our lovely  it has to be insanewouldnt have happened without insistent efforts of ryan reynolds almost forty actor wanted to produce the film about dressed in red mutant since xmen origins wolverine where he played wade wilson in a verystrange way with sewed up mouth and extralong adamantium blades hes been trying to convinced 20th century fox for almost six years to shoot single movie he believed that he was born to take this role now we can see that he was right movie belongs to him at all he doesnt have to play he is he literally invented him created him and brought him to live on the big screen altought most of the cast are very talented personalities no one of them is able to have any match for reynolds he steals the whole show so pity that two of three main actress  gina carano and brianna hildebrand  dont even try to be so aspiringim curious what have thought the producers after first opening weekend how have they reacted they havent believed in the success of the movie they used to be sure that such kind of production directed only to adult viewers can not earn big money i hope that theyre still shocked is a proof that you dont need two hundred million dollars to create great superhero franchise all what its going to take is a brave decision to create something special something different than typical film using adored character played by actor with passion to do that and thats all,comedy
i loved this so much i thought it was fun exciting adventurous emotional dirty and so much more i would definitely see this movie again and look forward to seeing the second one that is in preproduction and is supposed to come out in 2017 im so glad its still doing well in the theaters and hope it continues to break records if you havent seen it go now while watching the movie i will say that it is not one to bring your kids too yes its a marvel movie but it doesnt have much to do with the wholesome heroes were used to with marvel the humor is crude and there is much adult language however its definitely one for the books dont hesitate to go see it today,comedy
i am a fan of the marvel universe but honestly was never my favorite character more and more recent blockbuster filmography is becoming something a friend of mine calls a product that movie was one big joke with the audience and its intrinsic property of influencing or contaminating the one next to you it illustrated what we usually witness around elections and how you can pump up mediocrity ryan reynolds did his best to save the movie from itself being both a hero and a hooligan humor seemed so insipid and worn off to the point it was probably boring even at the time the comic book came out i guess that contributed to the persona he was meant to be annoying and he really was the thing that really struck me was the brilliant drama that was very cleverly hinted it never reached a tipping point and that left me with the impression of a real potential i sympathized with wade and his childish cynicism as who despite being invincible was fragile and disgusted with the way his life ultimately turned out to be i really hope there will be no second movie because it will surely lack the drama and will be stripped off its controversy it is interesting how sometimes bad movies uncover the real potential and talent of the lead actors,comedy
this movie is super hysterical a need be to see for everyone 17 do not bring children to this movie for there are a lot of graphic scenes laughed extremely hard had to excuse myself to go to the bathroom about a hour into the movie marvel fans rejoice at the greatest acting ryan reynolds has done in a very long time comic book fans of can appreciate this work especially for the use of making mentions of his other works hopefully in the next movie we see some fun with cable and hopefully more colossus too maybe get some of the other xmen like wolverine to be a part in the movie too only thing i wish to see in the future is vanessa becoming lady death,comedy
first off i knew very little about before going into this movie part because im not big into comics and also to avoid any spoilers as i was admittedly caught up in the hype i dont even like ryan reynolds most of the time but hes on another level in this the serious parts he plays incredibly well pulling the audience on the team bleachers by the end of the film every joke hit with roaring laughter at the screening i attended and the fun was entirely infectious this is the kind of movie my generation wants to see terrifying yet hilarious crude but smart and oh so deliciously gory the fact that it sits with over 810 but at a 65 currently on the professional critics scale shows how far from relevant these peoples opinions are bring on 2 raise a statue in his honor and lets all enjoy life a little,comedy
i usually see heroes movies and get disappointed because there is a lack of shades of grey oh not the 50 shades of crap please that human nature must transit in life and the choices we make we are not perfect or heroes those movies around doesnt show a moral for us but perfection we want to be and is nice to see for a little while and it is entertaining but are for kids not for me i am not a kid but gave me what i need it a movie with grey and human nature and stupids decisions that lead to something bigger and some times horrible twisted deep consequences and a road to dark places a movie with a hero for me and not for kids that is what suppose to be x men is one of my favorite series in comic but a lot of the reality seen in the series is totally lost in the adaptation and it is a comic for adults i know there is the comic for and ive told that the series is far much better and only for see this movie i want to read it i was told that critics have praised ryan reynolds performance and i must agree the whole cast specially morena baccarin whom i admire since firefly did a great job but ryan was excellent and i am just so pleased the script is amazing it never stopped it caught me since the very beginning action laugh some nudes and sex all in one pack and of course our heroes in costume and cool fights i wish i would see this in wolverine finishing this is my second 1010 in reviews and i couldnt be happier for it this is a film for not all people but those who appreciate what we are and all of our choices in life this is for adults who need a hero in costume thats a plus at least for me greetings,comedy
after fox screwed up the beloved in xmen origins wolverine fans wanted the character done justice the right way and in 2016 fox delivered is a fun superhero movie that tries hard not to be a conventional superhero movie does it succeed somewhatwhy i felt the film was fun and decent but not great was that it focused so much on being an rrated superhero comedy movie that it fell short on being a really good superhero comedy movie see my other ratings on the marvel and dc films satirizes the pg13 conventional superhero film that has nottooviolent action sequences minimal swearing and little to no nudity and basically overloads on everything that can possibly make the movie rrated the plot was minimal at best and doesnt expand on the xmen universe or storyline because the film wanted to focus on and his rrated antics the film has its emotional moments but the comedic gist of this film overshadows everything and makes those moments a bit harder to soak in and absorb than any other superhero movie wouldthe comedy for me was hit and miss there were sequences and metajokes that broke the fourth wall that i thought were hilarious and perfectly written and delivered they were jokes that would please any fan who would speculate and imagine the perfect movie there were also sequences that fell rather dull sometimes jokes were funny but not that funny it depends on your sense of humor of course if you love xmen and dirty raunchy humor youll love this movie if raunchy humor isnt for you youll still find the movie funny the comedy writing seems to cover all sorts of genres when it comes to humor and as a result can fall flat at certain times while hit well at othersfans of will probably love this movie fans of superhero films might love it but might also feel like something is missing with the writing,comedy
not a terrible movie but after all the hype i was pretty disappointed really i was expecting something at a higher standard than say the avengers but thats unfortunately about as good as it was could have missed this one thats not to say it has absolutely no redeeming qualities the action scenes for one thing werent terrible but even still they may have been a little too cgi there werent many interesting plot developments so it was hard to stay captivated and by the end of it i felt like i had just wasted the past 2 hours or so of my life i would recommend spending the 2 hours of your life that you would spend watching this movie on something more useful like making a meal that youve never made before or going for a run if you are thinking about watching this because of the hype just know that youre not really missing out on much,comedy
absolutely hilarious ive no idea what stuck up self righteous pricks insist on giving this movie a 1 lololdoes it have nudity oh yeah does it have brutal violence definitelydoes it have its fair share of toilet humor wouldnt be without itdoes george michael approve this movie well yes he does is it one of the best damn superhero movies ever you betcha props to ryan reynolds and tim miller for this movie  i had a blast watching it,comedy
normally i am not overly keen on superhero movies but all that i know who have seen has been overly excited and thrilled about it so i decided to cave in an give it a go and check if it really was as fun and entertaining as everyone said it wasand they were right wow is a fantastic combination of action comedy satire and spoofs the story in the movie is fairly straight forward actually bordering on being generic but it was the sly remarks the physical comedy of the wadecharacter that really made the movie work out so nicely and ryan reynolds despite already having played other superhero roles really was nicely cast for the characterthe audience is thrown into the fray right from the very beginning and the movie kicks up into an impressive gear and high speed from the very start and it never slows downthe cast in were doing some good jobs with their given roles and characters and i must admit that i was more than genuinely impressed with what ryan reynolds playing wade  managed to deliver with his part in this movie but also morena baccarin playing vanessa really brought something good to the movie with her skills and onscreen charisma and tj miller really had a great part in the movie despite it not being a prominent characterthere is a lot of action throughout the course of which was really well choreographed and equally well executedi will say that is without a doubt the best superhero movie that i have ever seen and it is definitely well worth watching even if you like me am not a particular fan of superhero movies manages to score a rocksolid eight out of ten stars from me,comedy
im so glad that ryan and dc parted ways though i liked gl i loved mr pool ive been enamored of morena baccarin since i first saw her appear in firefly perhaps my favorite series ever and perhaps the most beautiful sweet and funny actress ive ever seenbefore the movie even started i knew it would be a favorite if not the asshats aside the opening was brilliant previewing the fun to come in one of the most creative ways ive ever seenthe interactions of the two stars were magical and truly believable and this ride took me through my full range of emotions as most movies only dream they could doi knew nothing of before seeing this as i was a dc comic fan as a child which may have been why i loved this movie so much something new for a change marvel has blown dc completely out of the water since they started their new universe with the newest hulk in 2008 xmen was barely passable well until s v b which i loved almost as much as this keep it up marvel and get to work on this sequel,comedy
this movie knocked me of my socks the jokes were running like a landslide without leaving you air to breath from the start of the film i knew i was in a big fun ride without a steering wheel the editing and the pacing were excellent and was one of the major reasons that make this movie shine the chemistry between ryan reynolds and tj miller was hilarious and the cab driver scene with karan soni was awesome and all those one liners made this movie become nostalgic for all those actioncomedies of the 80s in my this movie should be use as a milestone from the filming industry to listen more to the people for what they want to see a big bravo from me and these kind movie will keep on coming,comedy
i want to start by saying i normally enjoy super hero movies in general apart from batman vs supermanand with all the glowing reviews and exciting trailers i was really looking forward to thiswatched this with my wife and after 30 min we were looking at each other and thinking the same what are we watching for a start any movie that has the actor talking to the camera is off to a bad start and this just got worse it was being crude just for the sake of it and trying way to hard to be funny when it wasnt the action scenes were well done and so were the fights and special effects which is why i gave it a 5 otherwise it would have been much lowershame super hero movies seem to be heading downhill like they have no ideas left and this was surly scraping the bottom of the barrel to jump on the super hero money making bandwagon,comedy
i was very curious about and eagerly awaiting to see this film as the reviews about this one were overly positive despite some criticism left and right well i can tell you right of the bat this movie is fracking awesome so the naysayers were dead wrong pun intended it was a very bold move putting the same actor who played a much despised version of in xmen origins in a completely different movie but they play it very smart is a smartmouth character and says basically everything what he and the audience is thinking this makes for some very good jokes and the humor though some might call it crude or a bit offensive is just excellent and works great as terrible as reynolds was in origins here he embodies the character perfectly the script is written very well and the director a director and creative producer for cgi shortfilms and cinematics at blur studios clearly understands the material and has knack for bringing it to the screen in the right way you could say this is the antisuperhero superhero movie after all the straight superhero flicks of which we might have seen too many this is a fresh breeze and welcome addition to the genre so if you see one superhero movie this year see if you are sick of or hate superhero movies this is also right up your alley very highly recommended,comedy
is the coolest film ive ever seen it breaks all the boundaries of politically correct film as it delivers its raunchy humour overthetop violence and extreme profanity in the most hilarious way possible ryan reynolds is the star of the show and with very good reason his portrayal of is what would happen if ryan reynolds twitter account was its own personthis film is in no way shape or form suitable for anyone under the given certificate in the uk it is a 15 this seems really laidback to me and so if youre thinking of taking your 15 year old to see this think twice  or three times  or 100 times,comedy
is a breath of fresh air to the genre of comicbook movies its one of the few rrated marvel films apart from the blade trilogy that pushes the limit of violent action and breaks the fourth wall1 ryan reynolds was born to play the merc with a mouth not just the fact that hes also canadian with his natural humorous charm and his always in shape physique he is the focal point to everything even when the movie hits its lows at times casting anyone else would be a huge injustice to the character of wade wilson2 ryan has a decent amount of chemistry with his love interest in the film vanessa morena baccarin although you dont get much of them together for a majority of the film things are balanced just right between them seeing as this is mainly a superhero flick and not a wholehearted lovestory which the filmmakers are fully aware of3 the effects are surprisingly good especially on the mutant colossus for a film on a modest 30 million dollar budget most of the stunts and fight scenes are practical until the third act where the cgi tricks are pulled out of the bag and into the mix the only thing thats animated about aside from his personality are his eyes if you look closelyyoull notice4 taking into consideration the events of xmen days of future past youll clearly know that the future our present has been reset so storyline in this film doesnt follow his traditional product of wolverineweaponx experimentation the one main thing that carries over from his comicbook adaption is the fact that hes dying from stage4 cancer this doesnt at all hurt the film despite what hardcore comicbook geeks may think the fact that wade is betrayed and experimented on to the point where his mutation is triggered through stress desperation and sheer torture makes you feel more sympathy for a character like deadpool5 ed skrein plays ajax sworn enemy and tormentor another selfexperimented mutant whos abilities garner him superhuman strength and invulnerability to pain hes an interesting addition and opposition of yet he feels more one dimensional than anything else only there to serve the purpose of acting and looking menacing until his final showdown with at the films climax gina carano angel dust plays ajaxs partnersidekick who carries the same mutant powers as he minus the severed nerve endings she has little to do and barely any dialogue but just to aid ajax in the final battle and take on colossus6 tj miller and some other side characters fill out the rest of the comedic cast that add to the graphic humor his character of weasel fits in well and plays off ryan naturally whenever they interact take it this film is not for everyone its super violent super bloody and super awesome not a good idea to take your kids to see this cause i cant stress enough that isnt your average superhero flick a sequel is undoubtedly on its way and needless to say i only have three word in response to that bring it on,comedy
for years marvel have released films that are aimed at either kids or big kids its weird that we finally have an adult marvel film first of all let me say that the usual juvenile marvel humour we all know and love isnt lost on this film but it has all the sex and violence of an adult film ryan reynolds is much more at home then in the green lantern film that flopped 5 years ago his performance is complimented brilliantly by the breaking down of the fourth wall i was sceptical of a super hero that spoke directly to the audience but something about it just works is one of the best films marvel have released in recent years and yet another example of why marvel are leaps and bounds ahead of dc while dc rely heavily on batman and superman marvel just seem to throw up more and more great super heros straight from the comic books perhaps the two reasons i gave the film an 8 and not a 10 are as follows 1 i would have liked to see better additional characters as i felt was the only enjoyable character 2 it was very obvious that this was a start up film for a much longer story perhaps the sequel will offer more in the way of an epic battle between and an iconic villainall in all the film was a credit to marvels great run of form perhaps one upping ant man which was also a very impressive film,comedy
following on from his brief and unpleasant appearance in xmen origins wolverine has been given a new lease of life on the big screen with his first solo film the merc with a mouth may have had it sewn shut in his previous outing but fox have finally delivered the film that fans have been crying out for making up for their past mistakes in the process in a market oversaturated with superhero films its clear from the moment the hilarious opening title sequence begins that is a breath of fresh air in the genre this is his film hes going to do things his waymake no mistake this could have gone very wrong with a director whose previous experience exists only in fx work and the same actor that portrayed the character in the godawful xmen origins first feature film could have been a disaster thankfully both tim miller and ryan reynolds hold a special place in their heart for the wisecracking antihero and this is evident from the minute the film starts right until the postcredits scene fades to black miller proves himself to be a more than capable director ensuring his action set pieces are stylish brutal and easy to follow the opening battle on a detroit freeway is like a freight train crashing through a ballet theatre each of movements being executed almost gracefully as he plows his way through a team of hired guns elsewhere the appearance of the xmens colossus and negasonic teenage warhead leads to a final showdown which is thrilling to watch at it escalates to levels of destruction which rival some of the studios bigger productions with many action directors choosing to take the michael bay approach when it comes to putting together a fight sequence its nice to see miller place so much focus on his characters during these scenes of ultimate destruction ensuring they are never lost in the mayhem its not just the action sequences which pay off either the romantic subplot  over the top sex montage and all  is handled with care and no matter how ridiculous some scenes may be the relationship between wade and girlfriend vanessa have a lot of hearteven with solid directing however could still have failed if the casting wasnt up to scratch but thankfully reynolds is on fine form throughout bringing every aspect of the character that fans know and love to life having strongly campaigned for the film to receive the green light from fox reynolds brings all of his energy as an actor to the role in order for it to succeed his love for the character shines through each scene as he quips his way through fight sequences and delivers not so tongueincheek references to bryan singers xmen franchise  amongst other things proving that no matter how much of a disaster xmen origins was he was born to play the supporting cast also impress with ed skrein seeming to enjoy playing typical british villain ajax tj miller managing to provide plenty of laughs as friend weasel and morena baccarin matching the energy that reynolds brings to each scene its also impressive how faithful to the comic books this version of colossus is compared to any of his previous appearances in the xmen films the characters good nature and kind heart being showcased in many scenes he features in daniel cudmore is replaced by andre tricoteux who performs motion capture which ensures the mutants organic steel frame is physically imposing while serbian actor stefan kapii provides the characters voice in what is at least an attempt to honour the russian giants nationality even more impressive however is the strength of the script that miller and reynolds had to work with while many superhero films are bogged down by excessive run times and moments of tranquillity which are often dull is fast paced and simple mixing an origin story in with a wholly recognised version of the character while never taking its foot off the brakes its because of this the films weaker moments can be forgiven because no matter what flaws it may have each scene feels necessary to the simple story being told which involves tracking down his torturers and saving his girlfriendas mentioned there are flaws to be found one well known aspect of is his ability to break the fourth wall and though its effectively used in some scenes there are several in which it does not at one point breaks the fourth wall in a flashback while breaking the fourth wall to recap the story and this is one example of the concept being used too often in order to try and gain laughs similarly while many of the jokes within the film are genuinely funny there is an overabundance of them at times leading to several of them falling flat nevertheless jokes and quips are a staple of the character and even those that fail to land seem much more natural than some of those that appeared in last years avengers age of ultronwith miller reynolds and co have managed to craft an extremely fun and thrilling addition to the superhero genre it may not have the budget of the films within the mcu or the upcoming dceu but it certainly makes up for it thanks to strong direction great casting and a simple yet effective script if you like your superhero films to be violent and filled with crude humour this is one you simply cannot miss,comedy
2016 is a movie that is 10 years in the making and it was worth the wait unlike other superhero movies of this nature is unique in the way that it was able to hold its own despite having an enormous weight of expectation placed upon it did not crumble under this pressure and i can honestly say that i can happily go through the rest of 2016 knowing that was a complete success in every sense of the word not only was use of breaking the fourth wall executed perfectly it was done in just the right amount the ratedr style of comedy and violence could not have worked better in any other movie and it is safe to say that ryan reynolds is as much as he is himself my only negative opinion on the movie is that it did not contain as many fight scenes or fight scenes of large scale that i would have liked but in retrospect it did not harm the overall experience of the filmthanks for reading,comedy
witty writing best adaption from marvel comicsi was laughing from the opening credits itself that is seriously brilliant writing  madness suggest you to watch it in big screen preferrably in imax because you will see more blood in bigger details wink emoticon entire film has humor coefficientwhich is really adorable ryan renolds is just awesome even though disfigured great sense of humor in heros characterization is perfectly suited for the film fun is the word you would describe this film actually these kinda films doesnt need reviews they should just go on movie may be rrated but it is worth watching overall the movie lives up to the hypechirureviews ryan reynolds marvelcomics deadpool,comedy
from the witty one liners to the gory death scenes is a movie that proves that comic book movies are still a must see this movie not only redeems the character of from the not so impressive xmen origins wolverine movie it also introduces new characters like negasonic teenage warhead played by brianna hidebrand and weasel played by tj millerfrom the minute i saw the opening credits i knew this movie wasnt going to be the typical superhero movie the fact that the opening credits didnt actually credit anyone shows that this movie will be different first of all the movie is structured differently compared to other superhero movies normally you have the origin story then a problem of some sort followed by a solution and ending on the big finale this movie starts off introducing character but then almost immediately goes straight to a fight between the main characters with the origin story being shown in flashbacks the movie constantly jumps between past and present which is a unique way of telling a story but still manages to work another thing that makes this movie different is that this is more of an anti hero movie then a superhero movie yes fights bad guys but the fact that he kills all his enemies with extreme overkill suggests he is more anti hero then superherothis movie does a lot of things that are good if you like blood and gore then you will find the fight scenes very appealing there are some clever jokes and a lot of references to other movies outside the marvel universe ryan reynolds was the perfect actor to play if youre not a fan of you will be after watching this movie and if youre already a fan of then i can confidently say you will not be disappointed the only real problems i have is that some of the visual effects look unrealistic but thats only because this isnt a big budget movie also the movie is short for a superhero movie being only 1 hour 48 minutes long they should have made the movie at least 2 hours long,comedy
the basic story of is in no way special  superhero against villains etc but despite the typical superherowayoflife is one of the movies in the superhero vs villain cosmos that i really like a lot and will recommend with full heart for watching first top ingredient  humor black one for adults not for kids not only the violence but also the talking makes a flick for a more mature audience kids wont understand half of the jokes  fortunately one could say  on top i didnt see many movies where watching killing and the context how the killings are done is so much fun  even if its not pc  overlaying everything there is always the vibe of not taking itself too serious which i guess i like so much on the otherhand the action scenes show far more hard stuff as the typical marveldc movie even some gore what more to say fortunatly the directorwriters dared to do things different with also ryan reynolds is just a perfect match as a movie with a similar approachmixture of humor and violence i remember is kingsman the secret service also a superb flick so if there would be a presidential election in the superheroworld i would work for the campaign for mr  so theres just one choice for president,comedy
is one of the best films so far of 2016 and one of the best superhero films since the dark knight rises the marketing for this film is some of the best but i was worried that the film wouldnt live up to the hype so i went into this film with low expectations when i came out of the film i loved this movie ryan reynolds was born to play and he gave one of his best performances of his career the film is directed very well from first time director tim miller i honestly thought there would be shaky camera action but i was wrong the action is quick fast and very brutal one of the best things for this movie is the writing the movie is very funny and its one of the best comedies that came out in recent year i do agree with the film being r rated because it fits with the character and if this film was pg13 it wouldnt be good and the film would hardly have a story to tell and i do hope they start to make more superhero films r rated overall if your a fan of this movie is for you and even if your not a fan of him or superhero films this is still a great movie to check out,comedy
this time it was my husband who can appreciate the de stressing and entertainment value of a numbing unintelligent b or even c flick now and again who said well im done please turn this off about 15 to 20 minutes in what a load of crp,comedy
theres a lot of 1s that walked into the wrong movie,comedy
if it wasnt for ryan reynolds i would have probably turned this off not only does he deliver a fantastic performance as the smooth talking slice and dicing mercenary but he portrays one of the most beloved characters in the marvel industry a fast moving one of a kind soldier of fortune who is dishonourably discharged from the special forces to becoming part of the sister margarets school for wayward girls on behalf of humanity he or his cohorts can be contracted to do in criminals as they see fit for a price yet he is more of a big brother than killer for those who pay a fee only to be discounted because of his giving natureduring his momentous flirtation against evil he learns he has full body cancer for which there is no cure paired up with a woman he had met previously at the school they become an item that has to endure the hardships of trying to find said cure in order for them both to live normal lives when he is confronted by a shady man dressed in black wade reynolds is told his infliction can be eradicated and even improved with powers of his own conflicted daily he takes the leap into the underworld of ajax his nemesis who turns his body into an immortal shell wade no longer has cancer but his anatomy can also eliminate any other disease even deathbrutally grotesque from a side effect wade then goes on a crusade to finding his benefactor so he can be turned back to normal but through out his days wade becomes increasingly irritated because ajax slips through the cracks with every job with every thug and with a friendly cab driver named dalpinder wade keeps his sanity by the use of crude humour which to me made this film what it is today a romp of ultra violence with breath taking action from beginning to end and on top of that uses eighties music to top it off like a cherryto me is brilliant turn of thrill where a person can laugh their butts off while watching a cool character turn a city into a viable roller coaster ride without the protective safety harness story plot theme as well as originality gave this film ten stars for its remarkable sequences of spills chills and down right brutality its not often a movie of this calibre can equal to some of the more high end block busters like xmen or avengers even though is on his own by his code of honour wade wilson will live on as the most influential character to our daily lives for its wit cathartic players and the odds and ends of side spin actors who helped in creating a one of a kind heroit is a wonderful addition to my library where i can watch it again and again until the next instalment comes out next year from what i heard it is just as loud violent and crazy funny as the first film highly recommended to all hero fans all over the world young and old although for the young ages of seventeen and up is appropriate,comedy
it might sound clich now because the market is being flooded with the character but has been my favorite comic character for a while ive wanted the merc with the mouth to get his own big screen movie for years thinking ryan reynolds would be perfect for the role since his performance in blade trinity as wisecracking hannibal king i was excited for reynolds to assume the role of wade wilson in x men origins wolverine and devastated when the character was mutilated by the studio id come to accept the fact that wed probably never see a true cinema incarnation and lo and behold reynolds and crew come through in 2016 wasnt just a fun relatively faithful adaptation of my favorite marvel character but a much needed break from comic book movie routine with the films proud embracing of the rrating and utilization of the comic tropes wed come to expect but assumed studios would nix for being too weird for general audiences in an effort to reeducate the unknowing masses serves as an origin film explaining to those unfamiliar how came to be horribly scarred certifiably crazy and essentially immortal wade wilson reynolds is a mercenary for hire who shortly after finding his soul mate in equally damaged working girl vanessa morena baccarin is diagnosed with terminal cancer with limited options he turns to the mysterious ajax ed skrein who claims he can heal wilson of his disease and an antihero is borngets a lot of things right and a few things well not so much wrong as poorly handled dont get me wrong i thoroughly enjoy this movie and im psyched at the level of success this little comic book movie that couldnt has achieved it was a stroke of luck that the movie ever saw production and the love of audiences to the tune of almost 800 billion in worldwide gross box office all but guarantees we wont have to fight so long to see the continuing adventures reynolds is exactly as perfect for the role as wed all known he would be he gets the character and truly brings him to life with all the wisecracks juvenile humor and bloody violence wed hoped to see the costume is fantastic staying incredibly faithful to the comics and even giving his mask expressive eyes to bring it to life i also loved the inclusion of tj miller to the cast as buddy weasel ive been a fan of miller for a little while and figured his absurd brand of improvised comedy would be an apt fit in the world of the two of them ensure that is just as much a comedy as it is an action movie which is exactly as it should be doesnt bring the senses of dread or stoic heroism that comes with the usual xmen film in our hero puts bullets in brainpans and turns violence into insane performance artis of course a character from the xmen universe and as a result we get a couple of cameos to establish this as to which xmen cinematic universe were rooted in it confuses even himself mcavoy or stewart these timelines can get so confusing but hes given the chance to fight alongside fanfavorite and criminallyunderused colossus and his current mutant trainee negasonic teenage warhead brianna hildebrand these two act as the straightedged voices of reason to fourthwallbreaking craziness in his search for revenge against ajax i loved both of them especially negasonic we dont get much out of her character but her angsty teenage persona sets up for some fun punchlines and her explosive powers come in handy during the final battle colossus is here to give valuable life lessons to in hopes of swaying him to the forces of good i enjoyed the oddcouple pairing of colossus and but i imagine well get better banter in the sequel where the end credits coda promises well be introduced togo watch for yourself no spoilers here but it should be obvious to fans meanwhile colossus serves the role well even if he is comically preachy in his heroic speeches i love that we finally get an accurate onscreen portrayal huge muscular and russian but the cg wasnt always the greatest its easily forgiven and still pretty impressive considering the limited budget it makes one hopeful well get to see unique brand of crazy interact with other xmen in future installmentsisnt without its flaws the plot is disappointingly simplistic its your average origin tale intermixed with a revenge plot but at least it uses nonlinear storytelling to break it up a bit most of the origin element is given through flashbacks over the course of a freeway chasebattle that fills the first hour or so of the movie plus everyone beside is relegated to twodimensional characters who only exist to serve a plot purpose ajax vanessa weasel and especially ajaxs secondin command angel dust gina carano are pretty thin characters is pretty much a oneman show with the merc with the mouth taking centerstage and everyone else taking a backseat to his showboating its fine though its fun and pretty violent so you know leave the kids home for this one as would tell you hes the best there is at whatever wolverine does wolverine never quite got to cut loose in the xmen films to the extent does here and superhero or not this is not a family film the rrating shouldve been a dead giveaway but im amazed at how i saw kids at my first screening in short is a comic book movie for people who are tired of comic book movies while still stumbling into same pitfalls of franchiseopening comic book movies,comedy
is a unique superhero film with a unique superhero ryan reynolds stars as wade wilson the former quarterback of the minnesota vikings oops wrong wade wilson ok he is really the father of that volleyball and bff of tom hanks in castaway ok enough reynolds character wilson is a fasttalking mercenary who discovers has late stage cancer wilson then takes an opportunity from an underground group that promises him that they can cure his cancer and give him superpowers i know that most of america and the world for that matter has seen this movie but in order not to be in the spoilerpool  i will not divulge more on the plot i do have to tell you that because of wilsons dilemma arises writers rhett reese and pauk wernick did go into their pool of witty zingers to deliver to witty verbal attack director tim miller did pull through with some nicely orchestrated sequences but at times did get trapped into the formulaic bang bang superhero scenic action reynolds was the superhero of his performance was superb so if you havent already take a dip in the  good,comedy
i really loved this movie it was funny raunchy gritty and gory ryan reynolds is the only person perfect for playing people who are saying that this was the worst marvel movie ever made just doesnt like comics or marvel movies in general because this was the best marvel movie in a while people who are also saying that the movie was too childish and too many curse words well duh thats the kind of character is he cusses a lot if you read the comic books then you would see a bunch of childish and a bunch of curse words in the comics and people who are also saying that the xmen are in this movie please know that the xmen are not in this movie but has been in xmen before and has helped them out a lot dont mess with he will shoot your damn cat,comedy

im not a fan of comic books but i do like some of the films that are produced from them like iron man captain america and xmen ive never heard of until i started seeing the trailers for the film i didnt even know it was a marvel comic after seeing the trailer for this film and the 85 rating it got on imdb i thought i was going to see one of those films i could kick back and watch the good parts over and over again that wasnt the case wasnt bad but it wasnt as good as i hoped it would be in the opening scene the action was intense and riveting i was hoping it remained like that all throughout the film between the decent action scenes ryan reynolds was just saying a lot of sarcastic and witty remarks which was good for the film because i guess thats ryan reynolds personality but it should have had some more hard hitting action to accompany the sarcastic and witty remarks unlike other marvel comic films isnt for the whole family its crude raunchy violent and full of sexual innuendos so dont bring the kids to see this one as i said before it wasnt as good as i hoped it would be comparing it to other marvel comic films but im not regretting the fact that i saw it either,comedy
i was honestly expecting the worst with this i found the trailers supremely annoying and a whole movie like that was going to drive me up the wall it still kind of is but i was able to get into it the story is as generic as they come but hey its a small intimate story that doesnt try to be anything more than it is i can appreciate thatits funny how this is structured it really doesnt need to do the whole flashback thing because they catch up to that point midway through rather than at the end but they wanted to start with an action scene to grab you i suppose it worksim finding it difficult to really write down what i think of this its certainly smugly satisfied with itself but its also charming in a weird way regarding the love story about 10 of the jokes and references are worth a smirk but when theres a handful of jokes or references every minute thats a pretty high number of smirks even a few laughsbut i cant fully get on board with this at the end its too standard and basic the simplicity of the story can be boring pointing out flaws in other superhero movies doesnt negate the fact that your own movie succumbs to those flaws in an even more egregious fashioni do need to give credit to reynolds and the production team they deserve props for bringing this to the screen and pleasing the die hard fans,comedy
well what genre this film was made of scifi action drama oh i think it was just a plain romance story i was spellbound watching this flick when i started off but when i reached through the interval my brain was hammering me to put this illfated story aside and to have a nice sound sleep nevertheless the xfactor that kept this film grossing among the minds of spectators was the charming ryan reynolds and the way he holds the story firmly but there is nothing else which empowered apart from humorous scenes the movie is simply boring video of two super heroes fighting for survival romance is at its place but as itself says a love storysincerely im skeptical over this issue it isnt merely romantic its another straightforward scifilm remember sam raimis spiderman trilogy unfortunately can easily be compared to spiderman to begin with positives pf the film character development takes time and eventually on the beneficial side of the movie the director elicits his skills to set up a perfect background for a responsible and classy hero regardlessly story is slow with other departments of the film like most of the other superhero movies does just good to create tension in between the movie ryan reynolds part is amazing funny hilarious charming witty talkative  everything perfect morena as his partner is nice to see in partson the flip side bores some unusual and redundant sequences which elongates the length of the film the premise wasnt good and the bad revengeful is born out of nowhere thus is viewed as mere another action packed movie right from the beginning with due respect to screenplay being watchable the film is able to hold the spectators not to mention the duration was longer than enough for such a film it seemed like ninetyminutes of fun merged with other twentyminutes of unnecessary biography of the character the conclusion had nothing new to offer tim miller tried way too hard to make this film a super hero film overall it was an average onetime watch film even more it can be skipped too 2 is coming soon and hope it wont be too stretchy as this,comedy
i knew it was going to be violent well because of the rating but this film is crazy violent and still you are laughing at all that happens it is absurd how fun it is when somebody is punched kicked hacked slashed shoot or crushed as long as it is served with a smile and a snappy remark it all works out that is one thing this film is full of actionviolence and everything is served with a snappy remarks a joke and a smile  and it just works my son is not going to see this any time soon but i loved it a lot that is for surei have always liked ryan renolds and in this film he really goes all in or maybe out to be the best super hero he can be as long as he doesnt get a green suit he is all goodlocation seating  time imperial nordisk film vesterbro denmark  bio 1 row 14 seat 3  5  22022016 at 1610,comedy
shoot em in the face i have long been a proponent of this method its supereffective this movie is everything the hero genre needed this better trend began with gotg with heroes who arent quite heroes antiheroes and so forth and who can act like actual human beings in spite of sometimes not being human beings and possess powers and abilities beyond mortalsbrooding is fine for certain characters but when everyone is dragged into the same mold it begins to get overwrought because thats just not how people work and we know that were not all on xanex and zoloft were not miserable 247 and most people dont like hanging around people who are also brought us a snarky brutally sarcastic wit sorely lacking in humor overall these days save for south park the fear of offending anyone with an entitlement attitude has finally begun to break and i believe may signal a resurgence as the studio execs have had the blinders unceremoniously ripped from their eyes guess what the vast majority of us are thoroughly sick of watered down pc writing the merc with a mouth dragged all the sjws out of their safe spaces and spanked them soundly to much adulation is the movie perfect nope do i care all that much double nope i dont exactly judge spaceballs by the same standards as the maltese falcon after all does it accomplish a great feat with its rather small budget and give the finger to the whiners who wanted it to fail because it upset their simpering sensibilities absolutely its a comedy first and foremost and succeeds at that aim 110 the writers were indeed the real heroes in this movie as such i feel it deserves a very high rating because it does everything it set out to do and made myself and the rest of the audience laugh ourselves silly with some truly brilliant comedic creativity thats what comedies are supposed to do and the rest of hollywood should realize this simple fact and stop with the terrible wayans parodies please,comedy
really how can anyone consider this ahole a hero he can not be even a clown,comedy
my bf summed it up perfectly  seemed like aggressively vulgar poopbutt humor meant to appeal to edgy teenagersmy take stupid flat jokes delivered by subpar actors its offensive to know anyone associated with this movie made money all the 8 star reviews reinforce my belief that most movie goers wouldnt know a descent movie if it bit them in the a,comedy
i love no other comical superhero film has hit those lol notes as well as these films have definitely check it out if you havent already,comedy
was a movie that i wanted to really enjoy and for some resson it was just really badand it was not as good as 2 why do you wonna start a franchise with a bad moviethat the question is it not,comedy
why they didnt take a younger actress to play vanessa i mean morena baccarin is 38 years old and with all due respect she is a good actress but in my opinion copycat should be much younger and sexier thats the only reason i gave to this movie 9 stars instead of 10,comedy
let me preface by saying i hate superhero movies i loved this movie it was hilarious and fun to watch definitely recommend its not a corny superhero story at all,comedy
with tongue firmly planted in cheek this movie takes shots at everything and everyone no holds barred is for adultsthe holiday sex montage and the whole entire movie will make you laugh like never beforei recently rewatched the original in preparation for the deuce and enjoyed it just as much if not more the second time aroundworth a view,comedy
ive heard it being talked about but only saw it last week for the first time in terms of its genre its a brilliant movie well crafted story line brilliantly scripted it does something different with the super hero weve never seen like this before hes lovable the story is heart wrenching you i want him to beat the hell out of the evil villains hes fighting ive never experienced that before about a villain in a superhero movie usually the villains are very stereotypical and dont evoke the passion did for me i really really wanted to see the horrible man squashed to smithereens for being so evil and inflicting so much pain on innocent people daredevils villain was suitably evil and cold but the characterisation didnt evoke such a strong emotional response for me im not a batman or superman fan but i do love a bit of science fiction and ventures far enough into a bit of sciency reasoning for his superpowers to fascinate me the fight scenes im usually just waiting for them to end so we can move onto the next story but with they were interesting they werent just bashing each other up in cool ways they had wit and humour in them which i loved,comedy
i discovered not too long before the film became official so it was really that that made me become aware of this character after reading some comics and watching clips online it became apparent that ryan reynolds is the only person who could play this role and does he ever knock it out of the park his passion for this character is not only apparent on screen but off the screenits action packed and hilarious with great fourth wall breaks and easter eggs that youll only discover all of them on multiple viewings the merc with the mouth has come a long way since wolverine its also worth noting that this film changed the genre by making way for more rrates comic book adaptations like logan im sure thirty years from now ill still be watching this movie and thats why it gets a perfect ten from me,comedy
the movie was comedey action  plus ryan reynolds is probably one of my favorite actors,comedy
i am in love with it dark twisted comedy if you understand it the blood the gorenot for faint hearted still mostly funny p storytelling  everything i am saying inside my head he is not a superhero he is an avocado who had sex with another avocado i am afraid i might give spoilers now the 2nd movie is coming i am fully excited not that way,comedy
the title of the film is the genree is action it is about on assasin it is based on a book the film is set in usa the film is set in modern times morena baccarin stars in the film ryan reynolds play the main role is my favourite character in the film andrzej kowalski would like this film,comedy
is an action comedy movie in which we watch a former special forces operative turned mercenary and after he found that he has cancer and there is no hope for him accepts to be subjected to a rogue experiment this experiment has as a result the acceleration of his healing powers and is ready he is ready to fight for everything and firstly for his love with a different way his dark humor sexy language and his new abilities are only a small taste of what this superhero is ready to do and what the results of his actions will bei have to admit that i laughed a lot at this movie and of course i enjoyed it very much i can understand that is a marvel movie which many people were thinking that was made for children and its jokes had to be for kids and not for adults but since this movie is rated with r all these comments are wrong is a movie for adults with plenty of violence bad language sexy scenes and nudity and not for children i liked very much the interpretations of ryan reynolds who played as wade wilson  karan soni who played as dopinder and morena baccarin who played vanessa the direction and the selection of cast which was made by tim miller were simply amazing and this can be easily understood by the success of this moviefinally i have to say that is an amazing movie with a very good cast a wellwritten and clever script good plot and many funny moments  scenes i strongly recommend for everyone to see it because i am sure that you will have a really great time and of course you are going to enjoy it very much its combination between romance with humor and action with violence its simply the recipe for success,comedy
just when you thought that superhero movies could not get any better from the hulk to spiderman marvel has created the countrys most well known superheroes and is definitely one to add to the top of your list not a marvel fan this movie still is the one for you is a parody of the typical and cliche super hero movies its about a a middle aged man wade wilson who was diagnosed with cancer he was in a very serious relationship with his girlfriend  who influences a lot of decisions he makes one of them being to get rid of his cancer so he can finally take the next step their relationship without the fear of death clouding her mind one day he was offered the chance for him to get better since the chemotherapy was not cutting it but it was a scam he was tricked into being a human guinea pig well to say the least he ended up losing all of his charming looks and looked like he was tossed into a deep frier hence the body suit that he never takes off however he was given the ability to never die or it would be very hard to kill him if he was shot by a bullet it would just leave a hole through his body and he would later recover with these powers he fought against criminals and teamed up with other notyourtypicalsuperherosit is impossible to just sit back and enjoy this movie every second leaves you either on the edge of your seat or squirming around as you laugh yes this is an r rated movie and does is recommended for an older audience probably 17 due to the profanity and sexual references but i definitely recommend saving this for your kids when they get older it for sure is a must see this was unlike any other comedy and action movie i have ever seen and that is why i recommend it i am typically not a super hero movie type of person i just think a lot of them are cheesy but the fact that the creators decided to create a superhero movie with a dash of comedy is pure genius that way it appeals to a wider range of people so if you want to watch a marvel movie that will constantly make you laugh till your stomach hurts with the perfect amount of love i there then is the movie for youwhoever claims that is pointless obviously has no sense of humor and is just purely hating on this movie to try to stand out yes there are vulgar words used but that just adds to the humor the reason why that they do that because they want to make it relatable to people nowadays whether you believe it or not this is how society and teenagers talk with the f bombs and slang this only just makes the movie more relatable also it is impossible to label as boring and pointless because of all the action and fighting scenes although like all other superhero movies are unrealistic the special effects and cinnemotagraphy is so well done that as you walk out of the theatre you feel as if it wade wilson is going to come out of nowhere if you were to break down the plot of this movie creating the graphics are difficult because of how insane the fighting scenes are a lot of times when wade is shot it leaves a hole in his body until he wakes up the next day through that whole time you can see directly through his injury as it matches the background also when someone shoots a gun they slow down the osmall and tedious details like these are hard to account for but executed this aspect perfectlythis movie combined love superheroes action and comedy all into one movie how could it get more exciting than that so the next time you bored at home scrolling through the endless movies on netflix unsure if you want to watch a rom com or a comedy pick to satisfy all of your movie cravings,comedy
i love pretty much everything about this movie though the budget is low it doesnt show if you for some reason havent seen this movie yet id like to let you know that there is a hilarious endcredit scene worth sticking around for action  the action is all well choreographed and fun all the effects are awesome and it feels like this movie had a much higher budget than it did the director knew what he was doing comedy  this movie is hilarious not a single joke falls flat a lot of the comedy is fairly violencebased and profane if you dont like that for some reason then dont watch it this movie has pretty much everything that could qualify it for an r rating in it plot  though there are a few cliches featured in this movie mostly for comedic purposes this movie is pretty original not a lot of movies tell their stories in this manner if youre interested in watching a boring conventional superhero story look elsewhere cinematography  looks awesome everything is wellshot enough said characters  everyone is funny and believable basically everything is well done and this movie should be watched by everyone except maybe young children,comedy
ryan reynolds does a good job in of not taking himself that seriously and by having fun having a contagious effect on the audience is a super refreshing installment in the marvel universe an rrated superhero blockbuster is a hell of a lot of fun and a wildly entertaining festival of laughs and thrills so many superhero films follow the same recycled narrative that its nice for the superhero to be someone we dont look up to but rather enjoy his many flaws a true antihero is a character i could see in a few more films and get the same joy put of every time,comedy
i remember seeing this in the theaters back in 2016 and boy what a treat this movie was a smashing mix of action satire and black comedy just about perfect now normally i wouldnt consider myself a fan of marvel  but along comes this movie which also inspired me to write a film of my own combining a womens comedy with this superhero film and its foremost ingredients that make this film so good likewise the opening sequence staggered me with its epic panorama tying into the prologues big action scene the satirized opening credits and angel of the morning song that effectively enhanced the mood i owe it all to marvel and whoever rhymes with polverine for making this film possible as for the fourth wall breaking thats like sixteen walls,comedy
sure the merc with a mouth may make his way onto our screens in all his uncensored fourthwall shattering and gutspilling glory but once the initial shock of 2016 has worn off the antics of this antihero start to wear a bit thin the constant turnstocamera popculture pilfering jokes and general crudity do become slightly tiresome since they constantly take the place of a varied and interesting plot dont get me wrong its entertaining even breathlessly so at times its fairly funny fairly consistently and rather exciting on occasion especially during its standout highway action setpiece  which is sadly ruthlessly segmented the sense that it panders to the same ideals and structure it lampoons is a strong one though and in the end it just cant escape the shadow of the genre it is trying so hard to defy 710,comedy
this is a massive breathe of fresh airthe marvel movies of late have been dumbed down for younger audiences which when you think about it is a money making reason however is the marvel movie that should have been made a long time ago i did go into this film thinking is this just going to be another suicide squad but its far from it the story is brilliant and the way it was told was geniusryan reynolds plays the part brilliantly i can definitely see this film getting 2 or 3 installments,comedy
a new word should be added to the oxford dictionary deadpoola combination of humouraction and romance and i feel like im missing something the 2016 tim miller movie that got fans to both antihero concept and ryan reynolds some may say it was all about the advertisement but the movie actually was amazing even though you wont get any morals from it other that staying away from strangers with suitsthe beginning was unpredictable  unlike typical superhero movies where they start from the child sad storyreverse chronology was used in by getting straight to the fight leaving the audience confused before the story gets more clear the asides in my opinion were the best part maybe just because we dont them that often in movies if not at all my most recommended superhero movie is surely not for kids of course,comedy
is this years guardians of the galaxy  a nonmainstream marvel film with offbeat humour thats really well made and the soundtracks good but not as excellent as the aforementioned film story is a simple one really  mostly because its pretty much identical to wolverines origin story exsoldier thinks hes not a hero even though he helps others gets experimented on and turned into a freak tries to win back his loved one that being said  this is much better than xmen origins wolverine and even the wolverine still theres a few throwbacks to the former which featured reynolds as a nonmasked and a few nice winks to hugh jackmanthe film starts excellently with a fantastic super slowmotion shot and has the funniest titles sequence i think ive ever seen the film then does a good job of flashing back to fill us in on how wade wilson reynolds became  helped by some appropriate fourthwall breaking were introduced to vanessa baccarin  who looks a lot like famke janssen from the original xmen the love of his life and weasel miller his best friend they both play good supporting parts particularly some of millers lines which are dryly hilarious its also good to see marvel try to take back some of their xmen characters from fox which is acknowledged with tongue in cheek with colossus kapicic being portrayed excellently  a naive russian with a pure heart trying to get to join the xmen hes helped by the new character negasonic hildebrand  and the taxidriver soni in two great scenesthe bad guys francis skrein  angel carano are adequate and move the plot along the endings good and i hope they make more because the fight scenes are done excellently the humour and jokes are 100 adultonly and totally fitting reynolds nails it as the merc with a mouth with great timing and nuance from under his mask and he does a great job of not being the prettyboy when needed this film makes me hope they get around to doing a gambit film at some stage  and im now interested to see how doctor strange turns out later in the year,comedy
not much of a fan of marvel comics not much of a fan of ryan reynolds not much of a fan of superhero movies in general so why do i love this movie so much chemistry it all came together it allowed this notmuchofafan to laugh and cheer and have fun its like galaxy quest you might hate the genre you might love it either way you can see the humor of poking holes in the genre which the hilarious doesas the headline intimates i eagerly await the sequel,comedy
generally i detest comic book movies this film is filled with insanely gratuitous and unbelievable violence for me the only redeeming feature of this potboiler is the funny and sophisticated dialog in what is an otherwise a lame and predictable plot the film was mildly entertaining but im sorry i paid money to watch it,comedy
its is a fun ride this is not a typical superhero movie it cant be 100 possible in real life but who cares the movie is for the grown ups and they made sure all the fun was in there ryan reynolds got a breakthrough role here he is definitely the cool guy not for the bad guys want to be around the actress is great too beautiful as she is she can be a naughty and it was a great joy to watch she and reynold had such good chemistry together the movie is fast pace and the action scenes are great this superhero definitely deserves a sequel,comedy
review by someone who is not a comic book fanis really funny and it is really meta it is not just meta it is metameta like the titular character says at one point it doesnt just break the proverbial fourth wall but a wall within that wallis also silly and it is fully aware of that silliness it is written to feel like every choice in the script that remains faithful to comic book hero conventions is a fully conscious and somewhat ironic onethat said theres still a decent plot barring the pretty basicunremarkable bad guy and somehow we can still feel for the main characters and root for their romancecoming back to my review title i think this is a comic book adaptation done right its inventive nongeneric and nonboring with such an abundance of blockbuster adaptations nowadays its really hard to find one that stands out and doesnt just follow a recipe and the beaten path its even harder to find one that will appeal to an audience that likes cinema without being particularly interested in comic books and would like to see something more substantial than a generic action movie i think the purely comedic and ironic take of manages all that i also think its the only option to making great comic book adaptations other than the gritty dark and realistic style that works so well in logan,comedy
full of comedy behinds with a emotional love story and a damn good starting cgs are greatly effected to look this real as possible reynolds fitted in as as hell makeups also baccarins performances are just raw ed skrein alright with his performances writers could do more with character ajaxhad a good time with in future i wants something extra ordinary,comedy
this was everything you could want in movie for our age it had me gripping an laughing right to the end the ending was fantastic as well a pleasant kick right to the end i cant wait until the next one no pressure though truly it was something that could have gone in any direction and seeing the othr films with these charactrs it already has however this truly has saved face andvredeemed itself as a true marvel masterpiece,comedy
incredibly funny and irreverent there is no superhero movie like this one and it really breaks the standards it was a fun violent rrated comedyi have been waiting for a movie ever since i heard of the character hes a brilliant funny selfreferential popculturespewing enigma this is why i thought getting a movie franchise started would be difficult to faithfully represent the character surely the fact that his origins are hazy to say the least should be touched upon but i suppose coming up with a definitive origin story was a must so i can forgive that everything else about the movie is as good as i thought it would be funny irreverent with a good dose of fighting and explosions yidioo,comedy
its a history about a guy who lives a life with some own justiceas anti hero the perfection of eliminate all the bad guys who have bad habits and need to be educated at the right wayhe finds his true love and one day everything change when he finds that have a terminal disease and hopelessly he wants to cure because doesnt want lose his girl and he tried to find help from wrong people that know his real powers and will exploit on that to control himall actions in this movie show the struggle in life to obtain all his target cause every ideal its about love in the end it seems that will be a continued maybe after all he will submit the possibility of being a part of the shield xmen a deep possibility but one doubts him own cause his character is strong and powerful,comedy
marvel studios embraces its rrated but hugely comical while keeping the typical superhero formula starring ryan reynolds as the titular merc with a mouthmost people know the fictional antihero for his insane mentality offhand humour and downright positive attitude under fire all the while hacking and slashing his victims to shreds in the most difficult of battles from his humble beginnings in the early 90s as a comicbook super villain he rose to the top of popularity for his offhand comments unique narration and violent nature depicted as a mercenary wearing a strikingly noncamouflage red outfit with black panda eyes underneath lies a physically disfigured and mentally insane man with a heart of gold he likes the banter and even during some of the most important comic book events his civilwar entries are some of my personal favouritesthe film takes its own liberties with its twisted sense of humour tongue in cheek references to past movies and a hyperlevel of violence we get a lot in terms of who wade wilson was before he dawned the red pyjamas of revenge his life as a mercenary isnt glamorous its actually impoverished hes cocky and handsome and the story begins right in the middle of his revenge against the man who tortured him nearly to death and took away any chance of having a real life of course the movie detracts from the original comics in terms of his origins which is not bad actually but it was a lot more melodramatic than i was expecting in parts wade discovers he has cancer and seeks out a cure by requesting the help of an underground medical group that is illegally testing gene mutations on people technically making wade a mutant his whole weaponx origin story from previous incarnation is thrown right out the window spat on and stomped into the ground its not surprising considering how terrible ryan reynolds was as his first induction as wade wilson  in xmen origins wolverine 2009 personally i would have loved to see a more insane version of with the voices in his head that are constantly talking to him his widely accepted acts of domestic terrorism and violent slapstick comedic nature instead of reynolds ongoing commentary and pop culture referencesthis movie does have a lot of things i hate about the superhero genre the simplistic get the bad guy plot line inconsistencies with story a villain who doesnt deliver any kind of threat at all the exceptionally obvious plot holes also some of the jokes fell flat for me at times and i was hearing some painfully forced laughter in the theatre when i saw this but it is unique very funny at times and its as violent as you would expect from this characterworth a watch610,comedy
this movie made me laugh like a madman in the cinema humour is very well used in this movie from 4th wall humour to slapstick to real world references this movie wont fail to make you laugh action sequences kick ass really fun to watch plotwise its short and snappy and focused you can also feel the chemistry between ryan reynolds and vanessa morena baccarin and you instinctively root for them though if you are expecting more plot development this movie is not for you this movie had everything a fun movie should have levity lovable characters or just character crazy action sequences and good humour 810,comedy

ok so i have been a fan of for a good 2 years i read all comics and then when i finished i wondered why the hell is there no movie yet this character is so interesting and unique and deserves its own moviei then heard they were making a movie and i was so excitedi watched the first screening and wow did i enjoy it i felt like a kid a again i had my eyes wide open and felt a big grin across my face during the whole movienot one aspect about disappointed me the jokesactiondialogcredits and more were just perfect and couldnt of been executed any better and ryan reynolds as dont even get me started he really redeemed his self from green lantern and previous attempt of in xmen origins,comedy
i admit ryan reynolds can get 80100 in the humor scale if only robert downey get 10100   the movie script was so dull and wacky forced me to reading the french subtitles  by looking at the bright side my french is much better now  i related to the majority of the sarcastic jokes in spite of reading it before on face book top comment and comics  tim miller try to simulate the quentin tarantino method for the movie plot and couple of kill bill scenes in order to add the action term to the movie genre   the cast intro was the only authentic thing about this movie   the disgrace reigned me after paying money to watch this movie  i would rather jerking over the money instead   the american cinema heading to a recession era seems to be similar to the 80 of the past century   i wondered how rated 8510 to ranked 65 on the top 250 and earn 135050000 at the opening weekend  510,comedy
2016 omg ive heard nothing but great things about this movie and typically when im told that something is so awesome it usually means it is horrible not this movie 2016 is within the first 10 minutes of the movie the best marvel film released to date the action is nonstop the comedy is off the chain the entire theater was bursting into tears with laughter the entire filmin reality this is probably my favorite movie that has came out between 2015 and 2016 so far and it is certainly the best comic book based film yet the acting the costumes the line up of cast omg everything was just perfect loved every second of the movie all the way down to funny things in the credits at the end perfectly done,comedy
first of all i would like to start by saying that i was uneasy about this movie when i heard ryan reynolds was playing i was not really impressed by any of his superhero roles in the past and bringing is difficult to say the least  but thankfully i was so wrong about that and reynolds just proved that he was born for this as for the movie for the readers of the marvel comics there is not to much to say its the merc with a mouth in his beginnings the movie will introduce some of the characters from the comics while leaving some for the sequels maybe from what i read also for budget constraints also we can make some assumptions on who will be the next villains based on the scene from the weapon x facility there are a couple of minuses from my side i would have like a few more x  men in the movie and also the insanity of the character is not fully exploited but i hope that with the success of this movie the next one will have a bigger budget to include these things i will not reduce the score for those thoughfor the non marvel universe readers this movie is r rated for a reason this movie is based on sex and violence also i saw in previous that people had something about the 4th wall braking this is one of the most important traits of the character that he knows he is in a moviecomic and for our amusement please do not go to this movie if you are offended by nudity and f jokes because you will hate every second of it literally and if you decide to go to it please do not take your child to it hence r rate this being said for fans this is a must see movie for other people it will be a great movie if you are into pop culture and edgy jokes otherwise thread with care,comedy
possibly my favorite comedy no not super hero movie of the year you dont need to be a comic book fan or love superhero movies to like this simply because its not a hero movie its a comedy and the best kind the way the comedy and forth wall breaking is done is just how youd expect the way he looks at the camera every now and then makes you feel like your there in the movie and the comedy is so funny i think the whole cinema was laughing the whole way through overall a great comedy and if your expecting a justice seeking crime fighter saving good people and arresting bad guys your in for a plesent surprise if your looking for a good action and anti hero comedy your going to be very impressed,comedy

in an age where comic book movies have taken the box office by storm the genre had gotten to the point where it had gotten a little stale in terms of the modus operandi when thankfully for most of us along comes the character of himself is a oneofa kind comic book character that not only subverts the genre it goes ballstothewall crazy in his portrayal that transcends its chosen medium and it is apparent to see how those ideals can be implemented in other forms of entertainment these characters are treated seriously as they are a contemporary concept and perspective of what greek mythology was in the past and its understandable but this does change the fact that these fantastic stories are meant to entertain and embraces this ideal not just to be unique but as an entire embrace of the medium that can only be done if one does not stick to the guidelines set by the medium itself as a fan of comic books and a massive fan of in general this movie just made me so personally thankful that i am alive at a time when a franchise like this not only exists but is enormously successful while doing it,comedy
when fox studios announced that it was making a movie the first thought that came to my mind was fox is going to destroy the movie just like it did in fantastic four then the red band trailer came out and my opinion changed completely first i was skeptical and very negative but after watching the trailer i started to think that fox might actually pull it off ryan reynalds already played in xmen origins wolverine and i have to say that the role suits him pretty well but that was over 10 years ago and nothing was done about it the reason character is very violent he uses swords to obliterate his enemies while simultaneously cursing them in my opinion a character like that just does not suit the pg13 genre so that movie will have to be rrated unfortunately  rrated movies do not generate high revenues as much as a pg13 movie does thats just the sad truth so no studio decided it was worth the 60000000 comic adaptations usually cost around 150000000 and the production was put on a halt until fox studios decided to take a leap of faith and go ahead with production heres a summary for the plot wade wilson played by ryan reynolds is a former mercenary who is diagnosed by terminal cancer looking for a cure an evil scientists experiment goes wrong leaving him disfigured with supernatural healing powersthis is tim miller directorial debut and he definitely does not disappoint however the success is mostly down to ryan reynolds what he did to the character is equivalent to what robert downey jr did to iron man sometimes a role is just made for you and sometimes its not and i simply dont think any actor couldve done a better job highest opening weekend for a rrated movie ever and i wouldnt be surprised if it becomes the highest grossing rrated movie of all time the record is currently held by fifty shades of grey unfortunately 571000000 and has already surpassed 500000000 in 10 days since its release this is a movie that works for comic fans and noncomic fans alike it has everything from action to comedy and most surprisingly romance in this movie youll find some of the most creative curses possible and an action packed movie definitely exceeded expectations and seriously looking forward for a sequel if there ever is one 9 out of 10,comedy
2016 dir tim miller  cast ryan reynolds morena baccarin ed skrein t j miller gina carano wayward comic book superhero film that is extremely violent and avoids the innocence of other films of its kind is out for revenge and answers dressed in red with facial scars in an experiment gone wrong when cancer threatens his life he takes to the street killing villains and making a mess director tim miller helms the first big r rated superhero film since kickass this is raw and sometimes graphic but ryan reynolds delivers deadpan sarcasm addressing viewers without concern for the massive destruction in the wake he has been tortured into mutant like powers and he seeks deliverance ed skrein plays ajax the experimental villain whose methods land wilson in his condition he is out to create mutant slaves but becomes one subject crossing the other side morena baccarin plays wilsons stripper girlfriend vanessa carlyle who becomes a target for ajax she is concerned when wilson is stricken with cancer but disappointed when he disappears tj miller adds further comic relief as a bar tender who bats sarcasm back and forth with gia carano plays angel dust a female mutant of ajax who can pack a punch there is also the appearance of xmen heroes colossus and negasonic who both attempt to bring in and become targets for his punch lines this film divides the line in terms of audience some will protest its violence and vulgar sense of humour while others may find dead charm and sarcasm to be dead on score 9  10,comedy
was an amazing adaptation they did a great job keeping the source material correct while adding the flair to this movie just to be clear there is a ton of gore in this movie but the reason it is rated r is for foul sense of humor so all these other wanna be superhero movies that are changing their rating to r dont understand why it means nothing the extra gore was nice in but it was not the reason i went to see it but back to our show it is really amazing that ryan reynolds can play anyone else because it seems like he was born to play this role and that comfort ability he has with is one of the reasons this movie is amazing it is full of vulgar humor silly off the cuff one liners and amazing action it meandering plot line keeps this movie fun the whole way through also there is a great adaption of colossus in this movie if you into action and vulgar humor this movie is for you if they make a sequel i hope the keep the entire team together director writers ryan reynolds and tj miller,comedy
being a fan of himself i know that there are some portrayals that are not good as what actually is in hulk vs wolverine is too serious in ultimate spiderman was made immature and they messed up his backstory from super power beat down made him annoying and we all know what happened in xmen origins wolverine but in this movie its really awesome ryan reynolds really does fit his role as going back on his other roles in movies his humour fits well in here i mean sure this is just another revengeorigin plot but in this movie it makes it more interesting the summary of the movie is title sequence in taxi meet ajax leaked footageonly tweaked xaviers school for gifted youngsters 12 bullets origin part 1 colossus meets up with origin part 2 127 hours spoiler alert origin part 3 continue that is how most movies should be normally its like 40 50 minutes until we see some proper action but in this it makes it entertaining and to top it off the rated r thing really works so yeah ill be waiting for the sequel,comedy
i really love this film it was incredibly funny and a great movie ryan reynolds played spot on at first i wasnt to sure about him playing that part but i was so wrong this is the best movie i have seen this year up to now with out a doubt is not your everyday super hero hes just a sarcastic hilarious powerful idiot and that is what makes him so different to any other super hero and is also why this films stands out too the reason for only giving 8 stars is i think they flicked back and forth too much from past to present which i just think can be slightly annoying also i thought the main bad guy ajax played by ed skrein wasnt a good enough fight for the film did not show the full potential of the masked maniac overall i loved this film it was comical full of action and had amazing graphicsthis film is definitely worth the watch so go and get a big bag of popcorn and enjoy the filmthank you for reading and i hope this helped,comedy
this is a superhero origin movie about whos more of an antihero with all the great marketing and dedication by ryan reynolds and the team behind it the movie had garnered immense hype and it was really pleasing to see the movie live up to it ryan reynolds was born for this role he personified perfectly he was simply amazing loved him aside from him the secondary cast did a really good job as well i loved morena baccarin as the love interest for and very surprisingly their romance subplot was handled very well something that is very rare especially considering i usually hate lovey dovey stuff they had great chemistry and i would say they are probably the best superhero couple in my opinion after spiderman and gwen in the amazing spiderman movies tj miller as friend was great and had some really funny lines loved colossus and the other teenage mutant movie handled them very well hell even the indian cab driver guy was funny and good in his small role from the awesome opening credits to the funny after credits scene was a blast it was very tightly packed with little to no breathing room at all the movie really flowed with jokes action romance etc all interwoven very nicely the movie was small in scale and i think it was a good thing they focused on all the right points mainly and it paid off it had signature 4th wall breaks and humor and was perfectly crafted in the film so many utterly hilarious moments in the film where i actually laughed out loud i tell ya i was having so much fun with this film that during half time i could have sworn that only 1520 mins have passed by seriously the movie flew by me so fast it was almost weird it is almost 2 hours long and it felt like half that long the movie is rated r and it fully utilizes it there is tons and tons of crude jokes and curses s talks here and there all the time the action is bloody and gory there is nudity and sex i mean this is a rated r movie through and through and it was just really refreshing to see a superhero movie like this plus you cant do justice in any other way relative to other superhero movies had a small budget and it sometimes showed cgi was a bit shoddy at times but the way they incorporated it in scenes and didnt made it a cgi fest it looked mostly fine the action scenes were great and entertaining villain was a bummer though ajax aka francis was just like the opening credits defined him just some british villain guy he was uninteresting had little to no development and was evil for the sake of being evil but funnily enough he still worked for the movie cause all it really needed was a target for and ajax fitted that bill perfectly so its more of like a nitpick then a real negative but still i would have liked it if the villain was more fleshed out all in all this is easily the funniest superhero movie i have watched to date beating guardians of the galaxy and was also my funnest cinema experience so far its one of those rare movies that is made by fans for the fans but also caters to nonfans i myself didnt know much about but i still enjoyed the hell out of this film it is great to see this film being successful cause now fox and hopefully other studios too will take more chances and give the teams more freedom i guess fox redeemed themselves after that disaster of a film fant4stic a must watch 910,comedy
everything hit home with the story the action the comedy i found myself going to imax to watch this film a second time and would enjoy many more viewings to really appreciate what the cast and crew were able to capture i have started to purchase movie swag and cannot wait for its release on bluray disk i cant tell you that you will enjoy this movie all i can really say is if you get a chance between work family and would enjoy a universe that functions with an rrating see it is brought to life with the character staying true to what wade wilson  is about my only complaint is i dont own my very own personal imax i would even type that i feel blessed being at the right age to see this movie i would also caution younger viewers from see this film unless there with an adult thank you all the fans that supported this effort and the hard workers that put this on it has been without a doubt an enjoyable experience 1010,comedy
superhero films based on marvel comics as well as dc comics are often subject for the most anticipated films of their years and usually come out with impressively rich box office receipts even when they fail to make a lasting impression this film operated by firsttime director tim miller is a unique turn for the comicbook genre the centric figure of this superhero action comedy is the crude mercofthe mouth antihero everyone knows as the irreverent foulmouthed hero wielding his blades and firearms like john mcclane on crack splashes into the screen with an audacious approach very few comic books have gone before he is not your average marvel comics hero for those who have grown accustomed to typical figures like spiderman thor and captain america he is a wisecracking guy with a patent of breaking the fourth wall cracking down on raunchy oneliners and dispatching his enemies in a violent gory fashion that superbly hence the rrating and it is up to ryan reynolds to bring his charismatic hero to life that not only remains faithful to the popular source material but serves justice to title characters lifeless appearance in xmen origins this film follows wade wilson played by ryan reynolds a hard headed new york city mercenary who falls in love with vanessa played by morena baccarin the girl of his dreams as these two fall into an adorable relationship wade soon finds his life in danger when he is diagnosed with terminal cancer the only one is capable of helping him fight this disease is an artificially mutated scientist dr francis freeman aka ajax played by ed skrein who subjects him to an experiment that quickly goes awry and turns into a red sickishlooking monster to matters worse he kidnaps vanessa so it is up to wade to save her suiting up in red wetsuit an arsenal of firearms and ammunition and adopts his egotistical identity he teams up with xmen hero collossus voiced by stefan kapicic and his teenage trainee negasonic teenager warhead played by brianna hildebrand to save herfollowing the origin story of the loudmouth hero director tim hill wastes no potential when portraying the irreverent nature of the eponymous character nor does ryan reynolds on capturing the crude overthetop personality that makes him such an charismatic yet raunchy figure the film finds an even balance of gutbusting hilarity and pulsepounding actions sequences to meet a satisfying showcase of the mercofthemouth hero and that the elements of both the film and the character himself acknowledging his comedic resonance this is best demonstrated in the opening credits which is generates to some laughter for its creativity but when our hero comes facetoface with against the baddies that is when the real fun begins as our hero cracks down on some hilarious oneliners that strong at hitting the funny bone however if you have read the comics you know that is the not the same kind of fun you would expect in more familyfriendly entries like the avengers or captain america there are plenty of crude jokes fourletter words and more than enough blood and gore to justify its rrating so parents if you plan on taking your children to this you are in for a rude awakening nonetheless it is an entertaining ride thanks to ryan reynolds who shines like gold in the role spewing one laugh after another with his striking comedic indulgence as does tj miller as the comic relief character ed skrein makes a good impression as the main villain but lets get real it is reynolds who is takes the show especially in the scenes of him breaking the fourth wall and being a wiseass is a violet crass yet wildly entertaining superhero action comedy that desperately demands for the attentions of all comic books fans and most of everyone else it is a big thrill ride that marks an impressive achievement for director tim miller and as it is worth mentioning make sure to stay for the postcredits scene if you are interested in a moment of both laughter and nostalgia well at least for some,comedy
indeed this review is mostly for nonfans of superhero movies because the fans probably saw it already and doesnt need this to know how good it is flawless logic isnt it they say the first twenty minutes are crucial you can tell from them whether youre going to enjoy the film or not well with the matter is solved at the very first minute with what probably constitutes the most hilariously creative opening credit sequences ever or lets say one of the to stay on the safe side although i really cant tell another opening that made me laugh like this one or maybe monty python and the holy grail anyway i wont spoil it for all the imdb badges in the world but lets say that it was the total opposite feeling than i expected nothing yet i felt let down this time i expected something big and i was still blown awayat that moment i never doubted i was going to enjoy it i knew i could comfortably sink into my seat and ill keep up smiling and laughing all through the film i mean one that manages to make you laugh in the credits sequences is like gently telling you we care about you yes thats what it shows a sort of special vip dedication to the viewer not to leave any detail unexploited for the sake of laughs and it sort of borrows from the python humor its anarchical out of place and spares nothing not even selfderision and i like that and boy the rest of the movie with its fourthwall breaking its flashbacks its constant nods to the audience never leaves you down is funny from beginning to end credits included and with a creative quality that is oscarworthy as far as screen writing goesnow remember i said this review was for nonsuperhero movies fans not that its an issue if you love them but i have to warn you you wont like me if i said i never loved superhero movies apart from superman maybe and if there ever was a trend that annoyed me these last years it was this overdose of marvel adaptations i grew up with tintin lucky luke asterix frenchbelgian school so i loved my heroes ordinary or anti rather than super i know some superheroes are more offhand and comical than others but if youre not an expert how will you tell them apart there are just too many and when i saw trailer i was like here we are another spiderman clone yet the tone wasnt exactly the same  but was it a spoof i didnt even know the character existed in the xmen universe so how can a preexisting character parodies the universe he belongs to now do these things really matter probably not the one thing is that the trailer looked funny and the movie better because its a signal when a trailer isnt really efficient it doesnt throw all the gags inside just to mislead you now to the story theres wade ryan reynolds a retired special forces operative falling in love with vanessa morena baccarin an escort girl so they live a beautiful romance until hes diagnosed with the big c and leaves vanessa later he bumps into an agentsmith like recruiter who informs him about a special treatment to cure cancer wade is treated by the sadistic ajax and his female and generouslyendowed sidekick angel dust after a series of painful treatments and tortures ajax reveals his true intentions turning wade into a superslave for wealthy customers a final process of mutation leaves wade totally disfigured but able to escape and become totally indestructible he needs ajax to repair his face and while ajax cant touch him he takes on his most vulnerable spot vanessa so with the help of a colossal version of the tinman without the ridiculous hat and a malcontent teen who looks like a mix of sinead oconnor and daria is off to save vanessai can hear the djvu bells ringing but just because the film swims in familiar waters doesnt mean youre going to drown in an ocean of clichs well there are clichs actually who am i kidding but its all in the treatment and the writing and the film acknowledges that the writers are the real heroes and for reasons selfderision is the greatest mark of humor and theres something very refreshing in the way the film ridicules its own material thats exactly how kickass started before going downhill with a violence that took itself seriously never does and thats what a superhero movie should do by becoming ridiculous in purpose from the start is even brilliant and creates a precedent that will make hard to take other superhero movies in a serious light but in a way its a kind of reboot in tone of the superhero subgenreand apart from the writing i also credit tim millers directing for never letting the action steal the funs thunder in fact the way the action sequences are choreographed serves the comedy not the opposite and thats a feat you rarely see achieved in movies the film has a few slower moments here and there but just when you get the feeling that its getting closer to the typical material you realize its only serious interludes before the fun picks off againso far is this winters winner and i suspect this is going to break the billion record because its the perfect word of mouth movie i know i can recommend this film because i know people whore fans of superhero movies and these are the ones ill immediately tell to go watch the film because i dont want them to misjudge the film it is that good,comedy
marvel simply fails to bore me i mean seriously xmen spiderman captain america the avengers and now is a film that combines both bloody action and comedy it is a great mix that a fairly low number of films get to achieve kind of reminds me of the last years kingsman as for the story it is by no doubt one of those typical superhero stories i mean every superhero starts out somewhere right peter parker got bitten by a spider captain america was in some sort of a mengele project and here is wade wilson turned into an immortal freak who is both a pervert a family man and a buttkickerthe entire styling move where the main character knows that hes in a movie not to mention that basically ryan reynolds plays himself who plays aka wade wilson is in most of the films just a downfall and just fails to deliver however uses mentions this concept at a very low and midfrequent rate that someone would say its barely noticeable but it still is quite much noticeable these little details tell a much more detailed story about because lets face it not that many people have heard or read a single thing about him before the film was announced last year as for the side characters there always has to be someone who is mocked by but this is not a group from another universe this is all an inside job and when i say that i mean by marvel only a chroma plated metal headed robothuman in a metal suit and a girl with quite undefined super powers are quite a treat they dont appear as much but when they do the best action happens taking everything into consideration and my review not being complete i have to say i really enjoyed watching this film at the movie theatre i do recommend you watch it with your partner since isnt just a superhero movie its also a love comedy that is even better than most of the mentionedgenre movies out there  810,comedy

solid enough story hated the flash back type of stuff seems to be the way to do things these days flash between a couple stories much like a lot of tv shows this however didnt need it it was all part of the one story if this movie was set out more linear it would have been a more enjoyable watch this could have allowed a more streamlined and thin story setup which unless you were living under a rock at the bottom of the ocean you would have known the regen cancer stuff anyway which brings me to the trailer a lot of the good gags are in it along with pretty much 90 of the story points you need the ending although somewhat witty did lack any substance action packed for the sake of it with all the destructionall in all a decent 8 movie could have done with some more gore and relational remarksinteractions,comedy

this is just flat out an excellent film it satisfies the marvel characters really well and it put out humor even faster than the action which is a good thing the film jams lots of punch into its nearly 2 hour running time the 2 marvel writer who wrote this script seem to really be hitting their stride it seems like this one has the pace of a run away train but it stays completely on track and does not derailthis one take full advantage of the action and spaces it well with the humorous banter it aids some neat graphics as well the cgi action is impressive here very realistic the script take advantage of the humor between the characters very well is immortal and that makes it possible to do almost anything with them they never even seem to run out of jokes with the double meanings of many of the jokes making them even better this movie really does most everything rightthis is how to design and execute an entertaining film highly recommend this one,comedy
hi guys i dont want to spoil a thing so im going to talk about some aspects of the movie and rate themthe cinematography beautiful this movie had a budget consisting of 56 million dollars in comparison to for example that horribleness called wolverine origins had 150million and the same runtime or even funnier ride along 2 had a budget of 40 million looked a lot better had good cgiespecially considering the budget had some cool slomo shotsthe opening credits was a complete freeze shot and incredibly well done this movie looked great 9510the action yes sir this rrated action was amazing guys got shot knived and slammed onto billboards and every bit of blood that left their body was seen on screen the action was also smart in one scene kind of spoiler if you have not seen the trailers the guy severes somebodys head and kicks it against another guys head no we needed a stuntman to do everything so were gonna use a lot jumpcuts bullshit wideshots of beautifully made action 1010the romancedrama youre not gonna believe this but it wasnt cheesy the love between him and rachel was amazing they were both crazy in their own ways and thats what made them have a connection again kind of spoiler if you dont know anything about when he finds out he has cancer you can see him in pain not because hes going to die but because he will lose her 1010the humor guys i have not had so many genuine laughs as i had in this movie im a kevin hart fan and went to see ride along 2 first i laughed chuckled once and laughed because my friend was laughing more so than the thing itself had me laughing from the first minute till the last minute the opening credits im telling you were the funniest opening credits since the beginning of film 2010s sexiest man alive is also 2016s funniest man alive i loved the humor which was improvised and also sometimes written by ryan renolds it was witty and not just toilet poopjoke humor the references to his old shitty work he has done but also the fourth wall breaking and dopinderfunny funny dude it was all hilarious 20 out of 10 dont know how to rate it differentlyall in all it was funny it gave the movie it deserved and more it was gripping sad scary in different waysthe torture the character had to go through but also i was scared i would laugh so hard that i would cough up my pancreas 10 out of 10 for this movie i saw a lot of people complaining it wasnt as good as mad max yet it was a lot higher in the top 250 imdbwell 1 their arent as many votes yet 2 my girlfriend hated mad max because it was so focused on the action it forget to be anything else was perfect in every way1110 but since my rating is restricted by the great limitations of mathematics and stuff 10 out of 10,comedy
is a fan favourite character for reasons that either work with people or dont for me is a fun character for his complete insanity oneliners and other such things that im sure others may find annoying however doing a movie on this character would be a little tricky but not impossible for me while the character is pretty much spot on there are a few things that drag itthe plot is that wade wilson is a mercenary who after finding the girl of his dreams and having a relationship that eventually leads to an engagement things however take a really dark turn when wade is diagnosed with cancer someone manages to find him and offer him the chance to have his cancer cured with sciencey things he is injected with the mutant gene by someone named ajax and put to various forms of torture one works but permanently damages his skin he breaks out after a weekend of the form of torture that did this and pretty much makes him more indestructible then wolverine going back to his hometown he tries to get back with his girlfriend but decides not to go through with it because of the issues he has with image he decides to suit up and start killing off everyone who was involved in order to get to ajax or francisonto what i didnt like the fourth wall jokes are something everyone in the opening credits is credited down as something like written by the real heroes here or directed by an overpaid tool there are other things like throwing a toy of weapon xi from xmen origins wolverine saying he hates it or him saying please dont make the supersuit green or animated there are quite a few of them but theyre not even chuckleworthy the rest of them are good but these just stand out for being badoh and the nonlinear structure frustrated me the movie starts with in costume shooting up cars and causing massive highway damage then it cuts to his past then it cuts to the highway damage then it cuts to his past then more highway damage you may have already seen it in the trailer a lot because to tell all of that one action scene takes the movie an entire hour i get theyre trying to balance out the whole i have cancer thing with some of what makes because honestly having this be a cancer drama for the first half would be weird when for the time hes a superhero hes foulmouthed oneliner cracking shooting stabbing and all of that would probably have audiences think theyre in a completely different movie but couldnt they have more action scenes then just that one thats where my complaint liesas a side note stuff here are other things i dont believe wade and vanessa are in love throughout the movie considering thats the only dramatic plot line towards the end thats a huge problem i have no idea of the purpose of the roommate has because all she does in the entire length of the movie is give him guns and speaking of i dont like the cab driver character popping up for the second time he wasnt really that funny in the first scene he was in either the funniest part of that scene was the thought of using a taxi whether its from the angle of accepting a heavily armed weirdos request to get in or comparing it to other superheroes means of transportationonto what i liked well for those like me that thought ryan reynolds as was a miscasting in xmen wolverine be pleasantly surprised the oneliners are pretty funny whether its from or some of the other characters i will say it unlike some of the superhero movies that get praised made today  was able to keep my attention from beginning to end so while i have ripped into this movie a bit i will say its probably one of the better superhero movies made today oh and i havent read that much of the comics for a while but everyone seems to be perfectly cast in their roles id say that if what youre looking for is a very good comedyaction movie then i would suggest this but not walk in with the expectation that it maybe something moreid say watch it but it to me is nowhere near as good as the almost 90 rating it currently has id say that it is worthwhile its probably more worthwhile then anything else on ill say it is instant redemption for another representation of the character made 7 years ago although does anyone aside from comic book fans really remember that aside from extreme hugh jackman fans and for that i think it unequivocally proves that they know how to represent the character at least now anyway,comedy
the roots of this film were very convoluted werent they 20th century fox had overseen a literally butchered version of back in xmen origins wolverine sew shut the wisecracking merc with a mouths sasshole really and reynolds himself didnt do so well with green lantern either from what ive read it seems like fox themselves didnt have much faith in the idea of a proper outing so reynolds and co had to lobby like crazy for years to get this thing made only to have several million slashed from the budget late into project fox have a history of derailing projects so its to be expected baccarin was previously involved in cult favourite firefly which had similar things happen so shed know better than anyone and it does lead to a wonderful bitingthehand joke where they ask why xaviers mansion is so huge when theres only two xmen in the story but i digressdespite these many speed bumps delays and other issues the movie succeeds on a number of levels  story acting directing humour  all present and correct and it hits the target so consistently you cant help but wonder what all the fuss was aboutmy favourite ryan reynolds character before this was the overgrown college boy van wilder and here he channels that sense of manic energy and fasttalking perfectly into wade wilson amping it up further when the famous red and black suit goes on the guy cant help but crack wise at every opportunity even when hes putting his last 12 bullets into the perps hes still mocking them to amuse himself me personally i found this hilarious throughout the whole film almost all the jokes work theres maybe three or four amongst the hundreds of puns putdowns and pop culture references that miss so im clocking that as maybe 3 that didnt make me smile laugh or groan at the right times  that for me is a high hit rate and a sign of great writingmore than just being a comedy though i was surprised to find that the love story between reynolds and baccarin is actually pretty compelling i figured maybe itd be thrown in to link with the valentines day release but no this has proper roots in the story the chemistry between the two leads is clear to see  they obviously enjoyed working together on thisi suppose whats also quite exciting is that isnt yet another bloodless cuss free fun for all the family superhero flick either theres actually a reasonable amount of gore where appropriate which is something the others just dont have and bad languagevulgar jokes at every turn this makes it a little shocking in a good way because a thats what the character needs and b when youre used to every super flick being cleaned up to earn a uk pg rating the one that doesnt has more dramahumour as a result a sign that it was clearly targeted at an adult audience people have voted with their wallets so the sequel and potentially other superhero franchises too wed hope should continue this trend himself is an interesting complex character who is more of an antihero but not in the same broody way batman is hes too fun and silly for that so theres definitely a place for this style of filmthe origin story is told very skillfully i wouldnt have guessed that it was tim millers first effort as a film director due to the careful use of camera tricks and attention paid to the editing to show us how came to be through flashbacks that are never short and vague or long and boring the pacing keeps the energy up to the point where theres never a dull moment and the action scenes never overshadow the drama of the others its quite impressive as another reviewer noted at points it feels like a comic book has flown off the page and come to life and i cant say that about any other superhero movie ive seen so far even the top quality joss whedon avengers monolithsi would say i went into this movie with reasonable expectations and found them exceeded at every turn is a hugely entertaining character the other leads are well chosen i love negasonic teenage warhead as the careful jab at teenage cynicism the main villain is a little underdeveloped perhaps but thats a minor criticism when the movie overall has such great enthusiasm and is just hugely entertaining from the first frame to the last even the credits animations and closing stinger another quality pop culture pull spot the john hughes film reference reflect the tone perfectlythis movie truly is the redemption of ryan reynolds its the movie he worked hard for and he has not wasted the opportunity  a strong introduction to what we hope will become one of marvels best and most popular superhero movie franchiseswould i see this again absolutely i want to try and work out exactly what wade was doing with that stuffed unicorn for one thing,comedy
in what may become the surprise of the year if not the last few years may also change the way comic book films are made this film broke many boundaries and is a risky movie it broke the fourth wall and is not a film for kids as comic book films tend to generate towards this may also be the funniest comic book film ever literally every 5 minutes the crowd in the theater was laughing at the over the top puns and references the next thing to talk about is ryan reynolds in what may be his best role to date he is perfectly casted as no one else can pull this role off like he did as for everyone else they were forgettable and thats all im going to say about it other then that this film is worth checking out now to grade acting b music b characters a specialvisual effects a directing a overall a,comedy
ryan reynolds has been trying his hand at super hero film for a while nowwith varying degrees of success not totally his fault but i have to take my hat off to him for this time the amount of effort alone to get this film made right and market it deserves all the kudosthe film is great if you dont understand you might think this film on the immature silly sideit is but that is that i love who cares if the story is simple or silly this film is fun from start to finish so if your going to watch leave your adult pants at the door and just enjoy the outrageous puns the flamboyant deaths gratuitous swearing its just deadpoolread the comic or play the gameyou will understand,comedy
is a fantastic movie with a really well developed plot and an outstanding comedic cast that are also very much able to be dramatic when its necessary its a marvel movie connected with the xmen series but it is so very different not just from superhero films but from any other movie out there its funny it has a surprising amount of heart its action packed and extremely violent they certainly took advantage of the r rating the best part about the movie is undeniably the main character and his ability to break the fourth wall we have seen it before but never to a degree as extreme as this he interacts with the audience makes reference to the movies cast the low budget its a terrific device that makes such a fun lovable character the only problem i really had with the movie is that the characters origins are overdeveloped it drags on for a long time showing us how he met his love interest and how he became immortal it was necessary but it did not need to be as detailed as it was the cast is all around terrific all entirely understanding of the blunt humour of this series ryan reynolds shines in the lead role of course as hes been trying to get this movie off the ground for years and his passion for the character is very evident he is also joined by the likes of morenna baccarin tj miller stefan kapicic and ed skrein who all did a stellar job with their vital roles great fun from start to finish intense violent and absolutely hilarious is easily of the best certainly the funniest superhero movies out there i would recommend it to anyone looking for a good action or comedy after an evil organisation kidnaps his girlfriend its up to wade wilson a man who has gained immortal powers and given the superhero persona of to save her best performance ryan reynolds,comedy
first i had never heard of in the comics so i had no idea what to expect saw the trailers and thought it looked interesting and decided to take a shot and see itbefore you consider watching this movie  keep in mind that it is irreverent to marvel very violent has nonstop profanity way over the top in everything it does and was one of the funniest movies i have seen in a long time the movie should never be taken seriously and the viewer should not expect realism  this is an action packed thrill ride that is also very funny  watch it for what it is and you will enjoy it is no batman thats for surethe movie wastes no time in bringing action into play and the sequences are choreographed very well if you are familiar with the comic version of i was told he talks to the reader and this is what he does several times throughout the movie  turns his head and talks to the audience  no super hero has ever done that beforeif you want to watch a high action movie with lots of violence language and hilarious one liners and insults then this is the movie for you do not bring your little kids to this filmi give this movie a 910 for its originality script brilliant action and irreverence toward marvel cannot believe marvel actually can laugh at itself for once this movie took a huge chance and it works  on almost every levelhighly recommend this film,comedy
this is my first review ever so please bear with me it had to be why you should watch is up to you but i am telling you your money and time will be worth it it is not like any superhero movie it has everything you want in a movie it is like a romantic comedy action packed gory film which will leave a mark in your brain and will send you home laughing your ass off it is r18 but i think kids can watch it too with adult supervision of course ryan reynolds was born to do this and i do not or cannot see anyone else do and the soundtrack is too cool for school that rhymed eh lol big shout out to the producers crew and the actors who made this movie one of the best movies ever made if you havent watched it what the hell are you waiting for,comedy
marvel comics unconventional superhero hits our big screen just before valentines day a life saver if you forgot that special day  so style it out and take your woman to the cinema if you want to kill two birds with one stone the first is that you can take your bird or loved one to see a movie that is a chick flick which has all the ingredients of a love story and the second is that you get see a dick flick that has all the ingredients of an action packed adventure as you would expect from a marvel comic moviethe ladies will love this cheesy  tongue in cheek humor with a dash of ahh in it and the male counterparts will be thankful that was macho enough to go with your bae and enjoy not only the movie but the fantastic soundtrack ryan reynolds who plays wadebrings this superhero to life with dignity in a dead end job as a mercenary wade falls in love with morena baccarin who plays vanessa dreaming of a better life with her until he is diagnosed with cancer he decides to leave her to give her the opportunity to live a better life without him and takes the help of ed skrein who plays ajax to cure his cancer and giving him super powers as he was a dead man walking so he had nothing to loosei must say for an overpaid director you have to see the opening credits  this movie is worth every barrel of laughter this anti superhero will have you laughing crying and squeegeeing all at the same time there are some scenes that are bloody and pretty gruesome but quickly followed by a snare remark to distract you from what you have just witnessed make sure you sit through the credits as the humor does not end until the very endi loved the soundtrack for from junkie xl mad max fury road has scored the movie to dmxs x gon give it to ya tracks from saltnpepa to neil sedaka and wham  who said romance is deadms safirah iranitwittersafirah63,comedy
ill be simple i loved this movie not only because it was really funny also because it had all the elements that it needed to be the perfect movie i dont give it a 1010 because of the origins story maybe too long and some plot holes here and there but the rest was pure perfection i havent seen a movie this good of only one superhero in marvel since captain america winter soldier considering only the 60 million of their budget this was surprisingly good the r rated helped a lot hope we could see more r rated movies of superherosthis movie took a lot of risks and it paid off crushing the box office in the oppening weekend making it in the top 30 of biggest oppening weekend in history all of the acting was perfect i liked all of them not a single person had bad acting hope 2 could be just as good as this one im totally going to watch this three or four times more hope hollywood keeps doing movies like this,comedy
a barrage of action and humor blend seamlessly providing an immensely entertaining experience the story features basic themes of love and revenge with wellpaced flashbacks to the origin of wade wilson as he becomes but is refreshingly unique and original both in and out of costume the star provides laughs is no typical movie adaptation of a comic book character its nowhere near familyfriendly like spiderman or the avengers this one is r rated and intended for mature viewers who enjoy extremely immature comedy in addition to over the top violence its not for kids except the ones with cool parents of course director tim miller strongly impresses in his first feature film the cgi effects are wellutilized and signature style of breaking the fourth wall is a frequent treat the plot and pacing provide a steady stream of fun the film has its clichs like any but makes fun of them to viewers as they occur turning anything generic into a laugh be prepared for a vulgar perverted and crude humor with overthetop violence if nudity or sex scenes offend you then beware the satirical humor can be dark and twisted similar to south park at its most extreme not all the comedic dialog lands flush but the creatively colorful dialog keeps the laughs coming ryan reynolds feels perfectly cast as the quickwitted antihero ed skrein stars as the antagonistvillain ajax although the character is a prototypical british baddie his back and forth with reynolds is great actor tj miller provides comedic support as the best friend weasle morena baccarin who plays the role of wilsons girlfriend vanessa impresses in a silly fun role in stark contrast to her work in homeland as he has another pair of supporting characters in the form of xmen colossus and negasonic teenage warhead the former is played by stefan kapicic and greg lasalle who split the work between voice and physical acting the latter who ill call ntw is brianna hildebrand who pulls it off well this movie is not for the easily offended and not to be taken seriously entertainment value is what counts and has it in droves disclaimer i am not responsible for the corruption of any innocent souls that may result from watching deadpool,comedy
the superhero movie has become stale as of late 2015 didnt do much for the genre as its most notable entry was avengers age of ultron which was a serviceable film at best the genre suffers because of its formulaic core marvel can make a billion dollars off of pretty much anything these days so they have little incentive to mix it up the mold has been perfected in terms of box office success and with it originality has taken a fatal blow however doesnt fit into this mold or any other for that matter and thats why its the best superhero movie to be released since guardians of the galaxy 2014 follows wade wilson played by ryan reynolds a mercenaryforhire that kicks the mess out of people for a living after being diagnosed with terminal cancer wilson signs on to an experimental program that will cure his cancer and allow him to happily live out his days with his girlfriend this program isnt what it seems however and wilson emerges from the torturous experimentation mutated disfigured and super powered with his newfound abilities wilson christens himself and goes on the path of revenge from the first frame of the opening credits its clear that is unlike every other superhero movie that came before it its hero isnt really much of a hero at all hes prone to profanity innuendo and brutal violence most of which is done with relative taste anyone whos been on the internet in the last month has surely seen some trace of the films pervasive marketing campaign most of which asserts the obnoxious humor characteristic of himself initially this worried me i was afraid id be subjected to several hours of lowbrow prepubescent humor and although there was certainly plenty of that strewn throughout it wasnt nearly as idiotic as i anticipated certainly not all of the ridiculous oneliners connect but a surprising number of them stick the landingin fact most of is genuinely hilarious the film is insanely selfaware and much like the comic books from which it came it often breaks the fourth wall addressing the audience directly just for the laughs it plays off the absurdity of its genres formula with refreshing effectiveness using the tired tropes of superhero flicks to its advantage however much of this breaks down into a matter of taste regardless for some people with be a humorless excursion into immaturity but for those unburdened by seriousness this film is a riot however violent it may be theres an honesty to be found amidst the carnage films like the avengers 2012 deal with apocalyptic destruction that surely leaves hundreds of thousands dead but the audience is never exposed to any of that weve seen iron man save the day countless times blasting his enemies to bits with his array of billiondollar technology but were never shown the reality of his actions sure he saved new york from an alien invasion but half the city was destroyed in the process almost all superhero movies deal in this kind of flashy softcore violenceon the other hand shows us exactly what its hero is all about wielding twin katanas wilson cuts through swathes of his enemies separating limb from torso head from spine and ego from spirit hes a killer like most superheroes but at least hes sincere about it characters like wolverine have power sets that are entirely based in visceral dismemberment and yet theyre dressed up on screen as if the kills are somehow clean and its title character are much more honestany complaints made about the films lack of plot or original characters are based in misunderstanding the villain for example is an intentional clich thats carefully crafted to reflect the tiresome habits of action movies everywhere right back into hollywoods face the plot is bare bones lacking in any globalscale destruction or international crises which is refreshing when considering the fact that the earth has come close to annihilation in nearly every other superhero movie knows precisely what its doing with its own elements its all very intentional its just a matter of whether or not you like its intentionbut this film has done more than provide us with an entertaining way to spend two hours has proved that theres a place for rrated superhero movies in todays market its taken what guardians of the galaxy started and expanded on it proving that the mold isnt the only way for studios to make money hopefully this films success will inspire future installments in the superhero genre to think outside the box,comedy
2016we can all agree that the topic of superheroes embodies a wide spectrum we have seen our flawed yet noble heroes iron man antman thor and we have also seen our dark gritty rougharoundtheedges antiheroes batman and wolverine and then we havedeadpoolthis is a somewhat different sort of heroic character who cannot fall into any particular category as he consistently breaks free from such standard bonds and rules this would possibly be quite difficult to lay out cleanly for general audiences to fully grasp let alone enjoy but this movie without a doubt nailed itmuch like the title character rather than go with the standard storyline structure beginning middle and end this film takes you on a rollercoaster ride of ups and downs as we witness the genesis of the socalled merc with a mouth the films starts us off in the middle with wild crazy and even hilarious action sequencesgoes back to our heros humble beginningsback to the crazy funny rising action middlethe compelling beginnings againthen back to the middle allowing us to better comprehend and even appreciate why is the way he is it should be of no surprise to us moviegoers that this is not an appropriatefor children superhero movie even if you dont know anything about the character the trailers movie posters and teasers wouldve been clues enough for mature adult superhero fans this movie really does have it all action rude language gratuitous violence crude humor sexuality a compelling story and most important of allentertainment of course it can be argued that the story seems simplistic in its telling a wronged protagonist seeking out revenge in the name of love etc etc but what more does a superhero origin story really require most superhero movies these days become royally screwed what with their overly convoluted story lines multiple villains popping out of the woodworks and even unnecessary visual effects all the while expecting the audiences to take the plot seriously and just go with it ie the amazing spider man 2 works so well as a movie simply because the audience knows rightoffthe bat that it is not meant to be taken seriously the opening credits are proof enough of that the title character actually takes us on this personal ride of his talks to us and literally expresses how ridiculous the whole situation really is take note this is exactly what as a character is meant to be and do granting the movie major points for loyalty to source material however when all is said and done this film wouldve been impossible to make without ryan reynolds the heart and soul of the whole project people tend to throw the term perfect casting around a lot but in this particular case there was truly no one better to play the role of reynolds was born for this role he perfectly embodied the characters vulgar and charmingly sarcastic nature in fact it would be fair to say that the films wellshot and seamlessly choreographed fight sequences made up about 10 of what made the movie so great the other 90 was pure raw attitude all of it originating from ryan reynolds himself all in all this was a fantastic movie great for all to enjoy providing they are mature enough to handle all of the wild generally inappropriate shenanigans it had to offer speaking for the fans we cant wait to see what else will have in store in the future,comedy
finally a film that met and exceeded my expectations not for kids hilarious and action packed from credits to post credits scene innovative in the way it gives us the origin story and fabulous in the breaking of the 4th wall reynolds is the natural choice for our hero the supporting cast is strong and the writing and direction are spot on the special effects were grand yet understated the villain was not run of the mill nor over the top the story stayed true to the source as well as it possibly could this is one film that could have been longer but id rather be left wanting more than to have dry spots well done gang bring on the sequels i hope this opens the door for more r rated comic book films theyre not just for kids kudos,comedy
this film never takes it self too seriously which could have wound up being to its detriment however in this vein this is exactly how the movie thrives i found to be funny and a bad ass in equal parts this could prove to be a tough balance but reynolds pulls it off the action sequences are killer especially in imax as i saw them rarely if ever does this film lose momentum and is always engaging merging sarcasm charisma and brutal fighting skills the anti superhero keeps us guessing and on the edge of our seats its a thrill ride you wont wanna get off of i gotta give honorable mention to ed skrein as ajax really thought he was brilliant in this role,comedy
now as this is my first review i may be a bit rough around the edges but j felt so strongly about this subject matter i felt i needed to at least put my voice out there and add my two cents to the mix firstly anyone who sees this will laugh there isnt a joke on any level both crass and base or high brow that wont raise at least a giggle ive been following since his 1997 comic run until the early 2000s and this movie follows along some of these parallels and it does them well while still in keeping with its own thing secondly ryan reynolds is a huge fan of the character and it shows in every way every line every frame every movement bryan singer who created the movie world of the xmen should watch this and hang his head in shame not full of allegories of homosexuality and discrimination with a few fights and comic names thrown into the mix to make you think oh its an xmen movie no this is the real deal theres only 2 count them 2 xmen at all in the movie and not only does the film get one spot on colossus but the other is actually improved upon and given real character and a sure on fan base for the future yes there are some details wrong and i could pick apart every small issue like the emotional scenes arent as good as they could be or the villains not really fleshed out hell even tj miller could have used more screen time he was perfect in this really from start to finish it is what it says on the tin its a labor of love and it shows unlike those other xmen movies not including the most recent ones right from the choice of music and the little in jokes like fighting over ikea furniture of all things is hilariously glorious as also the point of do not bring kids to see this a family left the movie theater shortly after the film started and i do wonder the logic of parents just because he appeared in ultimate spiderman does not mean this is for kids far from it pick up the comics see the movie and i am sure youll be a fan yet lets hope and pray xmen apocalypse even comes close to this also yes end credits scene so stick around true believers,comedy
i just came back from saw it 23 hours ago it was a good movie and i had really a lot of fun but its premise was too simple for me a hero is born his love is kidnapped he saves her from the villain obviously it twisted that format and made it its own and the jokes were spot on but yet i felt it had something missing having read the comics the 4th wall breaking felt really not good to me i did loved the side characters especially colossus and dopindar the indian guy the romance was unique for a superhero movie and i loved it ryan renolds was born to play and i am very excited for the sequel now that the origin story is out of the way which is boring most of the times in conclusion i had a lot of fun however it did not impact me in any way and i will forget it in 23 days completely,comedy
time to own up im a comicbook fan and also massive nerd if my review is slightly excited i apologise this film nearly didnt happen isnt a conventional hero by a long way hes not even a hero the characters traits he shows make him something that hollywood feared making because they thought it wouldnt sell and feared it would be a legal nightmare  let alone the difficulties anticipated getting clearance by the censors leaked test footage in 2012  2014 combined with fan power gave this project wheels and the film is enjoyable to both fans and newcomers it helped that reynolds was such a fan of comics too he championed the conversion from comic to film from 2005 on social media directed by tim miller this comes out exactly 25 years after first appearance in marvel new mutants 98 in one comic i read writers joked at reynolds to star as if ever a film was made  granted there was one story arc where gained tom cruises face but thats a whole different story and it was always suggested reynolds was the man for the job here we are in 2016 and that joke is reality as ryan reynolds delivers a great performance as the merc with a mouth he does much better job here than in his previous incarnation of the assassin in the xmen origins wolverine movie and so much better than he does as the green lantern which is even joked about within this film relatively true to the comics the cast portray the characters in the world with tj miller playing weasel and leslie uggams as blind al amongst others even hydra bob makes an appearance its an origins story showing how wade wilson aka gets his regenerative powers and what he had to go through to save his lover vanessa played by morena baccarin from ajax ed skrein the action and humour in the film starts from the very moment the marvel badge dissolves from screen and there is a great pace for the duration of the film all the way through the film and passed the end credits you certainly get value for your tickets lots of camera and editing techniques used throughout to give the film a great look and feel both modern with classic techniques too while the main story unfolds flashbacks and flashforwards act as additional narration to help the audience learn about the antiheros journey i enjoyed the ride and that surprised me being such a fan i expected hollywood to ruin this film this doubt was further reserved with all the great reviews that were coming in since the film was released i really didnt want to be disappointed and i wasnt here i am after the film writing a review to confirm that i actually liked it a damn lot the acting is convincing the script is littered with humour and drama which worked well with the expected insanity and violence which was due as well as the humour in the script there were visual jokes hidden in a beautiful crafted world typically broke the 4th wall with the character as well his surroundings talking to the audience there were jokes and nods to the previous character to feature a the below par xmen origins  wolverine movie like the action figure and the suggestion of sewing wilsons mouth shut a green lantern another role played by reynolds card was seen and wilson even begs not to get a green or animated suit while being treated by the weapon x programme talking to the camera refers to the previous xmen films and asks colossus if stewart or mcavoy was the current professor at the institute and at one point the merc even breaks the 16th wall by talking to the audience in a flashback already talking to the audience  typical insanity if you are familiar with youll already be aware of him constantly breaking the 4th wall and youll no doubt be aware that he got his merc with a mouth nickname due to his constant talking and wise cracking the film portrays that really well without ever getting confusing or boring sometimes the joke may not land but thats ok its and he cant help himself the minor negatives in the film for me and let me be clear these are teeny tiny negatives and didnt ruin the film for me were colossus and ajax i could have happily seen a different xman rather than the metal russian i imagine the cgi to create colossus wasnt easy and maybe a simpler character could have fitted the film better  although the fight scene with on the bridge was really amusing ajax was a little forgettable and judging by the villains that has fought in the comics filmmakers could have opted for somebody else  but then it wouldnt necessarily be an origins based film i enjoyed this although i didnt think the film was as bat sht crazy as it could have been it actually had as much of a heart as it did blood shed i enjoyed it more than other movies in the marvel universe the film doesnt take itself seriously and in doing so has a great mix of emotions at different times combine that with great action and you have a top notch film thats well worthy of a 9 out of 10 from me i was more content than i thought i would be being an established fan and an over critical one at that if you want a crude rude hard paced film with lots of bloodshed action but with a soft romantic side step up and buy a ticket in fact buy two or three tickets to help fund a follow up movie which might have cable and or nick fury in it,comedy
the most anticipated movie of 2016 has arrived and i was much eager like the other audiences to go for it i watched the movie in imax as i had high hopes with it the movie was astonishing with a tangled love story and a revenge saga was intense funny violent enough to make the audiences go for it a well made story and good character played by ryan reynolds brings reynolds back again after a series of failures action were timed very well and jokes in between the scenes were funny too i got what i expected from and marvels continues to surprise with new projects i go with 45 for and everyone should enjoy their valentines day watching deadpool,comedy
so finally seen the movie i have been waiting ages to see i was first was introduced to around 4 or 5 years ago by my older brother i read a few comics over the years and i was hooked and he is my second favourite marvel hero first being wolverine but i will say that in movie form comes first he would probably say that to ha haon to the movie i found it very well executed i loved the opening credits simply because its all about tongue and cheek and not taking it seriously the action sequences were really great to watch really over the top same goes for the jokes i couldnt stop laughing the bit with the hand growing back had me nearly in tears with laughter and the orgins wolverine toy was a nice touchi will say though that the story was a bit lacking and the villain was done poorly but not to enough to spoil the moviethe introduction of colossus and warhead was great i liked the new version of colossus really looks from the comics i would say this anyone who does not know the character and wants to see this movie go and research on him and then see how you feel about going to see the movie and always go with an open mind,comedy
confession i have a very limited comic book experience i just learn about these marvel or dc characters from either my 17yearold uncle or my knowledge from traditional comicbook movies and animated tv shows the best comicbook movies i always connected with the most are the xmen saga ive been a fan ever since the first movie directed by bryan singer came out 16 years ago currently waiting for xmen apocalypse to come out this memorial day but this is quite new to me when i heard that there is a movie actually happening last time i heard about i first saw him in xmen origins wolverine which i liked but it was the rotten apple of the series he was of course played by ryan reynolds who made the most of his very small role until see the movie or not and see why all of us were so disappointed anyway me being the reluctant one i didnt think a movie would work guess what its the one all of us comic book or noncomicbook nerds are waiting for so why did i warm up to well for one thing this guy who dresses up in a red suit is the kind of hero we havent seen in a while a man who shoots first and says a few wiseass things after that hes also known to break all types of walls first second third fourth and im pretty sure theres a fifth one and he doesnt give a bleep about everything as played by reynolds he seems to be the perfect choice for an rrated and unbelievably unconventional marvel character so how does this movie work well it starts off with the ridiculously inventive opening titles done in way plus a killer action sequence on a highway then its the origin story of which is quite a surprising one we get to meet wade t wilson reynolds also known as the merc with the mouth and maximum brute force he also finds his pretty woman see what i did there in vanessa morena baccarin from spy gotham and homeland there is a massive flaw in this system in which he has cancer making sure he doesnt lose her he signs for a experiment that should help him be cured of cancer turns out poor wade made a deal with the devil or in this case ajax a stunning ed skrein who is obviously a doppelganger for nicholas hoult also known as beast from the xmen series for an experiment that goes horribly wrong leaving his whole body scarred now all wade needs to do is get revenge on ajax and once he puts on the outfit its all good to go but standing in his way though are two members of the xmen colossus stefan kapicic and negasonic teenage warhead feisty brianna hildebrand is and has to be the best r rated unconventional superhero movie of its kind since the original kickass it has the right to make fun of the superhero genre and be super cheeky clever dark funny and incredibly bloody it even wears its heart and the rrating on its sleeve for example theres a sex scene with and vanessa set to neil sedakas calendar girl that pushes the boundaries to anything ive ever seen plus the bone breaking bloodspurting action is about as inventive as one could possibly ask for plus also has a tendency to talk smack about everything from the studio thats releasing the film to the xmen to wolverine and the actor playing him and even the actor thats playing although i wasnt a fan of van wilder and i only warmed to him when he was in great movies like definitely maybe the proposal smokin aces and the changeup i like ryan reynolds and hes very good here scratch the very good hes electric in the role of his foulmouthed fastpaced and earnest deliveries of certain lines are sure to be quite memorable and even though there are times when we just want him to shut up you cant put him down because we like and we certainly want him to get the girl hes also helped by a really cool cast including morena baccarin who provides the heart and soul of gold in the love story part tj miller who i also like is pitchperfect as the comic relief in terms not mine weasel leslie uggams as uncle al who is wise blind and caring not in the traditional sense and mma fighter turned movie star gina carano is lethally badass as angel dust who is more stronger than mr pool and colossus all combined props has to go to firsttime director tim miller from the world of visual effects and screenwriters rhett reese  paul wernick of zombieland for letting this animal go loose in wild big and cool ways that breaks the usual types of stuff we usually see in most superhero movies and for giving reynolds an opportunity to get comically crazy and go out blazing with a high chord like he always does is actually the first movie of 2016 that unabashedly lives up to the hype mainly because we werent expecting something quite like this i dont know if we will have something like this again but hey at least it was awesome right youll have a blast trust me and bring some chimichangas while youre at it its the perfect and most twisted valentines day gift youll give to your significant other oh and one more thing this movie is not for the faint of heart the squeamish and certainly not for kids,comedy
an r rated super hero movie our prayers have been answeredthat is because the people at 20th century fox home of the xmen franchise have decided to kick things up a notch and then kick them sideways in the process theyve given us a super hero movie heavy with violence very very vulgar language and sexual situations in short every thing the spider man movies were not we get a movie with attitude to spare right from the opening credits which is a joke too good to spoil give the writers rob liefield and fabian nicieza along with director tim miller great credit they get the marvel character of right and then some perfectly capturing the merc with the mouth weve all come to know in the comic book one the best things about this movie as that it does not try and do too much giving a compact origin and revenge story without shoehorning in too many other marvel universe characters from the xmen books unlike spidey superman and batman does not have a legendary origin story for screenwriters ruin by tweaking it for the big screen we just get douche bag wade wilson diagnosed with terminal cancer and then mutated by risky treatment run by ajax aka francis the villain of the piece whose only motive is to create super powered slaves wade his body now a mass of scare tissue courtesy of ajax fashions the now familiar red spandex costume adopts the name and goes to get some payback a simple plot that makes sense unlike some other comic book franchises that believe big is betterfinally gives ryan reynolds a part truly equal to his talent and should make him the super star he should have become a decade ago hes been a dependable actor in romcoms and bad comedies while often proving himself a very capable action hero is makes good use of his physical attributes and great comic timing the jokes and one liners he gets off are funny enough on the page but coming out of reynolds mouth is what really makes them funny and proving he is a very good sport the script takes very funny pokes at green lantern and blade iithere is a good supporting cast starting with tj miller whose character should simply be called comic relief ed skrein makes for a good bad guy with requisite british accent morina baccarin is wades tough talking girlfriend a love interest most worthy of the hero stefan kapicic is the colossus weve known from the xbooks while briana hildenbrandt is his sidekick teenage nagasonic warhead leslie uggams turns up in a small but very funny part as the blind woman rooms with a one point karin soni is quite funny as cabbie who chauffeurs heroes to a couple of big showdowns stan lee has his gratuitous cameo but it really is one of the funnier onesthe man is a great sportthe violence is bloody and the there is a car chase that doesnt look like every one weve ever seen in a movie before many of the jokes are very dirty and in really bad tasteway beyond anything heard on family guy some of them will make you laugh just because of how awful they arenobody who sees this movie will never again not giggle at the mention of meredith baxter birneyand there is a great soundtrack featuring chicago and neil sedaka among othersthough this is a super hero movie its not one for the kids and its raunchy attitude breaks new ground for the super hero genre lets hope the guys over at disneymarvel are paying attention,comedy
as a loyal comic book fan i found this a pleasant change from all the recent pg kiddie films the action scenes are spectacular the humor is adult and mature visuals are also stunning and good for its budgetis at his best that being said certainly sets the bar higher for future comic book films the character is fully utilized and is a direct translation from his comic book counter partryan reynolds does a superb job as the merc with a mouth and delivers on all aspects watch out avengers theres a new hero in town and he aint playing a must watch for any person who wants a dark mature comic book hero,comedy
is a movie directed by tim miller and written by rhett reese and paul wernick it stars ryan reynolds ed skrein morena baccarin and tj miller along with karan soni brianna hildebrand and stefan kapicica former special forces operative turned mercenary is subjected to a rogue experiment that leaves him with accelerated healing powers adopting the alter ego deadpooli didnt like i didnt love i adored to me is the height of marvel entertainment as it keeps the essence of the iconic character while weaving together a thoroughly engrossing storythis movies story has everything needed to build a pop cultural masterwork it finds its heart and originality in in its vulgarity and hubris much like its main character this sets it apart from any other superhuman movie ever movie at least in my opinion this is thanks in large part to the snark and acid wit demonstrated by the writers or the true heroes of this storythough decidedly scattershot and a tad bit convoluted writers over come these minor hiccups with mighty style showcasing their ferocious flair ready and willing to please these two fine men manage craft a movie that has both humor and depth a feat like no otherthough the wit self reference genre subversion and fourth wall breaks demonstrated in this movie did impress me the one facet that really sealed the deal as wade would say perhaps in a different context for me was the love story in most if not all actioncomedies there is a romance in most if not all actioncomedies the romance falls flat and seems overly clichd this is not the case as vanessa and wades romance feels earned thoroughly sweet and really fleshes out the characters leading to some seriously tense and emotional scenes in a movie that utilizes the phrase less angry rosie odonnellthe credibility of the love story and the nonstop humor behind it is only furthered by the two dedicated performers ryan reynolds and morena baccarin who display their seamless chemistry marvelouslyanother attribute that seemed thoroughly seamless was the pace of this movie constantly speeding but never exhausting tim miller manages to create perfect shot after perfect shot never overusing certain techniques and avoiding altogether dreadful uses of shaky cam and other equally annoying and lazy techniques first time directors often use tim miller proved to filmgoers everywhere that he has a long and prolific career ahead of him through this movie ryan reynolds has finally proved that he too has a long and prolific career ahead of him dawning the challenging role of the iconic and universally loved reynolds offers his best work to date bringing his trademark charm and enthusiasm to the profane merc with a mouth he is truly the shining star of this glimmering mess he played the role so well i really cant think of anyone else to play the part a feat only previously achieved by a handful of talented actors he fit so snugly into the part that i can really see a possible globe win for him in the already planned sequelaccompanying reynolds morena baccarin delivers a surprisingly heartfelt turn as wades love interest vanessa far from elementary baccarin brings out the complex emotional states of her character and reynolds ed skrein was really the only wild card in the lot as i wasnt sure how original they could make the evil british villain clich luckily for the transporterrefueled star he was given a genuinely decent role as the perpetual thorn in our outlandish heros sideoverall i can confidently say that has quickly become my second favorite comic book ever made barely lacking behind the dark knight gets an a or a 1010,comedy
when watching it is not exactly the typical marvel movie since it had lots if cursing blood fourth wall references and nudity which doesnt really bother me but it feels different ryan reynolds returns as the chatter box wade wilson who manages to charm himself with his witty humor and given the chance to explore hid origins wade is a mercenary that falls in love with a hooked named vanessa but finds out the tragic news that he has cancer and goes to francis as a way of fibbing a cure for his illness while he does findeed a cure for his condition but it also mutates him one of the aspects i liked was giving colissus a decent role who has been underused in the x men films,comedy
by far the hardest that ive ever laughed in a theatre the movie does have a weak plot and the villains could be better but that doesnt affect my rating much because the movie made up for it by doing everything that they did do perfectly i give it a 9710 but ill just round it up to 10 i highly recommend the movie but you probably wont like it if you are sensitive to violence  i also would not recommend it to children although it was not as vulgar as a film as i anticipatedit is still definitely for an adult audience everyone in my theatre applauded the film afterwards including me im just rambling because i loved this movie so much but i should probably sum things up it was hilarious action packed fun and without a doubt deadpool,comedy
this movie reminds me of a million ways to die in the west which also fails to be funny but in a different way in their only way of being funny is to throw lame contextless jokes one after another watching the movie is like watching a standup comedian show a talentless one of coursethe action part of this movie fails also lots of action and violence but none of them enjoyable it is so messy and chaotic that it is as if the action scenes are not be directed at all and the actors just improvise with minimum effortawful just awful,comedy
rating 8 out of 10 spending 58 mil and reaping 363 mil no wonder this country voted for a clown to be their president and this clown got a circus as a government to run this decadent society we can tell about a nation and its people by their cultural icons such as music movies arts etc hollywood keeps on making these braindead violent blockbusters because of the herd mentality of this dumbdown general population same trend in the music industry,comedy
superb movie must watch this is what a superhero should be fun is from start till the end ryan reynolds is at his best morena does great job too direction was terrific but the story was not at its best right from the start when introduces us to what is there to see in the movie leading to an awesome and one of the best action sequence i have seen in the movie his punching dialogues and high octane action is the real hero in this movie the movie delivers what was promised there is action there is love there is revenge there is emotions honestly i had never heard of before i saw this movie after seeing it i had to find out more about him as i loved him now i cant wait to see a sequel,comedy
i guess the reason its so easy to divinate is that his self destruction the normal humans deathdrive alike as explained by psychoanalysis actually drives him toward greatness immortality even  this is what were often driven to believe in our lives as well besides immortality guys i hope no one is so naiveonly when reality kicks in we tend to stop regain control get back to our terms realize that these selfdestructive processes we put ourselves through as coping mechanisms might actually lead to perishing of our existence on the most basic level who doesnt like to get trashed of alcohol on a saturday night for that matterthis is where humor kicks in as another tool of success for this impeccable story to help us cope with the inabilities that we face and fail to overcome especially psychologically well not exactly the same inabilities but hey might be immortal now but his faces ugly as life that he now has to live forever so we aint the only ones with problemsvery captivating film without this pretentious effort of other superhero movies but still full of glittery artifice and shinny cgi no wonder a lot of people might be hardly waiting for the second part and who knows how many more,comedy
confusing title  i know but i peed my pants laughing so hard that i felt like i shouldve watched it whilst sitting on the toilet normally what one can expect from a movie is a shitty love story because thats what people like apparently a happy ending and some kind of evil villain who will ultimately be destroyed or whatever and of course lots of action and killing this movie combined all those annoying features into the most genius innovative and eyeopening movie of all times for once we as watchers are presented with a righteous killer you know its true on a path of legit destruction who is not afraid of spilling blood ridiculing everything and everyone whenever he can kudos to ryan reynolds and wherever he can bravo marvel for making 2016 just a slightly bit better,comedy
there is always a guilty pleasure film every year that creeps into my favourites and in 2016 it is no other than which takes the comic hero genre to another level of funny where even the guardians of the galaxy could not reach this one is not about the action scenes which there were in good doses of or even gory ones which there were plenty of but more so about the little details of an excellent score including music from wham the amazing funny and borderline rude one liners including a ton of inmovie jokes and in general the entire selfsarcastic nature of it in fact and regardless of the admittedly very thin plot it was so much fun that i had to watch it twice,comedy
is a must see movieryan reynolds was brilliant throughout if you are looking for action humour and some good music this movie has it allthere was never a dull moment and the superb writing and production combined with reynolds timing and delivery made for many moments of really laughing out loudthis movie doesnt take the same serious approach as other super hero action movies the central character is refreshingly flawed and likable for it the movie was very well made on all levels its production values are as good as any of the blockbuster movies out therei was totally entertained from start to finish,comedy
once upon a time there was a film studio that was living a dream every film they came out with was a major superhero blockbuster everybody loved their films but there comes a time when things begin to saturate a time when glories of the past are casting a shadow upon everything the future will bring yes marvel cinematic universe im talking about you were getting tired of the endless machine invasions that may cause the end of the world were sick of the superheroes that are trying to break the status quo and then they reinvented themselves they regained our attention they brought us deadpoolryan reynolds is the alter ego of wade wilson a former special forces operative wade got involved in a rogue experiment that gave him accelerated healing powers this might seem great but he had to pay a price his skin transformed into scar tissue and to be honest it doesnt look really nice so wade wilson starts his journey of vengeance to find ajax ed skrein the man who did this to him so he can finally come back to his beloved girlfriend vanessa morena baccarin the title may ring a bell weve already met the antihero in one of marvels many franchises the xmen yet we need to forget all we learned about in xmen origins wolverine 2009 the old is nothing in comparison with the new one new isnt only as bloody as his former self but on top of that he is bloody hilariousyou could think that its easy for marvel hey were going to make a new franchise out of an old one just take some characters from the other film write a sequel story steal some ideas from the comic books and were done but no they didnt tehy brought up a lot of new stuff things we hadnt already seen in the comics the writers gave us an rrated film made of a violent and unflinching action sequences packed with crude and twisted humor with a lovely romantic touch and just to give it an extra dimension the whole film feels like wade wilson has written and directed it himself this is very comic accuratethats where the main characteristic of comes up his favorite hobby is breaking the fourth wall while watching the film you can catch yourself thinking about certain aspects of the film and then all of a sudden he turns his head looks into the camera and joins you on that train of thoughts another fourth wall breakingaspect knows that he is in a film he knows that ryan reynolds is doing a very good job in putting his character down this results in many references to other marvel films the actors previous achievements in other films and the acting skills of himself and his costars you could say that is almost reaching perfection the only thing that keeps it away from it is at the same time the thing that makes it so good the humor the many unpredictable jokes become rather predictable once youre halfway through the film the once surprising effect gets lostid say that if youre still doubting about seeing this film dont its really worth it its refreshing fun to watch hilarious sometimes touching and contains a lot of exciting action shots it also features two of wade wilsons colleagues among the xmen colossus stefan kapicic and negasonic teenage warhead brianna hildebrand and as would say while pointing a gun at your face what are you still doing here huh get the hell out of here and go watch the movie do we have deal huh,comedy
is a great movie the movie is very funny and entertaining and the action is amazing however the film is not perfect i have a couple of issues with it sometimes the cussing and dirty jokes can get tiresome or too much however it only got on my nerves once or twice during the film so it was not too much of an issue my only issue with the film is the origin while many of the origin parts are very entertaining once he gets to the place where he gets his powers i became very bored and was ready for it to return to the scenes however i think only ten minutes total was when i was bored so i definitely still really loved this film and maybe when i rewatch the film the origin wont bother me who knows the film is outstanding though ryan reynolds gives quite possibly the best male acting performance of the year as wade wilsonhe is he is absolutely amazing morena baccarin as vanessa was also great everyone in this film did a really good job the movie is very very funny there were probably only 14 jokes i didnt laugh out loud at the movie is great i dont think its the best of the year but it is definitely in my top 15 movies of the year i would give the movie a 910,comedy
though it has been hailed as an original and groundbreaking addition to the superhero universe i can call this only a step in the right direction yeah it was fun to see a movie that mocked some of the tropes of superhero movies but aside from that it was mostly lcd entertainment if nothing else it was not annoying in the way that superhero movies tend to be nobody was miraculously resurrected and the world was not at stake in any way which was nice i think mostly the creators felt like there should be a super movie that didnt have to cater itself to young audiences but if you really get down to it there is very little that is truly original about this movieas our antihero main goal is for the audience to have fun and basically love him even as he mutilates bodyguards and special ops left and right he certainly has a presence and personality always ready to pull out a sarcastic line regardless of his mood his relationship with vanessa was believable and not much more there are two main problems that i have with his character first he believes that vanessa will not want him back because of his ugliness this felt like a kind of oldfashioned sentiment that in other forms has been used in a number of fairy tales and fairy tale movies like the frog prince shrek second he has too much fun killing people now he does have a strong motive for fighting the people he does but his lighthearted mood in the action scenes is rather heartlessthe other characters dont get too much attention in fact they really dont exceed the stereotypes given to them in the opening credits francisajax is nothing special in terms of villains he just has a menacing presence and takes what wade wants colossus is the voice of good to wade but gets his advice mercilessly shot down vanessa may not be a multidimensional character but she at least has some personality and is not a dreamy airhead like many loveinterestsi was a little disappointed in the comedy that was included it was funny much of the time and a lot of the jokes felt original but there just could have been more i guess part of the problem was that some of the lines are only funny once and most of them were used in the trailers still there is a lot of variety in the style of humor which is a major plus and it is presented in entertaining ways i most enjoyed the budget jokes and colossus unfinished hero speech at the endif you hate superhero movies this will be fun for you to see but probably wont be all that you were hoping for if you like superhero movies youll still enjoy this and be able to laugh along with it for those of you who have doubts watch the first fifteen minutes and see what you think as i said i was a bit disappointed but if they come out with 2 i would be willing to see it overall rating 8110,comedy
its true to its comics and thats the best thing about this filmhowever the only thing that held this movie back was a lot of culture jokesits essential for people to understand the joke so you need to use references that majority of the world would knowand this wasnt the case for this movie a lot of jokes involved celebrities popular mostly in america thus i did not understand the jokes i understood most of them but imagine some less informedthe plot wasnt rushed nor too slowactors where fantasticmusic greatbut overall great movie,comedy
i have to admit that i am a huge fan of after reading the comics and trades i was excited when marvel announced that they were finally going to make a moviei had liked ryan reynolds as green lantern but when i found out that he was cast to play wade wilson the merc with a mouth i was one happy fangirl and i have to say he did not disappointmarvel had fun with this film all the characters were perfectly cast it was fun watching negasonic teenage warhead brianna hildebrand interacting with trading snark for snark while colossus stefan kapii as the voice of colossus is trying in vain to appeal to better saner side without success ajax and angel dust ed skrein and gina carano were good strong villains but it was leslie uggams as blind al that really stole the moviethe rest of the supporting cast played their roles well and created a good strong background for the main castit was also nice to see that marvel finally got character right for a change and i loved the fact that constantly breaking the fourth wall was included and a brief glimpse of bob popped up to the delight of the audiencethe movie was filled with chaotic images and kept up a frantic pace that suited the movie perfectly the constant tongueincheek references and humour kept the movie from becoming too darkall in all was a winner and i am looking forward to the sequel,comedy
so  a character which was butchered in xmen origins but here he is again taking the stage all by himselfits so funny explicit humorous and hit all the right chords of an r rated comedy about a hero who definitely kills more than villains firstly this movie works because of the freedom it received and without any intervention from anyone it does what it should do it makes you laugh filled with wierdly funny jokes and amazing action sequencesand ryan reylonds is absolutely amazingly fantastic where was he all those years ago his portrayal deserves him an oscar but academythis film from stating the films cast and title till the end credtis roll is a full on laughter ridei mean this is the film that makes fun of the x men timeline and states thats confusingthis is the one that points out that the xaviers mansion blows up in every x men moviei will not go further on the story though since you should watch it and be surprised but i can tell you every thing u loved or hated about a superhero movie is being laughed at in this flickgo and watch,comedy
if you are easily offended than you are probably one of the people that have said this is the worst marvel movie ever if you dont actually know anything about or even marvel in general then you are probably one of the people that gave this movie a one star rating if your sense of humor is lacking then you wont enjoy this movie i see so many people talking about how acted like a 13 year old throughout the entire movie but what is funny to me is the fact that in todays society 13 year olds are the quickest to be offended by everything and every negative review brought up the use of the f word in this movie seriously people do you not know what an r rating is have you not ever seen a tarantino movie in my opinion if you didnt like this movie then you know nothing about or you decided to hate it before watching it because it was too popular its a great movie cant think of one flawbottom line is its just a hilarious and action packed movie and ryan reynolds is great there are so many marvel fans out there now most of which have never picked up a comic book not everything out there marvel related is captain america and iron man and in case you missed it is not a hero do more research on what youre about to be watching because if youre a cringer you should just stick to the cookiecutter comic book characters go get offended by something thats actually offensive,comedy
i think is a great movie and i would rate it 10 out of 10 i say this because it has tons of humorous action in this film but also it shows you what different acts people can make towards trying to make its viewers laugheven though it may not be for younger audiences it shows you how life can turn from very good to crap but just because some medical things happen doesnt stop you from trying to change the world before your gonei think that if you enjoy comic book humor and kind of dirty minded films this is exactly for someone like you i enjoy it myself because it is kind of perverted yes but it has so much humor and it shows you how bad life can really be for some people these are some reasons of why i would rate a 10 out of 10 movie,comedy
a highly enjoyable balls to the wall comedy action flick that knows exactly what it is and never takes itself too seriously for me marvel comics has created many of the best and most watchable blockbusters on the market right now and this does not disappoint extremely sarcastic and willing to poke fun at other marvel characters and even the actors who play them which makes for a superb look at and his antihero mentality ryan reynolds is absolutely perfect for this role and simply no other actor could play this part with such ease and confidence the way ryan does jokes land and are laugh out loud the action sequences are excellently done with comedy even thrown in and the story keeps you thoroughly entertained throughoutoverall a completely unique and refreshing look at the hero genre and a mixture of original comedy action and good old bad ass fun,comedy
there rarely exists a time when i actually like a superhero movie but is an exception in the way that its different from most superhero moviesnow i tried not to join the hype train in fear of disappointment but fortunately i was not disappointed in the slightestapart from that has lived up to everyones expectations and most definitely has surpassed mine at first i thought it was going to be another bland superhero movie with little to no backstory of the main character but boy was i wrong surprisingly there was a enough of the story to make me feel emotionally attached to this characterand of course there are things being exploded balls being busted and above all awesomenessif your like potty jokes and awesomeness in general than what are you waiting for go watch it,comedy
deadpool2016 starring ryan reynolds morena baccarin gina carano tj miller ed skrein brianna hildebrand jed ress and karan soni directed by tim miller review you know i didnt think i was going to see this movie because while i may be eighteen i have no id but luckily my father took me man im glad cause this is one of the best superhero films just not the best rrated one based upon marvel comics most unconventional antihero tells the origin story of former special forces operative turned mercenary wade wilson who after being subjected to a rogue experiment that leaves him with accelerated healing powers adopts the alter ego armed with his new abilities and a dark twisted sense of humor hunts down the man who nearly destroyed his life this is a comic book that does not acknowledge itself but damn as heck feels like one with his balls out their humor and crazy costumed hero this movie was trying to get off the ground for years by ryan reynolds who felt he owed it to fans of the character to give them the they wanted after relentless backlash for both xmenorigins wolverine and his green lantern movie he damn well did owe us and he delivered it may be the most fun i have had in a comic book movie but that doesnt automatically make it the best but its one of the best not better than two films i could mention but the point is that you will fall in love with deadpool,comedy
the funniest nonclich and superior superhero movie ive ever seen as a character is unlike any hero youve ever seenhe has no qualms with blowing a bad guys head off with his pair of nine millimeter pistols or cutting them off with his twin katanas hes mixing it up with both the onscreen baddies and the audiencea superhero film is only as good as the actor playing him and if ever an actor was meant to play it is ryan reynoldsryan reynolds the king of charming smartness hits the big timebut its undeniably true that im in the minority here as reynolds has never been able to break through with audiences in a real or enduring way every effort to turn him into a legit action star has been met with stony silence if not open contempt,comedy

the new age of superhero movies shows how meta references and involving an expanding world of superheroes can create an entertaining flickisnt an average hero who has noble intentions or wants to save the world for the right reasons is in it for the revenge and to make something out of his worthless life i saw bravery and true potential from him in the start when he was willing to risk his life for a girl whos boyfriend wouldnt leave her alone most wouldnt care or get involvedhe undergoes experiments to transform his body into a super mutant but instead is betrayed by the mad scientist to become a slave while in not usually a fan of self aware films that pretend to be intelligent or witty yet this turned out to be a hidden gemryan reynolds has come along way from being a pretty face and a one note actor to be a leading man he brought heart and conviction to this rolethe xmen extras felt a little phony and not true to form of the characters we seen portrayed in the xmen series yet i found a certain appeal in their willfulness to risk livelihood and loved ones for the greater goodthe leading lady willing to over look psychical beauty for the man inside was touching she didnt care what anyone thought or how strange they looked in public you dont get depth like that in super hero movie or kickassstill it leaves the question on if is gay straight or bi since some of the action or phases he sprouts are questionable about his sexualitythe final fight scene was magnificent and kept you guessing will he save the girl or let her go to save mankind it was heartbreaking funny and touchingit earned all ten stars dont be put off commercials that dont do it justice,comedy
i understand it could of done better however loads of people rated this 1 star out of 10 have you frigging seen the opening credits that was awesome i mean starring gods perfect idiot that is awesome the cast was amazing the flashbacks were good and this film had some funny jokes if you are over the age of 15 and have not seen i assure you go and watch it this film was awesome tim miller ryan reynolds and much more help from loads of people made this film for a long time it was worth it colossus was amazing in this negasonic teenage warhead was brilliant and the damn british villain was outstanding i dont understand how anyone can really hate this this was a good success,comedy
ryan reynolds demeanor is perfect for this role the movie is an excellent blend of action humor and excitement it catches you from the start and holds your attention throughout the special effects are great the flow of the movie jumps around a bit but is done properly and conforms to the story references to the x men may suggest a possible merge of characters from this movie in the future i think that would be an amazing addition to the x men genre as it would bring the humor into that series however that would also have possible effect on the ratings or they would have to tone down the character in the movie or at least limit his appearances to avoid the crudeness and violence that would give it the r rating as the warnings have stated this is not for children,comedy
ok it was an origin story  again i dont know how many more super hero movies  especially origin stories  i can takebut this one killed it and for a couple different reasons first of all it was fun funny sexy and almost gratuitously violent hey im a north american movie watcher i like those as much as the next guy i found their approach to sexuality hilarious  one nice big montage get all that super steamy sex out of the way so that boom we can go back to the plot the violence was great  i thought they could have done more to establish the fact that wade wilson was a badass apexfighter pre healing factor or shown some training montages after his powers or something to justify his triplesowcow aerialmarksmen maneuvers lol and i thought the fight between him and francis at the end would have been more realistic if francis who had enhanced reflexes took less hits while wade with normal albeit peak reflexes just kept taking hit after hit but wearing francis down gradually aside from that though epic fighting and i loved itbut finally i think part of the reason it was a success was the mockumentary style  like the office  of wade constantly breaking the fourth wall like in the comic book it was hilarious and added new levels of humour it also allowed the character to comment ironically on himself and his situation and connect with the audience in a new way through that the lines themselves were funny too and the delivery excellent but the mockumentary fourth wall style turned out to be super conducive to getting viewers to connect with the character which is particularly important given his anti hero status  we forgive wade for a lot because of his brief asides to us excellent flick highly entertaining one of my favourite lines was when wade is talking about being good looking and asks do you think ryan reynolds got by on his acting method i thought that was hilarious  and then watched as the same ryan gave an excellent performance while looking like a diseased avocado well done ol boy,comedy
im only writing this review to argue with those who gave it 1 star what the f is wrong with you sure it wasnt the best movie ever made but it deserved at least a 6 and the reasons you gave were not all valid like 1 thinks hes a stand up comedian even though his jokes are not funny  thats who he is if he didnt spit out some lame and pointless jokes every ones in a while than he wouldnt have been a good now would he2 the villains intentions are not clear  yes they are as francis clearly states that they were going to give wade super xmen powers and create the version from wolverine origins so brainwash and use him however they want to3 women worship bs  of coarse the chick had to save the day the movie was released on valentines day and a ton of girlfriends were forced to watch the movie at the theaters or secretly wanted anyway because of ryan reynolds 4 for whoever said that isnt funny because its not quotable youre gonna die in 5 minutes pi only used an arrogant tone  swear words because its a review i actually respect your opinions and all so id like to apologize about that,comedy
vile offensive and insane with no redeeming social value at all in other words it was awesome is what happens when you take the usual superhero movie mix it with an antihero drama and then decide to make it an action comedy the movie is super meta with vile language and adult situations so this is not for the littles this is one of ryan reynolds better movies but that isnt exactly a ringing endorsement this is less a superhero movie and more a revenge fantasy that becomes a twisted love story somewhere along the way not for the faint of heart anyone with a low tolerance for vulgarity or for anyone who takes superhero movies seriously this is fun and vulgar and funny vulgar but it doesnt pretend to be anything else,comedy
so i took a look at the reviews and i found something most of the low ratings are complaining about talking too much the lack of using the budget to put more xmen in the film and the clichd and predictable plot well i have one thing to say to all of those people read a comic his character is supposed to be talking all the time making fourth wall jokes and overall being as raunchy and inappropriate as he can thats his character and it was pulled off perfectly the plot was simple but that was the point it wasnt supposed to be this deep thoughtprovoking movie this was supposed to be a fun rendition of the merc with a mouth and with the action in this film it was a great one this movie was a fun ride with plenty of jokes and a few somber moments sprinkled in there but if you dont like raunchy humor at all if youre not a fan of the main character not believing there even is a fourth wall if you dont like the way the character is supposed to be or a simple and fun movie then this isnt for you otherwise buy this movie because you will love it,comedy
if you compare this to other dc and marvel films is not an outstanding film yes it does have some scenes that are offinece and rude and racist but its not that bad of for an anti hero film here are some of the things that i did and did not like about this film 1 some scenes are rather inaporepet at times which could of been cut out of the film and be an bonus feather on the dvd and blu ray release 2 i think the film is a bit overrated giving it an 82 on imdb i think at least give it an 73 instead just because some of the sexual scenes are a bit too much i do like this movie as it is one of my favorite scif but the sex scenes where a bit too much overall its a great film if you dont take it too seriously 710,comedy
is a great marvel film some say its the best some say its not this is my opinion has good comedy en well directed action and dialogue between a handful of interesting characters which most of have important value to the story also cgi is well incorporated with the moviestory those where some positive points the negative point is that the movie makes a lot of jokes about clich superhero storys but has quite a clich story itself still great movie imdb makes me have 10 lines so let us write random words film cheese marvel coockie space sword line imdb we are almost done with writing stupid lines almost come on this takes for ever thanks for reading my review on deadpool,comedy
youre probably thinking my boyfriend said this was a superhero movie but that guy in the red suit just turned that other guy into a fcking kebab well i may be super but im no herodespite the feeling of satiety when it comes to superhero movies i still had to see this new hero from the marvel stable now you didnt need much to persuade me to watch it certainly not after i saw the revealed trailer last year immediately i was convinced that this could become a mega blockbuster it was so brilliant and witty trust me i was sick and tired of the world of the avengers xmen and superspiderman besides guardians of the galaxy and antman most superhero movies were just a copy from the previous episodes another storyline but with the same principle guardians of the galaxy antman and are an exception to that rule a refreshing breeze through the superheroes universeright from the opening credits you know what to expect a mixture of bluntly spectacular action and sharp unabashed humor is some douchebags film and as protagonist gods perfect idiot with a hot chick to take revenge on a british villain with the help of a moody teen and a cgi character produced by asshats written by the real heroes here and directed by an overpaid tool you can read this during the opening shot with the camera zooming out in slow motion during a devastating carcrash maybe its not highlevel humor but its an indication that you shouldnt take it all seriously a crossfire of sarcastic sexual and provocative oneliners throughout the whole film is an outsider at all levels who uses both selfdeprecating and offensive text lines the humor is sometimes as explicit as the violence used in the movie graphic violence with well thought sarcasm is exactly the combination i love the mostryan reynolds could drop his acting talent since he wears the mask practically the entire movie i have no doubts about his abilities as an actor certainly not after seeing him in mississippi grind and woman in gold the mediocre movies in which he turned up ripd safe house and green lantern were from a significantly lower level but this was certainly not due to reynolds but rather because of a measly movie script in physical stamina agility and speaking skills are more important than acting skills his greatest merit is his perseverance to get this project realized despite the resistance of the marvel despots after a cameo in xmen origins wolverine his obstinacy and the enthusiasm of the upporters made sure this film was realized thank god for thati include this highly entertaining and overthetop movie in the list of most successful movies of the year for all i care they can think up a few sequels even though i thoroughly hate sequels as long as the concept stays intact and both humor and action are of an equivalent level fascinated me so much that even the presence of gina carano didnt bother me ed skrein showed again that hes cut out for a role as crazy villain and that participating in a monstrosity as the transporter refueled was a misjudgment one thing is clear though havent you seen this flick put on a red latex suit place yourself in front of a widescreen television and have fun with this unpretentious antiheromore reviews here  httpbitly1kidqmt,comedy
i avoided this movie when it was in the theaters but recently i was on a long haul flight and watched this movie i thought i would probably give up on it after 30 minutes and move on to another selection this isnt the sort of movie i would normally watch but im so glad that i did ryan reynolds played his part beautifully  hes good in comedy i love his dry sense of humor the special effects were spectacular and there was a reasonable storyline to follow i was enthralled from start to finish one minor criticism  the overuse of bad language  had it been used less it would have been more effective and have more impactif youre like me and avoid all kind of superhero movies give this one a go it really is better than you probably imagine the consistent foul language is a bit of turn off but apart from that its an enjoyable spoof and send up of this genre i have no hesitation recommending this movie,comedy
an ex special forces mercenary who finds love is diagnosed with cancer and out of desperation to live with his new found love accepts an offer in a dodgy experiment to become a mutant with super healing powers to cure his illness but the price is literally hideous and atrociously torturous so is born and he sets out on a rampage for revenge on the people who so deceitfully made him the thing he has becomeanyone who doesnt like this movie has a very dismal sense of humour its so hilarious and ryan renolds gets let lose in his hilarity in this this part is made for him like iron man for robert downey jr it is much more violent and explicit than the usual xmen franchise but its part of the entertainment for is no hero nor a bad guy either i found myself crying with laughter this is such an off beat unpredictable movie i loved it not for kids folks thats for sure another fantastic marvel flick,comedy
though this movie was good and i gave it a 8 doesnt mean i fully liked it as a lot of people have mentioned is going to be the mostbadass movie coming and it will be so hilarious regardless of the nasty sexual humor in the movie i think it still missed some spice to be a great movie i actually liked how it was built to be a clich with the bad guys with bad guys versus good guys that might not be that good after allin a nutshell a nice movie with too much hype the music in the movie added a really nice input since it was planned well with the scenes  the movie was easy to watch and it was something that i didnt really need to fully pay attention to i actually multi tasked while watching and i still stayed aware of what happenedi recommend you to watch the movie though if you havent yet its nowadays a good thing to know what the movie was like because after all it is quite popular,comedy
was a pretty good movie just wish the studios would make up their minds about how they want the characters to look like and keep it they way and at the same time keep it close to the original comic character as possible first the had him in wolverine with swords as arms too funny i mean when did colossus become russian and think they could have picked a better known xmen other than negasonic to be in it i hope they get it right in the squeal but over all was a decent movie just sucks that its rated r for people with kids who like xmen and wolverine 3 is supposed to be rated r also kids are gonna be disappointed againand they need to stop messing around and make a movie about gambit,comedy
i am writing a review for most likely one of the best movies of all time first i would like to discuss the plot of this movie the plot of this movie is a mercenary who meets a beautiful women falls in love leaves the business of killing people and right when everything is going well he gets news that he has cancer that will more than likely kill him so as he is sitting in the bar having a couple drinks contemplating his situation he gets offered a way of getting his cancer cured but in exchange he becomes a test subject that will make him appear as a freak but have powers of a mutant after he gets free after he puts the facility on fire he search down for the man who tortured him for months and at the end he ends up finding him but only at the cost of his wife being kidnapped there does end up being a happy ending and considers joining the x men now although the ending is no different from most super hero endings i still was extremely connected to the plot and i dont even know why the humor aspect of it was also very good the whole time i was watching the movie i was literally dying of laughter this is why i gave this movie a 910 and if the director is seeing this keep up the good work,comedy
just the kind of fresh blood this genre needed superhero films and modern pop culture at large really have been ripe for satire for some time now and is a great vehicle for bringing that about without feeling disingenuous or trashing the original character along the way the first hour is basically one long dose of fan service sharp and egregious with both wit and weaponry the seams show through in a lot of the cgi but that just plays into the act and in a way adds to the films clunky diy charm ryan reynolds is really what makes the whole thing work both onscreen and off as he occupies the character with uncanny zeal and was instrumental in bringing the mercenary back from xaviers junkyard we stop short of the unhinged deranged depths of disconnected insanity that typify comic book persona and the closing act  happy ending feels forcefed but that seems like a small price to pay otherwise its effective at becoming what it set out to be a chaotic gratuitous shootfromthehip misadventure that blows stuff up decapitates bad guys and takes every opportunity to squeeze in a literal wink and nod at the viewing audience i had a ball,comedy
i really enjoyed because it is my kind of humor and the great thing about is that he kind of breaks the 4th wall and that is just amazing i think is about a guy wade wilson who have found love and suddenly out of nowhere gets cancer and he doesnt know what to do some guy says he can help and cure him and leaves a card with a phone number on wade then calls the number and ends up on an operation table in a underground lab they make him into someone special they say he can not leave and that he have to work for them wade escapes and sets out on a journey to hunt them down to make sure his loved ones is safe ryan reynolds is the perfect actor for i don think there is any other actor that could have pulled it off ryan is is ryan morena baccarin is a beautiful actor and a great actor for the part i dont think there is any of the actors in this movie that did not do a great job on their role the shooting and directing was great when i look at the cinematography in movies and series i compare them to the blacklist because the blacklist i think does it all perfect and was close i think to the same level the lighting was good as well and i dont think there was any scenes in the movie that didnt have good lightingthe music was awesome every song was so fitting to the scenesi am rating this 910 because it was everything i looked for in a movie about i am not giving it 1010 because there are very few movies worth giving 1010 and i dont want to give it away to everything,comedy
when was announced and the first trailer started to roll i was hugely hyped since there were no other actor other than ryan reynolds that i could think of portraying him i still remember the filthy mouthed guy that struck me in blade 3 with his fk me sideways line and the trailer was so promising that i started to have doubts if the rest of the movie could be as funny and raw as the trailer these days you watch so many trailers that are better than the whole movie so i had my concerns so i went to see when it premiered and boy was i blown away from the first second this movie brilliantly gets right in the middle of the plot during the action and flashes back and forth making the viewing of the movie interesting and does not bore you for a second i knew that the merc with the mouth was a filthy filthy mouthed antihero but the level of profanity and foul language is so high and disgusting that i am amazed that high executives gave the green light for such a blockbuster i wont go into many details but the movie is extremely funny and raw with so many dick jokes as anyone can handle but at the same time is very sweet and tender it is actually a love story clothed with explosive action and sick humor it is very well directed with the proper pace it takes the time to let you know about the protagonist it doesnt take things for granted nor does it demand that you should have read a million comic books in order to get it it provides the back story with a great back and forth movement it also has so many easter eggs that it would probably require another 2hour movie to analyze everythingso to wrap it up this is a hilarious movie with the best casting decision for a superhero equally awesome as robert downey jr who nailed iron man and became an immortal god now if you are easily offended hate the foul language and the occasional butt plugging of reynolds then you should probably pass if you want to see a thought provoking movie go and rent primer if you have kids and want to go to see the movie good for you youre an awesome parent but be aware in this movie some things cannot be unseen so if you fall in the above category of easily offended people you enter at your own risk,comedy
when this movie was announced i was a sceptic as to weather they could pull it off and im glad they did manage to pull it off the jokes are funny and are made funnier by the delivery i could not imagine another actor other than ryan reynolds playing he was a brilliant choice the film was completed with his voice and charm as he managed to break the fourth wall excellently the best use of breaking the fourth wall that i have seen in any other film or playyet i felt towards the end of the movie that they lost the charm that was with the movie to begin with and it ended rather abruptly i understand that it had to come to an end i just would have preferred a funnier ending the film over all was beautifully played im just nitpicking over the ending,comedy
okay everyone knows of the god awful film that shall not be named that sealed the merc with the mouths mouth right well destroys that movies to kingdom comeis a crazy deadly hilarious crazy 4th wall breaking dirty talking crazy mercenary who kicks bad and sometimes good guys to get what he wants and thats exactly what we gotryan reynolds is as much as hugh jackman is the wolverine robert downey junior is iron man reynolds and the rest of the cast had brilliant and hilarious momentsnot to mention the marketing team did an amazing job purely showing what would do if he was in the world if you have a friendwifesisterauntgrandma okay maybe not grandma and theyre girls tell her ryan reynolds is in it women including me love this movie note dont take kids under 12 theyll say dont worry its just a marvel movie its rated ma in australia and r for the rest of the world,comedy
well its about timefor so many years weve suffered through the moralising of batman superman and any number of xmen or women oh and dont get me started on spiderman and his with great power comes great responsibility waffle theyre all so anxious obnoxious and tediousbut now we have deadpoolheres a superhero i can get behind not the same way his girlfriend gets behind him not that theres anything wrong with that hes a dude who fights the bad guys the way they fight nasty how many times have we seen superman smash a baddie and stop short of killing the guy to hand him over to the authorities just for said villain to escape again doesnt suffer from such niceties as justice or compassion he shoots first and asks questions later much later like the next day while the coroner is sifting through the remainsis a guy who just gets the job done and doesnt need to moan about it to his butler in his billion dollar mansion while two supermodels polish his furniture in fact his alterego wade wilson lives in a fairly spartan apartment with a blind woman for company and what seems to be a cache of weapons and ammunition big enough to take down isis hes a bluecollardowntoearth former soldier with outstanding recuperative skills thanks to a recent brush with a mad scientist not crazy mad angry mad at waderyan reynolds was born for this role hes funny and annoying which is huge improvement on his green lantern effort where he was just annoying his costars are just along for the ride which is wildly violent extremely crude and so unlike every other superhero film its an instant classicnot a kids film or a date film unless your girlfriend recommends it in which case go then marry her on the way home,comedy
spoilersthe director makes his pointthat the movie is pointless  stupid but extremely amusing and entertaining clear from the very beginning he aims at creating an uncut action hero movie with smart dialogs good acting along bitter humor and he hits it he took the risk and tried to avoid the basic structure of hero movies that have so intensely inundated the cinema that it is hard to differentiate them from each other the storytelling is good  it keeps the audience interested but still it seemed that the first part of the movie is a bit long it would be better to stick to present story earlier and intricate it morethe movie overall appeared a little bit short for meheres a summary for the plot ryan reynolds is a former mercenary with a loving girlfriend who is diagnosed by cancer and while searching for a cure he becomes a victim of an evil scientists experiment  leaving him disfigured with supernatural healing powers he becomes a superhero and decides to revenge the plot is easy to grasp and the way it is told keeps audience engaged and amusedthough at the end it gets too predictable  waited for more unique onebrings one of the most hilarious fictional character from marvels universe to life in a really unique way the humor is refreshing and funny waited more about the taxi drive at the end the dialogs are smart and many scenes are amusing along with being brutal violent and sexy  a fairly r rated movie soundtracks are pretty decent and enjoyable the action scenes were incredibly well done with just 55million budget  which is almost 14 of typical hero movies with a lot of beautifully elaborated details reynolds is incredible as he fits the character really well the great chemistry he has with costar morena baccarin gives a good emotional core to the movie and eventually surprises audience by the love story that is one the most honest ive ever seen in a superhero movie  so is a decent comedy action  heromovie that offers audience a smart humor dirty sexual scenes violence wellcrafted action scenes and amusing story telling that will probably make you feel engaged and entertained for 2 hours,comedy
let me first say ive never read a comic i did however read enough to give his character some background so i wasnt going in blindthe upside is this movie is accessible to even those who go in blind it doesnt pull any punches though or try to soften the character or try to be anything but a great action flick with lots of inappropriate humor lucky for me i love that kind of humorthe only complaint i can say i have of the film and im not even saying its a huge complaint more like a minor nuisance was the pacing it felt like it jumped back and forth a bit too much not in a hard to follow way just in a lets progress the plot and not keep going back sort of wayother then that i cant say theres anything id have changed fight scenes were amazing acting was imo great music felt like it fit the movie rather then a studio trying to push an album camera work and lighting were well donethis movies not going to win any oscarssadly but it shows what a violent super hero movie can bewould love to see the next wolverine movie go this route some are saying kick ass was better having seen both films i appreciate what both brought to the table not knocking one or the other if i had to say this movie was comparable to anything else id say a mashup of kingsman meets kick assi want to say so much about the plot but wont ruin it for anyone lastly ill just ad that this is the first super hero movie ive written a review for ive seen watchmen batmanall of them supermanalmost all of them x everything and am looking forward to seeing both suicide squad and batman vs supermanim not a dc or a marvel im a comicmovie lover if you have questions feel free to ask me if there are any spoilers ill use the spoiler block so as not to ruin it for anyonesorry for my all over the place review hope this sheds some light for those who are wanting to see it i only gave it an 8 because 9 and 10 are at least for me more for movies that are powerful emotionally as well,comedy
he finally gets his movie after a laughable appearance in the groan inducing xmen origins wolverine ryan reynolds is back bringing wade wilson the merc with a mouth the regenerating degenerate and a whole paragraph of other monikers to the big screen with what is possibly the most faithful portrayal of a comic book character to date in live actioni watch this and i am convinced that ryan reynolds has never existed he has always been wade wilson deep down inside and this movie is showing up his true self he is perfect exactly like the more comedic of recent years but with enough of the bad ass 1990s so as not to come across like any other lovable loser read the comic watch the movie play the game whatever it will be the exact same character you know and lovekicks off with one of the most uniquely imaginative tongueincheek opening sequences to over grace the silver screen keep wikipedia and a counter handy for all the pop culture references the movie defies genre it defies convention it throws us right into the thick of the action unlike many comic book character origin stories we do not get bogged down by a lengthy first act setting up the eventual birth of the superhero where the titular character is only seen in his civilian self without powers or the iconic costumes for the obligatory tragic backstory we get flash backs interspersed with the ongoing altercations just as the flashback looks like it will start to drag we are snapped right back into the whizzing bullets blood and twin blade actionthe overall plot is a little bit derivative but in this day and age with eons of creative history behind movie making what else isnt it is the execution the energy instilled by director tim miller and the well timed well written clever humour soaked into the script by writers rhett reese and paul wernick of zombieland fame we arent talking the cartoony quips or snide banter of disneys marvel movies this is smart actually humorous befitting of the film and filled to popping point with pop culture references if all sorts yet is not some laughaminute comedy ryan reynolds completely sells even the more sombre scenes with such earnestly for the first time i actually feel bad for poor ol wade and all the crap he had to go through before he became reynolds sells the heartbreak and the torment in a perfectly nuanced performance but more importantly he sells the utter glee and satisfaction of sweet violent vengeance the film earns its m18 rating with nudity swearing and bloody violence though i still consider those tastefully restrained for an adult oriented film of such rating we never get excessive thus allowing the writing and direction to shine without being marred by the spectacle or eye candy the music by junkie xl accompanies the eye candy and honestly is nothing spectacular your standard electronic action samplings but the soundtrack consisting of classic songs is amazing the songs chosen and the scenes they are paired with either fit perfectly within the context of those scenes or create this comedic dissonance that enhances the mooda bit of the backstory has been changed from the comics as are the villains ajax but his name is francis and angel dust here they are devoid of their outlandish costumes and garbed in your bryan singeresque black civilian outfits on the flip side we are introduced to two xmen supporting characters idealistic metal skinned muscleman colossus the big dumb giant and brooding time bomb literally negasonic teenage warhead somehow the good guys retain some outlandish comic book traits colossus is no longer the chrome clad pretty boy in xmen days of future past but a hulking lunkhead who is a dead ringer for his comic book counterpart negasonic is altered somewhat from the comics but she now sports a more traditional black and yellow suit like the classic xmen uniforms was this contrast between colourful good guys and drab baddies an intentional jibe at the black leather look of bryan singers xmen movies every once in a while a magnificent piece of work comes along to sweep you off your feet into an imaginative mind boggling masterpiece of modern cinema throughout one can feel the absolute passion that the cast and crew brought to the project the story is a tragic romance worthy of romeo and juliet washed out soldier finds the love of his life and prepares to settle down he finds out he has cancer and leaves hoping to spare his loved one the pain of seeing him waste away it is also a science horror flick worthy of david cronenberg as that man gets betrayed to an unscrupulous scientist who conducts torturous experiments on him it is a revenge thriller on par with a tarantino movie in wade wilsons vendetta tracking down his old tormentors in hopes of finding a cure for his affliction lastly it can be considered the wittiest most clever most violent rrated action comedy film of the decade,comedy
this movie i must say is sexy funny action packed emotional comedy full of rage blood sex and what not this movie is bloody awesome i mean to say bloody the starting credits were awesome unlike all other movies which has names in it ryan reynolds was awesome and i mean to say sexily awesome the most sexy thing about this movie was morena baccarin brilliant acting by her she looked hot the starting segment with karan soni dopinder was totally hilarious and finally after the credits scene was totally mindblasting literally laughing my a off this movie is total package of action sex comedy blood lots of blood i will still be watching this movie in hindi a total blockbuster kudos to the team,comedy
readily accessible wit and selfmockery sooo much popculture and gore and not a moments respire  just the way i love it the jokes keep coming and they are not getting old on the contrary albeit being quite simplistic they remain refreshing and enjoyable all characters are adorable even the evil francis who tries very hard to be a super villain with a badass name the allusions game is strong in this one the unrelenting humour transpires beyond dialogue through the costumes attitudes even settings from movies to commercials to marvel mythology the selfreferences never stop do you think ryan reynolds relied on his acting skills to get this one   what better way to market and celebrate the industry than by beautifully trashing it at every turn its a fantastically violent mutant ninja romcom  with superheroes and the main character mr pool who promises a wild and strange ride from the beginning delivers,comedy
really made me see marvels movies in a very different way and made me expect much more from their already wonderful movies i was very worried when i heard of a movie being a reader myself but i must say theyve done an honor to first feature film the fightingviolence was very well done and more graphic than there has been in a marvel movie if marvel takes anything from this movie they should finally see and that regardless of the rating their fans will flock and awe over their movies and will be excited for every evolution that takes their movies one step closer to the comics regardless of the seriousness of the attitude,comedy
this movie is simply amazing i entered the theater with incredible expectations which i usually attempt to avoid because i do not want to be utterly disappointed however this movie is quite different not only did this move meet my high expectations but it exceeded them greatly ryan reynolds is my favorite actor and is my favorite character so this was doomed to fall short but it didnt the entire theater was in abrupt in laughter from the surprisingly historical opening credits there was even an applause after one gratuitous cameo nevertheless the action and fight choreography was stunning to say the least the jokes were endless and the fourth wallbreaking was incredible this self deprecating hero flawlessly played by reynolds was nothing short of spectacular i encourage everyone to see this movie over the age of 18 of course winky face,comedy
thanks to a anonymous source for leaking some fine test footage and after going through such a fantastic string of some of the best marketing i have ever seen for a film we have finally been granted the pleasure of receiving a rather satisfying film for our favorite antihero fox has finally done right after giving us basically the merc without a mouth with laser eyes and no sense of humor at allwe are finally given the right film where ryan reynolds finally has the chance to finally show his true form of howing off speedy parkourlike sword and gunplay as well as the mercs infamous mouth reynolds plays off this character unlike no other he was undoubtedly born to play this role his enthusiasm for the opportunity to play this characteris apparent in every scene whether cracking wise pausing ina tender moment or splatteringthe floor withan enemys bloodeach supporting character in this really included a specific purpose mirroring key elements of personality worldview as well as enduring the titular characters physical andor emotional abuse ajax and angel ed skrein  gina carano mostly play onenote bad guys for to punch but they do have a bit of importance colossus and negasonic teenage warhead are exceptionally a funny gag and dramatic conflict for not having the hugest of roles in the film weasel andblind al really showed some fine chemistry with wade and some really great humormorenabaccarin wadesequally sarcastic partnervanessa carlysle is an empowered presence the relationship between wilson and carlysle presentsone of the more developed and authentic relationships in the superhero genre thus far a relationship that shows as a human being not just as a costumed killer of bad guysfor first time director tim miller and writerspaul wernick  rhett reese we are packed full of such passionate direction sharp writing and exciting actionchoreography while succeeds as a clever change of pace inthe superhero movie genre miller wernick  reese give this film a great abundance of selfawareness showing our foul mouthed antihero breaking the fourth wall as well as poking fun at past failures of this character being such a huge fan there was a bunch of metagag humor pop culture references and a lot of winking genresatire that really had me rolling on the floor from so much laughteri really loved it was everything i wanted and more from a film it was fast paced action packed clever and most certainly hilarious it really took its rrating seriously with such audaciousabandon really basing it as an opportunity to revel the antiheros irreverence it was truly a great experience the film wont be for everyone especially for people who dont know the character as much as others tim miller has undoubtedly delivered a adaptation that at the absoluteleast introduces to audiences the real merc with a mouth if the films opening credits wont convince you enough i dont know what will,comedy
first of all i have never felt so strongly about a film to want to write a review so that says a lot about i loved every second of it casting definitely got it right this time ryan reynolds executes this character perfectly i was unsure of how his quick witted comedic style would fit into such a character but it seems like ryan was born for this role the actionfight scenes do not disappointi really couldnt find much i didnt like im usually not one for over the top raunchiness but there was just enough crude language and sexual innuendo to make it tolerable without taking away from the enjoyable components that i love to see in marvel films cant wait to see it again,comedy
was the perfect comic book movie ryan reynolds was born to play the character and the movie is a very good different kind of movie its fun to watch has great jokes its fun funny has great wallbreakers good amount of action you dont want the movie to end its been a while sense i seen a superhero thats this good and perfect ryan reynolds is inspiring in this movie makes you wanna become an actor so you can play a character like this this movie deserves to be on imdbs top movies it cant get better than that hoping to see more in the future one of the best superheroantiheros ever movie had a simple but fun story,comedy
this movie is inspired from the director to the writers the real heros indeed to the stars  everyone played their position to the teethis movie for me is not awesome because it depicted a road arguably never taken before its awesome because it took a route that should not be mirrored everthe love story was made butch via cursing boobs and mad action all at the right tempo and portions yet still at the heart of it all the love was marshmallow like sweet soft and pinkthe humour quite honestly was witty keen acute and executed with the same precision as the final shot kill three simultaneously skill achieved the budget was so well handled even if xaviers school dwindled to just 2 students also morena baccarin was sooooo hot like truly though ohhh my she really was the hot chickthis movie deserves an 810 definitely but not because of its plot or depth rather because of its execution however i hope through the possible misconception of the masses that it doesnt detriment or diminish the superhero age did what it did incredibly well the satire mockery indifference but im still a fan of intense drama scifi action thriller without question i still prefer the cap tony you know i wouldnt do this if i had any other choice but hes my friend iron man so was iearned its right to be what it is i just hope it doesnt pollute the rest of the poolalso gina carano was also hotcivilwar apocalypse doctorstrange dawnofjustice suicidesquad,comedy
review by mike smith fat mike a former special forces operative turned mercenary is subjected to a rogue experiment that leaves him with accelerated healing powers adopting the alter ego its been 7 years scene fox tried and failed at putting on the big screen well hes back i was worried about this film from the day it was talked about but fox did this movie right from start to finish this movie had me laughing non stop the writing was well done and in my opinion feels loyal to the comics this movie has pick up and go from the very start of the film to the end the action scenes are exciting fun and gory with a nice blend of comedy and hilarious one liners the acting is great everyone becomes their characters and makes you believe they are who they are playing which is one thing i look for in a film i believe no other actor could have played like ryan reynolds did the one shocker was tj miller i feel like at time he can over act andor steal the show in he did an awesome job and blended nicely with the rest of the cast i cant wait to see the gag reel for this film you can tell everyone had a blast and it was a blast watching this film a big part of the movie is humor its not just dick and fart jokes one of the best humorous parts of the movie is the juxtaposition of the music also the film pokes fun at everything from the superhero movie clich to the studio being cheap and even ryan reynolds passed superhero movies all together has been my favorite superhero film since guardians of the galaxy with a great blend of mature comedy and action this film made me want to watch it again as soon as it was done shows the world that not all superhero films need to be family friendly cheers and remember life wont suck as long as there is a good movie to watch 10 10 edited by samantha lockefacebook page httpswwwfacebookcomfatmikesmoviereviews twitter fatmiketpkhow do i get my review score2  cast chemistry between cast acting and make me believe that they are the characters and not who they are 2 cinematography  directing sets scenery2 story 1 rewatchability 1 freshness  better then the sequel1 the ride is it funny action scary all around a good ride and worth a watch1 if i enjoyed it at all i know its a lame point but some movies maybe bad but i enjoyed it or the movie was good but i hate it,comedy
i had to make an account just because i think this movie deserves a higher rating than an 88  after being introduced to from hulk vs wolverine in 2009 i was hooked on him and he became my 3rd favorite marvel herovillain next to wolverine and spiderman i saw xmen origins in theaters and was pretty disappointed due to the fact they changed so much from the comics  but i was still sorta happy they added him anyway after waiting a whole 7 years for the movie i went in with mixed expectations  the trailers looked great but then again you cant judge a movie by its advertising  i was hoping it would be good but wasnt gonna cry if it wasnt and all i can say is wow this was definitely the best movie of 2016 as of now and one of the greatest movies ever made imo  it was an adrenaline rush full of laughs  sadistic villains  drama  4th wall breaking  a ton of pop culture and movie references  and intense fights between and ajax i never saw any movie like this because i dont think there is any movie like this ryan reynolds was born to play and if he doesnt take home an oscar this year nobody deserves one the movie also featured 2 xmen members  the comic accurate version of colossus and warhead whos another xmen member which i dont know to much about  but i do know this  they were both badass and the team up with was great congratulations ryan reynolds and tim miller you guys definitely deserve the 100mil has made at the box office and anyone who says otherwise probably isnt used to the character or what hes about  this movie is not for kids although i was actually really surprised at how many parents took theirs to see this and it was the only time i ever went to a theater and saw people actually dressed up as a character overall i give 10 chimichangas out of 10 ,comedy
starring ryan reynolds is the cinematic origin story for the merc with the mouth marvel superhero it follows wade wilson a wisecracking antihero who becomes the titular character after participating in a body enhancement program to overcome cancerwhat really makes this film work is its humor from the opening credits to the closing credits the jokes flow in a rapid fire of obscenity vulgarity and irreverence the film frequently breaks the fourth wall and takes aim at pop culture elements ranging from movie studios to ryan reynolds himself i was expecting a funny movie what i got was a hilarious movie reynolds absolutely nails the role of wade wilsonhe has the perfect personality and screen presence to embody the snarky antiheroic character his timing and delivery are impeccable it was also refreshing to see a superhero movie that does not shy away from showing graphic violence with the r rating the filmmakers were able to show much more than your average pg13 special effectsladen superhero movie the graphic visuals lent themselves well to the humor and the brutality of the action while i mentioned special effectsladen superhero movies as a contrast to this film there is quite a bit of cgi in some of it works some of it doesnt i was not a big fan of the cgi towards the end of the film the end sequence did not feel real to me due to what i would call fairly questionable cgi in addition while the dialogue of the script is witty and creative the structure of the story is mundane it follows the same beats and turns as many of the other superhero origin stories the film gets away with this for the most part because of its selfawareness but it would have been nice to have a more original story behind the great dialogueoverall this is definitely a film worth watching people who have been suffering from genre fatigue due to oversaturation of superhero movies may want to give this film a shot it doesnt reinvent the story wheel but its dialogue and bloody action raise this a notch above its contemporaries in the genre,comedy
the anticipated has arrived with fans either expecting it to be really great or awful but it turns out brilliantputting x men origins under the rug ryan reynolds returns as wade wilson the repulsive vial antihero for his local town but when diagnosed with cancer he is given the chance to become a superhero but obviously he takes this opportunity to do what he wants and mess about with a blend of his humour with his decapitating people skillsi can firmly say that ryan reynolds was born for this role and does actually kill the part in the film weve seen him in some funny films and some okay action movies but what he needed was a mix of the two to create the perfect film for him not implying anything as him as a person just his acting talent here we see all the key personalities of the violence the sexually motivated the constant humour and cool action of course the whole point of is being really silly talking to the audience referencing the film franchise itself it could be seen as stupid but no its so awesomei have never found the small humour in the other super hero films very entertaining but five minutes into i was already close to hystericsthe only thing that bugged me is the constant sexual references which is part of character but maybe there was too many for meis a clear 910 and much more entertaining and just so awesome than first thought and will not be a disappointment to fans,comedy

as many memes across social media have indicatedand i will reiteratethis movie is not for kids and no your kids are not the exception this is a super not hero and the not is important but you must see the movie in order to understand movie that is written for a mature audience from the groundbreaking selfaware opening credits to the perfectly paced and strategic adulthumor this movie is sure to have you laughing from beginning to end and its not just the writing that is super but the visual effects stunt sequences and fight scenes are far above par for this action movie genre ryan reynolds captures the character of so incredibly effectively that you will swear that he was made for this role not your disneymarvel movie fox and marvel bring you a spectacular combination of action and comedy to show off this unique antihero so to speak for fans of the comic and those who just enjoy a super moviesimply from the opening credits it is clear that this movie is incredibly selfaware and playing to the audience one hundred and ten percent best opening credits ever in terms of creativity and being an extension of the narrative itself the idea of a selfaware movie is not a common one to begin with and certainly not a trope of traditional superhero movies i think that is what i appreciated most about the movie the brilliance behind the selfawareness is that the film is equally selfaware as it does take itself seriously as a superhero movie never before have i witnessed the fourth wall being broken so incredibly much for those of you who do not know what breaking the fourth wall is in its simplest form it is when the character addresses the audience this is apparently an element that was brought over from the comic according to my comic and anime enthusiast coworker that went with me to screen the movie last night what makes continuous commentary so effective and entertaining is the fact that he says what many of us would be thinking given if we encountered the same scenario the candor is such a breath of reality within this world of fantasy or augmented realityso often a movie will either choose to rest upon its strong writing impeccable actingdirection or visual effects the sheer remarkable innovation in this movie is supported by not one but all the aforementioned elements ordinarily i am able to find flaws in a movieespecially within the superhero genrebut not this time i suppose the fourth wall was broken a little too much but that would be the only flaw i could identify sometimes a movie can be a great superhero movie but not a great film however exceeds expectations both as a superhero movie and as a film in and of itself at first thought you may feel that a movie with endless diegetic and nondiegetic commentary may overshadow or steel attention or coherence from the narrative itself but the writers did such a fantastic job of integrating the narrative and commentary so seamlessly that the movie is doubly entertaining as it would be without the offensive explicit hormonal commentary from the earthiest and most human of superheroes and yes i realize i am using superhero even though reminds me over and over again that he is not a hero but you get the idearyan reynolds is one of those actors who is equally talented as he is attractive and he gets to show off for this movie in ways that many actors wish they could in movies but it does not come off as obnoxious at all thats the beauty in the direction of this movie youd think that his over sexualizing of himself and the continuous adult commentary that he or the movie would play off as exceedingly obnoxious but youd be mistaken there is a perfect balance struck by the writers and director that enable to be a total douchebag but oddly enough in the most endearing way for fans of the xmen comics 90s cartoon or the xmen movies you will get to witness a crossover of movies in in an ever growing effort to recruit to join the elite mutant force lead by charles xavier colossus and negasonic teenage warhead confront this subplot is an important elements to because it helps to build foxs x men universe by bringing two franchiseswithout getting into a lot of ip intellectual property rights discussion despite the procurement of marvel in 2012 as long as fox keeps making xmen movies sony makes spiderman movies even though he is appearing in the avengers series and universal studios florida keeps modifying and improving attractions then disney does not have the rights to use the respective characters in movies or rides now ip rights are a little more complicated than that but i wanted to provide you with a general idea back to the crossover including the xmen in is strategically important for three simple reasons 1 as i mentioned earlier it helps to rebuild and reinforce the respective timelines of both franchises 2 it builds the foundation for a larger character universe much in the same way disney is doing with the avengers and related movies and 3 part of what makes so incredibly fascinating is his ability to play the antihero off of legitimate superheroes or as fox is able to officially call them mutantsif you are a fan of disneymarvels guardians of the galaxy and you are not a kid then you will definitely enjoy foxmarvels prepare yourself to experience a superheroaction movie like no other from being mesmerized at the stunning visual effects and editing to the incredibly funny writing and acting you are sure to be entertained and will definitely crave more good thing that has already received the green light for a sequel,comedy
this movie had everything one person could ask for gore action humor nudity love romance plot and of just plain perfect just when you thought ryan reynolds couldnt be more amazing than he already is he decides to give it his all in this movie really becoming thank you for the unique perspectives and the non stop laughingthe breaking wall approach to the movie and scene cuts were done beautifully i give the director a definite 3 thumbs up hey were all mutants right  i hope everyone takes the time to go see this one in the theater it is worth the moneyhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvflo9c9xe2xy,comedy
ryan reynolds returns once again as after his first appearance in xmen origin expect the unexpected in the most anticipated rrated superhero film of the year that will blow your brains out literallyafter the failure of rebooting fantastic four last year 20th century fox finally redeems itself with and takes a risk in releasing this with an rrating which is really rare for a mainstream superhero film these days but the result clearly shows that they made the right decision has a pretty basic plot about a guy getting revenge and killing people along the way while it may not have a fancy plot like other superhero movies the result is beyond satisfying and lives up to its premise the whole movie is filled with nonstop raunchy humour as well as a delightful amount of bloody violent action sequences that are refreshing and certainly will entertain the hell out of you throughout its running time this is a movie that totally deserves its rrating for strong violence and language throughout sexual content and graphic nudity im pleased to see that they didnt choose to go soft by giving it a pg13 rating to gain more audiences which in that case would have totally limit the movies potential thanks to that decision you all can now expect lots of violence and nasty dialogue and prepare to laugh your guts outalso the important element that makes all this all work is the cast ryan reynolds is perfect for this role which reminds us what a big mistake it was to shut his mouth in xmen origin here is just as foulmouthed and filthy as you expect him to be without a great supporting cast this movie wouldnt have been this satisfying tj miller rachel sheen brainna hildebrand as warhead and scenestealer leslie uggams as blind al all did a great job portraying their characters and adding a great comedic touch and chemistry with our and naturally balanced their performance really well and trying not to give anything away stan lee also has one of the best cameos you will ever see in a marvel movieoverall with its gleeful violence and nonstop raunchy humour turns its simple plot into the filthiest most entertaining and hilarious superhero movie in the marvel universea,comedy
this movie brought everything a movie should havecomedyso much comedy in the movie gory violencethere is so much blood in the movie that you are sitting in your seat and just staring at the scene with aweand the romance between wade and vanessa that it makes your heart get touchedthat is how deep this movie gets you you get so much laughs from wadeweasel even colossus for a brief moment but i dont really want to spoil the movie for you but if you are reading this then i advise you to go watch it now this is one of the best things marvel has done since the avengers nothing can really compare to this move today is 12216 it made over 11 million dollars on its first night its the highest any xmen movie has ever madei dont know how much it will make tomorrow or when ever your going to read this but in any case it was amazing,comedy
boy was this fun ryan reynolds should be commended on bringing to the screen because not many people would be able to rise above the criticism levelled at him over the years for both green lantern and xmen origins wolverine beyond that he should be commended for the performance he gives here he wears the classic costume with pride kicks complete ass in the action sequences and is in general the funnest protagonists to grace the comic book screen since peter quill and eclipses both chris pratt and robert downey jr with his sheer charm and humourafter one of the best opening credits sequences ever made we are treated with a cleverly interspliced story is hunting down his nemesis francis but this sequence on the bridge is cut between the origins of powers the filmmakers knew we would get bored by the same formula so they shake it up and keep us entertained thats not to say that the origin story isnt fun reynolds and a wonderful morena baccarin have enough chemistry to engage us with their love story in the same way that eisenberg and stewart did with american ultra ed skrein is an adequate villain i believe in you ed you can do great stuff with enough drips of smug malevolence to make his downfall desirable to the audience in the present theres some great work done by brianna hildebrand and stefan kapii as a pair of xmen who try to get to join their team both of them are so much fun that i found myself wishing for more of them on screen theres even a hilarious subplot about a taxi driver named dopinder which ends up serving the final film instead of being useless in stark contrast to sicariowhat accelerates is what everyone wanted from  humour fourth wall breaks and general irreverance masturbation and sex jokes are both crass and hilarious yes you can have both wilsons foul mouth wit and childish love for innuendo is absolutely irresistible but best of all are the constant digs at xmen films hugh jackman and especially ryan reynolds himself i was always holding out for the next fourth wall break and rarely did they disappoint me i adored the monty python inspired jokes and they worked superbly on all fronts the use of dmxs music is inspired and utterly wonderful i could find fault only with the action sequences which are choppy shaky and almost impossible to decipher i also felt that having established negasonics powers she was forced to sit on the sidelines to avoid overpowering the whole film that being said tim millers directorial choices for the most part were brilliant  especially a clichkicking wow that was awesome declaration by after what would inevitably be an omg wheres wade towards the films climax im glad that a debut director got his hands on this property because anyone experienced in the industry might have been tempted to give into the formula,comedy

2016 directed by tim miller cinema ryan reynold has tried to get this film off the ground for 10 years as he is a big fan of the character and desperately wants to make amends for how the character was butchered in the now defunct timeline of xmen origins wolverine it took the leaking of some old commissioned test footage that got comic fandom buzzing to finally get greenlit then reynolds and co wisely settled for a very low budget so they could keep the film r rated and have delivered a film very authentic to its origins for those unaware of he is a former special forces operative turned smart mouthed mercenary who is subjected to a rogue experiment that leaves him with accelerated healing powers adopting the alter ego he is part of the marvel universe or more specifically within big screen parameters the xmen universe he is famous for being the one character who constantly breaks the fourth wall and speaks to the readers directly or in this case viewers everything about his character is not the usual fare for superhero films which is half the reason he has never made it properly for this long reynolds was born for the role and he delivers with the help of a smart script that does not hold back and my shock many who are used to the pg super hero films of the last decade the supporting cast are great too and include some familiar characters there is no shakycam for the action which is great and it really delivers the budget may have been quite low comparatively but it rarely shows except for in the special effect in a small part of the finale this may end up being the funniest comedy of the year the best action film of the year the raunchiest r rated film of the year and it wouldnt surprise me if in a year when there are more high profile superhero films coming out than ever before that this ends up being at the top of that mountain too this is a smaller film that does not need for their to be earth destroying consequences to give it gravitas much like antman from last year the situation is smaller but the film has relationships set up and some heart as well but not unlike the daredevil netflix show the gloves are off here and they are way off and anything goes,comedy
youre probably thinking this is a superhero movie but that guy in the suit just turned that other guy into a fng kebab surprise this is a different kind of superhero story deadpoolryan reynolds titular is not like any other superhero in fact hes an antihero he murders men and women and murders language as well yet his unceasing banter is sometimes witty and full of cultural allusions especially to x men who would like him to join thembut hes not ready yet for he needs to track down the baddie ajax ed skrein who gave him a horrible face as a result of an experiment that cured his cancer and gave him supernatural powers in the course of the pursuit wade civilian name meets vanessa morena baccarin a darkhaired beauty who makes his life worth livingmost of the film is of course the usual cgi comicbook roughhousing but peppered with so much irony and sarcasm that its worthwhile just trying to catch half the tossedoff lines reynolds is a master of the one liners many of which can be found in the imdb sidebar quotes for example wait you may be wondering why the red suit well thats so bad guys dont see me bleed or i didnt ask to be super and im no hero but when you find out your worst enemy is after your best girl the time has come to be a fng superhero deadpoolanyway its the kind of dialogue best suited to adolescent boys but this arrested adult critic finds the dialogue entertaining and the movie a refreshingly sardonic take on an inviolate genre enjoy this out of the summerhero fest at a time of year when we all can welcome the relief from otherwise mediocre and boring fare,comedy
this was just it like the title says everything youd expect and morethe humor is there just as much as youd expect and than a little more but it isnt overwhelming theres seriousness as wellits the perfect mixture of everything the humor the mouth the story the intro is the credits are the after credits scene is deadpoolhe speaks to you he speaks to me hell even speak to your wifegirlfriendhusbandboyfriend who isnt into superhero movies because this isnt a superhero movie this is a deadpoolmovie or maybe a ryan reynolds moviethere are just so many things small and big that make this movie the story for those who dont already know it the small and the big references to the xmen the jokes oh the jokesthis movie is just marvelous go watch it,comedy
where shall i start with this hilarious actionpacked and witty film is a funny film from start to finish  the humour is laugh out loud funny the movie itself doesnt take itself totally seriously and this is perfect for a film like ryan reynolds truly was born to play this character as his dead pan or rather performance was very watchable morena baccarin is also very good as the main female lead of the film she adds another perspective on the piece overall ed skrein is a slightly clichd villain but this does not take away from the film as reynolds really does steal the screen the on screen action is fantastic and stylised the progression of the story is also very good although unconventional the brilliant writing and clever observations really are the strong foundations of this film though to conclude i thought tim miller did a stand up job on this first feature film i hope returns and continues to make me laugh overall i would give this film 89 out of 10 the film was extremely funny but was just missing a little something to be 9 out of 10 for me this being said i think is a great movie and i highly recommend it to anyone who wants not only a laugh but a good action flick,comedy

lets just begin that this movie was everything i wanted it to be it did not hold back and by gosh is was hilarious some of the jokes i will be honest did not understand but the overall feel of this movie kept smiling and laughing but ill get to itfirst of to ryan reynolds thank you so much sir for making this movie go through you showed love to the character and to the fans you played so well that really no one else will be able to play this character again as for what a fun and interesting character you can honestly just have him sit in the a chair and talk his constantly pulling out funny remarks and jokes his fighting style is awesome for the other characters they all bring there part to this story but i feel that it really is all about which is not a bad thingthe action in this movie is well choreographed and entertaining the rated r really did allow this movie to steer off from the original super hero movies we have come use to seeingoverall this movie was everything i wanted it to be i was please and really looking forward to what we have next,comedy
1hr48mins 910 14 years in the making at a budget 0f 58 mill this film had a lower budget than any of the xmen iron man avengers or captain america movies so they have limited budget but it doesnt take away from being unique and a new class of superhero that rise from the ashes like a phoenix marvel have kept their brand fresh and funny and ryan reynolds describes breaking the fourth wall this means he talks straight to the camera so his jokes taking himself not seriously and not been overly serious so this film is a origins film so it has story a back story rewind and fast forward button ability as a reflection of his wit hes funny and and a little bit of a mad but hes also not trying to be liked hes intentionally trying to annoy everyone  but his other superhero roles like the green lantern get mentioned as his other roles like his green roles as we see the slow mo action scenes from the the start the hero roles the genius marvel the english villain the cameo from a xmen the of genius in marvel show this sword wielding guns is subjected to a rogue villain experiment that leaves him with accelerated healing powers adopting the alter ego this director tim miller first film and he does well with what he has got at his disposal tim miller does his best at the subject and joke taking that goes on with loads of scenes which is not for children is why its r rated movie great cast are up for this this is an easy movie to review but compared with the a list of marvel this is the underdog with a soundtrack from the 80 like wham and chicago been belted out and ryan reynolds singing along to cheese pop with his suit but his girlfriend in this movie loves him but when he disappears her life changes but his also changes armed with his new abilities and a dark twisted sense of humor hunts down the man who nearly destroyed his lifebut fights to get his life back and with help of two xmen with great fights scenes and wise cracks the battle scenes with a cameo of sorts for of the marvel and shield item in the back ground which becomes a hugh scenes so watch out and also the blind women fun at her usefulness at doing things and not knowing who her roommate is helps a lot but there reference to taken for liam nesson in takenso with a big prop from the marvel shield universe for the finale to help the big battle for hearts and minds this film i gave it 8510 because i giving to many film easy tens,comedy
i can understand why 16to25yearold geeky guys ie the internet generation would love this movie its a fastpaced videogame ride of a movie with many many wise cracks selfdeprecating humour and cultural references it has an overtly camp edge to it much of this movie constitutes a running dialogue between wade and his adolescent viewers this movie is cool camp sexy and violent the violence and sex in this movie are not that over the top i saw nothing that really made me squeamish it is more graphic than most movies there was an extended torture scene that made me a little uncomfortablethe movies themes are the themes of adolescence in the early 21st century scifi superhero movies yes the movies genre was also a theme fitting in rebellion anxiety about personal and professional failure angst about disease looks and getting the girl stalking cruelty bullying alienation feminism sexuality etcthe movie doesnt even pretend to be realistic yes i know its a movie about a comicbook figure but cmon there has to be something realistic about it and its not adult in any way you know what im talking about this is not a movie for adultsi have to go back to see the movie twice because much of it was too fast the movie was funny but the kind of funny where you feel afterwards that you didnt quite get the joke cultural references hurled at the viewer do not make a movie intelligent i did get some visceral enjoyment out of it all i was mildly moved on a few occasions and i did chuckle out loud but at the end  despite its attempts to be an antisuperhero movie  much of it was just the same loud overthetop busteverythingup superhero crp you see in all these films the big scenes here are the same old sht big crashes disasters shootouts kungfu fighting i thought at one point that the film was made for young men who have grown up with difficulties focusing and require a barrage of snappy dialogue and crashes to enjoy anythingits really just another marvel xmen movie nothing wrong with that i suppose i really liked the last one so thats two good ones in a row its just that i dont need all my movies to be franchise movies about marvel comic figures or anything else lets do other things once in a while this movie didnt blow me away as much as that galaxy moviei want to give it about 75 i have to round it down because i cant say this movie was all that great its somebody elses 10 9 or even 8 its a 7 to me,comedy
comic book hero movie franchises can often get off to a good fun start then peter out so badly that you lose interest in watching more sequels has gotten off to a good start and hopefully being more antihero in genre will hold the wannabe franchise in good steadryan reynolds plays the titular antihero in this movie and you get to see  through fragmented and out of sequence story  how he came to have the extraordinary powers that he does if ive seen any of ryans films before this one i dont remember themat least for him specifically in that way hes kind of an unknown actor for me and i do like the way that the character of is underplayed by him as for how came to have the powers that he doesim not so sure why hes so upsetgiven the alternative that he facedwith the vulgar and violent nature of it could have been easy to make him much larger than lifelike jim carreys performance as the maskor maybe demonstrate the kind of exuberance you see by the superhero in the first spiderman movie starring toby maguire as it stands  in this first movie at least  isnt as charismatic as one might have been lead to believe ive never read any of the comics for that character apparently he had a small part in one of the wolverine moviesif i saw him there he meant nothing to me and nowhere near as charismatic as chlo grace moretz as hitgirl in the kickass franchise again this isnt a bad thingat least not yetthe action scenes in the movie are well donestylised and excitingcf the second avengers movie where more most definitely translated into less also enjoyable was the humour in this moviedoesnt take much seriously if you have wide pop cultural knowledge you can play spot the referenceeg there is a variation in this movie of an even longer monty python sketch which stretches the joke to breaking point theres also a paraphrase of a famous quote from notting hill if youve seen american psycho you might get a kick out of the discussion on the merits of wham its hard to say if the anti heros tast in music is meant to humorous tooi suspect that it is the humour of also gets quite meta at timeshe refers to actorswho play characters in superhero moviesyou do see other superheroes from the marvel universe in this moviei just have no idea who they arebut their super powers aresuitably silly some of the reviews that i read for this movie made it seem like it was particularly violent but i didnt find it particularly confronting some of the dialogue has sexual references so combining that with the violence id say that this isnt a movie for the youngstersthe character of reminds me a bit of the tom baker years as the doctor in doctor whobut more violent have to say that im more a fan of these antisuperhero type movies than the more conventional kindsso i like deadpoolas well as watchmen kick ass and hancock,comedy
one of the 2016s most hyped movies follows a mercenary who is subjected to an experiment which turns him into a mutant with superpowers sounds like your everyday superhero movie right well no as the rather brilliant marketing campaign never stopped repeating this is not your average superhero movie swearing sex gore adult humour and meta jokes add up to a very unique superhero movie which is not for kids is a victim of its overhyping but its a good time and at least a bit different from the usual superhero movies it does have quite a few problems though in many ways the plot is generic and while some clichs are mocked not all of them are at times the film is too dark at times the film and the central character are unbearably smug and insufferable many scenes just feel like the film trying to be as r rated as possible and the adult nature of the film starts feeling like a gimmick as a result not all of the jokes hit although quite a lot do and its pretty entertaining its not as different and unique as it looked but its still subversive and entertaining much of the time it is funny occasionally hilarious the performances are strong and the visuals are very clever possibly the most subversive thing of all is that the romance actually works for once its probably not going to age too well and i think people will realize its not deserving of its ludicrously high placement on imdb top 250 on repeat viewings but its a decent enough movie with some very good lines610,comedy
short version is a fun little gift to the fans a strong comedy on its own and just an all around blast to those who love things reminiscent of a live action cartoon if you want to see something like this even if you arent a big fan of or his humor youll still be quite satisfiedi dont really want to make this a full on review since doing so would spoil chunks of the movie however i will say that the movie is a very abnormal enigma its pretty much a live action cartoon with gracious violence and yet also plays with other genresusually taking huge shifts in tone like at the weapon x building youll know when you see iti wouldnt recommend taking your young children to see this because the adult stuff in here is reeeeaaaaly out there however it does shift to a long cut of scenes involving such explicit content however if you want to see a comic book movie with a lot more of an edge then i couldnt find a better film that came out as of late,comedy
this is not your family superhero movie dont be taking your mom and dador kidsto go see this its perhaps the uninhibited superhero film weve been waiting for if youre into that sorta thing its not even really a superhero movie so much as its a comedy in a leotardryan reynolds plays the title character wade wilson aka a mercenary who undergoes a special procedure to help cure him of his terminal cancer this ends up giving him special powers of selfhealing but also makes him look like a freakhence the mask meanwhile hes afraid to see the love of his life vanessa morena baccarin because of what she might think of his new facethe film plays around with the timeline a bit jumping back and forth between postsuperpower wade and everyday guy wademost likely to avoid any boredom or anxiety built up by superhero originsat its best its very very funny reynolds timing is excellent as the snarky insouciant rascal from the beginning the jokes are rapidfire it looks as though were in for a guardians of the galaxy or antman type of film but this goes way beyond that it breaks the fourth wall about a dozen times and occasionally has the star selfdeprecating himself at one point reynolds makes a quip about the film not having a big enough budget to feature any other xmen characters the comedy can eventually get tiring for some not so much tiring actually just numbing but luckily the jokes come fewer and far between at about that point in the movie then we get the big action sequences and all thatis definitely something new in this world of belabored superhero films and thats probably the most refreshing part about the movie it never takes itself too seriouslyit doesnt give us some ridiculous villain who unstoppably giving a shot at world domination instead spends much of the film just trying to hunt down the man who turned him into a freak killing anyone standing in his waywhich is made to be funny until we realize theres no real reason for any of these people to die in fact maybe is the villain after allbut if looked at as a superhero action film it will evoke distaste in many however if you see it as a comedy then it all makes more sense and you can sit back and enjoy itit toys with this whole beauty is only skin deep theme but never really capitalizes on its impact instead the film cares more about its irreverence if this movie were to be amazing it would have found a perfect balance between heart and gall but honestly i dont even think it tried totwizard rating 83,comedy
is marvels the most entertaining film to date yes we have seen cooler superheroes better effects more intense fight scenes and mind blowing cgi but none of it succeeds to be as memorable as hilarious screenplay and ryan reynoldsreynolds is the most perfect casting not only in marvel films but many many others ive seen in last of couple year he steals every scene where he talks moves or gets nakedthe movie makers know that is no captain america or any similar franchise hero but also they realize that even anitheroes can excite people consequently never takes itself seriously and it jokes the sht out of everything sometimes it may seem to be politically incorrect too r rated but trust me youll never stop enjoying it,comedy

adhering to mpaa rules is killing creativity of us blockbusters that is by now pretty certain the rating system scares away almost any kind of risk taking when it comes to making expensive alist films because film companies naturally want to see their huge investments returned by assuring the widest possible public appeal  but they dont want to pss off the censors thats why its ever easier to predict the plot and the stories are all looking blander and more and more alike any form of gritty realism readily available on the internet and tvnews is a huge nono when it comes to showing a cinematic work of art to a precious little teenager or an adult prudefilms made upon comic books are particularly sanitized given the nature and obscurity of the source and they suffer for it a great deal enter as one of the rare attempts to tackle the rrating not to fight the rating system itself but to sort of rehabilitate the r and make it lucrative again long after the impact of pulp fiction and private ryan has been forgotten it has been heavily marketed as not for children and it was implied that the filmmakers hope for a sizable money return nonetheless there seems to be a growing intent to make comic book films more adultoriented and im certain a lot rides on the success of this filmsince this is a sort of probe its obvious from the first minute that marvel and fox allowed filmmakers unusual creative liberties but unsurprisingly unusually low budget a complete newcomer when it comes to directing a feature film that is in form of tim miller is put at helm partly probably for fresh perspective partly because hes expendable in case of failure expendable is also the main star a handsome but downandout ryan reynolds at this point hes got little to loseapparently miller handled everything pretty well from really impressive and hilarious opening shot through solid pacing and good action scenes to dynamic climax really hardly anything to complain about there editing is also done well although there are places where more trimming would be welcome screenplay is more of a twoway street however and it has its hits and misses its undoubtedly brave not only with gratuitous and quite welcome profanities sex blood gore and dark humor but with the concept of a downbeat main character itself and complementing miseenscne as well as with the ending there are many inventive visual gags and some verbal jokes really click but a lot of them are overwritten cheesy too absurd or unnecessary so the reaction to them is more of a meh than a real amusement but i suppose thats what the character of is all about  an edgy nervy blabbering sort of fellow as the lore goes a spitting image of ryan reynoldsyes as it happens a relatively new hero of marvel universe is fashioned after the guy that eventually got to play him twice by now on film so reynolds by definition does the character justice but i did hope for something slightly different than reynolds doing his usual hamming and nodding he is surely a likable actor and carries the film well but a comedian he isnt and he simply cannot find the right measure for his deliveries so hes a hit and miss too in this film as well as in his entire careeri recommend because although not brilliant its quite a fun watch its also an unrestrained celebration of the r and as such hopefully a small milestone in the future of filmmaking id honor it here properly if imdb allowed me to use the same words that were used in the film oh imdb youre a walking piece of sht irony,comedy

for years ive been following imdb as my movie guide but never until tonight i ever registered on the site this movie made me do it and still write my first review ever of a movie congrats for that i do not have the ambition or boldness to talk about technical aspects of film making as many reviews i read so far as i admit not having the knowledge to do so i just love cinema both clever movies which makes you think for long time after you watched it and those pure entertaining popcorn light stuff which makes you spend a couple of hours alienated from the real world this film matches none of the above a non existing plot makes you think why theres nothing to think about an embarrassing mess of characters action sex and humour makes you feel like standing up and stop the agony after the first 10 minutes it was one of the very few occasions i seriously had to make a huge effort to watch this until the end the reason why i did it was because i kept a nave hope girl would end up dead or dream of the dreams would die himself for good and i do like happy endings  superheros are in fashion marvel is on fire the industry sucks this resource until its exhaustion as always and thats why you have good stuff reasonable stuff and bad stuff sometimes they come up with pure trash because they know some brains will still enjoy it is a fine example of that the worse is they tried to look creative original and defying arrogance they ended up making the comic character look ridiculous and the whole piece as dumb as an ostrich the humour is atrocious cheap and vulgar the attempt to make fun of itself embarrassing humour is much more than we saw here this can fit on something rather comic and bad comic producing comedy nowadays looks like making fast food take and go but humour is not for everyone and specially not for those who cant see they have no talent for it laughing on is for childrens minds up to 12 years old max or iqs below 70 resuming this is an insult to the xmen saga futile hollow and arrogant the sequel is on the way so be careful,comedy

a former special service agent gets accelerated healing powers after a experiment gone not exactly as planned he then creates the free spirited superhero that accentuates his own view of right and wrong a vigilante of sorts is that take the day at it comes kind of guy that you want to have as your best friend even thou he can be utterly irritable just because he lives so unhampered a fun romantic classical superhero film with a twist  if the film were a drink this would be what you read on the menu  among all the superhero movies we have seen over the years this one leaves you with the sought after feelgood so many films claims to give you but failsmovies are made with love love them back,comedy
after having marvel forced down our throats for two decades i didnt even want to watch this latest installment i thought ryan reynolds would continuously annoy me throughout the whole film and that it would just be another mashup from the marvel universe with the possibility of a wolverine cameoboy was i wrong its stupid its dumb and its annoying yes but overall very entertaining being stupid was a good thing this is the first marvel movie that didnt take itself so seriously there is a lot of fun in this movie adult fun this movie is definitely rated r but again this is good marvel fans aged 20 probably heavily outnumber the teens nowall in all highly recommended again though this movie is definitely rated r and isnt serious at all,comedy
i didnt really no what to expect when i put this on im not a comic book fan but i heard from friends that this movie was outstanding indeed it was ryan reynolds put on one of the best performances of his career his wiseguy remarks and out of the box insults shit speckled muppet fart made the movie enjoyable this movie was pretty hilarious in my opinion also it was probably one of most well written films ive ever watched tj miller also put together a great performance as weasel this movie was a little bit of everything an action film a comedy and a love story the casting was also outstanding also is it safe to say ed skrien was probably one of the most unlikable villains in cinematic history hes up there but not quite all in all a great movie and i highly recommend you watch it1010,comedy
coming none too soon to give pause and relief to the repetitive releases of franchise after franchise of comicbook movies rhetorically asks the question have we jumped the shark yetsomeone said that when something becomes selfparody the original idea has run its course but comicbooks have a certain resilience to what is normal there hasnt been anything quite like the movie although kickass 2010 might be sighted as a cousin of sorts ryan reynolds stars and had a hand in producing and bringing the movie to audiences and was determined to get it right successaudiences and critics love the film to varying degrees but no one can deny that this is a balls to the wall attempt at supercharging the superhero movieits completely nutzoid irreverent reverent sharply written and directed makes onslaughts of its own wallowing in excessive everything and is the most fun that fanboys have had at the movies maybe ever comicbooks have always had an ability to holdthehand of the reader as heshe holds it in their hands and makes you part of the club an insider as you enter that nether world of outrageousness youre in with the in crowd youre in on the jokes youre part of the actionthats in a nutshelloops left it wide open for wade with that onenotethank the comicbook gods for the r rating theres no wimpout with this one,comedy
a marvel of a marvel anti hero or maybe superhero or perhaps simply a hero brought up in the man by the right girl just let him be the hero he wants to be since anyway we know from the start that he will get the girl he loves and that he will defeat his main enemy even kill him if necessary because she will forget his looks and only hear his heartromantic the way hollywood likes it romantic and sexy you could even say obsessed and obsessively obsessed with his flesh at that it could have been an erotic film if he had not decided one day to live his life and get on the way where he met the worst possible people and first of all that demon francis i thought francis was a saint but after all nothing proper in a proper name that is not common in a way or other and common he is that francisa good sance of torturing to heal a cancer that is unhealable and the whole story ends on the other side of the divide between reason and insanity his cancer is healed for sure but he lost his good looks and he went through a mutation that made him immortal not exactly in fact but unable to be killed unable to die and the result is quasi immortality for someone who just wanted a love affair with his girlfriend the cancer sauce and the hot chili peppers of a treatment made the future quite differenthe will get his vengeance and he will recuperate his girl friend back but in the mean time half the city will have been destroyed dozens of bad guys will have been killed or maimed what was a disastrous building site will become a pitiful field of ruins but our will have his girlfriend and his love story slightly more than a simple love affair after allif you have a hormonal teenager in you thats the film for you if you have a liking for special effects thats the film for you if you like happy endings thats the film for you just let the merrygoround of the if clauses continue its circular route to the end of time but dont come and tell me i did not warn you it is not an intellectual and social minded exploration of human life and society so have a good trip on the other side of the looking glassdr jacques coulardeau,comedy
i couldnt picture ryan reynolds playing this character before i saw the movie but once there i thought he was fantastic it is not by any means your usual superhero movie but surprised and delighted me from the very start hit the spot for me all round definitely not for children it is very dark and violent in some parts but funny in others i could easily see the movie again and maybe pick up on some parts i missed it is one of those types of movies you can watch several times in my opinion if you love a bit of carnage action and fighting then go see this movie my advice go in with an open mind if you love comic book characters with a twist then this movie is for you it is extremely entertaining and am hoping there will be a sequel,comedy
well what can i say about this movie apart from its fricking awesome i havent laughed this much at a movie for years there are many movies out considering themselves to be full blown comedies however they couldnt lace boots its absolutely refreshing to see a major studio have the balls to make a film like this they have done the comic books proud keeping character true to the written material ryan reynolds is as if hes been sent down from god to play this part i cant think of anybody better to wear the mask just as hugh jackman made the part of wolverine his own reynolds has done the same here but while the wolverine standalone films were pretty average at best the movie knocks the ball right out of the park a sublime blend of humour action and romance make this the unexpected hit of 2016 while this is not a comic book movie that should be shown to children it is a real treat for all us grownup kids the story if you are unfamiliar is about a mercenary named wade wilson who finds he has cancer and undergoes a horrific experiment to try and cure himself of the disease the result gives him superior healing powers just like wolverine however he is horribly scarred due to the nature of the experiment and because of this he believes he has lost the love of his life what ensues is an action comedy fest as goes on a quest to catch the man who disfigured him and have him make him look like ryan reynolds again you must watch this film at least four times to catch all the jokes and even then you still missed plenty the gags come thick and fast delivered superbly by the very funny reynolds i could go on all day about some of the sidesplitting moments in this film but rather than that just rent or buy this film if you have an ounce of a sense of humour you will be laughing from start to finish,comedy
humor like most things is a matter of tasteseveral good friends of mine with generally similar senses of humor to mine love the movie tommy boy i hated tommy boy go figure different strokes so im never surprised at bipolar reviews for a filmthat said oh my god i loved this movie lol funny as in i was literally laughing out loud throughout the movie ive never seen ryan reynolds in this type of role but he nailed it he channeled his inner will ferrell and kept me in stitches the humor the sarcasm the irony the comic timing the inside jokes the chemistry among the key characters it was all just nearly perfect i dont give a lot of 9 ratings especially for comedies  ive rated 470 movies with 29 of those earning 9 or 10 and of those only 12 romcoms  but this flick earned it from me rarely do i buy the dvd of a movie just after watching it on demand but i immediately ordered the dvd because i know i will watch this multiple times with different friends,comedy
thats a mean summary but its the truth im a big fan of marvel and dc but was disappointing first of all the history has nothing interesting and the end of the movie was very clear for me since the beginning its a cool movie i think is a great character deserves a movie but something deeper than that it has a lot of blood and shooting as a movie deserves but that scene where he kills 3 guys with one bullet while hes doing a impossible stunt really im sorry but only kids buy that kind of stuff and what about those lame jokes not all jokes but some of them were so clich and not funny at all kids will enjoy i will give 7 because the movie has a lot of great action sequences violence good effects and it has even some x men colossus and negasonic teenage warhead besides that the history is boring and the actors are lame kids will enjoy more then adults because theres a lot of superhero action without much story to understand to me batman vs superman still the greatest superhero movie ever along with watchmen,comedy
it was an ok movie the dialogue was the best the plot was a boring standard revenge plot the story telling was very unique the scope of the movie was small  it all took place in one city the characterization was poor many of the characters were flat their motivation was unexplained and some were even onedimensional  just placeholders the main character was ok though by the way has an entp myersbriggs personality type his friend tj miller who also plays erlich bachman in silicon valley is also an entp rick sanchez from rick  morty is also an entp i dont mind the r rating but it had very little adult concepts rick  morty has more adult themes,comedy
although a very good movie im surprised its on the imdb top 250 the movie opening is excellent the level of humour and fun is steadily kept up but the story dips a little towards the end where most of the action takes place i must admit if i was able to make this film i would have given it ten out of ten but as i am only writing a small review for this thing then i have to honest i was smiling through out the film and laughed out loud a few times some of the humour missed its target and this is a super hero movie go on the internet and listen to mark kermode and simon mayo on bbc radio 5 pod cast too if you want to go and see a movie that really misses its target go and see an adam sandler or will farrell comedy or bvs doj a superhero movie with a very poor story line and hello to jason isaacs,comedy
i would have rated an 8or perhaps even a ninehad it not been for the overthetop swearing and a bit of the gratuitous violencenow before some of you jump down my throat bear with me for a moment as i walk you through my thought process and explain why i feel this wayin addition ill preface this by saying that i get that its as i am quite familiar with the source material  i have read several of the comic booksgraphic novelsfirst lets start with the swearing shall wei myself am known to swearsometimes oftennot so much that it would cause someone to think i have an extremely limited vocabulary but often enough however from what i can recall didnt swear a ton in the source material matter of fact i cant quite remember him swearing at all in the comics not saying it didnt happen but i cant recall it happening which suggests that it didnt happen often enough for me to notice and certainly not enough for it to become tritefor me part of the reason is so damn funny and lovable is because hes so darn clever while at the same time remaining utterly innocent this imho is what keeps him teetering on the verge of annoying the crap out of everyone to the point where no one can stand him his charm is in this ability to be clever in such an innocent manner that even if he sometimes crosses that line of bothersome to the point of being annoying hes easy to forgive his innocence is what makes him endearing while at the same time making him tolerableunfortunately for me when you have a script calling for the character to swear like barnacle bill the sailor it nullifies any ability for the character to appear innocent and instead simply makes him look like a tool or a jerk there were moments of brilliance in this movie where you would see glimpses of possessing this innocence and charm only for a twinkling of a moment before it is quickly dissolved by a poorly timed cuss here or there for me it was a negative as it took away from a lot of the charm that makes greatin regards to the gratuitous violence i am a little more forgiving here as this is for the most part a bit more unavoidable if you are sticking to the source material having said that it would have been nice if they tried a bit harder to avoid some of the graphic violence or at least toned it down a smidge in an effort to appeal to a wider audience personally i would have loved to have taken my daughter to see this at the theater but because of the extreme violence decided against it and thus didnt go to the theater to see it myselfregardless ryan reynolds does an excellent job as but thats not saying much as reynolds was pretty much born to play this role i cant imagine there was a lot of character research that went into this role nor was there a need for mr reynolds to get into character my impression is that the two are very similar and that there wasnt too drastic a change when reynolds had to become wade wilsonas far as the direction is concerned tim miller does a brilliant job for the most part there are some moments of pure directorial genius in this film such as the opening scene where the car is flipping over in slow motion to the song angel of the morning pure geniusfor the most part the writing is good with only one or two questionable moments where i felt like the script was lackingoverall is an enjoyable movie that stays pretty close to the source material had it done the things i mentioned above without question i would have given the movie an 8 rating perhaps even a 9 if it could have done that as well as avoiding those couple of lackluster moments in the script i would have considered this a comic book movie masterpiece,comedy
okay for the few naysayers out there well it was made abundantly clear prior to the film releasing that there would be full extensive use of the r rating if you are a fan then you would also have been well aware of what to be in store for if you watched any of the 30 trailers social media clips promotions etc you would have been well aware before going to this film what to expect my personal opinion and people are certainly entitled to disagree with it is that like any movie you should rate it on whether it delivered as promised not give it one star because you either expected it to be watered down or didnt bother to research it at all prior no this isnt like the other marvel movies out there which i adore and follow avidly it is a completely different animal but no less wonderful i have watched this 3 times in the theater and if i get the chance ill watch it again before it is out of the theater it was brilliant from beginning to end pay attention if you havent had the pleasure of going yet to every little thing because there were incredibly few instances of anything in this movie being face value be it references to pop culture alternate movies comic books or other happenings in the film itself do not bring your children seriously they may beg you to watch it but there are some actual adult situations including torture that may not be the best material for them maybe check it out first and go from there but i had a pair of grandparents behind me in the first viewing with their 6ish old grandchildren and they ended up leaving in the first 20 minutes so totally 5 stars id give it a 100 if i could,comedy
i enjoyed this film a great deal few films have the testicular fortitude as this one and ryan reynolds found his calling nobody plays smart ass like this guy its funny as hell but could have actually been a great movie as well it tries to be a satire of the super hero movie something most super hero movies accidentally do anymore but what it really is a super hero movie with some admittedly hilarious dirty jokes this film would bump up to a seven or even eight if they cut down the origin story no super hero origin story will ever be interestingnolans batman had an interesting one not because the story was good but because it was well photographed honestly i cant wait for the sequel though the origin will be gone and reynolds will have more time to do what he does best,comedy
i thought this film was amazing a very welcome break from the dumbing down of recent superhero movies to make them suitable for children real ex military tell dirty jokes appreciate sexy women and swearother recent movies send a message its ok to slaughter people but to swear or see sex scenes or make dirty jokes is not ok some of them felt like i was watching the batman series from the 60s with better graphicsis great stuff from the get go well done flash back scenes that didnt reveal the entire story in the first 20 seconds and a main character you could really empathise with it was a risk worth taking and id like to thank the studio for remembering adults like superhero movies too and taking this step towards more realism in characters,comedy
is hilarious news at superhero genre humor is fresh delightful violence scenes are not the wildest you have seen but there is a blood enough in this movie too ryan reynolds is great as a and seems to enjoy at his role is not greater than life experience but certainly it is fresh at marvel series there are a lot of hints to other marvel movies and that makes it feel a little disoriented it feels like a big action hero movie with a low budget at the same time and that maybe is a reason it feels so fresh is very schematic comic book story made to silver screen it doesnt offer lot of anything new but there are a lot of very funny moments in it it is full of obscene humor but not enough to be tasteless it certainly is not suitable for younger audience but mature audience will enjoy it sequel had already announced and it will be interesting to see if they found something new to story hopefully 2 will be as hilarious as this one it gonna take a lot from screen writers but if they manage of it movie may be even more hilarious than the first one is fresh and funny movie to an adult audience very entertaining and it feels all new at its genrehttptinovalkkiblogaajafi,comedy
got to be honest to date i have seen it twice something despite what some believe i dont do that often and while i enjoyed it the first time i think i liked it more the second time on first viewing it felt like the humour was all smoke and mirrors hiding what if it had been intended to be taken more seriously a very over the top but sub par superhero movie although superantihero makes for a better description but second time round having heard the jokes already i was able to find stuff there that i had overlooked the first time and i think i enjoyed it more as a result one definite strength of is the title character itself once again played by ryan reynolds after his brief appearance in xmen origins wolverine clearly putting his past poorly received superhero movies behind him a lot of the fun humour and what makes the film entertaining in general comes from his portrayal of the character as much as it would seem that how he was played in the film wolverine would make it feel like no one else could play the role he makes for a even more memorable character the second time round while although still technically set in the xmen universe he brings his own spin to the character that does enough to set it apart from the xmen movies and to become its own thing even going as far so poke fun at his past superhero movies from a action figure of his original design to jokes about how he doesnt want to look green animated like he did in green lantern something that was worth a laugh or two for those in the know a lot of the fourth wall humour from himself did stick to this formula thats for sure even one moment early on similar to the marketing done based on the valentines day release date by having mimic the girlfriends in the audience thinking they were tricked into watching a superhero movie and the seemingly conventional marvel post credits scene on how there is no samuel l jackson with a eye patch or 2 trailerbut look past the title character and focus more on the superhero movie satires it does come across as another kickass type of movie it is much like kickass a very over the top extremely graphically violent movie that does not hold back almost surprising it managed a 15 the uk mid way between pg13 and r in some ways but in some ways on this front the more ironic nature of kickass in the sense that the title character was not what you would expect from a superhero ie nerdy not big or strong doesnt actually have superpowers dare i say it seemed to work more at what both of those films and also where both trying to do in those movies but despite this still comes out on top comes out as the more entertaining character plot wise is a stark contrast to what we have seen it mainly regards that there had been another movie featuring the character although if hypothetically if xmen origins did happen i would argue that it took place after ryan reynolds scenes in that movie and after the climax of it but thats a big if the character is introduced in a more focused not at all down played way although there is hints of what happened during the characters first appearances in xmen origins wolverine but so vague it felt more like a easter egg there are some moments while that while surprisingly dramatic for a film that wasnt intended to be taken too seriously that goes in some directions that kickass did not but there was still the downside too this in that this only gives motivation for becoming and not much else in the long run but its mostly a revenge story somewhat about love that is the best way i can put itbut in all is still an entertain movie it is quite the adventure and pure escapism it has the right kind of self aware nature to it all that seems to work for the movie and does become what you would hope for it to be of course if kickass was not your thing then this will not be yours either  but if it was then this is probably worth checking out,comedy
do you love taking the younger nerds in your life to see each new superhero movie of course you do but for the love of god do not take any kids to the most recent entry to the xmen cinematic cosmos ryan reynolds affectionate take on this clevel marvel antihero fills a massive hole in the ubiquitous world of superhero films fanboy fiction for proudly immature adults a noholdsbarred guardians of the galaxyesque romp its gleefully violent and unabashedly debauched serves as proof that true passion projects are sometimes worth backing unfamiliar with the character no problem the film catches us up to speed with some unique origin storytelling jumping back and forth between his present crimefighting life and his past normal life its a gloriously messy way to breathe some life into a clichd story form all the while metareferences and injokes burst from every bloodsplattered shot starting with a wonderful opening credit sequence that features selfmutilating gags ie referring to ryan reynolds as gods perfect idiot reynolds a guy often overly interested fratboy shenanigans revels and shines in a role he was clearly born to play and hopefully this wont be his last time donning the redtights and foulmouth if done correctly the sequels have the strong possibility of only being better than this first one as the setup of the character can be lost to more frivolous fun how will this strongly rrated character get tied into the larger xmen story without losing his bite not sure for now lets just enjoy this oneshot actioncomedy as a oneofakind superhero experience that youve likely never experienced before,comedy
wow it lives up to its impressive marketing campaign and then some it was truly worth the 11 years it took reynolds and the entire comic book fan base to get this movie made as it is a must see for anybodyi have never smiled as much as i did throughout this the film is non stop fun consistently and it really is emphasized by the amount this movie was allowed to get away with after being made a 15 the superhero genre for me have been burning out recently with the high volume that marvel seem to be churning out so a change of pace was needed this film offers a completely fresh take on superhero or in this case anti hero which should be praised for its balls and excellent plot which captivate the audiencemy biggest concern going into the cinema was that the 4th wall breaking wouldnt transfer well onto the big screen but it really gives this film an edge over all others in the same genre it never takes you out of the immersion and is a constant reminder of how comic books really can be brought to life in cinema,comedy
in india 14th movie is censoredmany scenes are cut not just with nudity but dialogs toomany dialogs are mutedscenes from trailer are missing1st meeting scenes between wade and weasel were chopped up which are present in trailerthere is no point of seeing this in india in a cinema hall near youwe could see only 34th of movie which was gooddont know about rest 14 thby the time it makes to tv it would have been cut by 12censoreship in india sucks thay could as well not release it,comedy
ryan reynolds in a spandexish tight superhero suitdoes this movie deliver lets find outi think definitely is a strong addition to the comicbook movieverse boasting strong performances and aboveaverage action set pieces does it do enough as a origins story not quite is far too selfaware for its own good the film tries so hard to be different it actually disappointingly falters in its attempt to be original the director seems too inexperienced to accurately meld all the wild elements in this fun and quirky script the writers of zombieland nail the oneliners and most of the self referential sadomasochistic nonsensical commotion that goes with it is there such a thing as trying to be too cool popculture is popculture for a reason quotable film lines are deemed classics because of the audiences that make them so you cant coerce your way into popculture fandom rather you earn your place there all in all had me leaving the theatre with ambivalent feelings i do not know exactly where i stand when it comes to liking an antihero who keeps on reminding us he is a reluctant superhero while being in a spoof movie of the subject he is making fun of does that make any sense the film definitely is a satire of the comicbook superhero formula alas the execution of that satire is far from perfect is enjoyable for its jokes and to watch ryan reynolds sadistically inflict pain on his bevy of hopeless criminals i think the audience secretly felt more pleasure as we watched him ingeniously come up with dozens of ways to perform his lethal dutiesfans of the character will be pleased comicbook movie fans who have an insatiable desire for unconventional chaotic superheroes will also be content with this adaptation film fans who care about the plot and cinematic elements will be divided on this one no one likes a smartass even though it is amusing to watch one in his confidence and insanity capture the screen,comedy
this is the kind of movie comic book fans of the dark age of comics have been waiting for the days of the anti hero a smart ass like peter parker but the mouth of a sailor and the temper and lack of respect for life like lobo who better than ryan reynolds who everyone thought was perfect for in the wolverine movie til fox screwed that up they could have gone with omega red instead just sayin action packed spread out in doses perfectly rather than having to spend an hour watching the creation of the hero ehhem spiderman franchise wake up no more rebootsi wanted so bad to give this a ten here s why i couldnt the went slightly too far with the adult jokes masturbation really was it necessary now my son has to wait a while to see this secondly colossus sounded like an 80s cartoon russian way too familiar why not get the guy that played him in the xmen movie thats it two jokes and an accent from a 10,comedy
is easily he most fan service of comic characters so it makes sense that his big screen spotlight is a movie that feels a fan service movie the merc with a mouth is a character that doesnt take himself seriously and neither does his big screen adventure which is the biggest appeal of an otherwise standard super hero formula hiding under waves of winking irony crass humor and gleefully bloody violent mayhem ryan reynolds plays wade wilson a hired gun that undergoes a risky experimental treatment by a shady black ops organization to cure his terminal illness it makes him generally indestructible with a rapid healing ability but his flesh is also horribly scarred and wade is afraid his girlfriend vanessa morena baccarin a hooker with a heart of gold will reject him even in the opening credits you know this isnt going to be a typical super hero movie the time is ripe for a film that knowingly ridicules the tropes of the super hero film industry and scores some big laughs when its making fun of itself and its super peers the dark humor can often surprise with how goforbroke it can get like wade and his vanessas flirty oneups man ship of hypothetical sexual trauma theres a clever montage of wade and vanessas romantic history told through sexuallyspecific holiday celebrations and the inclusion of a couple of lowrent xmen provides a comic foil for to bounce off from the action is fun and the movie is entertaining from its opening credits to the nowmandatory postcredits bonus reynolds is spiritually attuned with the irreverence of the antihero finally plugging into a part that makes full use of his charm motor mouth and physicality runaway boxoffice success grossing more than any xmen film and on at least half the budget will hopefully allow hollywood to feel comfortably allowing their less than familyfriendly comic titles to stay true to their intentions then again maybe theyll just take all the wrong messages and think that audiences just want to hear more swearing from people in spandex is a super hero movie that prioritizes fun over everything else and while it may not be for everyone at least its trying to be for someone different,comedy
is a vigilante that has well earned his own movie we all began to gain respect for him and ask for him in his first appearance in x men from that day forwards we knew would become a wonderful character this movie did way better than what people actually thought it would do they chose the perfect actor ryan reynolds to do this hilarious movie it give you everything that you want in a movie from action to comedy to a nice little love story if these are your guidelines for a movie and your a marvel comic book fan you definitely should go and view this movie for yourself or if your just trying to have a romantic date with your loved one then you can do this too the best thing to do is give the movie a chance and see what everyone has been raving about,comedy
let me begin by saying that i am a marvel fan maybe i wasnt prepared for what i was about to watch i was later told that this character exists in the comic books even so i dont understand why i found the character completely stupid and tasteless i mean really really stupid and really really tasteless why be so grotesque really maybe the character from the book was just like this there is being funny and swearing and being funny doing it this movie goes way beyond that it is idiotic and i really cant understand the high ratings,comedy
this movie is terribly overrated the plot was the same as every other marvel movie only worse it was supposed to be funny and cute but the jokes were juvenile and aimed at 12 year old boys i dont know how anyone could laugh at it 99 of the jokes were dick jokes and they werent even good ones aside from that the plot was weak and so was the actual character of he was uninteresting and it was impossible to empathize with him or care about him at all in fact i found him to be more annoying than anything the only part that was kindaaaa interesting was when he was being tortured but even that is a stretch honestly if you havent seen it yet dont bother unless you have a terrible taste in movies i guess i cant understand why everyone loves this movie its annoying and not worth your time,comedy
admittedly it wasnt until my fifth attempt that i was able to make it past the first 10 minutes of this movie but hearing how some people absolutely loved this film i knew i wanted to give it another go after the credits rolled i understood why i had such an issue with it and why some folks were incredibly devoted if youre unfamiliar with stan lees marvel xmen franchise most of the inside jokes will be lost on youputting that aside the special effects were incredible as was the sound mixing but not knowing xmen characters or previous plotlines definitely put me at a disadvantage as well i did find a lot of the dialogue and doubleentendres offputting and incredibly crude its obvious how this movie was geared to a specific younger demographic and not as a general public offeringfor the couple of jokes i did find humorous and the very well done soundspecial effects im giving 4 out of 10,comedy
in 99 of superhero movies the hero himself is the most boring character at least in my opinion even when it comes to batman by far my favourite superhero im more than willing to admit that the villain is almost always still the most interesting character however this certainly cant be said for admittedly even by him hes not exactly a superhero in fact the film ends up playing out as more of a revenge flick nothing is off limits coldblooded killing torture nudity it has it all and much more the greatest thing about this film though is the simple fact that people who enjoy superhero movies will love it but so will people who dont thats an accomplishmentryan reynolds is perfectly cast in the title role having already had one try at the superhero genre and failing badly its good to see he was willing to get back on the horse and give it another shot im sure hes glad he did the script is terrific balancing humour action and even drama exquisitely the only put down i can find is that i would have liked to have seen a slightly more menacing villain he was unpleasant theres no doubt about that but he never felt like anything of a threat to be honest though that really is nitpicking in a nearly flawless film,comedy
wade wilson played by ryan reynolds is a smalltime mercenary he meets vanessa morena baccarin and falls in love life is idyllic until one day he is diagnosed with terminal cancer things look bleak but a man appears who says he can be cured through a treatment that gives him superhero powers after initially turning him down wilson agrees and meets the man behind the project ajax ed skrein while undergoing the treatment he discovers that it will involve him becoming a mutant and he will need to undergo several painful tests to discover what his mutant abilities are plus ajax is a sadist the treatment results in wilson getting powers of accelerated healing but also leaves him terribly disfigured ajax tries to keep him a prisoner but he escapes he now has two aims find vanessa and make ajax pay for what he did to him killing ajax may not be as easy it seems as ajax is also a mutant and the meddling dogooder superhero collossus and his sidekick negasonic teenage warhead keep getting in the way oh and wade wilson is now operating under an alias deadpoolafter all the all stylenosubstance cgidriven comic book movies this movie is a breath of fresh air in the genre outrageously funny original and entertaining clever snappy laughaminute dialogue some great cultural references and injokes especially regarding other comic book moviesbasic but decent plot hardly citizen kane stuff but at least it has a plot which is more than one can say for most comic book movies decent character depth and engagementgood action sequences toothis all said it really is all about the humour and ryan reynolds delivers it with aplomb good support from tj miller in the humour department and morena baccarin in the drama romance and looks departmentseasily the best comic book movie made in a very long time,comedy
a english  my rating  new venture strengths  powerful action sequences  comedy scenes were hilarious  visual effects  new super hero concept final verdict  overall it is new venture from marvel entertainment and making the movie blockbuster is a huge and risky attempt just watch it you will enjoy a former special forces operative turned mercenary is subjected to a rogue experiment that leaves him with accelerated healing powers adopting the alter ego director tim miller writers rhett reese paul wernick 2 more credits  stars ryan reynolds morena baccarin tj miller  see full cast and crew ,comedy
i was not a fan and im still not but like any superhero films id pleasure watching it the other reason was we had other superheroes in our time so this guy is kind of new to me it was a stunning launch to the big screen for the as well as for this new director this film was merely an introduction tale than a fully stretched story like how a human becomes a mutant and later who seeks a revenge for ruining his natural life but it yet to explain a couple of things and i hope it all will be revealed in its sequeli am happy for ryan reynolds to get another chance because his previous comic book character did not received well i certainly liked the film but nowadays there are plenty of superheroes to choose in that not in my top 5 so i am happy he joined the x men because i never liked the boring xmen films or its characters but i do love its spin off wolverine ill definitely look forward for his solo films like wolverinethis film broke a few records like the best box office so far for an xmen installment a short film with the present and flashback narration shared the screen piece by piece alternatively this was a strong r rated film so far i have seen in a superhero theme and there were plenty of other films referred no offense to the people who liked it and those who are going watch will do the same but in my personal opinion it was a bit overcelebrated610,comedy
ryan takes and piles comic characters wit and sarcasm into a reallife version so well that wait for the sequel is going to be agonizing pain visually there isnt gigantic scenarios of destruction like other marvel movies commonly have but this movie goes deeply with violence and humour with a twist of black movie does not suit for serious people since the humour is so big part of the violence that most serious people just grunts unpleasantly the biggest separation from other marvel titles is that this one goes overboard with the possibilities heromovie can offer if you want to enjoy and have good time alone or better with friends booze this one is top notch,comedy
being not one who is into all the super hero films but more comedy films after seeing the trailer i thought i would give it a go well i was in stitches at parts its a good twist on the serous super hero storyline and it works well with ryan renolds who i dont really like and is another reason to skip this film for me but hes great in it really does work and is a must watch if you like comedy but not really stupid comedy although a little far fetched in parts you cant complain it is a super hero movie after gets an 8 out of 10 for me and thats a surprise for me just stay clear from letting kids watch as there are a few adult meanings,comedy
i think this is the best marvel film yet and thats saying something i can see why ryan left dc because nobody could have pulled off this character better than he and though hell be missed as green lantern he breathed life into a character that may not have otherwise lived the repartee between he and morena is magical she is among the most beautiful women in the world and her quirky sense of humor and slanted smile is nearly enough to make me weep ever since firefly i knew 5 seconds into the credits that i would love this and really did the marvel universe keeps expanding while dc seems to be spread out yet convoluted and inconsistent i knew nothing of before this movie except that i often got it confused with deathlock and deathstroke and deadshot but will never again make that mistake i have a new favorite and cannot wait for the sequel chickachickaaa,comedy
this movie is one of the best films i have seen so far this year while it may not be the most serious or dramatic superhero movie it does have some dramatic moments and knows when to have them this movie takes itself seriously when it needs to but only when it absolutely has to which is not often this movie is crude and packed with tons of hilarious original jokes and i think that no one could have played this role better than ryan reynolds as far as superhero movies go this doesnt even come close to touching my all time favorite the dark knight however this movie is certainly one of a kind all the hype surrounding it was completely right is definitely worth seeing and maybe even buying on dvd would recommend for all who love a fun time at a good movie,comedy
an every day man meets the girl of his dreams but he finds he has a terminal illness and becomes a reluctant superhero when taking on the bad guys to reunite with his womandirector tim millers exceeds expectations its fast pace humorous bloody and violent rhett reese and paul wernick script with its fourthwall busting aspects puts as spin on the superhero film formula with wildly entertaining action set ups and selfaware witty dialogue even after the credits finish rolling ryan reynolds is excellent as wade wilsont j miller is notable as weasel wilsons best friend the rest of the cast do a great job for marvel fans theres plenty of nods and it also includes the colossus character the production values are high the score is pumping its a nice change from the norm so long as studios dont get on the bandwagon as saturate the marketgreat adult fun pure entertainment,comedy
started laughing at the start and carried on almost all the way is the film gory um yep is the violence over the top yep are the fight scenes top notch oh yep is there constant bad language um yepthis is not an intelligent film but doesnt claim to be this is a fun film a fun adult filmit is a step away from any of the other superhero films who now take themselves very seriously throughout the film other superhero films are constantly made fun of including the superhero landing saw batman v superman the next week it was there its tongue in cheek humour is a breath of fresh air and a pleasure to see pizza this film then pub and beer a top notch night out,comedy
yes indeed ryan reynolds second take on beats crazy lazer eyed bamfing mute that we got in xmen origins wolverine was done right thanks to the love and passion that the people making this film had for this property and character it was like seeing walk right out of a comic book page watching reynolds i just feel like seeing i really feel impressed that the third wall breaking was done great too it wasnt sort of cringe but actually made sense and those jokes do land well i think that the eyes part on the mask being able to squint really helps build character and makes him seem so much more charismatic with those were no longer just staring at a mask without really delving into emotions because after all is known for his outgoingness and without that would seem quite inwards and toned down unlike the waynow despite all the praise i am giving it has its flaws but i dont believe they surpass the positives by far i didnt really like the order of events being not in chronological order because i feel that it is unnecessary some of my friends told me this too but really that is just cherry picking some people told me that they felt that didnt live up to the hype if you are one of those people ive gotta say that you shouldnt be penalizing because it isnt as good as what someone else told you because whether something is good is completely opinion based and just because it isnt as good as you thought its still pretty goodi am very interested now in how is going to further tie in to the xmen universe the appearances from colossus and negasonic teenage warhead it would be great to see appearances from xmen of the main roster and to see in the main xmen movies too if we see appear in the announced last hugh jackmanwolverine movie that would be greatds second take on,comedy
if  just something different  the world of superheroes has been exploited in recent years and leaves the pattern  it was worth the wait to ryan reynolds good action much sarcasm and comedy  violence and blood  at times it seems a parody but it happens there are things that perhaps might be improved but by way of rights  did not like the rest of the xmen another thing that strikes me is that if is able to regenerate a hand because he is not regenerate or healthy skini still recommend her remember its for adults,comedy
i am very surprised to see this movie with such a high rating i was looking forward to watching it especially since nearly everybody had given it rave reviews having watched it i must say i am bitterly disappointed  if ever a movie suffered because it was overhyped this is it im not saying its a terrible movie badly acted or even badly conceived action sequences  its all just ok i didnt find it particularly funny his inane quips even started getting on my nerves by the end of the movie its worth watching if you are a fan of comic book heroes you may even enjoy it  i just found it all a bit samey if this movie was a colour it would be beige its ok but dont believe the hype like i did and expect it to be great,comedy
is the perfect movie to watch for anyone looking to laugh and is old enough to digest obscenities and isnt offendedi see many people complaining about the fan boys giving a rating of 10 i am not a fanboy the only thing i knew about before this movie was that he featured in xmen origins  wolverine but this movie deserves a 10 the best movies arent only the ones that make you cry or give you the feels a funny movie can also be one of the best there doesnt have to be a good director and major plot twists for that this is because movies are divided into genres this means a very nice animated movie or an extremely funny comedy movie can have high ratingsnow for the moviethe opening credits themselves indicate that you are in for a showryan reynolds was made for this he is and he steals the show breaks the 4th wall with ease and doesnt overdo it he is perfect with his jokes and continuous blabbering you wont stop laughing also apart from his all other roles can be considered as cameosmorena baccarin looked extremely hot a decent outing for a short roleed skrein  he plays the villain in this movie a joke for a villain his character was though and the reason for the rivalry was stupid but i figure this was deliberate to not shift the focus from deadpooltim miller  the director has done a commendable job to make the final product this amazingalso i would like to congratulate the marketing team one of the most awesomely marketed movies ever the expectations were so high and the movie didnt disappoint anyoneoverall it was a pleasant experience and a new one indeedwhy do i give this 10 i went to watch to be entertained and entertained i was not bored for even a second except for a few towards the end i am so glad the filmmakers decided to take this risk and give us this movie i hope this proves to be an inspiration for many other such equally entertaining movie not wannabe ones though people who are easily or even difficultly offended dont watch this stay after the credits start a surprise awaits,comedy
it was the best superhero movie to date no glam production like the obvious suspects but a very modest movie with terrific jokes some of the quotes were so funny im considering watching it again in less than a week also ryan raynolds didnt seem too pretentious and what i liked best is that he was so spontaneous with the jokes  to the extent that he really grew in my eyes as an actorthe plot is absolutely nothing new you could pretty much foresee how things will develop but do watch it for the humour you wont regret the experience id give it a 10 but superheroes are not my thing necessarily which is why i leave it at 9 but im awaiting another r raynold comedy now as i am keen to see the sequel of deadpool,comedy
i am very disappointed to see blatant vote manipulation on here for this movie dont expect this movie to be an 8 its entertainng and a fun watch but does not merit a score of 8 imdb really should start breakdown score instead of general score this movie is an origin story of character in marvel universe how he became superhero and join forces with other superhero characters is a superhero character but without the seriousness of a superhero this is really more of a comedy genre with good amount of amazing action scenes theres plenty of injoke humor for the fans not as funny for nonfans i feel this movie tries too hard to be edgy and relies too much on profanity to be funny that it feels cringey at some parts maybe thats intentionalstorytellingwise i think its quite effective due to its less serious nature the movie plays out quite well it doesnt feel slow and draggy lots action and funnies an overall entertaining fun watch,comedy
if you like simple and rude humor lots of violence and cgi explosions this movie might be a good choice for you but if you like anything beyond that this movie is nothing it claims to be original and something different from a typical superhero movie but in fact its plain and mediocre the only originality is that the main character is a rude person with a foul sense of humor so what does it affect the story in any sense no are there any interesting events emerging from these traits of our superhero not one he might have as well been as dull as a superman and i dont find sort of humor particularly sparkling for the most part its just dirty commentary on what happens on the screen besides you dont need to see this movie more than once for any reason everything is plain no mystery no twist no hidden meaning why do i give it a 5 then it is entertaining no slowing down of action its visually sufficiently pleasant but nothing out of the ordinary dialog is not particularly smart but it maintains a certain level without dropping too low and of course morena baccarin is gorgeous especially naked all in all its a solid professional work but no masterpiece for certain,comedy
audacious sagacious hilarious in a smaller word  fun the script on this movie worked from top to bottom and talking about timing on the jokes and i should say clever totally clever jokes another thing throughout the whole movie you should pay attention for the references sometimes references to another movie sometimes to an artist and or a song this i think was craftily done it couldnt work any better the surprise performance was from morena baccarin she was great in her role matching perfectly on the screen with the main protagonist ryan reynolds didnt not let this new opportunity to slip through his finger which i think helped and contributed for the success of the movie,comedy
fairly unexpected coming from already twotime superhero carcrash reynolds and surprisingly refreshing in a cinematic universe thats in desperate need of juicethe circus is on point from start to finish and it succeeds so by not taking itself all too serious reynolds hits the spot by being well reynolds he balances the sarcasm with comic punchlines swimmingly and breaks the 4th wall without forcing us to cringe storyline may be whatever a critic wishes but we are not here to bring you deep and insightful dishes of moral escapades a la the dark knight no we are here to make you smile for the next 2h i get that one does smilea lot heck i even laughed out loudbeing it became a huge thunderstorm success it was inevitable for it to become followed by an oncoming sequel on that however one is in doubt hoping it will reprise itself gloriously oh yes but the big butter will be for it to keep itself out of the seriousness swamp without becoming repetitive unless it wants to appear repetitive for the mere sake of yet again to be indulged as tastefully careless,comedy
as a fan who has been following this character before he had any movies i was ecstatic when i saw the film i lived through the painful adaptation of in xmen origins wolverine and was glad ryan reynolds shared the pain this pain gave him the drive to push for a film that would do the character justice and make fans happy  this film did just thatnow the story is nothing special by any means but never has his story arcs in the comics really hit any high notes but what did was his character quirksmotormouth 4th wall breaking etc seeing is believing and never have i seen a character portrayed as if it were jumping out of the comic pages themselves needless to say if youre a fan this movie wont disappoint,comedy
its great to see a film that sets out to do something and absolutely nails it andthe makers whoever they were must have met a lot of studio opposition i wonder whether the studio learned from the antman experience and just let the writers director actors ride the waveadmittedly you have to have an inner 13yearold boy to enjoy it but a surprising number of people doand underneath all the stylism the action the talking to the camera the jokes the flipping back and forth all brilliantly done is a great love storyfolks you can be loved if youre ugly though it helps if you have humour a motor mouth the odd superpower or two and genuinely love the gal,comedy
the movie was almost everything i expected in a script i only gave it an 8 because it tended to slow down a bit during the many origin story flashbacks something that is unfortunate but necessary dont get me wrong i understand why we need the origin story but is just one of those rare occurrences where having to go back to the origins is really lame back when was first released we needed an origin that origin was used to gradually intrigue the reader and get them familiar with a hero who was set far outside the realm of what we expected a herovillain to be the more time that passed the more outrageous became and he eventually grew into the figure that we know and love today now it feels like we were all put on hold so the story can go backwards and allow everyone else who thinks comic books are stupid to catch up again necessary for box office profits but it makes the rest of us bored during those periods of time im not trying to discourage anyone from seeing it though it is a really fun movie the rest of it made me laugh uncontrollably plenty of action jokes and gore to satisfy even the most hardened fan plus now that the origin is out of the way 2 can focus on taking all of the good stuff from this movie and jamming more of it in the second one,comedy
is the most anticipated marvel movie since the avengers and for good reason if you are unfamiliar with the character is the outcast of the superhero world hes got the moves and the abilities but rarely does or says the right thing for that matter he doesnt get along much with anyone either ryan reynolds stars as the not so super hero and he is literally perfect for the role its as if the comic book was written last week with reynolds specifically in mind it was that great of a match there is certainly a ton of hype around the character the actor and where it may eventually lead but the truth is that the story really isnt anything special i assume the film is meant to be about the character and how funny he is making the story an after thought but how can that be in a major motion picture the film is your typical guy falls in love loses his girl because of a bad guy and then goes looking for revenge a common theme in every marvel film there is nothing different exciting or shocking about the story for the purposes of its all about the character he curses he kills he makes fun of other marvel films and yes hes very funny but to me it was also a bit over the top since being acquired by disney marvel is trying more and more to appeal to adult audiences and wants to show that its films can be just as bloody and crude as anybody elses point made the first time i watched i thought it was a weak story and a little over the top but the second time i saw it i thought it was a weak story and really over the top the bottom line the character is great ryan reynolds is amazing there are some great oneliners and laugh out loud moments but as far as the story goes it leaves a lot to be desired as it was predictable weak and has been done time and time again,comedy
from the studio that inexplicably sewed his fking mouth shut the first time comes meone of the greatest antihero  the merc with a mouth  wade wilson was once a special forces operative but turned mercenary after being subjected to a rogue experiment he finds himself with accelerated healing and transforms himself into armed with weapons and a wicked sense of humor he will stop at nothing to track down the men responsiblenever have i seen so many fans or moviegoers dying to see a character like on the big screen its a bit like how everyone wanted to see the avengers on the big screen back in late 2011 its bad enough that the studios cant seem to get the character right with the disaster that was xmen origins wolverine but the respect and love that fans have for this character stayed strong until everyones prays was finally answered by this movie and it did not disappoint because lives up to hype by being entertaining and hilarious while i dont think its an a like chris stuckmann rated it or a masterpiece of all comic book movies but did i have fun watching this movie absolutely its a film that fans wanted and got i cant imagine anyone else in hollywood playing but only ryan reynolds he was born to play this character and hes the only actor that i think of to do the character justice reynolds as expected did that and thats make the character of hes own he was terrific has the mouth talking anthero badass this is ryan reynolds come back role after his past disasters roles that mostly involves green lantern and origins wolverine that this movie brilliantly makes fun off reynolds was just perfect for this character and he did a great performance in this film he delivered the comedic timing and the somewhat of a hidden charm that has ryan reynolds absolutely nailed it the writing in this movie was surprisingly good which i didnt expect for a movie with this kind of character of course there are easter eggs references and nods to the comics and marvel movies but in this movie its done in such a way that feels kind of refreshing i know for a fact that i missed a lot of the jokes and references due to amount of laughter that i had while watching the movie i can say it with a brave face that the writing is this movies biggest strength because its self awareness on marvel movies and itself was all top notchim so happy that this movie is rated r and not some water down pg 13 movie because if you honestly think a movie should be rated pg13 then you really dont know the character at all im taking to you grace randolph just because some little eight year old boy who probably doesnt know who really is whats to see the movie but cant because hes not old enough to see it doesnt mean it should be changed to a pg13 for someone who doesnt even know the character of these fans have waited 7 or 8 years for this character to be done right so this little boys mother should teach him some patience now for the flaws how much better would this movie be if it had visual comedy i mean edge wright should seriously do a marvel movie because i know for a fact that he will make the best marvel movie ever when it comes to its comedy pasting and execution something that age of ultron couldnt do i highly recommend seeing every frame and printing video on how to do visual comedy because tony zhou knows some much about movies better then i do but thats what i felt was missing in this movie and i know this is tim millers first big film and an impressive one as well but im just saying that it would be really brilliant if there was visual comedy in a movie with while i did think the writing was great but some of the jokes in the movie i didnt find that funny and no its not because i didnt get it or i didnt understand the reference because all of the jokes and reference in this movie i understood clearly its just that i didnt find some of it funnyoverall is a fresh entertaining comic book movie that its hard for any comic book lover not to like this movie you bet ill be seeing the squeal when it comes out since i know its in good hands,comedy
is to the superhero movie phenomena what the wild bunch 1969 was to westerns at a time every single caped crusader is fit neatly into a little box to justify a franchise or a teamup or a resurgence or an origin story dares to skewer the clichs the faux intensity and yes even the fans dont get me wrong doesnt exactly reinvent the wheel weve seen superhero films with a tinge of satire like kickass 2010 super 2010 and even a little in guardians of the galaxy 2014 the difference here is i think now people will be clamoring for more of the novelty showcased in and for that reason this film is a game changerryan reynolds stars as wade wilson a mercenary with a talent for guns swords and wisecracking hes nicknamed the merc with the mouth by those who know him but to troubled nymph vanessa maccarin hes the love of her life that is until he is diagnosed with stage four cancer and has mere months to live sniffing out an opportunity a shadowy organization headed by ajax skrein decides to recruit him to go through an experimental procedure that just might save his life and turn him into an unstoppable assassin problem is the procedure produces unintended consequences resulting in angrily tracking down those who almost killed himthe secret to comic book appeal is his dark sense of humor liberating amorality and unique abilities as a fourthwall breaker throughout his various teamups largely with wolverine and spiderman he lampoons and undercuts any attempts at drama or seriousness with a few zingers and a lot of borderline cartoony mayhem in that respect became part of the early 90s jaded take on comic books only with a longevity that surpassed the mask or the tickthe movie attempts to transcribe some of wackiness to the big screen and it largely succeeds thanks to xmen side characters colossus kapicic and new xavier school cadet negasonic teenage warhead hildebrand they play the straight man to shtick and the movie would be at a disadvantage if they were left out teenage warhead in particular does such a good job stonewalling every single one of wades mugging and gleeful 80s references that she should get her own movie seriously get diablo cody on it right nowthe other thing has going for it is the relationship between wade and vanessa their chemistry is undeniable and composes the creamy gooey center that makes the occasionally foul easy to digest unlike everything else in the film theres no irony or meanspirited jokes at her expense i am a little disappointed the film gave vanessa so little to do at the beginning wade confesses this isnt your average superhero movie yet by the end there he is saving the girland what of the foul bits has gratuitous nudity naughty language and a heck of a lot of violence its ironic that a movie very much geared towards the sensibilities of young teenage boys should have a hard rrating but one cant help but admire such an auspicious choice in fact as a former teenage boy myself i hardily enjoyed all the insanity it never quite reaches the level of sustained aweinspiring showstopping extremes i would have liked but not every shootem up can be shootem up 2007in case you were curious there are fourthwall breaks a lot of them many of them are geared towards reynoldss other attempts at superhero glory wolverine origins 2009 and the very poorly received green lantern 2011 movie that in congress with comparing xaviers school for gifted youth to a boy band cranks the postmodern hipster dial to elevenreynolds has said before that has been a labor of love for him no doubt his entire career has been leading up to this film ever since his two guys a girl and a pizza place 19982001 days finally after years of teasing the film has been brought to the big screen its violent dirty childish and loose with the mentioning of rival franchises and god love him for it,comedy
one of the best aspects of the movie is how it is able to poke fun at the tropes and stereotypes of current superhero movies while still being an incredibly enjoyable superhero movie it is delightfully self aware and packs in more laughs per minute than most comediesit is also refreshing to have a superhero movie focus on a morally grey antihero who puts his wants and needs above the greater good or what is morally right and have the audience still be able to relate to his motivationsthat being said it is far from a perfect movie while it makes some great decisions such as making it a hard r and telling the story in a nonlinear fashion there are definitely some flaws that take away from the uniqueness of the film listed below1 despite the unique concepts and the satire of superhero movies the film still suffers from the flaws of many comic book movies such asa an uninteresting one dimensional villain very generic bland motivations he is just evil and not really much elseb a cookie cutter plot while the nonlinear narrative compensates for this it is still a very traditional super hero origin movie guy gets superpowers girl gets kidnapped guy saves girl while it is told in a unique fashion that keeps the attention and interest of the viewer when reflecting back after the movie you realize that not a whole lot happened this relates to the second flaw namely2 the film is not as rewatchable as most superhero movies the trailers spoil many of the best jokes of the film and the first 10 or so minutes of the film are essentially just an extended version of one of the trailers many of the jokes hit as hard as they do on the first viewing because they are unique and unexpected for the genre but after the shock wears off they dont hold up quite as much upon repeated viewingsall of that being said though those are a couple of gripes that are essentially unrelated to the first viewing of the movie the first time watching the movie these flaws are noticeable but you dont care about them because of just how funny and unique the film is while it is not a perfect film it is a very important film as it is a breath of fresh air for the superhero genre and shows the viability of rrated superhero movies or rrated blockbusters in generalthis film is a must see for anyone of the appropriate age with even a passing interest in comedies action movies or superhero movies,comedy
a real good marvel movie with a real good r rating,comedy
is a superhero movie like no other before it its main character is filled with personality and is way more than comic relief it is funny action packed and fourth wall breaking from the opening credits to the posts credits scene,comedy
i a huge fan of this character i was blown away i did not think they could pull this kind of movie off it is a berath of fresh air in a world over crowded with comic book movies loved it,comedy
watched this movie more than five timesand ill probably watch it another ten times more great acting killer laughs plenty of action some cheeky romance original story lineneed more movies like this instead of the lame unoriginal super hero crap pfffft batmansuperman got nuthn on this,comedy
tries so hard to be funny by using purile and dirty humour that is actually pretty sexist in a machismo kind of way i presume that one reason this film is so popular just because is pansexual because its so wonderful and sexy in the trendsetting banalities framework of the films like this rather than just being treated like a sexuality like any other another reason i hate this film is because it is being touted as though it is edgy and brilliant just because what theres a load of meaningless gore and sexual references god they must live sheltered lives with little juvenile minds to call this film one big exercise in juvenility would be an insult to young people patronising would probably be better,comedy
this is a really great movieas a long time marvel fan i was happy to see they brought the backstory and the way they implemented it worked really wellit is a really funny movie and i love the 4rth wall breaks that are everywhere,comedy
this movie is awesome unique fourth wall breaking and darkbrutally honestly humor makes up for a by the number plot great songs and acting looking forward to seeing the sequel,comedy
you know i wanted to like because the action scenes were cool but i wasnt laughing because his jokes werent funny and he kept interrupting his own movie it was like mystery science theater 3000 or his own audio commentary i can understand that being funny in waynes world but that had better jokes and werent superheroes if you want to see rent the dirty harry sequel the dead pool,comedy
is fast funny 4th wall breaking excellence it actually surprises me that ryan reynolds even did this after xmen origins completely destroyed the character after seeing xmen origins i wasnt sure about another but damn this just brings so much more to the table it shows that the writersevidentlywerent afraid to use seemingly endless crude humor gleeful profanity nonstop violence and some moreintimate moments the strip club part i think the movie couldve done without thoughhimself is even more of a character in this movie instead of being whatever the hell he was supposed to be in xmen origins may god forever curse that movieinstead of a mouthless mindless weapon we have a charming zany smartass rad dude with a bad tude on screen donning his bright red christmas suit to go hunt down the people on his naughty listis to me the best xmen movie ever,comedy
the film opens with realistic gag credits and playing ann murray i think it was her and not a juice newton cover we have our main character going after a bad guy ed skrein being interrupted colossus stefan kapicic and introduces moody teen negasonic teenage warhead brianna hildebrand the film then resorts to flashbacks of ryan reynolds not to be confused with green lantern aka wade wilson becoming the near super hero operating with his own set of vigilantespecial operations ethicsthe film spoofs avengerxmen films with numerous asides and one liners it is critical of the shallow film industry in general while creating the same shallow film the language in this film is adult more adult than kickass but is much funnier this is not for the kids but a good comedy for adults who like super hero films and i also know people who dont like super hero films but loved this oneguide many fwords brief sex and nudity 2 has been announced with ryan reynoldsnote to self seltzer water and lemon takes out blood,comedy
this review contains spoilersis a standalone superhero movie starring ryan reynolds as the character is an origin story on the character it follows his origins and subsequent revenge on the group that wronged him along the way a pair of xmen try to redeem deadpoolretains its comic book charm and violence in this liveaction adaptation the movie has constantly making jokes even when the subject manner gets darker the movie makes light of many dark situations such as horrendous disfiguring that brings the movie back into a lighter tone since this movie is an origin story much of backstory is told here however his story is not fully complete as the xmen acquaintances the colossus and negasonic teenage warhead are not explained fully the plot is incredibly basic as it is a simple revenge story that is told through flashbackseven with its basic plot the story has some highlights in the way it is paced with humor and wit the story remains engaging the true highlights in the movie are its action sequences the action in this movie is well shot and well performed the effects and sets are well detailed it is easy to watch the movie solely for its action scenes to fill the price of admissionit is easy to recommend to anyone looking for witty dialogue and entertaining action anyone looking for a movie to transcend the typical superhero movie plots should look elsewherethree stars out of four stars,comedy
is a different superhero movie mainly because its rated r but its also very entertaining and memorablethe story is really simple and not dull the story isnt too focused on its just another origin story but what matters in the movie are the charactersthe acting is good ryan reynolds is literally a walkingtalking in real life negasonic is still the coolest superhero nameand people this movie is not for kids but kids need to watch to thisits a really good and funny film and its one my favorite movie of all time,comedy
if you like the right mix of superhero love friendship and real life stuff then this is for you all the many reviews about the swearing need to get a life yes this is one for the adults not the kids ive never written a review in here before but the groaners compelled me to do so this film made me laugh and cry at the same timeno mean feat and if you cant see the story the point or the entertainment you are blinder than blind al kudos to ryan reynolds and the rest of the cast with a nice cameo from the genius stan lee ps watch after the credits,comedy
my second favorite wade wilson im a cowboys fan fun movie with lots of laughs the opening credits are just the start great shots at green lantern and stan lee as a strip club dj nice love the roommate the bartender and the girlfriend didnt love how slow the backstory unravels especially in the lab nor did i like the strange inclusion of two xmen  the first scene we see them in really doesnt make much sense like why on earth did the stop him whatever good movie good humor and excellent music cant wait for 2,comedy
a truly wellmade masterpiece that involves hilarious comedy but also subtle drama and a very eyecatching summary has topped one of the top marvel movies that fox owns a very intriguing antagonist and an origin story that flips in and out of how he became the merc with a mouth we do not have to wait for the merc with a mouth to finish up to how he got there instead the fantastic director tim miller has given us a chance to interact with the foulmouthed fantasticallymade antihero with his weapons and his mission but also tells us his backstory as the movie progressesoverall fantastic movie worth to watch over and over and over againgo watch ,comedy
we finally get a great non family friendly superhero movie with its some of it one liners it almost so hard to resist laughing the whole movie plus we actually get a good movie from ryan reynolds overall great movie just not for the kids,comedy
i really really liked and you know what i didnt expect to seriously i was never a fan of the character in the sense that i hardly knew anything about him and the humor as well as the violence seemed forced and overdone in the trailers still i remained interested in the film i just never expected it to actually be good  until the reviews arrived after most critics unexpectedly showered this newest superhero movie with praise i went in cautiously optimistic but still fully prepared to hate the filmthe first thing i noticed was how inventive the storytelling is the film throws you into the action from the first moment literally the very first moment and then it goes back and forth in brilliant and unexpected ways to slowly unspool the story of this insane  but oddly charming  antihero flashbacks and fastforwards can be annoying as hell but when done right they can help render even a somewhat simple story fresh and exciting and thats exactly how felt to me right from the start like a fresh if somewhat dirty jolt of energythe action itself is beautifully designed employing playful visuals and using pretty much every camera technique available it never feels repetitive and the pacing is close to perfection but and that was probably the key to me liking the film so much theres a beating heart underneath all the action and carnage and that has a lot to do with how brilliantly ryan reynolds portrays the character and the great chemistry he has with costar morena baccarin what came as a complete surprise to me was how unabashedly romantic is the love story in this film is probably the most sincere ive ever seen in a superhero movie and it gives the film the strong emotional core which so many of these movies lackthe humor which i initially feared would just be nonstop juvenile wisecracks and soon become distracting also works surprisingly well not every line or every joke lands  but thats the beauty of this character they dont really need to cant help himself as long as hes able to breathe hell crack wise and make fun of himself and those around him its a clinical condition hes not a standup comedian whose jokes need to land hes a madman albeit a very entertaining one and the comedy in his case is born out of tragedydespite all my praise its not a perfect film the villain in this revenge tale could be more memorable and the story itself is a bit too derivative to really do its highly unconventional protagonist he insists hes not a hero justice but its a damn good first entry in a franchise that will hopefully explore the character and his world to a much larger extent in the sequels and its actually a very important film for another reason if is a financial success  which at this point is already clear it will be  this could play a vital role in how studios henceforth view the financial prospects of rrated superhero films and well hopefully see more of them in the future,comedy
instantly became one of those films that will werent many watches defying the usual make up of a comic book super hero type reynolds delivery of his lines although with added immaturity gave laughter pretty much from start to finishtotally character driven i can only hope the sequel lives up to this one,comedy
i saw on valentines day 2016 the day that it released ive now seen it about six other times this movie is fuckin perfectif you love the character youll love this movie hands down its a perfect adaptation which means the comedy is great the action is great the characters are great everything is greatgo see it if you havent and take me along with you so that i can see it again,comedy
if youre considering a trip down to your local multiplex to catch the unlikeliest xman in all his fourth wall breaking glory then chances are you know a little about what youre going to get already from the gloriously silly opening credits wants to make one thing clear right off the bat this is not going to be a shy movie if theyre going to do theyre going to do it right this timeas is well known by now the last time they brought the merc with the mouth to the big screen it was in 2009s abysmal xmen origins wolverine where they took the decision to allow a significant part of his screen time to take place with his mouth sewn shut this time around there will be no mouthsewing instead we get plenty of crude humour gratuitous violence and all the fourth wall breaking we can handle this is the way it should always have beenwade wilson reynolds makes the untimely discovery that he is riddled with cancer its untimely because he has just met the woman of his dreams in an act of desperation he agrees to undergo an unorthodox procedure that will supposedly cure him and as an added bonus hell get superpowers as always with these things its not going to be that straightforward end result he becomes hes super but hes definitely not a hero and he has one thing on his mind revenge against the people that did this to himis consistently laughoutloud funny from the witty oneliners to the numerous sight gags with so much more dotted throughout if you dont mind your humour being a bit silly and more than bit crude then this is one of the funniest youll have seen in a long time its also excessively violent the censors decision to go with the 15 certificate in the uk will certainly be raising a few eyebrowstonally is fairly consistent the only noticeable exception to this are the scenes inside the facility where wilson is being tested by the shady people who have brought him there to cure him it is in these scenes where events take a very dark turn almost too dark this humourless sequence sticks out like a sore thumb and threatens to hamper the film momentarily fortunately its not too long before were back to the quipping and dick jokesat a time where the superhero flick could do with maybe taking a step back and easing off the taking itself too seriously pedals arrives like a breath of fresh air to a genre that is fast showing signs of being worn though you might want to consider leaving the kids at home for this one,comedy
was this really the meta parody that its cracked up to be short answer no is more of a hypocritical albeit comedic critique on the superhero genredont get me wrong it was a good time entertaining funny true to the source material and an interesting enough origin story ryan reynolds doesnt do a bad job as his somewhat recurring character and fits the part pretty well he doesnt seem to always have the best comic timing or ability but then again some jokes are only so funny when they come from an expressionless cgi head the comedy at times was spoton and at other times juvenile and forced but considering the rapid fire pace of everything in this film you didnt really have time to get discouraged about it tj miller added even more comic relief but the person who really shone in that department was leslie uggams who played blind unlikely roommate every moment with the duo on screen was laughable from their exchange of snide remarks and insults or just the general situationas funny as it was which is really all it had going for it in the end is just another bigbudgeted mindless actionpacked explosion full of atrocious cgi its really just an rrated version of what weve already seen sure it wasnt another green lantern experience but it wasnt a uniquely fresh spin on the genre like something we got with kickass a film cant really be considered a parody if it becomes the tropes that its satirizing is not much different than any other of the numerous superhero films coming out today it just takes a different path to the same singleminded goal of box office success,comedy
even the very beginning of the film proves how good this movies it starts with a panning close up of a fight in a car while time is stopped with humorous mock credits are shown this somewhat breaks the tone of what most generic action movies do in which they would show the fight scene in a time freeze while the opening credits go by and then unfreeze to the action but once again surprises us by instead of speeding up to create intensity it slows down and shows a taxi scene the whole movie uses the generic action movie formula to create humorous by going against what that formulas expectation the non diegetic also plays into this since during action scenes it is slightly intense low sounding and fast tempo songs but when makes a joke the music cuts and the one liner is made the movie is using what we expect of action super hero movies to its complete advantage in order to make a total unique action movie like the anti hero it stars,comedy
oh boy did i enjoy aside from being hilarious and the main characters lovable charisma and persona it delivered an intense action packed dramaticallystorylined movie with no chance of yawning or leaving your place at any minute it was fastpaced and very clever of a dialogue that was although i am not so much into this superhero kinda thing but guess what  ive already lent the dvd to my friends because is just that good 910,comedy
this movie is my favorite movie of all time the movie beautifully blends comedy with action ryan reynolds is perfectly cast as yes stan lee is in the movie like all marvel movies this movie should be on everyones list of must sees some movies that you should watch if you like this movie are guardians of the galaxy guardians of the galaxy 2 spiderman homecoming and iron man,comedy
the actor who plays or wade wilson ryan reynolds was a very good choice he did a great job portraying the character using his ever expanding arsenal of delicious snark an operative turned mercenary turned cancer patient turned medical experiment then turned constantly and only thinking about revenge to the one who cured him with his character talking directly to us it makes us a part of the movie throughout the movie you see many different types of camera and lighting shot to set the mood of that scene during the time that they are shooting the scene when he is in the medical office they are using low level lighting at the end when they are shooting the main fight scene at the end of the movie they are using a high level lighting the lighting is another very helpful tool to set the various moods and different type of scene throughout the movie when they use the different camera angles like in the beginning they use the close up this is the first time we see this later in the movie you see the technique like when hes in the cab  the close up angle is used to portray a mood of seriousness this movie was a very good movie and im am looking forward to the second movie coming out in 2018 if the second movie is as good as the first one then that will make one great movie sequence,comedy
ok so i think most us can agree the way that ryan reynolds plays any character is brilliant and sunny no matter what he does ryan reynolds was casted perfectly for this role and i cant wait for 2 to come out next year the only annoying thing about this film is the rating attached to it unfortunately i wasnt able to go and see it in the cinema so i had to instead wait until it came out on dvd to see it and i can honestly day that i was not disappointed with it i was laughing the entire way through the film partially because of the pure comedy and satire of the film but also because some of it is somewhat relatable to in my mind has been a pretty underrated marvel character and now he finally has his own movie i did think it was pretty late to bring out a film about him as in the comics he has actually killed every character in the marvel universe including the writers themselves however this was a fun short story that marvel produced but one the less back to the film though it was amazing in every aspect both action and comedy it was equally balanced and the casting for each and every member was perfectly picked i have already watched this at least two times follow me on instagram gabewatling and twitter gmwatling,comedy
is a breath of fresh air in a world dominated by generic boring marvel movies not all mcu movies are this way but there are a few that follow the same generic pattern like ant man thor the dark world and doctor strange of course the film takes place outside of the mcu and is coupled with the xmen movies made with 20th century fox who are not afraid to go out of their comfort zone sometimes it does not work like in xmen age of apocalypse but the nicest thing about this movie is it takes risks and succeeds is this film a masterpieceno however it was thoroughly enjoyable and went where not many comic book movies go people die in this film and does a lot of the killing without remorse and adding in some really funny lines that flow easily most of the jokes in this film make sense and add an air of comedy to the situation however some jokes were not funny in my opinion like the brown pants joke which falls shortanyway the plot plot wise this film is simple wade wilson falls for a hooker gets cancer tries to save himself with experiments which give him a fast healing factor curing him but leaving him disfigured he goes after the guy who did this and ultimately kills him and saves his girlfriend in the process nothing more to itsimple plots are sometimes a great thing as they allow for characters to be introduced and interact in interesting and fun ways is shown to the world as a wise cracking violent forth wall breaking antihero and that is just what the audience want to see the fact that none of these characters come to any realisation or develop is half the charm of the actual movie in generic marvel movies the character does develop in lame ways by either learning a new skill or learning to work together as a team something along those lines this film has none of that and instead we are treated to nearly 2 hours of gags and violence honestly in this movie it is not a bad thing to have that as it is a unique experience and a break from the normanyway onto the characters and the actors who play them ryan reynolds does a great job as he is very charismatic funny and acts the part of like we can say hugh jackman is wolverine we can also say that ryan reynolds is in my opinion they could not have picked a better actor to play him he just fits the idea of what most people think should sound like and act like so well done ryanajax or francis is a boring bad guy his major thing is that he hates being called francis for some reason it really triggers him as well which i found a bit retarded most villains are wronged in some way or have a traumatic experience ajax has none of these things and is a bit of a boring character to watch as he just fits the british bad guy stereotype if we take a villain like loki or magneto we see that really ajax it not a very competent villain his henchwoman that he hangs with is boring too and doesnt say any lines of interest she is only in the film as musclethe xmen are characters that work well in this film however they are the most stereotypical good guys in a marvel inspired movie to date this is not really a thing that destroys the movie or takes you out of things however i found their lack of depth a bit disappointing considering colossus can be a really interesting character if done right if fact to say that most characters in this film stick to a stereotype would be a true enough statementfrom a technical side the cgi is done really well and even the cg blood is done tastefully the music is all popular songs instead of score and brings a sense of fun and playfulness to each scene especially the violent scenes the camera work on this film is pretty average for a superhero movie however i do like the bits where the camera being there is used to break the forth wall and provide a bit of comedy to the scenethis film is great i just wish it had a better villain and a little bit of depth to the supporting characters not just however i would advise seeing it and hope you enjoy it as much as i did just the nods to other comic films and the easter eggs in the film will be enough to satisfy the marvel fan boys the funny jokes and ryan reynolds as will be enough to satisfy everyone else,comedy
is the definition of a game changer the many that though r rated super hero movies could not work even though the first blade and punisher were good and watchmen was pretty good and kick  which was great finally got something good when the movie ended i was so amazed at how great it was funnyvulgar crude violent and sexy who doesnt want that in a moviethanks to logan the first r rated wolverine movie came out and was good thanks to many more superhero film will be r it was unexpected and in just over one hour and forty minutes it showed you that it could work some may think its immature others will think its just ok but most will probably love deadpool,comedy
now that its one of the most successful rrated movies of all time and has started a new wave of comic book movies targeted at the older crowd such as logan there is little doubt that will be a cult classic in the future so is it as good as youve heard in spite of a few reservations yes it largely is right off the bat ryan reynolds is the key to its success his performance is a perfect match for the character of and is among the best portrayals of a comic book character on screen of all time its easy to see why he got a golden globe nomination still not everything works theres a little too much time spent on the origin story and the villains are too weak you get the impression that theyre meant to be parodies of generic movie villains but theres nothing particularly memorable about them save for a few good scenes this leads to a finale that isnt quite as subversive or clever as the rest of the film now back to the positives the action is stylish particularly in the opening scene and the jokes are mostly hilarious sure some of them are a little crude but whether its breaking the fourth wall or poking fun at past xmen movies the gags land more often than not overall in spite of some shortcomings is a blast for comic book fans and ryan reynolds is perfect as the title character looking forward to 2,comedy
i honestly think that if it wasnt for ryan reynolds this movie would not have received the high average rating it got on here ladies and gents lets face it if was played by some average schmuck would you really be giving this movie 10 stars keeping in mind that he delivers the same lines the same way yes this is a snarky movie and its supposedly true to the original series but as a movie on its own its just cringeworthy the jokes are funnyish the beginning is loaded with unnecessary sex scenes and shots of reynolds a and towards the middle i was falling asleep because it just seemed like the movie was all over the place and not really going anywhere one of the most overhyped movies this year if you want a semilove story action snarky remarks and cheesy one liners and of course brief glimpses of ryan reynolds doing the nasty with a hot girl yes go ahead and watch this,comedy
2016  12 out of 4im not sure people need a plot description here but weve basically got a man named wade williams ryan reynolds who comes down with terminal cancer and he accepts a deal to try and have himself cured the doctor named francis ed skrein instead does a horrible experiment on him and soon the deformed man takes the name and goes out for revengeim not a comic book person and i know very little about them outside of what i see in movies with that said it seems got a pretty big group of people who gathered around to say that a rrated comic book movie would never work and that the studio was committing suicide well the box office numbers certainly proved them wrong as the film managed to take in a lot of money as well as please critics and fans personally speaking while most comic book movies are good they are start to look and sound alike so getting something as fresh as was terrifici think the best thing that can be said about the film is that it just stands out among the various other comic movies out there naturally the rrating is the selling point because this hero loves to cuss have sex tell dirty jokes and when he kills someone he wants their brains splattered everywhere all of this madness is what makes the film seem so fresh because the action scenes are pure 100 action with nonstop bloody violence that is just fun to watch the comic tone is hilarious at times due to the characters sarcastic nature and dirty mouth everything here works extremely well and this includes the real mutants and their super powers everything in the film is a joke and whats most shocking is that its all funnythe casting was certainly the most important thing and reynolds handles the role with ease i think its safe to say after watching the film that they selected the perfect man for the part and can you really think of anyone who would have done it better reynolds comic timing is flawless and he really makes one of the most memorable characters out there skrein is very good in the role as the villain and morena baccarin is also very good playing the love interest even more great humor comes from tj miller in his role as the comic reliefcertainly earns its rrating and delivers the goods in terms of dirty laughs and graphic violence im not sure how many other comic book movies are going to be willing to do this but this certainly stands out from the crowd and best of all is that the dirty humor isnt just a gimmick because it actually works very well,comedy
ryan reynolds thank you was everything i could hope for and love the comedy is grade a for my taste every quip that made had me laughing even in the midst of an action scene speaking of the action was beautifully done and more than satisfying in terms of brutality and being epic as much of a fan as i am of the marvel pg 13 movies this is one of my favorites in regards to the pure realness of the interactions i am a vulgar humor kind of guy and just happens to be exactly that aside from the action and humor the story line i felt was well done especially in the means of how it has phases of flashbacks and flashforwards all while keeps the audience entertained by his direct interaction with the crowd as we all know and love him to do a goes to fox for knocking this out of the park or maybe a goes to ryan reynolds for pouring his heart into making this film happen for us the fans who wanted a real film and not baraka from mortal kombat catch this film ladies and gentleman unless you do not like vulgar humor and blood and brutality and well just go see it you will love it,comedy
spoilers this film is not for the sensitive or squeamish there is pervasive strong language graphic nudity a lengthy sex montage and brutal violence and gore dont let the tv spots fool you this is not a family friendly film ignore your childs pleas to see this film just because its got marvel slapped on doesnt make it appropriate i loved almost every joke in this film except for 3 there is a masturbation scene and 2 references to the act the sex montage is done to the theme of various national holidaysdepending on what screening of the film you see during wades first fight with ajax you can see his genitals there is violent gore in this film the opening credits will tell you that great marvel film for an adult targeted audience 910 for some unnecessary sexual moments,comedy
bread pudding is good pudding but you cant make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich with bread pudding or can you last night i decided just to find out exactly that so i went to the store and asked the store clerk hey where be the bread pudding for i am on a quest to find the bread pudding and then make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich out of bread pudding and he said sir this is a library please keep your voice downi then realized that it was a library so the bread pudding must be under nonfiction sadly it wasnt the end,comedy
i just made an account on this ridiculous site for the soul purpose of addressing the massive amount of useless reviews posted about this movie the type of people who post bad reviews are a people who dont even know who is a very popular comic character b people who dont understand what is supposed to be like c people who live on the internet and have nothing better to do with their lives but whine and complain over a movie d people who were to dumb and lazy to do the research on the movie before they went to see itthe movie was good it had its cringe worthy moments but to be fair ever movie does and if you dont know who is then dont go and see the movie this movie was mostly aimed at fans if you dont know who is and you still wanna see the movie dont be surprised when you leave unhappy all because you didnt know what you were in for hope this review actually helped for a change and if i didnt well sorry it didnt help,comedy
i was not optimistic about seeing this movie given how superhero stories have been changed  twisted sic superman  batman so the lack of enthusiasm for this movie but this movie was as fresh as the morning dew and the action is so well interwoven in the story that one does not get any time to focus on anything but the movie the past  the present are both well presented and the action scenes are pretty vicious  funny with snide comments the story telling is truly refreshing the villain could have been more lethal but in hindsight more lethal villains result in unnecessary action scenes unduly prolonging the movie or procrastination of the story so i am glad with the short roles of the villains please marvel this is the right recipe for success keep it up highly recommended for viewing,comedy
from the outstanding opening credits to the hilarious postcredit scene breathes life into the superhero genre by essentially making fun of it ryan reynolds is the perfect voice of this mockery as he has experienced failure in the genre firsthand twice he might just be the finest casting choice for a superhero ever he captures the humor perfectly the film handles the origin story well by depicting wade as at the beginning and then switching back and forth between his origin and his current fight the action sequences are very well done and not repetitive is a reminder that superhero movies can bring new things to the table without trying to set up a sequel,comedy
when i first saw the trailer for i wasnt very impressed hear me out before you throw rotten fruit at me after watching the film i now realise why all the best parts are way too crude to include in the trailer this isnt the first time ive felt this way about a movie my initial reaction when i saw the trailer for the hangover was stupid  its now one of my alltime favourite filmsafter following vancityreynolds on instagram i was bombarded with marketing for the film i excused it because ryan reynolds is gorgeous so he clearly has a hall pass to do whatever the hell he wants in life naturally my turning point was when i saw his post regarding the billboard that fox had ingeniously placed on some busy highway in the stateshow can i dislike something which uses one of my favourite emojis  the happy turd then the rave reviews started flowing in rave reviews from some of my friends friends who i seriously trusted regarding their taste in film okay so im intrigued now consider my interest piquedas soon as the opening titles begin you know what youve gotten yourself into they set the tone for the rest of the film with its tongueincheek script and consistent breaking of the fourth wall the gore dial is switched up to high compared to its marvel counterparts which i actually find a little refreshing im sick i knowto me the film is the mutant ha see what i did there love child of antman and kickass so whats not to love oh and ryan reynolds gets his kit off too i know gross,comedy
crude crass and controversial hilarious creative fresh and violent goes to a place where other superhero films dont dare to go and the result is a total laughoutloud beatthemup calamity that sucks the audience right in and refuses to let go it doesnt mind in the slightest to make fun of itself relayed brilliantly through the antihero star of the show himself it sarcastically points the finger at the whole marvel superhero world but never forgets that it still must deliver the riotous impact that the viewer is expecting like many people i had never heard of and was unfamiliar with his whole world even with a cameo in the wolverine origins film as motor mouth wade wilson this offthewall character never made it in my comic book collectiondebut on the silver screen coincides with first time director tim millers virgin feature and what a way to announce your arrival there is nothing safe about millers production and with an r rating it couldnt have been anything less simply needed to be let loose to see where this outrageous character would take the whole film and right from the very first scene the audience will know that they are in for one hell of a ride rhett reese paul wernick and co had the very enviable task of being able to fabricate a narrative where the boundaries are not as constrained as its well known and famous rivals and the whole blasting spectacle benefits from the less conventional scriptfor the first part of the film we are treated to a story that goes from the present back to the past and then returning to the explosive present until we have all caught up with the crazy fast paced narrative and able to suck in some much needed oxygen wade wilson ryan reynolds is a mercenary of sorts he makes his living as a thug and standover man for those that will pay the right sum wade is also a smartarse quick witted and crude but then one evening he meets his match in the form of the very beautiful vanessa morena baccarin she has the ability to in successfully dealing with wades ways resulting in an adventurous and active relationship this all turns to sewerage when wade is diagnosed with a terminal illness that directly leads him to becoming the antihero with the help of an experimental cure that transforms him into an unstoppable force there is a side effect that quickly becomes obvious leading to carnage as with the help of some minor xmen goes about amusingly righting the wrongs that were thrust upon him by ajax ed skrein and save the woman he lovesryan reynolds is the only actor that could convincingly play this character he has experience in the super hero genre when he jumped the fence and rode into dc world to strut around in green as the lantern but it just didnt work out not to worry he is known for his outlandish behaviour but it does seem as if was in some way auspiciously written for him reynolds doesnt disappoint completely immersing himself in this performance that can only result in this very funny action packed production everyone else that appears along side ryan is there for the benefit of hilarious nature but by no means out of place the characters come and go but all play their part each providing moments of r rated controversy that will leave the audience in stitches the narrative is simple but it drives the merc with a mouth on a riotous journey to seek out his vengeance in typical ryan reynolds style it is his film and he grabs it with both hands and feet but rememberhe isnt a hero,comedy
this was a strange experience watching this movie because it is neither a purebred comedy action flick or superhero movie by creating a movie like filmmakers merge these three genres into one for me at least undefinable genre the movie is funny alright no question about it from the very first shot of the opening scene we are introduced to who is a fast mouthing mercenary on a quest for personal vengeancemixed in between the countless snappy comebacks hilarious oneliners or downright retarded comments quest is a violent one and still within the opening scene of the movie he shoots stabs crushes decapitates and in general just kills a bunch of other mercenaries while on his quest is in an open dialogue with the audience narrating his own origin story many times he refuses the idea of this being anything related to a superhero movie but the attentive watcher will notice countless references to different parts of both the dc  marvel universes at some points during the movie it feels like we are supposed the feel bad or feel sorry for some of the movies protagonists but when the same scene is presented with a goofy oneliner the whole empathy thing is dropped to the ground for a brief moment i loose complete track of what feelings the scene is supposed to create and its mostly because of these scenes i cannot rate higher that i do,comedy
i really really loved i went into the cinema with high expectations and i came out with none of my expectations broken or exceeded i left feeling content and happy knowing that this movie matched how awesome the trailer looked ryan reynolds playing had me from the beginning of its inception i dont think any other actor could play the role as well as he did the storytelling was extremely inventive given how long the run time was 1hr 48min it felt as though there was minimal plot to the movie however it was the way it was told that grabbed me and kept me enthralled from start to finish the protagonist is thrown right into the action from the word go and from then on it goes back and forth in its storytelling of this insane yet charming character named and how he came to be flashbacks in movies usually annoy the heck out of me but in this one it was done right with no boring scenes only coming across as fresh and exciting the action was such a beautiful creation in this movie every scene beautifully showing off its gloriously gory headshots the pacing is almost perfect in this movie as it never comes to a standstill or dull point the story movies seamlessly underneath all of the action is the fantastic chemistry between ryan and his co star morena baccarin beneath all of the carnage shone a great love story which mixed well into the movie it had a strong emotional core to it which i think is the best that has been seen in any marvel movie yet the humor was fantastic whilst not all of the jokes hit well or even if some of the references were not understood there was enough ingenious humour in the movie to keep the laughs rolling being tim millers directorial debut this has amazed me watching this movie you would think it was from a hollywood veteran from the way it was shot to the pacing and to the amazing casting it was almost a perfect movie given that it took 10 years for this movie finally to be developed and released it was definitely a long time coming with fox holding out on the release as they thought it would not gain any interest whilst i think that it was true back 10 years ago now was the perfect time for its release as all of the other superhero films are gaining momentumthe marketing of the film is probably the main contributor to its success the way it reached out to different countries is what made it so unique and the way it portrayed itself as a valentines day film is what was interesting as it was released over that weekend it had the biggest opening of any r rated movie and the studio can thank the marketing team for that effortdespite all of its extremely minor quips this movie takes the cake as my favorite marvel movie yet verdict 910for more of my reviews visit wwwrevelryreviewcom,comedy
wade wilson ryan reynolds is a mercenary who falls in love lives a happy life until he finds that he has cancer a mysterious man offers help in a form of an experiment that will cure wades cancer the experiment turns out to be making super slaves instead it makes him invulnerable but also scars his whole body so wade takes a new identity and starts his quest for revenge along the way we meet supporting characters like blind al and even a few xmen negasonic teenage warhead and colossus and yes the lack of xmen is addressed in the film wow this is such a big house but i only ever see the two of you here its like the studio didnt have enough money for any more xmen the film has been in development since february 2004 so this is a very anticipated film for many including me and im happy to say it is very good is filled with crude humor from the opening credits that announce that the film is directed by an overpaid tool until the very end the film is rated r who even suggested that should be pg13 and the thing contributing to this aside the humor is the over the top violence bones break limbs get cut off and blood sprays and its awesome this movie is a success so i hope other movies would have the courage to be r rated if appropriate looking at you suicide squad the fight scenes are all well choreographed especially the one opening the film that also establishes the tone of the film with jokes like this i never say this but dont swallow and people beaten to pulp the film also constantly breaks the fourth wall and references other like when wade comments please dont make the super suit green or animated a jab to green lantern also starring reynolds the music is also very good with most of it being rap which really fits this film even gets his own rap comics have always been as funny as they are gory so i can imagine that the fans of merc with a mouth will be pleased ryan reynolds was born to play he has showed great interest towards the character his enthusiasm shows in his performance he is funny witty and a fast talker all the cast members get at least one big funny moment as well and play their characters well there are parts in that left me wanting more the plot is something that audiences have seen in a lot of movies  since there are a lot of films about revenge a lot of the film is shot like this there is a shot of someone saying a funny line then cut to someone reaction to said joke i felt like the filmmakers could have more added visual jokes or make the movie more interesting visually so the film would have been as funny visually as it was with its dialogue the villain is also a bit boring with ed skrein playing him a bit too stoically for this kind of movie overall is a fun time with a few flaws but i still think it is a good start for a possible franchise and that fans will love it,comedy
i knew who was but had never read much about him i would have gone and seen it regardless but the marketing with the various ads and trailers convinced me to go sooner than later even if you dont like superhero movies and would be the first to tell you he isnt a superhero this is still a fun movie to go see if youre not a kid happy international womans day the injokes and pop culture references are almost non stop i cant wait to see it on dvd just so i can make sure i caught them all even the appearance of colossus and negasonic teenage warhead are great as they are different aka minor superheroes who are much more interesting than the heroes who have their own movies you have to like some sophomoric humour to get through parts of this but it is worth it while i didnt think there were gaps in the storyline i think when we see the dvd version i wouldnt be surprised if we flesh out some of the story he was away for 2 years but it doesnt seem that way,comedy
i had zero knowledge about going into this movie i was expecting some dirty humor and comic relief based on the previews but i wasnt expecting anything like thisryan reynolds was absolutely hilarious this will revitalize his career and turn him into a mega star for the foreseeable future he plays the perfect antihero and delivers his performance fantastically he really became his character and went all in on his deliveries besides reynolds the story was made in a way to make fun of other superhero movies and people who make those movies there were plenty of jokes pointing out the annoying and repetitive parts of the billion super hero movies that have been made the last 10 years they did this to take a shot at other movies but also to still have these parts within this one too this was an extremely interesting way to keep the classic superhero parts but in a new wayis a great antihero and this movie was hilarious for most of the time there were a thousand jokes that were constantly being spewed out of reynolds after a while all of it was just over the top and too much i got sick of the stupid forced jokes toward the end the first half of was hilarious but it just pushed its luck after a whilereynolds is funny the story is portrayed well and the humor takes a new look at a super hero movie this is a great unique antihero movie that will hopefully continue into more in the future is a fun character that filmmakers could do a ton with i hope they take this solid start and show us more of this antihero take this is unlike any other superhero movie and worth a watch 710,comedy
i like most people am so glad that fondled wolverines smooth criminals to get this movie made ironically making a movie better than both stand alone wolverine films is funny exciting and meta as f more than redeeming itself from x men origins wolverine shudderfrom the opening title sequence of the film it is clear that we are in for a kick ass ride with a film that will take the mick of itself and everything else in pop culture with itvan wilder himself ryan reynolds was great in this film proving to everyone that he was born to play the merc with the mouth everyones least favourite transporter ed skrein plays the evil british villain ajax really well in this film gaining some redemption of his ownwhat i like about this film is how it is able to be funny but have heart as well wade wilson isnt just a 4th wall breaking sex and chimichanga joking loud mouth he is also a guy dying of cancer who has fallen deeply in love the film also has some rather dark and disturbing moments but also manages to blend back into the wise cracking ways of wade wilsonthis film had to be rated 15 r as the film just simply would not have worked if it was commercialised for everyone with a 12a certificate or lower has to be the merc with the mouth and a 15 certificate allowed to be rather than a bald mutant with his mouth sowed shut oh waitis an absolute blast the action is good the jokes are hilarious and the film even has its emotional moments itll make you laugh cry and both at the same time tim millers directorial debut is a good one with a good script and great acting throughout my hopes for the future are that they stick true to the character with its rated r certificate and dont do to what they did to john mcclane stick to 15 fox,comedy
soits not a remake of the dirty harry movie i wondered where jim carrey wasif the incredible open credits for the cast and crew doesnt grab you its best you leave then i couldnt stop laughing throughout the smart opening and never really stopped to the end but it wasnt just funny its brilliantly written refreshingly crass in the goody two shoe pg13 superhero movie world and when there was action it was extremely fun to watchall thanks to ryan reynolds a role he was born to playuh more than once but definitely an improvementthe movie jumps all over the place with the origin and present day stories while telling the story of smartass wadejourney from almost death to basically immortality oh and despite his gift hes destined to kill his creator and get the girlbacki really cant wait to see this again i know i was laughing so hard or marveling at some of the fantastic cuts to both this own studio  la family guy jabs at fox reynolds movies and himself and trying to watch both the action and humor to get everything in in one viewing and despite reynolds playing this character before i knew virtually nothing about him so it was kinda nice going into this completely cold and leaving completely satisfiedit did help that the internet nearly blew up on the last portrayal of personally i didnt know any better when he showed up in x men origins wolverine and still didnt until this fullon origin story began here i wasnt much of a fan of either the character back then or the movie itself i am nowseriously hope they consider making more ratedr superhero movies this one was so great and will do so good at the boxoffice maybe they will see itfinal thoughts and speaking of ratedr superhero movies i rewatched another one of my favorite superhero movies of alltime last night kickass while i liked that one better than this one both now are extremely high on my list of best superhero movies sadly though this one is gonna be tough to beat this year especially with my personal favorite superhero superman flying back into theatres next month unfortunately i cant see myself liking that film more than this one but who knows hopefully im wrong and even though this one was excellent it only goes up from here,comedy
i was laughing at the get go this reminds me of guardians of the galaxy but funnier so good for ryan reynolds that people can forgive him for green lantern he is in his elementparental warning there is some very adult humor so its up to you if you want to bring the kiddieslots of great characters and one linersloved the old school references and the soundtrack was pretty cool great seeing leslie uggams as a wisecracking roommate great action scenes and then when it would start to get too serious someone would say something to make us laughand we all laughed hard i would definitely go see this again on the big screen cant wait for the blue ray and i wonder what kind of extras will be involved,comedy
you want to know the review of this movie let me tell you something when you sit in a theater to watch an english film especially in my country when the final scene is up people start marching out through the exit for the first ducking time not even a single soul got up till they have completed watching the cut scene that is how good this movie is oh regarding the cut scene oh my keyboard is not workingchuckles ryan reynolds worth the wait bro you nailed itas the review requires ten lines here it is this is one of the most touchy films released till date it will touch you in the right spot at the right scenes even after rated as an adult film they cut the audio for many scenes you cut everything why censor board kids are not even allowed to watch this do you think we adults dont know bad words that is puberty,comedy
takes us on a journey of how he revenged a person responsible for making him a monster and putting him away from his newly found heavenly lovepros the nature of laughing out of every bad situation is tremendous his nature matches his colleagues nature at bar both are excellent at par although rules this role was meant for ryan reynolds girlfriend is gorgeous in every possible manner  the action sequences are exceptional villain is killed instead of getting imprisoned a great movie in a budget little higher than 30 million dollars great work by the production studio which is not marvel to note a positive ending although i want him to get better looking again in the sequelscons referring to the last point mentioned above a positive ending not that positiverating 8010,comedy
forget everything you ever thought you knew about a superhero movie because here comes just a quick heads up this review will be discussing chunks from the movie so if you havent seen it yet here is your well needed spoiler alert and if youre one of those peoplewhat are you waiting fortim millers debut motion picture provides the origin story of the superhero that so desperately needed another chance to showcase ryan reynolds potential as the beloved merc with the mouth after the hideous attempt first time around yes xmen origins wolverine im looking at you so did miller reassure fans that can indeed make it to the big screen hell yeah and with style toothe flood of hilarious marketing for the movie had me from the getgo from the christmas special trailer reveal to the testicular cancer awareness video i knew the movie was going to be an experience to remember  and it certainly was i dont think i have ever laughed so hard at a movie in my 19 years of life than i did with this movie the humour was refreshing and comical throughout its entirety which is something that has been missing nowadays its spectacular humour derives from the films accurate depiction of in the comic book world a character who enjoys to break the 4th wall and address the audience directly not only this but pokes fun at both the marvel cinematic universe and the real world from his continuous mocking at the xmen to liam neesons tendency to fail as a parent within the taken franchise did i also mention that he mocks batman and robin too yeah that happensryan reynolds the man of the hour and also the perfect casting choice for too his witty nature presents itself entirely throughout the movie and just like robert downey jr as tony stark you cant see anyone else playing than reynolds his love for the character and his dedication to make things right from his last mouth sewn shut depiction really shows how he embodies the character to a monumental extent to the point where it becomes difficult to separate the man from the suit he just is the introduction to an improved colossus did nothing but benefit the movie too with an amusing chemistry between the two characters one being an embodiment of patience and respect the other beingwell as for stan lees ritual in making a cameo appearance in each marvel movie this is his best one yet without a doubthowever no film is flawless and is no exception ed skrein who played nemesis ajax being the main one his performance which consisted solely on a british accent and endless jawclenching was nothing short of tacky in truth he added nothing special to the role and it became evident that any other actor could have easily played the part which was deeply disappointing as the movie as a whole was marvellous however it was so difficult to try and pinpoint problems with the movie as it addresses these potential problems for us for example the scene where we get to see the monumental xaviers school for gifted youngsters with only two of the xmen there i was thinking damn wheres the rest of them at and with complete awe replies with a sarcastic comment regarding the movies lack of budget to afford more characters even the opening credits made fun of the conventional types of characters in this movie and most other movies overall such as the british villain and the hot girl these selfaware observations reinforce the complete hilarity surrounding the movie and we are so thankful for itmuch to everyones delight tim miller did an exceptional job in ticking all the boxes that were required for an excellent movie a hilarious antihero extreme violence a foul mouth and an extreme tendency to break the 4th wall i for one will never be able to take another marvel movie seriously anymore and because of this i can only applaud in achieving the seemingly impossible standing out from the marvel cinematic universe and doing so in spectacular fashion,comedy
ive never read a single comic book but that didnt stop me from enjoying the movie its a fun creative and  unconventional entry into the xmen film franchise that actually made me laugh out loud a few times id give it an 8 out of 10it isnt high art its got a thin story based on a rickety plot device nearly no exposition and it includes some cartoonish action that i thought was just too over the top even by comic book movie standards our hero dodges bullets and survives a stab to the brainit helps to bear in mind this movies real purpose  fan service for the infamous niche characters evident legions of followers isnt meant to be densely plotted like x2 xmen united 2003 or genuinely cinematic like the christopher nolan batman films its a long awaited rrated feature film to please loyal fans of this profane adultoriented antihero who would be out of place and necessarily bowlderized in a mainstream superhero teamup flick and i kinda get that  i loved the wolverine comics when i was a kid and trust me his film incarnation is tame compared to its source materialis damn funny the movie succeeds by making us laugh and combining a raunchy comedy with an xmen film gives it a weird cool subversive vibe it makes you wonder if stan lee would approve of this sort of thing  until you see lee himself in a cameo at the storys strip bar its fun to know that dirty jokes indeed do exist within the xmen movie universethe lowbrow jokes made me cringe one or twice baby hand but youve got to give the movie credit for delivering its bathroomwall humor if thats what the original character is about are the comics like this ryan reynolds is genuinely funny and his deadpan delivery is perfect the film might not have even worked at all with out himby the way this movie actually reminded me a hell of a lot of a longago flick that i absolutely loved but which im guessing is largely forgotten  andrew dice clays the adventures of ford fairlane 1990 that movie also had a foulmouthed lone maverick antihero who often broke the fourth wall and that also made me laugh like hell i know it sounds like a strange comparison but theyre very similar filmsfinally id like to think that the wade wilson we see here actually is a version of the wade wilson that we first met in the widely lamented xmen origins wolverine 2009 and how can he not be if that movie is canon if xmen days of future past 2014 rebooted the timeline then the were rooting for here was never recruited corrupted and experimented upon by william stryker so you can have your cake and eat it too,comedy
i quite literally have no issues with this movie and theres no way for me to make it better it was as i said  perfectthe acting was phenomenal im a fan of ryan reynolds and therefor might be biased but even the supporting actors did a really good job and you connect with all the characters most superhero movies are mindless entertained based entirely on the wow factor but this one actual makes you feel what happens to and in most cases agree with what he doesthe visual effects were outstanding the fighting fantastic and the recreation of from a comic book character to an actual movie character was on pointand the added xmen inclusion was like icing on the cake i loved how the xmen were mocked constantly in the movie especially shots at wolverine and hugh jackman funny as hellif you havent seen this movie you need to definitely going to be best movie of the year,comedy
marvels ever expanding universe introduces us to an unlikely hero almost as a mockery of superheroes this wisecracking regenerating mutant will not shut the  up and will randomly digress into thinking about his kitchen stove in the midst of a car crash his moral compass is broken to an extent where he disregards human life and ignores collateral damage caused by his actions the distinction between good and evil is blurry to him but all this doesnt quite make him an antihero he still has a freakishly loving girl and a villain who is british enough to be one origin story doesnt break new ground nor does his emergence in the marvel universe make it any easier to prevent thanos from destroying the universe and yet debutant director tim miller does get a few things strikingly right which make an incredibly fun must watch action film wade wilson ryan reynolds is a mercenary who crossed paths with some dirty folk and then got even dirtier with vanessa morena baccarin for months at a stretch soon he realizes that he is diagnosed with cancer and that his only remote hope is to be a part of a medical experiment that involves mutant genes we know how that goes the resulting hideous face needed a mask and a body suit that ended up being red just so the enemies wouldnt see him bleeding embarrassed by his condition wade chooses to live with a blind old lady and not confront vanessa till he forces ajax ed skrein the mad scientist who created this accidental mutation to reverse the adverse effect with this origin story reflected upon in the middle of an intensely gory action sequence reverts our attention back to his gruesome ways as he pursues ajaxs convoy and practically decimates the scene just as he is about to torture ajax colossus and the punk teen named negasonic teenage warhead from prof xaviers university intervene and try to arrest wade as ajax sees the right opportunity to escape in the movies timeline all of this occurs in the first fight sequence itself with a couple of lengthy flashbacks unable to forget his love for vanessa he gathers the courage to face her at her workplace only to realize that ajax had kidnapped her just then wade will need the help of a lot of ammunition colossus and the teenage warhead to stand a chance against ajaxs forces that include angel dust gina carano the finale atop the helicarrier has all of them battling with marvels special effects galore as still doesnt stop yapping away with his punchlines the usual origin story of the unlikely superhero doesnt quite surprise anyone what the film instead depends on is the narrative through the fourth wall the snark comments unabashed action that is both gory and gruesome and the naughty yet petulant romance that really makes a badass like genuinely care about someone it finally seems like ryan reynolds has a possible franchise that could be his career he enjoys the sarcasm and wit while his character transitions through several phases the carefree attitude and fickle behavior are what make so enjoyable and reynolds has pretty much nailed it morena baccarin not only looks gorgeous but plays the naughty escort with convincing charm she can certainly combat wades innuendos with effective volleys ed skrein transporter refueled and dario naharis is matched in mutant powers but his character falls short of an evil that is worth despising or respecting perhaps a more powerful nemesis will follow this origin story that had a lot more to introduce than just a battle against evil tim miller and his writers havent reinvented the genre but they certainly have reengineered a tired concept that involves a multitude of characters and special effects over some witty dialogue and rrated action to enhance the characters appeal will leave you entertained like no other superhero can if it all comes down to earths saviors having to send an emissary to negotiate with the arch enemy will be a mouthful of a hero who might just save the day if he cares enough8776 on a scale of 110,comedy
was perfect for what it was it is tough to write a plot line for a character that can literally read the script in the movie even with that tough spot the movie did and excellent job of creating a background and a story that can intrigue the non die hard comic readers and keep the die hards in love the jokes were some what corny but it is so that you cant complain i think the marvel comic fans will enjoy this movie more than the general audience the 4th wall breaks were really well done and did not consume the movie as it did in the video game there was no one moment or moments that had me on the floor crying from laughter but there were plenty of great laughs at every moment the ending was hilarious but predictable but once again it was so that you cant complain all in all the movie was hilarious wild crazy and entertaining but most of all it was so comic fans embrace the merc,comedy
it is the funniest grooviest and outofthisworld movie i have ever seen di went to the movies and there was only one other person watching it several weeks now its been playing and i was not expecting this kind of awesomenessperfect in every way but one not being twice as long di actually think ryan reynolds has a good chance of making this one of the coolest franchises ever he just needs to make 2 more movies about and thats itoh and another thing why not add on an xmen or avengers movie that would be great,comedy
new respect for ryan reynolds after seeing this filmhe really pulls of the character and takes you on the ride with himthe writers make it of course which is what you would expect from a marvel filmthere are a few cringeworthy moments but mostly worth the watchwe all liked the comedy even when he talks to the camera it kind worksthe ship scene at the end was kinda superfluous in terms of just being set on a ship there is a cooler spot for the finalebut who cares its good see it,comedy
well the best part of the movie is its humor deal pool rocks with his sense of humor and every time when he cracks a joke you cant stop yourself from laughing the action is also quite well and literally kick ass it has a love story in it revolves around the concept of xmen and its also has two of them the hero is an exact copy of the mask of jim cherry a funny yet stylish man with supernatural powers which are artificial in this case literally is a kick ass movie just watch it and have fun it will help you in forgetting the misery of daily life and teaches you to take life not so seriously at the end i must say the dubbing team of hindi version really did a good job,comedy
potential spoilers a mercenary named wade ryan reynolds is happily in love and just proposed to his girlfriend however he finds out he has cancer a mysterious man contacts him and says he can be cured of his cancerbut wont say how wade agrees to whatever treatment he is tied down and tortured and pumped full of drugs by evil ajax ed skrein it turns him ugly and into a mutant able to withstand any pain and a body that completely regenerates itself he escapes and sets out to find ajax and kill him he wears a costume and calls himself deadpooldespite the synopsis this movie is actually quite funny there are constant jokes by reynolds and hes frequently breaking down the fourth wall and addressing the audience theres also tons of gratuitous violence but its impossible to take it seriously with reynolds constantly making jokes it also has cameos by two of the xmen and stan lee however the sequence when we see being tortured and shot full of drugs is not fun and ajax is such a despicable villain the fun sort of drains out at times however the final all out battle at the end makes up for it so i liked it but it sometimes got too brutal still it is recommended also reynolds is excellent in his role,comedy
   since it has sunk as low as i guess that thats what happens when youre bored with the 18 billion names already given to real life people on our planet including rocky rhodes and chastity bordello and you concoct an infinity of alternate universes because the artist formerly known as prince already has exhausted societys patience for hieroglyphical names since numeric monikers become monotonous after about three digits just try to imagine telling someone that two social security numbers kissed each other and with names composed of random letters such as asdfghjkl largely viewed as being both crude and unwieldy marvel is forced to resort to the of this world with ryan reynolds making a couple of postcredits appearances here to promise a sequel including new super hero characters im willing to contribute a few free suggestions to the obviously depleted marvel brain trust first off braintruss seems perfect sort of like a jockstrap for your mind as marvel values testosterone so highly why not add jockstrap and testes to its pantheon as well theyd make a great team finally i once ran across an alice limerick that could provide marvel with a real thumperthey only have to beat out dc comics in the race to be the first to trademark phallus,comedy
is a story about exspecial forces op wade wilson now a mercenary who contracts cancer and goes to a organization to have it cured unfortunately the organizations goal is to make specialized soldierslaves and wade turns into a man with incredible healing powers and goes on a quest for vengeance on the man who mutated himand to rescue his true love the movie was first off hilarious i was laughing practically the whole time it was also a story with a good lesson about true love and never letting it go once you have found it this is a good message sure the jokes feel strained once in a while but is a blast of laughing gas in a genre that sometimes takes itself too seriously may not be a perfect comedy but it is a perfect marvel movie thats saying something,comedy
even since before the character was mercilessly ruined in 2009s forgettable x men origins wolverine ryan reynolds buried the voices has been passionate about bringing cult comicbook character to the big screen with all his profanity violence political incorrectness fourthwall breaking and generally unsuperherolike behaviour so here we finally are with unknown director tim miller and the writers of zombieland leading reynolds along with morena baccarin firefly ed skrein game of thrones tj miller cloverfield and gina carano haywire on his honourable quest to inject some variation into the superhero film marketis a film that knows exactly what it is which is evidence by the funny tonesetting opening credits its far funnier than most comedies more exciting than many superhero films and just more plain enjoyable than most of todays cinema reynolds could not be more perfectly cast other than perhaps h jon benjamin of archer in this role under the iconic mask his snarky insulting tone mocks and swears whilst his actionfilmstar look is highly appropriate he even manages to lend some drama to the role the writers  as acknowledged by the opening credits the true heroes  have written a tight quotable script that is bursting with onelines that will be seen across a thousand internet comment chains for years to come alongside exciting action with some good violence  refreshing in increasingly kidfriendly superhero films  and glorious profanity is a welcome change and hopefully a gateway to more adult action films on the general marketits obviously not perfect it often feels disjointed due to its admittedly admirable desire to showcase all its talents at once and not all of the jokes fully land nevertheless is one of the best superhero films ive seen in a while remarkably enjoyable and a very good watch indeed 80100,comedy
ive actually watched all marvel movies up to this point and truly from all of them is one of my favorites the script was amazing the acting was perfect and the cgi was very well blended in with the camera thus making the action scenes even more realistic ryan renolds is an excellent character and all the humorous scenes were perfect and hilarious there were no scenes that i got bored unlike the latest star wars sorry but hey the latest one did not compare to the previous movies at all no long conversations that the movie could do without and even the romantic scenes had a point to them i could really really see myself watching it a second time,comedy
how to describe this movie in words is a challenge all i can say is that when i left the cinema my mouth was gaping wider that the entrance to luna park it was raunchy it was violent it was hilarious many say it started off strong and slipped to above satisfactory i disagree it definitely slowed at some points to give way to the eherm plot but am i going to nitpick that no it was done wellthis is the best movie of this year so far and it will be a challenge to beat and whys that because its original and genuinely funny delivering zingers every 30 seconds pretty much the weird thing i cant remember any because it was all so relevant to the situations in the movie that is definitely a good thingplot almost imaginary and uninspired like as if they took it from a magazine called cliche monthly again thats not important for this film this one was all about delivering a new kind of hero to save us from the increasingly mediocre other marvel films it did however throw a few spinballs into the mix for the whole damselin distress scenario which was niceso why a nine because it was a fantastic film and deserves a crisp highten but if its a ten theres nothing better right i believe 2 could be so ill leave a bit of a bufferand please dont take your kids to see this i saw a few embarrassed parents walk out with their youngsters after 10 minutes,comedy
firstly i dont read comic books i havent seen any of the x men films and i didnt really know what was about before seeing it in fact i expected would be something along the lines of kickass another excellent film but how wrong i wasit is hard to explain how funny this film is i think the fact i had no real prior knowledge about the film or the comic books it was based on meant i wasnt going in expecting anything the humour is just hilarious its proper good old fashioned adult one liners with plenty of nob jokes to keep the little boy inside everyone of us amused i found myself laughing pretty much all the way though the film with tears streaming down my face if you are hoping for political correctness youre going to be disappointedthere is loads of action love and romance bad guys car chases and crashes and loads of great special effects i dont know how else to describe apart from to say that if you like comedies andor action films you really will love this film you dont have to be a fan of x men or the other marvel films to enjoy this film if you are great if youre not then youll probably enjoy this as a hilarious send up of themthe best money ive spent going to the cinema in years i cant wait to see it again,comedy
at first someone will think thats another movie about a new superhero who gained super powers to save the world totally wrong is a very special character and in fact he is unique in several ways in the world of comics he is relatively new because he is old twentyish years but rapidly gained favor with his audience he is the anti hero dare to say the best he is aware that he is a character in the comic book very often addresses the reader has perhaps the strongest fastest ability to cure has a special style of fightinghe is dangerous and deadly and with this all he is completely crazy this is a short list because theres more the film is great seeing all this i can understand that someone did not like this movie but then i realized that the film was not made for him since it is very faithful to the comic transferred to the big screen it is clear that there is a large grade or hype ryan reynolds was not playing a great he was i liked it immediately from the excellent opening scene and enjoyed until the end of the postcredit that is really awesome there is someone who has gone by now a few months ago i was hoping that this will not be the only pg13 movie than r movie because otherwise you can not make a movie and to be good and true to the comics this movie has a million jokes there are a million references to other characters and movies well let no million but there are over 100 well this movie was made for such a person who understood each reference and each joke it is clear that this is not a new godfather the odyssey fight club  insert the movie of your choice but in its genre for what would this movie should be then this achievement deserves the highest ratings and positive reviews i look forward to continuing,comedy
dear parents the film is great to watch many references and jokes 90s but i think the film needs to be respected by classification my son is 12 years old and is totally fan of the media marvel but this film i found quite controversial and complicated to watch him we will respect this rating i hope you do not miss not one piece of film because the references are held every 2 min all of them are linked to the world of hqs movies series tv drawings novels other films actors  it is totally important to follow with patience and attention throughout the film from start to finish recommend to person like me he was born in the 80s and continued watching and having fun over the years with the media and issues facing the movies and hqs,comedy
i will try to keep it honestif we were to criticize it as a movie it doesnt offer something new and it has really clich plot bad guy kidnaps girl good guy saves her and kills the bad guy so as an individual movie it would be a 610however we are talking about a superhero movie and if i was judging every superhero movie based only to the above stuff then every movie would be 56 stars in a superhero movie you have to judge how true to the character and the origins it was was just as he was meant to be it had violence swearing and dirty jokes his origins story was true to the comics from that point i would give a 1010so 61028 and that will be my final rating,comedy
honestly im not usually into super hero movies or movies like these but this one was by far the funniest movie ever the actors were amazing i have this girl crush on negasonic teenage warhead by far she was super awesome ever if she didnt speak too much on it the whole catchphrases and jokes had me laughing and the action and fighting scenes were pretty bad ass as well im looking forwards to what they will be doing next and i even hope to audition for this sequel that the have planned i had to give it a 10 out 10 for all above awesomeness ryan reynolds seriously killed it im glad he managed to get this project out there an amazing job well done,comedy
picture ted as a superhero that is how ryan reynolds plays it he is a wise cracking foul mouth guy in a tight suitthe opening fake credits are great the end credits and the ferris bueller after credit scene are worth staying for between the opening and end credits is a movie that cant decide on a genre there is action romance comedy and science fiction there is something for everybody but not enough for anybody morena baccarin is interesting and easy to watch as the love interestleslie uggams has more then a cameo as the blind side kickthere is an abundance of random violence that along with language justified the r rating the construction of the timeline works and it isnt too long before you understand where came fromthe movie looks good on the big screen and should be seen in a theater the abundance of violence mixed with comedy may not work for everyone,comedy
was justwow when i walked out of the cinema i just couldnt believe how good it was as it had a small budgetwas small scale and the movie was short for a superhero movie but thats what made it good you can clearly see the directorproducers and cast did great with the material they had first off the humoroh my gosh my humor was greatryan reynolds is there perfect choice even before this movie we knew thatxmen origins wolverine and the dude brings the character to life with his portrayal even from the opening credits this movie starts to make you laugh and the first 10 minutes of this movie has the is best opening scene in a superhero origin story because origin stories are usually slow paced then improve to a faster pace but this movie starts off with a fast pace and even when isnt shown you never get bored because of the cruderude humoroneliners and characters in this movie the rest of the casts performances were good as well as the chemistry between ryans wade wilson and morena baccarins vanessa was great you bought the romance these two characters hadcared for their relation as it was a weird and odd relationshipwades friend weasel was also decent comic relief and the two xmen characters colossus and megasonic teenage warheadyeah fit perfectly into this moviethe villain ajax portrayed by ed skrien was actually good this guy was a generic bad guy but worked for this movie as he was a threat to and people around himand the guy was an ahole what made this movie different from other superhero movies is the rrating at first i wasnt sure about it because from the trailers i thought they would go over the top with the rrating but i was wrong as this movie was better because of it the goreviolence and ofcourse language was right for this movie even with some very explicit scenes it never feels out of placethe action was great again the rrating makes the action better and how can you not love a movie that opens up with an action sequence and one more thing to point out is even if this movie was part comedy it had some small scenes where the movie grew dark and i was really surprised by this because it fitted well and the intensity was amazing now the bad this movie had a few bad things about it like we all know isnt a superhero more antihero because the man is a clear and there was this whole subplot in the movie where they tried to make be a proper hero but you know it couldnt work as the subplot was just unnecessary and pretty obvious also i pointed out that the movie has good humor there are some scenes whereby the humor feels out of place at specially whereby the movie is supposed to feel intense it just doesnt workthen there are some annoying filler moments whereby they tried to rub some humor but just felt unnecessary and ofcourse with a small budget comes some bad cgi at times but rather than that this movie is perfect is the perfect origin story for the character as the movie is funnyaction packedweird and just funthe studio made up for that monstrosity in xmen origins wolverinethey shut his mouthdidnt go over the top with the rrating and the movie was just fun despite the small budgetsuperhero fans with love this movie and nonsuperhero fans will have a good timebring on 2,comedy
i saw with high expectations ive been a fan of the character since the video game where i first knew about the character the comics were pretty good too but i havent read a lot of it and when i heard they announced a movie i just screamed in joy i saw the movie a week after its release and here is my thoughtsthe story is predictable but not bad a former special forces operative now mercenary named wade wilson likes doing crime and being a villain but one day in a bar he meets vanessa and they instantly fall in love until one day wade collapses to the floor and the next day he finds out that he is diagnosed with thermal cancer and that he will have a few days of survival but a recruiter at the bar he goes to says he can give him powers and cure the cancer wade agrees and is sent to a facility where people get their powers the leader of the facility ajax villain tortures wade and straps him up to a machine the machine while giving him powers made his face disfigured and burnt his new powers are regenerating health and invincibility now wade must seek revenge on ajax for both making his face disfigured and for stealing his girlfriend so wade becomes with the help of weasel and al old lady and he slices his way through the city of vancouver to get to ajax and fulfill his revenge with help by colossus and negasonic teenage warheadryan reynolds in this movie is absolutely stunning he is the perfect choice for and his wit and sophistication is wonderful the characters are pretty good too while ajax is a bland villain i really liked weasel and especially al theyre both funny supporting characters and they will never be forgettable even dopinder is a great character i would have liked if he had a bigger role but he is still a great characterthe films main selling point is the humor and is also one of the films strengths the humor is near perfect with a lot of injokes fourth wall humor from pop culture references visual humor and vulgar humor all of them work even the jokes that suck are pretty good because they are supposed to be bad on purpose which makes the humor even betterthe source material is top notch everything from the fourth wall humor and the characters is very like the comics this is one of those comic book films where it follows the comic book perfectly the action scenes are spectacular some of the best ive seen in years theyre fast and very gory and profane the scene where shoots three guys with one bullet is some of the best piece of action ever put into film its absolutely marvelousthe film isnt by any means perfect the story like i said earlier is predictable and the origin story feels kinda rushed compared to the comics and the villain is bland and forgettable and sometimes the jokes can wear off but other than that the film is amazingthe climax and post credits scene is amazing the climax is funny and exciting and leaves you wondering and the post credits scene is especially awesome since theyre tells the audience that there is gonna be a sequel featuring cable and making jokes about actors and films along the way so excited for the sequelis one of the funniest and exciting films ive seen in years its ambition humor characters source material action sequences and did i forget to mention the soundtrack with music by dmx and salt n pepa is pretty good the story as well as its origin story is predictable and the villain is bland and some jokes are a little clunky but this film is worth recommending guaranteed1010 btw the film is very damn vulgar af,comedy
i really loved this movie from the opening scene and credits to the films final climax i laughed mostly throughout i brought my wife with me to see this she knows nothing about and she absolutely loved it as well  though she did have hard time with some of the violenceparents be warned this movie is rated r it contains graphic violence harsh language and nudity if this is going to offend you and especially your kids then dont bring them i couldnt believe some parents were so dumb as to bring their 69 year olds to this  we saw about a dozen little kids in the theatre and it was an 1100pm showthat being said what made this movie so great is that everything was noholds barred the jokes were raunchy the action was intense and there were some very dark and dramatic scenes where the villain and motives were established his time with weapon x creating 1015 minutes of quiet despair from the crowdbut this is why the movie is so great as tough as those scenes were to watch they werent overdone like so many recent tarantino films and the humor came right back to wash away the bad taste the fact that is also constantly breaking the 4th wall makes for a very funny intimate and entertaining filmthe acting is topnotch ryan reynolds is the perfect person to take on this role  he does the character proud remaining faithful to the comic character we know and love throwing the tragic wolverine origins out the window the supporting cast did an incredible job and i was pleasantly surprised at how well morena baccarin played her role  im only used to seeing her in the firefly series very different charactersif you love the comic book or are looking for an extreme actioncomedy with some great drama thrown in  you will be wildly entertained by this film,comedy
this is a different kind of superhero story wade wilson is a former special forces member who now works as a mercenary he has the perfect girlfriend and everything is going his way when he discovers he has cancer everything changes when wade is approached by a stranger with a way to cure him he takes the chance it doesnt go as planned and now wade has only one thing on his mind revenge if you have read any of my reviews before you will remember one thing i am pretty much over the whole superhero movie trend i am a huge ryan reynolds fan and this looked funny so i was looking forward to watching this one this to me is hands down the best marvel movie they have ever done the movie is hilarious very adult and self aware which i love there are a ton of little inside jokes and the movie starts with maybe the best opening credits ever and ends with one of the best post credits scenes i have seen superhero movie fans will love this nonsuperhero fans like me will love this this is just a fun movie that never really lets up i just cannot recommend this enough i loved it and my stomach hurt by the end of it overall the best marvel movie so far a comic book movie made for everyone not just comic book fans i wish more were like this i loved this movie i give this an a,comedy
ive read every publications i could put my hands on on kindle thats quite a lot needless to say i like the character and the humor of the stories all this to say i had of course some doubts about this movie for once im not disappointedthis reallynotforchildren film reflects almost perfectly the soul of the comic ryan reynolds owns the role of deadpoolthe dark humor feels unaltered compared to the comics i almost choked a couple of times its raw violent sexy sadistic cruel gore  all of thisthe image effects and presentation are very nice i liked the soundtracks tooits quite difficult to describe this one without spoilinggo see,comedy
its sort of a running joke that marvels blockbuster squad is giving its midastouch reacharound to progressively fringier characters in the comic book universe a trend i blame on iron man and one that shows no sign of letting up i heard theyre doing aquaman in 2018 to this slow trudge of goldplated alsorans we now add no ones favorite secondary superhero whothanks handsy midas actually deals a solid rrated base hit in this strong strong filmas any helicopter parent will tell you excellence starts early and the opening credits are brilliant not the cgi which is cool and all but the actual credits so rare to see something really novel done here ive never laughed so hard at names beforeand that includes the social security list of unusual baby names i loved this opening nearly as much as i did 21 jump streets end credits but thems tall boots also if you were in la on opening weekend there were some truly inspired spoof billboards around town hausey likeyryan reynolds is in his element here as wade wilson an exspecial forces type who falls in love gets sick and turns invincible this isnt the gentle romcom reynoldsno this is the real improvbred van wilder canucklehead reynolds hes crass and harsh breaks the fourth wall on the motherflippin regular and slings insults like donald trump in a tough mudder hes great his whitehot love affair with his manic pixie dream girlfriend is a bit much but gives him dramatic purpose and all also he forgets stuff in cabs leading to a cute if lonesome side storylineand not to toot my amateurreviewer horn here but i did once learn screen writing from the late syd field himself at afiand armed as i am with this prestigious toedip into the real thing i feel qualified to opine that this film is structurally very interesting thats as far down film school lane as ill take you but check this out syds bmw 3series had the vanity plate plt pnt take that for lagniappeits a shame then that given such an engaging and inyourface antihero lead marvel poops it down the bad pipe with a closed self referential story that distills down to exacting bloodthirsty revenge on the dude who helped him theres no real villain to speak of no heroics and nothing really for to do besides take out his own dirty laundrywhich causes one to wonder what hell do once that strange score is settled im sure midas will figure something outbut as much as i generally despise closedsystem superhero films ahem green lantern here the basic narcissism of the storyline works fairly well after all is unapologetically all about himself and his own problems and the only folks with a ticket to the twitching bone heap are those whove wronged him in past fair enough mr poolwhat i wont do here is trot out once more my standing objection to marvels mutant science its beyond ridiculous and nothings changed but couldnt they at least have done something with the fact that cancerous cells are themselves mutated so mutating him more would likely cause more cancer no sighhaus verdict ultraviolent funny and in on the joke meta and it works so well you wont mind the secondstring xmen and empty plot see it,comedy
what can i say about that hasnt already been said in so many of these reviews already if you have time on your hands read through them however if you are hungering for an actionpacked superhero flick that completely changes the game for the genre dont waste your time here just get to the theater and see from the opening credits through the ending credits yes you need to stay through them is a relentless wild ride of sex violence profanity comedy and ummm romance    yeah romance not to mention that whole fourth wall thing ryan reynolds is at his snarkybest i enjoyed every minute of it bottom line see its just too good to miss,comedy
first of all im must say well done to ryan reynolds for his comedic performance in this superhero movie i thought we saw the last of him after his last superhero movie green lantern back in 2011 but hes come back ultra strong with this one bravonow this an rrated so i would not advice a parent to bring their child to a screening this film really is adult themed and could traumatize or badly influence youre young one even though its a comic book movie there are some many inside jokes references and easter eggs here i have lost count it pokes fun out of almost every single comic book origin film including ryans very own green lantern character you will laugh hard seeing this film if you dont youre dead inside i think this is quite a different type of superhero movie we are used to could really be described as an anti herooverall a very enjoyable movie i cant wait for the sequel go see it now,comedy
actionpacked and wellchoreographed as said in the summary title it seems as if somebody choreographed a wonderfully aggressive dance routine and added a lot more blood splatter ryan reynolds comedic timing is that of an atomic clock spoton but sure enough the humor doesnt get in the way of the sequencesas a comic book fan i appreciated the fact that this doesnt deviate from the heart of the glossy pagesi only had a few gripesnow i am perfectly fine with any amount of cursing nudity vulgarity etc i dont give a rats ass however it shouldnt get in the way of the story dialogue or jokes or whateverthat said the word fk is used to great effect in the movie but at times it was used in a way that made the dialogue a little bit clunky while almost all of the jokes landed some of them relied on the word as a crutch and they didnt work but again most of the jokes landed,comedy
this is probably one of the best superhero movies i have ever seen now is one of my favorite superheroes ever his costume is cool this movie is hilarious cool etc  my favorite part is the big fight at the end where that bad guy gets shot in the head by and was killing everybody the big metal war machine was throwing stuff at the bad guys girlfriend the teenage girl was blasting through everything and making explosions etc and i think the scenes where the characters swear are hilarious because they act like little kids and i think thats funny and shot the bad guy in the head but i think that it should be more violent now one of my favorite superheroes ever because his costume is really cool he is invincible he is hilarious he is like me etc and i wonder what 2 is gonna be like maybe he has more superpowers maybe he meets other superheroes or i dont even know if they are gonna make a sequel and the acting was really good and really funny the actor of the bad guy was acting like a real life villain the acting for that metal guy the teenage girl was hilarious so i think this is the best movie of the year so far there is also a lot of movies im excited for that are coming up and i think that this movie is okay for kids over 13 if they are mature enough and understand but if they wont understand i think it should be for 16 so that was my review for deadpool,comedy

i loved this movie it was full of great yet most of the time vulgar and crude humor ryan reynolds was the perfect guy to play the role as along with the guy that plays the role of francis the crazy bad guy due to the nudity bloodshedand the constant over age 21 puns throughout this movie please do not take your kids to see this at all it shows every kill in slow motion along with making sure to show you every detail of the torture and murder played out but besides all the gore and breakingdismembering of body parts it was a great movie that will have you laughing from beginning to the very dead end it also has a great love story in between all the humor and violence this is a must see marvel movie even if is not your usual spiderman or xman hoping for a few more sequels to this movie a,comedy
finally reynolds found himself in this characterit seems ryan is the only one who can play everything in the movie was perfect all the rrated jokes action dialogue story line and about that fourth wall him self aware of that he is a comic character bring this in a movie was worth it what can i say more i love this movie already watched 4 times and going to watch again this weekend it was a dream come true for me i think any previous marvel titles never make me this entertained as this one didi want with cable and other x force members as comics i hope tim miller read this love you dead pool,comedy
before walking into the theater i was told this movie was hilarious deserving of an r rating and one of the best marvel movies of all time after watching it however i can safely say that they got 2 of the 3 descriptions correct the movie definitely deserves the r rating because of all of the nudity most of the jokes hit their mark to say its the best marvel movie is a far cry from the truthwhat made this an average movie boils down to two things the first being the action and the second being the cg when you think of modern action movies there are a lot of jump cuts of cars exploding swords flying guns shooting and fists punching often it will happen so fast that you wont be able to quite make out whats happening half of the time unfortunately this has become par for the course it wouldnt quite be a movie without all of that action it just seems really caned and boring where it should have been the opposite because of the character they were working withthe special effects and cg characters are incredibly disappointing and look as though they were made some time in the early 2000s this becomes an even greater shame when you think back to the first iron man movie where the suit still looks really good and that movie came out in 2008at the end of the day it was an ok watch i wouldnt recommend seeing it in theaters even though it seems like it would be a perfect theater movie i also dont have the slightest drive to see this movie a second time which is becoming a reoccurring theme with most marvel movies,comedy
is quite the time you can have well spent at the movies an entertaining funny if somewhat dark first outing for a cult favourite marvel comics character the movie isnt perfect but really what movie is completely flawless anyway kept me entertained from start to finish and dare i say that i found this more enjoyable than marvels age of ultron well im sticking by that verdictis a breath of fresh air for superhero cinema and has a lot of blood to shed for newcomers to 20th century foxs xmen franchise i didnt know exactly what to expect going in to the session but boy oh boy does deliver in terms of entertainment it does get a little bumpy some of the time but even after those little imperfect moments it never loses focus of its fourthwall breaking and downright absurd take on the superhero origin setup storyis worth the trip to the cinema see it before hes all out of chimichangas,comedy

has a simple plot revenge it also has a ton of comedy vulgarity and violence simply put it was fun to watch ryan reynolds was obviously very comfortable in this role and he nailed it great supporting cast as welli enjoyed how the movie opened up with a scene and used flashbacks to give his origin story my only complaint with the origin story is the whole we are going to save you from cancer by torturing you and turning you into a mutant thing which still confuses mei gave this movie an 8 out of 10 because of the humor the great cast and the excellent action scenes glad i watched,comedy
was entertaining from start to finish it immediately establishes its tone  immature comedy mixed with overthetop violence it breaks all the rules successfully the opening reminded me of monty python and the holy grail  they cant even take the credits seriously the humour reminded me of the first few best imo seasons of south park  happy to offend anyone and everyone but with the focus still being pure comedy i dont usually like dick and fart jokes much but makes them hilarious its the juxtaposition of such immaturity with a wellmade action movie that makes it work and it has a story and dramatic moments as good as any recent superhero movie as wellim not familiar with but it sounds like hes a very popular comic book character the filmmakers and perhaps ryan reynolds in particular have tried their best to do the character justice he is irreverent wisecracking and likable even if he isnt exactly noble he says and does what were too afraid to say and do he only fights bad guys and he lives for the woman in his life where other superheroes are hypocritical and maintain a facade of moral superiority at least can admit what he is and make fun of everyone including himself while trying to fight evil and help the innocenti liked the many times the fourth wall was broken the filmmakers know their audience and what kind of movie theyre making and it shows they use the device effectively where appropriate and without it becoming routine it makes the movie more fun and the darkness easier to swallow there are so many lines from the movie that i loved both in concept and delivery comedically it was very satisfying i dont remember any missed jokes every chance for irony or sarcasm was taken advantage ofthe action was engaging and cool even if similar things have been done before every sequence is creative and infused with humour in one part he has only 12 bullets and counts them as he uses them he wastes some and chastises himself but then makes up for it by killing 3 henchmen in a line with one bullet its a good sign if you cant tell whether youre enjoying the action or comedy more i liked the fight choreography and even though some cgi must have been used there seemed to be a lot of impressive stunt work seeing bodies flip and impact solid objects is just inherently excitingthis movie was a great introduction to his origin story was well done its pretty dark but its nice to see something so odd and unique being presented sincerely comic books deserve proper film adaptations the film makes good use of nonlinear storytelling near the start its never confusing and the order of events is logical in balancing action and getting to know how wade wilson became deadpoolyou could say every person is flawed with good and bad qualities but some people make you feel good they make you laugh and some people are selfdeprecating and accept their mistakes and are open about their shortcomings is like one of those people whose company you always enjoy,comedy
is a very very funny movie it takes the overexposed superhero genre mixes it with comedy and romance to create an entertaining and very funny film for adults its hilarious from the start with the tongueandcheek introductory montage scene you get a british villain a cgi character produced by some asshat production talk about being selfaware i mean this movie knows exactly what it is and it delivers on that while the first 20 30 minutes is very action heavy and has some awesome action pieces its ultimately a love story between wade wilson aka ryan reynolds and his girl before this movie came out i was very confused as to why a superhero movie was coming out so early in the year given that usually not so good movies come out during this period in seeing it makes perfect sense because ultimately the movies plot revolves around boy meets girl boy falls in love loses girl and then tries to win back the girl oh did i mention evil research scientist mutants and xmen characters including colossal negasonic teenage warhead and mention of wolverine there are so many throughout the movie that you begin to wonder if there is something going on between and wolverine besides plain rivalrythings i didnt particularly like1 my biggest gripe with the movie is with the girlfriends character vanessa morena baccarin initially when wilson meets her she is portrayed as a strong female character but are we really supposed to believe that she just accepts her boyfriend back after he leaves are suddenly without saying anything and disappears for 2 years  during which time she assumes him to be dead really i just cant help but feel her character was objectified in the movie apart from being the perfect girlfriend material and being the thing that drives motivations and actions she doesnt have much else to do here her character was disappointingly onedimensional its a shame because morena baccarin is so good here but apart from having a lot of skin show we dont get to see other sides to her character2 i didnt really care for the blind landlord lady i dont think their scenes were particularly funny given the level of comedy in the rest of the film i found their relationship just way to awkward for my taste3 i didnt like the way the only indian character in this movie was portrayed why must an indian be portrayed as either a sciencetech person or a taxicab driver why yes dopinder karan soni and scenes in the taxicab were all very funny but cant we move away from over generalization and perpetuating the same stereotypes of ethnicity couldnt the writers come up with something a little more inventivesee full review on httpwwwartspeaksycomdeadpoolmoviereview,comedy
i feel like ive been hearing about the character of for a long time before i saw this movie so having seen what he is all about there is not much i would boast about it is certainly entertaining but basically isnt much to remember although the beginning credits are clever which are basically of generic names given instead of the particular names of the cast and crew this overall implies my feelings regarding the rest of the movie apathy i may not be as gungho as perhaps some others but generally i would say its worth it especially on the big screen the storytelling hops back and forth during the first half and then pretty much goes into a straightforward narrative in its second half i think that is one of the reasons why i like the first half better than the second half because its style made things interesting then the plot gets muddled halfway through and it is slowly realized that its a standard revenge film personally i think there was too much comedy which kind of drags it down a bit the humor is essentially a cross between ryan reynoldss charm and the family guy series it runs a little thin after a whileim not really a fan of comic books and the movie adaptations are usually take it or leave it but i found myself mostly intrigued not saying i am a big fan of his but to a degree i think it helps to like ryan reynolds also its r rated which in these days is certainly an interesting concept especially in the way of a comic book movie revisions from my understanding they wanted to stay true to the source material and for that i congratulate them he plays a likable mercenary who safeguards teenage girls from wouldbe stalkers then he meets up with an escort with whom he develops a relationship with later on he finds out he has terminal cancer and agrees to undergo an experimental procedure that goes horribly wrong then he sets out for revenge on his captor and then things get really personal when his girlfriend is captured and there is the final showdown at the end thats it in a nutshell it seems with these types of movies theres no real imminent danger the fight scene particularly in the end i couldnt help but think that it could be neverending theyre all pummeling each other and then again theyre basically superhuman i like this film a good deal but its not without its criticisms overall grade b,comedy
has outperformed all rrated movies at the box office this weekend and audiences couldnt be happier after all it is a gamechanger for the types of movies studios might take risks on additionally everyone seems to love it but is it actually any goodeven before the first line of dialogue kicks off with a bang with a hilarious and appropriate opening credits sequence the action that follows is equal parts brutal and comedic and soon takes us back to the beginning of his story as a matter of fact he tells us hes going to do thatfrom the opening scene would appear to break all the rules breaking the fourth wall spewing countless profanities in a superhero movie and having that superhero actually be a murderous psychopath but in fact is structured like many superhero movies from before marvel phase ii its an origin story and despite its constant barrage of jokes that poke fun at many of the tropes of superhero movies is actually pretty conventional this aspect i found to be rather disappointing because in any metafilm all the rules can be broken because they exist in our world too yet remains confined to the world of the screen despite acknowledging a world outside of itstill that doesnt mean isnt a fun film outside of a brief respite in the second act nearly every line of dialogue has a punchline and theres no joke too lowbrow for to touch on this movie is as crass as they come like many rrated comedies of recent years what sets it apart is that the script is so airtight and fastpaced it never feels like its reaching for jokes rather it feels as though the writer tapped into the devil on everyones shoulder and channeled it every nook and cranny of the script anyone who has sat through any superhero film even if they loved it has at some point felt indifferent about the genre and its tropes as a whole and mocks every single of those tropes despite also using them as the vehicle for its plotthe movie is funny enough that even conservative types who dont enjoy lowbrow humor will burst out laughing at least once in the film theres no denying the movie is hilarious however i feel the movie really shines in its second act when things start to get real the characters who were previously onedimensional are actually given some depth its a sobering few scenes in a movie drunk with comedy it proves that the writers are even smarter than the humor of the film and honestly could have made a better film instead of delicately balancing the hilariousness of the first act and the darker humor and drama of the second act it returns to pure comedy for its third act and it starts to feel a little past its welcome theres a lot of potential shown in glimpses or entire scenes of that go largely untapped in the final act when it retreats into familiar territoryperhaps in a movie so blunt the writers felt it best to play it safe in the narrative structure of the film after all the studios took a big risk and were often worried about the film they wanted to make it pg13 they cut 7 million from the budget shortly before production they were worried it would fail its enormous success has proved them horribly horribly wrong perhaps the writers will up the ante for the second film i hope they do because for all the enjoyment i felt watching i also felt letdown whether you feel as i do or hate the film or love it success is extremely important to the movie industry as a whole which has been dominated by the monotonous churningout of safe formulaic superhero films and hopefully that will give the writers more room to take even bigger risks in the inevitable sequels,comedy
has come at the perfect time with the current superhero obsession weve seen at the cinema a film like is the perfect antithesis to the over saturation of comic book adaptations hes a crude rude punmaking machine who also has an affinity for breaking the fourth wall addressing the audience directlyweve seen ryan reynolds take on comic book characters before but gratefully so has this movie is constantly selfaware satirically meta and hilariously open about reynolds past misfires it was beautiful to see a film directly discuss what were already thinking in our headworks as pure action entertainment as well as an overthe top comedy its a revenge tale a love story an origin story and a damn good time justice has finally been done to the merc with a mouth is it the next citizen kane no is it the perfect movie you bet,comedy
there are many problems with this move especially if all the jokes that didnt hit are allowed to be counted as separate problemslook comedy is hard action comedy is especially hard and is a dark comedy comic book hero it should not be surprising that the movie based on him can be pretty stupid at times some jokes are genuinely funny but a lot of them are just dumb of course if you are the kind of person who thinks so what dumb can be good then this argument has not much of a leg to stand onhowever while the quality of the humour is in the eye of the beholder its life expectancy can be judged more harshly because a lot of the humour is popculture topical referencing various celebrities or obscure movies which means that this movie is not going to be nearly as enjoyable a few years from now even now it can be sometimes hard to perceive for those who are not into superhero moviesit is not only the humour but the whole movie feels that way like it will not be relevant or remembered a couple of years from now it does things like introduce the xmen academy and characters from the xmen universe without explanation because it expects you to know those things which in turn makes the movie feel like a stop gap between some two other bigger superhero moviesthen there are some standard superhero movie plot oddities why does put so much effort in trying to avoid bullets considering his superpower how did one of the characters who is not a superhero manage to survive what should clearly be a fatal fall do we really need another i got your girl villain all of this does not break the movie though because is still a good movie all things considered i found it to be less enjoyable for the comedy and more for being a pretty good standard super hero movie the acting is good if you do not mind ryan reynolds delivery the chemistry between characters is good the villain is very shallow but surprisingly charismatic and the action looks coolcould it be better yes the jokes could be less corny the camera work during the action could be clearer the fighting choreography could be less bland and less reliant on cg some of the plot points could be less clich but as it is is still worth a watch and worth making a sequel to,comedy
i guess if antman and of all people can get his own movie and a pretty good one at that then can finally get his own movie luckily fox bounced back from its monumental flop fantastic four last august with the pretty decent rrated comic book flick in wade wilson is a mercenary in new york city when he meets a woman named vanessa at a local bar they hook up and a year later wade pops the question with a ring pop which she accepts wade then collapses and is later diagnosed with terminal cancer one night at the bar he meets a recruiter from a secret program who offers an experimental treatment for his cancer wade declines and leaves but he later reconsiders the offer and leaves vanessa in the middle of the night to receive the treatment the procedure involves getting tortured for weeks on end until a mutation occurs and wade is severely disfigured in the process although his cancer is cured and hes practically immortal wade escapes the facility that looks exactly like the torture chamber in hostel and vows revenge on the person who did this to him oh and somehow hes aware that hes in a movie for all its intents and purposes is a very fun and sometimes funny movie although not all the jokes hit and it gets a little exhausting towards the end the ridiculous overthetop violence also makes the movie unnaturally entertaining for a comic book flick hopefully more r rated superhero movies are made in the future ability to break the fourth wall also makes the film more interesting but it causes the plot to suffer somewhat a lot of the backstory is told by in flashbacks causing the film to jump around in time a lot may not be the crowning achievement of comic book movies but its entertaining enough to watch in the theater im sure itll be the perfect movie for 12 year old boys slumber parties after their parents have gone to sleep,comedy
ive been a fan of dp since the first time i saw him in a dd comic this is perfect and hilarious and completely and utterly i think it hit new highs for me as a marvel fanhowever this is not for kids omg i cannot stress this enough if you think the marvel logo makes it kid friendly youll be surely surprised i saw two families with kids and whoops did they leave fast i loved the soundtrack very random but fits the tone of the movie and this movie is amazingly centered but full of tangents and flashbacks and full of fourth wall breaking amazing goodness and i have to say its my favorite marvel movie right nowif you love violence and romance and gore and toilet humor and witty banter you will love this movie if you love romantic films about the consequences of love and the bitter truth of surviving cancer but hate grotesque violence and bad language you will hate this movie but deserves all the praise its quick and a few jokes take a second listening but so good cant wait for the sequel,comedy
going into this film while excited i was also honestly a little hesitant largely because of the marketing giving the impression that the movie was to right the wrongs that xmen origins wolverine had done to the character any time i hear a film attempting to correct the wrongs of a predecessor we receive movies like exorcist ii the heretic or batman  robin what im saying is that it usually doesnt work out very well i was worried that the fourth wall humor would get stale or annoying or maybe the story would be too standard to be entertaining the moment the opening credits hit the screen all my doubts were put to restafter thinking hard about it now i can confidently say that i love the hell out of this movie so much so that it possibly rivals what has been my favorite marvel movie for the last couple years guardians of the galaxy the comedy is gold from the hilarious opening credit sequence to the ending credit sequence i was pretty consistently laughing the action is pretty fun and creative and gorges itself in the hard r rating the references and cameos were fantastic the fourth wall breaking actually worked extremely well and was one of the highlights of the whole movie ryan reynolds loves every second he is playing this character you can just tell that he is giving this role all of his energy and love last year he was in a movie called the voices also a very good movie but is not the same as this much darker but still very funny as well as intense after i saw that movie i was saying how i hope that reynolds will finally get his comeback movie and not keep getting handed bomb after bomb it took a year but i believe that it finally happened hes in a great movie that is actually going over very well with the audience it seems im not really going to delve too deep into the story not because i think its going to be chalk full of surprises for anyone who sees it i think that most can probably guess whats going to happen because its a simple story that isnt an insult to the film at all actually its a compliment its nice seeing a marvel movie breaking down to a basic revenge film instead of having to save the world in some grand and epic way while im not saying that its necessarily a bad thing when an xmen or avengers film does that im only saying that its nice to see one of the comic movies break away from that formula is allthe film is about wade wilson ryan reynolds who meets a girl morena baccarin falls in love and after a while he finds out he has cancer attempting to spare his fianc any problems he runs off without a word and joins this secret experiment that is promised to rid him of the cancer and even give him additional abilities things dont quite go as planned causing wade to take on the title after being hideously deformed by the mad scientists involved so he may exact his revenge and save his fianc basic origin story doesnt need a world destruction and must stop it from happening plot line theres no fish out of water thing going on there is one smart ass of a character that just wants revenge and to be with his fianc again while not looking like hamburger meat everything in this movie works the relationship between wade and his fianc was a lot of fun and i actually felt invested in them even the villain who was played by the man that took on the last transporter installment for its lead ed skrein i thought he was terrible and extremely bland in that movie but in this he actually was some fun to watch and posed an actual threat to the hero without be too stock for some reason these characters easily grew on me and it didnt take me out or detach any emotional investment whenever the fourth wall was broken which can be a very hard and tricky thing to do but this film does it flawlessly in my eyesi thought that this was a blast and i would love if i could see it again i say bring the whole family but thats because i grew up on robocop and friday the 13th as a kid although there wasnt a pegging scene in any of those movieswell anyways if you like hard r action ryan reynolds and wham on the soundtrack then youll probably get a kick out of this movie,comedy
once again along comes a movie that i hugely anticipated and i find it well just okay anyway what more could have i expected from this film but i have to say that the plot was well ordinary not so much in a bad sense but it was similar to say wolverine its just that it starred as opposed to wolverine okay it wasnt exactly the same but it simply seemed as if the creators took the basic outline of wolverine and changed the characters dialogue and scenes but pretty much kept everything else mind you you cant get characters anywhere near as opposite as and wolverine  actually come to think of you swap the hair for a spandex suit and remove the adamatine coated bones and claws and the big mouth then you could probably say that they are fairly similarmind you is much more a spoof film than anything else though it is not a spoof film in the same sense as those really bad spoof films that you fortunately dont see all that much anymore probably because the go straight to video  or even straight to youtube rather it is the marvel cinematic universe taking a really good laugh at itself and while there are only a couple of xmen collosus and negasonic it is clear that it is set in the same universe in fact there is even a scene where you see a model as he appeared in wolverine as well as a joke about sowing his mouth shutthats the thing with he simply cannot shut up and if there isnt anybody in the film to talk to hell unashamedly turn to the audience and have a good old chat with them further he isnt a hero and once again he is pretty clear about that to the point that he flat out refuses to join the xmen and doesnt seem to be all that keen on joining the brotherhood of mutants either further he seems to be pretty accident prone and forgetful including leaving his spare ammo at home in the opening scene all this adds up to a rather amusing interlude within the xmen marvel cinematic universe saga and while it is set in the modern age despite him apparently being killed in wolverine we must remember that the entire universe was reset in days of future pastall in all its a pretty fun movie with some clever dialogue making good use of a rather unique mutant though technically he isnt a mutant because he gained his powers as opposed to being born with them dont expect anything too serious though because that is definitely not what this movie is,comedy
is this a super hero movie well yes in a way that cannot be killed is this meant for kids no it is more violent with adult scenes and nasty jokes for super hero movie it more of super vengeance movie of a character taken from the movie goodbad and ugly having the traits of all the three xmen are comedians and is originally a human if i were to give a presentation of the movie it will end in three slides slide 1 introduction slide 2 romance and terminal disease slide 3 betrayal and vengeance but then presentation of this movie is very good with little content they made a good movie for me a movie should have more content with good presentation of course i wont call this movie as bad but the expectation after seeing the trailers were very higher in the end trailers alone was enough for this movie if you have seen all the trailers then you dont require to see the movie to spoil your imaginations as there is nothing more impressive to it,comedy
masterfully played by ryan reynolds is very entertaining with a lot of funny jokes and not much elseby the end of the initial sequence the novelty will wear off and youll left wonder if theres anything left to see there isnt what follows is a torrent of oneliners between the occasional more violent than usual fight scene most of the jokes have no build up are dickrelated or pop culture references and are delivery in such an abrupt manner that you become numb to it worst of all the lead characters can only interact through these jokes and seem incapable of any other kind of speech and thats a shameits almost impossible to relate in any way to these characters some of them come as bigoted others as onedimensional theres no progression no struggle and barely any conflict the film starts at the end and doesnt add much more to the beginning bound to an origin story most of its shortcomings come from the wish of the creators to stay as close to the comics as possible the film would certainly benefit from more creative freedom and more room to breathecan by appreciated by its mere existence and by the self aware nature of the character its in the meta segments that is at its best but in the end it never delivers on the promise and fails to satirize its counterparts becoming one more addition to the superhero movie in the process  one where its impossible to disassociate the man inside the suit wade to its alter ego deadpoolalthough theres much room for a much more interesting and already confirmed sequel is exactly what one is expecting and thats disappointing,comedy
this movie is awesome dthe storytelling here is creative by chucking us into an action scene then cuts back and forth in excellent and surprising ways to tell the story of this crazy but oddly likable antihero usually flashbacks and fastforwards can get tiresome but then theyre done right they can help make a simple story feel new and thrilling when it comes to the action having only a few action scenes does indicate its small budget but seeing fights kept as thin as they are here is refreshing even if it isnt settled by a unsubtle joke modifying their scarcity but were not left hanging the action is short quick ultragory and violent and extremely stylish with the opening scene and the final fight between and ajax being the highlights for me,comedy
hello i want to start with the negatives in order to get them away as fast as possible  a the movie does not follow the myths of  many things that make the character what it is are overlooked ignored or did not make it into the movie b no lady death  forget it c ajax was just not good enough for this d why is he able to break the 4th wall and why is he even mad to begin with there are reasons for that e it followed the 1st movie for the hero tropes but but the movie captured the aftermath of what is i was busy laughing around 80 of the movie i was not able to catch a break and this is a movie i will recommend to 910 i hope that where it fell flat like why is actually mad will be addressed in the next movie of the franchise,comedy
this movie is amazing i saw xmen and it completely hated it when i heard there was going to be a movie i thought i arent going to see it  but after hearing good things about this movie i went to see it and it blew me and my mum away keep in mind she hates movies like this usually the plotline is so understandable and easy to figure out which makes it a perfect movie for the jokes to come in even for and other characters within the movie the only downside to this is that there are two main action scenes at the start and the end but nothing in the middle its just getting know what happened in the past for him they did do a massive action scene at the start with background stories but the middle was just a way to get it all out in time for you to know that the end will be coming the extra scene after credits is funny it tell us quit a bit on how much they had to go on this and how well the made it with a small budget but i think it is confirmed to have a second movie if it is not theres going be rage from fan,comedy
ryan reynolds and co excel in the bloody foulmouthed and fourth wall breaking a comic book movie for people who are sick of comic book movies even as the opening credits roll you know youre in for something different the plot plays out as a typical get revengesave the girl superhero movie but the added twist comes from himself who is there the whole time to crack jokes and sneak winks to the audience about how played out and formulaic the plot their following is weasel t j miller and colossus stefan kapicic provide some laughs along the way but its tim millers direction and rhett reesepaul wernicks script that makes the movie whole not to mention reynolds deadon portrayal of that seems like it was ripped straight from the comics pages,comedy
im middleaged into many anime and manga am black and have lived in several countries including the usa ive been a comics fanboy since way back i owned the first spawn and collected comics since the 1970s ive followed the films of many comic adaptations and this is absolutely one of the best so i would say that this film appealed to methe music selected for the film was pure genius it gave added energy and edge the story was light but did have the basic components to create a full story there was pathos humour revenge sex and action it was a sort of adult version of a spiderman story if spiderman had been raunchy and had a bit of wolverine in him i may go see it again but even if i dont im buying it as soon as its available great film i gave a very high rating due to its immense fun factor sadly for other similar films that are due out soon or in the not too distant future the bar has been raised im not worried for batman v superman but i am scared for suicide squad as it may have to have some reedits if its to have the type of following that has gained i cannot recommend higher,comedy
star rating  saturday night  friday night  friday morning  sunday night  monday morning former mercenary wade wilson ryan reynolds now ekes out a living as a sort of odd job man for hire when people need the frighteners laid on things perk up when he meets vanessa morena baccarin the love of his life and they look set to live the rest of their lives togetheruntil he is hit with late stage cancer in several of his most vital organs all seems lost until he is approached by a mysterious agency that says they can cure him as well as giving him superhuman abilities its all just a cruel front though so the villainous ajax ed skrein can use him to experiment on left hideously disfigured wade reinvents himself as the ultimate wiseass wisecracking indestructible tough guy superhero there isthe whole superhero franchise is placed on such a pedestal these days like the ultimate symbol of high art against which others must compete so it was begging for something to come along that stripped it of its pomposity and play out as more of a parody if it does nothing else right hits this mark perfectly from the flashy opening title sequences where insults are replaced by way of crediting the producers and stars of the film to reynoldss relentlessly dry wisecracking delivery on this front at least it worksthe reverse storytelling style was something that had taken a little break for a while but director tim miller gives it a secondcoming here a little overbearing on what is such a short and simplistic tale the sarcastic humour is what gives it its distinctive charm but the hand that feeds it becomes its chalice by at times feeling a little too in your face and full on even in interludes when a more sombre tone would have fittedthe inclusion of two xmen characters as comic relief serves to highlight the leap between two cgi creations and a guy bedecked in a homemade suit and further highlights how stands alone in the crazy marvel universe but stand alone he does and while at times this feels a little overdone its still a funky funny adaptation of one of marvels trickier characters ,comedy
ill just go straight to the point and say that is one of if not the best marvel film to date i was hooked from the beginning credits all the way through to the final credits what is even more valuable though is how it could not have been nearly as masterful if it werent for the fact that ryan reynolds was born for this role i was pleased to see him be able to shine in a role that displays his true talents and boy did it pay offwith the exception of sam ramies spiderman or james gunns guardians of the galaxy too many marvel films attempt to receive easy money by creating a film through an unaltered formula in which makes them all seem the same however manages to stand completely on its own compared to any movie ever created mainly due to the fact that the main protagonist is unlike any other youve been introduced to a word of advice go see this movie,comedy
after the feminist pc machine of disney kathleen kennedy and jj abrams destroyed star wars forever with their crazy left wing ideology and their pandering to all the morons drug addicts millennials in this country i cared not to see i wasnt ready to see another movie in the theater just yet i went reluctantly and was not disappointed in the least delivered good characters good story great cinematography really good music and great humorthe fight scenes were awesome ryan reynolds and morena baccarin had terrific chemistry tj miller was actually okif star wars 7 crushed your soul like it did mine just go see this movie will begin to make things right even if you liked sw7 go see hopefully you will understand that sw 7 was hot garbage compared to in story telling character building script dialogue acting humor music etc i could keep going but i think you get the point,comedy
this movie is a delight to watch  its a different take on xmen series it relies more on humor and it balanced it very well kudos to ryan reynolds its a must watch supporting cast is goodryans friendvillainthe lead from the latest transporter movie doesnot have much to scare offactress is a bit of eyecandy dialogue writing is good  witty and funny there are references to other movies characters as well direction is good this movie is watchable than the rest of the movies release with the theme on survival on island or beach beat the heat with this one,comedy
in an age of never ending superhero films its nice to come across a film like tells the story of a mercenary named wade wilson who becomes a test subject for a shady organization after discovering he has cancer after surviving he becomes a mercenary bent on revenge calling himself the plot of the movie is very formulaic and true to form the real delivery of instead comes from its sense of humor is self referential crude but also a lot of fun its a balance between pure gritty antihero movies like the punisher and typical superhero fanfare of the avengers however with such a barrage of never ending jokes some are guaranteed to be funnier than others one of my gripes with the film comes from the main character himself although wade wilson is understandable in motive and generally funny some of the emotional moments of the film landed flat for me since hes unlikable its an entertaining film and worth watching at least once though,comedy
all of us have expected for a very funny movie with a lot of scenes of sarcasm references and bad words and it was confirmedsince the first scene i laugh so hard many times its unusual at least in brazil a movie be released for 16 years old and have a lot of bad words uncensoredunfortunately i watched this movie dubbed in portuguese but it was not bad i gotta thank the dubbers from brazil for such a great workfront my point of view the movie is a mix of guardians of the galaxy and ted wait dont flame me gotg is a movie that has many jokes and at the same time is a superhero movie on the other hand ted is a movie of drugs sex bad words all the time and it make you fall in loveis a successful of box office and fox finally did a nice jobjust one request invest money hard in not in fantistic four ,comedy
at this point most marvel and dc fans are expecting a bit of a slow down with the rate of comic book related movies the studios would probably agree that to keep audiences coming they have to keep it interesting this marvel flick seems to fall into the middle category depending on your interest in the comic book character of antman had a similar take where it was good but not as powerful as some of the other marvel flicks weve seen most of the marvel movies are good at delivering a punch for great fights between characters and short witty lines in the middle of the normal dialog seems like its an extension of what we got w andrew garfields take on spiderman who does more bantering with the villains if you like bantering comic book characters this is more for you as opposed to characters like batman who dont talk all that much when in action im actually glad the studio managed to satisfy the fans enough to shatter the february record  for valentines day that comes off a little weird oh and for the fans that are anywhere from 30 to 40 years old you will appreciate the end credit scene,comedy
ok so i might seem mean being so strict about content here but hey its my thoughts and here we go now for the review it was a fantastic movie dont get me wrong the jokes flew like bullets and every one worked perfect u gotta love the character of as a whole hes charming witty and just a great guy however the sex swearing and nudity was a little much for my taste it was just unnecessary and not any good story to the movie could have easily been left out however the movie itsself was fantastic couldnt have had a better time at the movies u gotta check it out see it just keep contentin mind as u go but defenetyly see it,comedy
actually a 95 out of 10 but whatever superhero movie fatigue has begun to set in and after a while it felt like there would never be a superhero movie that could rejuvenate the genre since its announcement in late 2014 along with its brilliant aggressive marketing campaign all throughout last year and into early 2016 has finally arrived and ill be damned if i dont admit right now that it was well worth the wait from the opening credits to the end of the film you are in for a hilarious ride the jokes are hilarious and wellwritten and the comedic timing is onpoint the violence is spectacular and while it can get pretty gruesome it is never too overthetop to the point of being confused for a hollywoodproduced snuff film the acting is also fantastic give credit to ryan reynolds who slays the role of wade wilsonmy only gripes are that the villain was generally cookiecutter he felt too similar to a mcu villain who arent that wellwritten and characters such as negasonic teenage warhead are sadly underused overall though i will go ahead and call the best movie of the year so far and one of the best superhero films of alltime youll be doing yourself a favor by watching this movie,comedy
is here finally on the big screen our favorite antihero bags himself a movie and it has something to do with polverine  let the fandom erupt it walks closely on the scales of comics although focuses on his origins more the vanessa carlysle story is chosen to go with him in order to pack in the romance quotient writers take it all the way through tim miller chooses to go with an oscillating presentation where he tries to merge up the current and the past later connecting us to the stream midway occasionally breaks the fourth wall for emphasis and it does manage to pack in his comic quotientaction seqs are jaw dropping as the protagonist rolls midair does impressive flips whilst performing enthralling takedowns gore speaks volume with the rad guns heads drop bodies get spattered bones break and faces get battered to pulp it is all in there just how you would have imagined it to beat no point in the movie does the humour stop it is on an incessant unchecked ride that has so many marvel and dc references that would put you in laughter fits watch out for green lantern xmen and wolverine references so many quick snappy comebacks that have been aced by ryan reynolds nicely the merc with a mouth has a flair that relates to the cool perfectlyother characters in the movie are great as well portrayals of dopinder and weasel go with the comedy bandwagon complementing the hilarity just fine whilst ed skrein mixes style and perversion beautifully stan lee makes a cameo as usual and a hilarious postcredit scene waits for you in the end as well dont miss that one the big downside of the movie is its plot it weighs low on it since most of the times is busy entertaining us with his sarcastic unceasing oneliners also negasonic teenage warhead gets lost in the chatter and fails to make an impactbut we tend to overlook all of that since it was supposed to be an entertainer anyhow oh wait before i almost forget beeeeeeeeeeeep you indian censor board you ruined it for us,comedy
by that i mean that the plot mad scientist moonlighting as merchant of death ultimately kidnaps catherine bell lookalike doubling as love interest of antihero exists only as a means of thinly justifying all the action sequences on the other hand the thornton wilderstyle breakings of the fourth wall do allow ryan reynolds to take some well deserved pot shots at timewarner with regard to green lantern furthermore the almosttouching scene where wade walks out on vanessa in order to take advantage of ajaxs cancer cure treatment leads to a bit of scenerychewing by the british guy playing the latter thatquite franklyalmost literally put me to sleepthat being said however i still enjoyed this film a lot more than the prequel i shall always without hesitationor apology refer to as x men low class especially the debut of negasonic teenage warheadim hoping shes a revamped version of boomboom from the comics,comedy
spoiler spoiler spoiler well i watched yesterday and all i can say is wow what a different take on the super hero genre for one as he says in the film its not a super hero film its a love story however its a funny love story with many funny moments ive never heard blind jokes that made me laugh ryan reynolds changed all of that this part was made for him and there was action laughs sad moments and it touched all areas is a guy names wade who gets diagnosed with cancer he decides he doesnt want his girlfriend to have to see him die so he decided to get some special treatment done which basically turns him into when turned into the side affects are gruesome and he blames the people who changes him he decides he wants to get his messed up face fixed so goes on a killing spree to get the guy who did it to him basically there is some kind of corporation that turns people into mutants by torturing them so after getting the back story and working his way through armies of people he gets stopped by the xmen in the form of colossus and some girl whos name escapes me again there are allot of laughs when they come into the film i dont want to spoil to much so please go and see this great film that sits on the top of the podium with guardians of the galaxy as marvels best installment to date this film isnt really a childrens marvel films its more of an adults marvel film with allot of swearing and gore amen to that,comedy
im one of those people who first saw the leaked test footage some years ago and having been a comic book fan from a young age have been hoping that the movie would get made and in a way that honours the comic bookif you are a fan of the comics and can forgive that they have lightened up a little just to have this made at all this is a fantastic movieright from the credits which you have to pay attention to there are 4th wall breaches which give you an indication of the type of movie that youre about to watch the initial part of the movie is interspersed with parallel telling of origin story and the current period time a difference of about 2 years right up until hits the motorway  which is where the test footage starts to look very familiarthe movie is definitely bloody and not at all for the faint hearted however the comedy aspect of it makes the gory scenes almost so unbelievable that you can laugh them off  between people being shot in the head you have being shot in the ass  which lightens the whole mood of near decapitation by a single bulletthe laughs dont stop coming either even in the midst of all that violence the 4th wall is constantly broken  from the appearance of a toy wade wilson as a kind of from that xmenwolverine movie that we would want to forget him appearing in to references of mcavoy and stewart as charles xavier the jokes are juvenile and crude and the action violent and bloody  apart from a few jokes which i dont believe translated as well to little old new zealand  i absolutely loved it and plan to go see it againdo make sure you check the closing credits and stay right until the very last credits,comedy
this was just flat out awful the entire thing was based in being as intentionally low and foul as possible and was bad enough to overcome my compulsion to watch the whole thing after several starts where i only got through a few more minutes here and there i finally just turned it off about half way through maybe ugh now i know why ive heard the judgements ive heard against it from great folks who generally never say such negatives i had it right before i took the totally fallacious advice to not have a negative impression without watching its ometimes a good thing to just avoid the shows that look bad on first impressions maybe go watch an old b movie or a made for tv movie rerun,comedy
watched the first halfhour of this feces and turned it off since it turned my stomach this garbage is a prime example of the fall of human civilization and our deevolution an ugly sick sadistic monstrosity whose message is that agonizing torture brings out the best in humanity ill never watch another ryan reynolds movie if hes willing to star in this he would be willing to star in a snuff film,comedy
the jokes the charakters and finally a bloody superhero movie one of my vafourites now,comedy
is one best movies out there it has a lot action its very funny i really enjoy this one,comedy
im a big ryan reynolds guy and an even bigger guy lets goooo,comedy
finally a movie that fits todays viewers and gives the audience exactly what they didnt know they needed if you havent seen this film please add it to your list,comedy
this is a great movie this might be the best marvel movie so far it only lacks a bit with the story but its ok,comedy
love love love this movie and cant wait to see whats next ryan reynolds is hilarious and the perfect choice to play deadpool,comedy
imagine you were in front of annoying teenage guy who think he is funny cant stop his blabbering mouth even 1 second just to hear his first masturbation experience perfectly describes iti know is merch with a mouth but reynold is not the guy who can spoil a joke moreover every jokes is cheesy and forced nothing to laugh about if you 20 years or older the plot is terrible come on a guy fall in love have a terminally ill cancer found a doctor and make him special then get revenge does it can scores 8 to this point i would not believe imdb rating if this could achieve its rating more than 5theres nothing special with the plot it bores me to the point i would never touch this sequel if the producer really stupid to make it a sequeli would state it in bold is most overhyped movies that succeed attract everyone to go to the movies and disappoint them later luckily i watch it on fox channel the only thing i felt sorry is my 1 hour got wasted the score rating is rigged the good reviews was liar dont fall for it guys,comedy
2016 is a hilarious super hero film the story is a about a witty mercenary wade wilson who turns into played exquisitely by ryan reynolds after his search for a cancer cure goes horribly wrong the story has drama romance and some serious adult comedythe music in this film is outstanding every song serves a purpose whether to emphasize the scene or add a touch of funny to an otherwise serious action scene the music for comedy though very enjoyable is outdone by the comedic performance of ryan reynolds his dry straight faced humor is perfect and had me gasping for air through my laughter this film has made its way on to my favorites list and i wait in great anticipation for 2,comedy
im actually quite surprised on how this movie goes well but the ratings didnt do well on its release like it had 6  69 rating more or less on the 1st week and so weeks go on then it became to 8 now its actually good though i really recommend it to be honest is playing as ryan reynolds the character really fits perfectly for reynolds performance 1010 acting 1010 humor 1010 i cant wait for another movie and i hope its 2h30m long the movie is really worth a penny,comedy
2016 this issuperhero filmbased on themarvel comicscharacterof the same name our main character hunts the man who gave himmutantabilities but also a scarred physical appearance this is not your typical superhero film hence the r rating the violence is cranked the up to john wick levels the language and sexual content is not what you would expect out of a superhero if you know the comic youll understand but you dont need to know the comic or character to love this film the cast was fantastic it includes ryan reynoldsmorena baccarin andt j miller the jokes are hilarious sometimes juvenile but utterly necessary to understand the character this is by far my favorite superhero movie it really blew me away i still cant conceive how much less it cost compared to other superhero movies this is an absolute must see hell ive seen it five times in less than a year,comedy
i am a 53 yearold manand the target audience for is much much younger so its not all that surprising that i wasnt bowled over by the film like so many younger people i know and when i am not as enthusiastic about it understand that i am writing my review mostly for folks who are not huge fans of superhero films sure ive seen more than my share but i am growing tired of the whole genre and while deliberately avoids some of this its still a head on assault to your senses due to all the action and explosionsmy primary reason for not being a superhero fan yes there are tons and tons of explosions and actionthat left me pretty coldas did some of the ultra violence what i did like was how occasionally broke through the fourth wall and talked to the audience or made commentaries about superhero filmsthat i really liked overall its a mixed bag for meworth seeing and enjoyable but one i am very glad i waited until the film came to cable tv,comedy
what i appreciated about this movie is that it manages to be such a fun comic book adaption as well as gleefully earning its r rating the violence and language enhanced the tone which i would describe as a giggling middle schooler getting away with something i didnt think it had the depth that some reviewers seemed to attribute to iti think the love story was more important for some than others i thought the fact that didnt call his girlfriend and tell her he was alive was frustrating i kind of liked colossus but he looked a little too cgi im not sure where i stand with ryan reynolds performance he might have been the perfect person to play but something about him was slightly annoying not much else to say except that i will be looking forward to the sequel,comedy
dont expect this movie to be like spiderman or batman  this is a humour film  a complete entertainer  laughs guaranteed  dialogs were so funny  story is simple but was carried out good  the taxi driver character was cool  a simple movie but executed well  i like it that this is not a usual super hero film where things go serious and with terrifying villains  a new type of superhero film  overall  a great entertainer  just watch it without any expectations  i have now started finding better movies through wwwflickstreecom  it not only suggests great movies to watch  it also tells where you can watch the movie online highly recommended,comedy
i went into with seemingly high expectations the video game series was great so i set my standards high for the movie and well i wasnt exactly disappointed but i wasnt exactly pleased now look i read the original comics but im not gonna act like a butt hurt fan boy about this the humor was meh and pretty crude for the sake of being crude the scene with the ring pop was kinda funny and it had its fair share of boring moments and im not gonna lie but the scenes where they tortured him to unlock his powers kinda felt like some weird torture porn seen straight out of a japanese hentai but overall i still enjoyed it ryan reynolds was a great cast for in all honesty i looove him as an actor some of the side characters were pretty meh i loved the blind old lady to death but his wife and francis was that his name i forgot were pretty forgettable but i still enjoyed it none the less still kinda hated how the chick saved him in the end his wife or whatever kinda forgot her name but the costume looked fantastic like it was ripped right out of the comics i give this movie a 610 because it wasnt awful but it wasnt good,comedy
a solo movie has been a long time coming originally being set to be a spinoff from xmen origins wolverine despite the film being put on hold star ryan reynolds and first time director tim miller were determined to make and after seven years and leaked concept footage we finally got this hyped flickwade wilson reynolds is a bad guy who is paid to go after even worst guys after meeting a prostitute vanessa morena baccarin wade forms a relationship but their happiness is shattered when wade discovers he has cancer and volunteers for an experiment to give him mutant powers the treatment was a success but disfigures him wade sets out to get revenge against that the man who mutated him francis ed skrein and becomes everyones favourite gun totting katana wielding motormouth assassinthe appearance of in xmen origins wolverine was a complete distance reynolds stole the show in brief appearance as wade but when he turned to the film reinterpreted to have his mouth sewed shut and blades coming out of his arms even the xmen films before days of future past rewrote continuity ignored origins by the xmen films and solo outing is a more faithful adaptation letting the character wear his famous red costume being extremely violent and breaks the fourth wall the primary goal was to please the fans and it manages that effortlesslywas a pet project for reynolds he wanted to see it made despite a lack of interest from the studio was the perfect character for reynolds to play he has the quick wit and delivery while also physically believable as a superhero reynolds has notorious bad luck with superheroes starring in blade trinity and green lantern but with he finally found the right role for his abilities as wade reynolds was witty with his delivery whether talking to vanessa or taking on a foe and as he lives up the title of the merc with the mouthin the comics is famously aware he is a comic book character and a part his shtick is he forth wall the film adaptation keeps this and has a blend of selfreferential humour popreferences and crude humour it could have easily been a disaster since it this was a very difficult type of humour to master but fortunately the writing acting and direction gets it right the film starts off with one of the best title sequences for any film in a long time which makes fun of everyone involved and having some well placed references reynolds makes fun of himself and his previous superhero roles and himself and as mentioned constantly has witty lines there are also plenty of visual gags and reynolds is not the only funny character in the film tj miller has some funny exchanges with reynolds and brianna hildebrand was a revelation as negasonic teenage warhead being a sardonic snarky teenager who has a very dry deliveryother actors played their roles more straight mainly skerin and stefan kapii as the voice of colossus skerin was convincing enough in the action sequences and does toetotoe with but as a villain on the bland side it was a shame that daniel cudmore did not respire his role as colossus but kapiis version is more loyal to the comics being a huge eastern europe metal man the film uses gina carano to the best of her abilities  by not letting her speak much and lets her fighting do the talkingtim miller also shows himself to be a director with potential he has previous worked as special effects artist including working as the second unit director on thor the dark world he keeps a fast pace and he delivers some excellent action sequences the opening action sequence was an excellent recreation of the leak test footage and the action as a whole was perfectly bloody as uses his knives and guns tim miller was bit like zack snyder with his approach being highly stylised as uses his guns and swords and jumping up in the air when wade escapes from the experiments felt very similar to vs escape in the film adaptation for v for vendetta but the risk for tim miller is he could end up being the next james mcteigue have a great debut film and makes nothing good afterwardswas made budget of 58 million very modest for a big superhero film considering tim millers background the cgi work was strong particularly the motion capture for colossus it would have been great to see colossus to change back and forth from his human to his metal form but he was kept in his metal form because it must have been cheaper to do so even makes a dig at the films budgetthough is a funny and fun film being a good example of an actioncomedy its the story that is lets it down its a standard origins story which by itself is fine and the logic is to help distance this version of from the last one particularly since it has the same star but it brings nothing new to the table and the film is not as subversive as it thinks it is films like kickass super and chronicle are much better deconstructions of the superhero genredoes what it sets out to do please the fans of comics while also being a genuinely funny actionsuperhero film it deserves its status as an immediate cult status and there is enough for a more causal audiences to enjoy an excellent start to the 2016 superhero season,comedy
one of my favorite marvel characters finally gets the longawaited liveaction adaptation he so rightfully deserves this is the comic book film weve all been waiting for this is the weve been looking for seriously we have never seen anything like this before ryan reynolds dream came true he also kills it as this movie is so twisted as its should be its insanity pure insanity has it all literally theres action blood sex and a hell of jokes like the jokes are constant and it all mostly works laugh after laugh after laugh easily the funniest movie ive seen in quite sometime i never thought there would be a day where i saw a 5 minute sex sequence in a marvel film what a time to be alive,comedy
it is 054 and i just got home for the late session at my local cinema in spain where today the 19th of february has been released now the movie has a beautiful screenplay and acting cannot be more on point and we havent even got to puns pop culture references other comic book characters references the fourth wall omg the fourth wall everything beautifully put into place in its own way of course now come on everyone red band trailer plenty of warnings parental control advised lets all be grown ups and admit that if you had done your homework you would know that this is no kiddies film with that being said i have to stress again that there is very little wrong with this movie in my opinion of course the only two thing i see out of place are1 the advertising while its clever and teasing to release a trailer with a countdown for another trailer with our antihero drinking something hot in front of the fireplace for christmas in my humble opinion the trailers were much too revealing for quite a large portion of the film i was rather expecting to see the things ive seen in the trailers then focus on the film because you could actually anticipate the best part of it as in oh nows when weasel says what wades face looks like understand2 and second i believe that doesnt really stay much in one place for long and there are only two general setting in the movie apart from the origin story what i mean by that is that i dont get the feeling that really moves about like in the game for example he goes to genosha he is being annoying to the actual wolverine he explores more places and it gets much more random so to sayonce again there is nothing wrong with the actual film but next time i would say shorter trailers and more places,comedy
trailers were overblown with the hype but it didnt meet the expectation in full version of the movie the script itself is a soso it could have been done better a lot of things seemed forced the effects were lame like there wasnt enough money to do it rightinvolvement of secondclass xmen for me was unnecessary if they couldnt bring the real deal regarding the profanities it wasnt badacting of ryan reynolds was on the spot he was the right man for the job but other things failed enough so this movie couldnt deliver as it should have,comedy
superhero films are not really my thing for me films like the avengers transformers etc are comparable to indian masala films where the hero punches a guy and he goes flying in the air its what i call junk food cinema it satisfies ones taste buds but we all know junk food in excess just causes diarrhea however with this weeks released my expectations were a little higher than i would have from a avenger film this is because the trailer of was kickass fun and novel looked hilarious and he seemed like a antihero who didnt want to save the world for the millionth time in the films trailer well in eventuality was a little underwhelming than i thought it would be but it was still great fun and miles ahead of all the other superhero films i have seen except guardians of galaxy which i enjoyed slightly more is quirky zany and the humour is downright raunchy and thats something you probably have not seen before in a superhero film is a satire of sorts on superhero films but were the film should have broke the clichs it was making fun of it in the end gets caught in the same rut  works mainly because of the films badass hero aka ryan reynolds who i have never liked in a film before  acting wise deadpoolbut more on that laterstory wise a former special forces operative turned mercenary wade wilson who after being diagnosed with cancer in the final stage he is then subjected to a rogue experiment that leaves him with accelerated healing powers adopts the alter ego armed with his new abilities and a dark twisted sense of humor hunts down the man who nearly destroyed his lifeacting wise honestly other than ryan reynolds nobody is really noticeable on screen and thats a great thing for all fans because ryan owns the screen he is hilarious he kickass like never before and doesnt want to save the worldthankfully this is the first ryan reynolds performance i have enjoyed and its a bloody good one keep up the good workhas a clichd villain there is a clichd love angle and there is a climax fight sequence were the superhero has to save something luckily this time its not the world so the film is not really novel but everything is done a quirky zany satirical way were everything is being made fun ofso one enjoys the proceedings but i wont lie i excepted something a little more badass at times for example the whole love angle in could have been done with the film would have worked without it in my opinion however everything is being satired like i mentioned before so even the cheesiest scene brings a laugh like the scene when the girlfriend is about to say will you give it to me in the aand wade says i love you  he thought she wanted him to say that scenes like that evoke a huge amount of laughter the films biggest plus is the raunchy over the top humour the films action sequences are top notch and the bridge and climax action sequences are feast for a action film lovers eyes the added gore was nice touch toothe production values were good but there eerily similar to antman but both are marvel films so its expected i guess i must say my favourite scene was when and the xmen characters  who i have never heard ofwalkout in the climax fight with dmx playingthat was badass a special mention to the films director for using raj kapoors classic song mera jhoota hai japani in that felt like a proud moment being a indian however the brown taxi driver character was too clichdwas also nice to see my hometown vancouver bc as the main shooting location in the filmstory and screenplay needed a bit of work because the character gave scope to make a even betterbigger film but the lacklustre predictable story bogged the film downoverall after guardians of galaxy is the only superhero film i enjoyed its a film that never bores and is great kickass fun minor blemishes aside for the regular cine goer this film could be a enjoyable prospect for all you freaks who are superhero cinema fans i am joking you have already either the watched film or reserved your tickets so you dont need my recommendation 3255 or 6510,comedy
greetings again from the darkness superhero movies have been dominating the box office for the better part of two decades and most tend to lean towards moody and intense  though ironman and the avengers have certainly enjoyed adding searing oneliners to the mix as for ratings superheroes have steadfastly claimed pg13 as the perfect blend of massive action massive muscles and massive audiences so its a little surprising to find a movie about a relatively unknown superhero thats the first feature from director tim miller previously a visual effects guru crashing through the rrated barrier in noholdsbarred fashion its startling and refreshing to see a new take on what had become just a bit too familiarthis is a movie for which you will want to actually read the opening credits and stay for the post credit scene a 2parter additionally you will want to make sure you keep not only little kids away remember the hard rrating but also any grownups who are offended by harsh language on the tarantino scale ultraviolence on the kill bill scale or any combination of sex sex talk or sex jokes all at an entirely new level to label this movie as crass or profane is like calling chewbacca somewhat fuzzy and while it pushes the raunchometer its also blazingly funny at times especially for a cancer moviethe previously mentioned opening credits refer to the writers as the real heroes here and while the plot is pretty textbook superhero stuff its the barrage of oneliners and sight gags at which those writers so excel they even make sure those unfamiliar with the wade wilson backstory understand that he is a former special forces operative turned mercenary for the average joes and janes in no time its drilled into our heads that he is also a wiseacre wisenheimer wiseass wisecracker and any other adjective that means funny but not wiseryan reynolds stars as wade wilsonand leaves no doubt that he has finally found the role that fits him as well as his red suit if you are convulsing as you flashback to mr reynolds as green lantern 2011 take solace in the fact that this movie fires a couple of deadly shots at that ohsodisappointing effort his girlfriend vanessa is played by morena baccarin homeland and his best buddybartender is played by tj miller silicon valley since reynolds had a brief appearance as in xmen origins wolverine 2009 there are numerous nods to that franchise including two key roles here for colossus stefan kapicic and negasonic teenage warhead brianna hildebrand the target of revenge comes in the form of ed skrein the transporter refueled as ajax and gina carano as angel dust  accompanied by her theme song angel of the morning unfortunately its the juice newton version and not the more powerful merrillee rush and the turnabouts version lastly its pure joy to see leslie uggams cast in a spunky supporting roleyour kid may have a captain america figurine on their bookshelf but the rrating is solidified in the first 10 minutes and is relentlessly reinforced until the movie ends we can only imagine how much fun those old enough to watch are going to have and brace yourself for an onslaught of comebacks over the next few weeks  only hopefully not in church at the office in front of grandma etc ,comedy
its an ok movie it does several things right1 doesnt last too long 2 doesnt take itself too seriously 3 goes for fun  jokes 4 pokes fun at the superhero genrebut its not great most of the jokes arent that good the breaking of the 4th wall a trademark is pretty random  a lot of times you would expect him to speak to you yet he doesnt  and vice versa while poking fun at superhero genre it ends up being a lot like other movies of the genre sans selfreferential jokessince it pretty much abandons the idea of having a cohesive story and jokes arent that good whats left is the characters which arent very interesting is ok but not great so is his bartender sidekick others not so much morrena baccarins beauty is in the eye of the beholder but unfortunately theres not much else villains are pretty flat gina carano especially could just as well have been a robotso if youre 21 or older its an ok watch just dont expect too much,comedy
this film is full of artificial scenes firstly the name he choose when he was in a bar is a copy of scene from film rango of johnydepps secondly he keeps talking to the camera looks like nothing but annoyinggina carano angel dust try to strangle colossus when it is very clear he cant be strangled because is ironmanwade gets in enmity with ajax without any reason just because ajax transformed him but infact it was wade who approached ajax to transform him to mutantthe rest of the film is nothing but full of boring copied scenes but the funniest was when angel dust tries to strangle colossusreview from pakistan girl,comedy
whilst superman is fighting batman and the xmen are going back and forward in time youre just wasting your time watching them the best superhero movie is deadpoollets just say first and foremost this movie is not for kidsfor adults though this movie has everything  action boobs superheroes boobs and laughs there is comedy from the very first scene and although im not a fan of ryan reynolds i must say he is perfect as his comedy timing in this is fabulous and his chemistry with other characters means the jokes appear so natural and subtle its almost like there wasnt a script rather a lets film it and see what happens kind of directorwatch the movie listen carefully to the dialogue because a lot of the jokes are subtle and just enjoy i would watch this over and over again foregoing all xmen and marvel movies bring on 2,comedy
this movie has plenty of action and outrageous special effects that dont even try to be realistic theres some dramatic back story and lots and lots of violence and spraying gore its pretty funny too although the humor is extremely campy its as though the old british carry on movies were crossed with quentin tarantinothe language is bad there is a good deal of nudity there are tasteless masturbation jokes and allinall its a heap of low brow fun dont look for moral lessons there are none dplus it was wonderful to see leslie uggams still a classylooking lady although she didnt have much to do,comedy
funny yet overrated and not accurate to the comic book series still a fun film but in my opinion a letdown,comedy
it should be said i dont particularly like super hero movies but this one was really bad in my opinion american pie meets spider man someone is bound to like this that person is not methe story is non existent the humor is on the bad end of immature and nothing sticks out as interesting,comedy
when wade wilson a former special forces officer left the army then in his own garbage according to his own rules the good of the bad a man having a great harmony with vanessa who just got into her life thinking that something is going right it is cancer face the truth to watch the woman he loves for this painful process wade who abandoned her to save her offered herself a treat participate in the scientific project but this project is only a side effect cancer treatment will be the main purpose is to trigger some dna wade who does not come to mind he has the authority but with all these features one goal there is revenge on ajax francis some sections from your life in the story of the hero who shares with us the story of professor x the virtuous colossus and negonic teenage warhead in adolescence accompanied antihero character in his own film x men origins wolverine is a different version than have a structure in marvel studioss project while director tim miller undertook the screenplay rhett reese and paul it belongs to the wernick duo wade wilson  character in the film ryan reynolds morena baccarin gina carano ed skrein brianna hildebrand and tj miller is also present,comedy
highly invented parody of the super hero genre with ryan reynalds at his cocksure best it seems the super hero movie has been in vogue for the past few years now with studios clambering to release any kind of movie tv show or animation attached to a super hero premise there was a time when studios waited to unleash their tent pole super hero movies onto the world this usually followed a long laborious period of rumours of actors playing the part directors walking in and out of production script writers and script doctors being hired and fired now it seems that every six months a new super hero movie or new look super hero is being reborn rebuilt reconfigured renewed rehashed reimagined or just plain revealed add to this the fact that within these movies are a scatter gun of loosely attached characters who will go on to have their own movie releases this really does say all you need to know about the state of the hollywood movie making process at this moment in time and perhaps says more about international audiences appetite for spandex clad crapolanow add to this the new movie a movie which is so self aware of its roots as a super hero movie it borders on the pastiche the joke in is that the character is aware he is in a movie that alone is enough to separate it from the usual slam bang visuals of the ordinary super hero movie now factor in that he is a foul mouthed sexobsessed drug abusing wisecracking mutant hero and you begin to start wondering how this movie ever made it to the cinemas in this age of polished stars and stripes hero obsessed genre of movie making it is refreshing that hollywood deemed it worthy to add to the cannon the antithesis of the super hero and that antithesis is deadpoolwhilst not totally reinventing the wheel succeeds through its sheer disregard for the genre wears its r rated badge proudly neither trying to kowtow to the box office pg crowd nor go full blood and guts towards insatiable violence it straddles a fine line between the two providing some clever meta references to its modern audience whilst at the same time being visually eye popping with some deft cartoon style ott violence even though at heart this is a super hero movie with a character that has been present in comic book form for decades and is straddled with a plot reminiscent of any marveldc movieorigin tale that you care to mention comes across as fresh and a nice tonic to what we have seen of the tired comic book genre so farwhen you start to analyse why it works you begin to realise that it falls nicely onto the feet of one ryan reynalds ever since ryan limped onto our screens as van wilder in the early noughties he has been an actor who has been left in a state of limbo artistically whilst good looking and toned and more than capable of holding a romantic lead he could never quite shake his obvious comedic chops always delivering a line as if he was laughing to himself on the inside thus we saw his peers such as ryan gosling bradley cooper matt damon leonardo dicaprio even ben affleck all in the same age bracket go on to make more serious movies with great success all successfully transitionally from drama to action with little fuss whereas reynalds appeared to be left behind still trying to define his acting unsure if he was a romantic lead action hero or a comedianin i feel ryan has rediscovered his range in essence he is not an actor to be taken seriously nor a superhero who we can convincingly believe is capable of saving the world for me he is a modern day chevy chase all knowing smiles and smarmy charm he is a throwback to the 80s comedic sensibility where it was ok to laugh at people who were different or less good looking than you he is the actor we all love to hate overly confident limited in range lacking in subtleties and way too quick with a one liner but when he is good he is great and when he is bad he is just damn unwatchable in he is note perfectthat isnt to say that is a perfect movie as part of the xmen entourage it does spread its bets by including links to the xmen saga clearly with a view to cashing in on a deadpoolx men collaboration at some time in the future however this link seems somehow fitting as a comic book character exists alongside the xmen furthermore the inclusion of colossus is in itself a joke and one that is cleverly interspersed into the script rather than ham fistedly wedged in to tie the two entities togethera fun inventive spin on the super hero genre and a much welcomed breath of fresh air to the current status quo of hollywood blockbusters it will be interesting to see how develops in his inevitable sequel and if the powers that be have the balls to put their money where their mouth is and give him free reign in an xmen spin off judging by how well this movie came together all signs look good,comedy
ryan reynolds was born to be the his humor his positive energy and his talent made this movie great it is one of my favorite i have watch it at least five times and i am never getting bored of it i can not wait for the second movie of the most funny scenes is where talks to camera like he knew that he was been recorded all in all it is a wonderful movie and i recommend it to everyone,comedy
the level of detail on this movie is amazing ryan reynolds acting absolutely matches wade wilsons character and colossus is finally done right unlike the scrawny version they have in the xmen films this was the type of colossus we needed in the xmen films just to give you guys an idea how well detailed this movie is this movie was filmed in vancouver canada and our vehicles in canada go by km and underneath the km is the miles as opposed to usa where the miles is on top of the km in the instrumental gauge cluster in the vehicles and the vehicles in the movie reflect this not too many people would pick this up in the movie but this goes to show how much effort theyve put into this i truly hope this guy directs the next xmen film or at least assist after apocalypse i do not think i would want singer to direct ever again only reason why i did not give this a 10 was because i personally thought ajax was not a good enough supervillain against deadpool,comedy
a brilliant film with awesome action awesome acting from the cast the film is very funny the film is just loads of fun the characters are well written the funny as hell dialogue between the characters is a highlight of the film the villains were fine the violence is brutal that is the way i like it,comedy
is a masterpiece for the following reasons beyond the traditional rules and hollywood stereotypes is irreverent vulgar and violent beyond belief the action scenes simply perfect hilarious dialogues though vulgar for an audience of minors but not much they would understand the jokes ryan reynolds is perfect in the part as indeed all the characters many hate it but they have not caught the ironic spirit of the character or simply do not know and were expecting a film type spider man or ironman but is not any of it and enjoy it is a hoot in a rush  i can not wait to come out 2 in 2018,comedy
in short if you know if you read the comics and enjoyed them over the years then you will love this movie they really did get it spot on to how it should have been made almost like a 90s made for tv movie but with a bigger budget it suits 100 if you dont read the comics dont like or dont know who he is then you will likely become one of the sour adults reviewing this with 1 star and complaining that it simply isnt funny and probably throwing out a few insults to those that enjoy the comics andor the movieif you didnt read the comics and still enjoyed it then kudos to you you are not easily offended like some of these ancients giving it bad reviews because they didnt get what was funny about it,comedy
this film is amazing why you ask because of ryan renolds not only was his performance true to the character but he was involved every step of the way to make this film after xmen the wolverine origins put a crappy on screen we are lucky enough to have seen this now talking about the film this film uses nonlinear storytelling narriation 4th wall breaking a montage and lots of great action and comedy can do anything and the creators of the film took this to the next level just look at all the marketing for a film that had a 60 million budget it was incredible is not just a superhero movie but also a romance comedy and tragedy if you will is true to the comics which makes this movie great theirs a lot of great comedy from ryan renolds and tj miller and great action overall i give this film a 9510 for being amazing if youre wondering why no 1010 its because i found some of the scenes where they make fun of their xmen films or the studio a little head hitting one of my favorite of 2016 and looking forward to cable,comedy
although it peters out about threequarters of the way through the first three quarters of are definitely worth sitting through the movies funny and cynical with a definite who gives a f attitude toward comic book super heroes by their own admissions a number of the writers of comics from the early to the mid1970s wrote said comics while indulging in a variety of mindaltering drugs while this didnt make for better comics it certainly made for different ones fits right in with them its interesting that not a lot of people seem to have gotten wind of the fact that is really a flipping of the bird to comic book superheroes and their now quaint codes of conduct the character himself might just as easily have been a villain as a hero although his past as a corporate assassin pretty much settles that issue at least for me it does written with an eye toward its target audience young teens often straddles the fence between adult and adolescent entertainment if one can hark back to ones misspent youth one can enjoy despite its blatant catering to the undertwenty mentality its the seemingly endless cgi finale that brings the movie to a screeching halt the way cgi finales almost always bring movies to a screeching halt some of these animated sequences drag out so long that one finds oneself drifting off into daydreams of other things better than average but a far cry from great,comedy
is an outbreak in superhero film industry when talking superhero movies you expect movies stuffed with senseless action and violence an outofreach love story or unnecessary vulgar language serves these aspects in a fine ratio none outweighing the otherthe movie is a smart mix of explicit comedy romancedrama good storytelling directing cast performance visual effects and screenplay watching the movie hardly a scene wentby without laughing even the vulgar language comes into context the love story although unlikely but attractive the storyline is smooth and light hearted not confusing or ridiculously prolonged visual effects were appealing not sloppyso if youre willing to a watch movie with this recipe will rather do the trick,comedy
the last time we saw the merc with the mouth it was in xmen origins wolverine he laid at the bottom of a pile of rubble mouthless disgraced and his character bastardized for the sake of name recognition fans everywhere shed a tear believing that their one and only chance to see in all his snarky cartoonish meta murderous mayhem were gone forever in the time since that debacle of 2009 the world is a different place women have gained the right to vote weve had two popes and chris hemsworth redefined the word sploosh for women everywhere most importantly though has gone from largely unknown cult comic character to the che guevara of marvels underground appearing in marvels animated movies his own video game and growing an enormous fan base a fan base so large in fact that 20th century fox was convinced albeit begrudgingly to green light ryan reynolds perhaps the films biggest supporter to take another shot at creating more true to character version of o whats the verdict on this movie its perfect everything that makes the dark comedy king of marvel is here hes cocky hyper violent self referential clearly a little pissy about having to drag fox kicking and screaming into making this movie and is as nutty as an old school bugs bunny cartoon you know the good ones with all the lovable racism the action scenes are stellar with over the top violence and believe it or not the love story that drives the whole thing is genuine and heartfelt with morena baccarin playing against ryan reynolds with an equally dark sense of humorso if youre looking for a good both a good valentines day movie to take a loved one to this weekend and a movie that will make you howl with laughter one second and then shout eww and awe within that same second check this flick out youll be glad you did gets a perfect 5 out of 5,comedy
ryan reynolds cast in this movie as an unusual super hero is a perfect match ryans comedic performance was exciting and captivating you never know what will happen next much less how will resolve the dangerous situation conflict and humor make for an unusually entertaining mix in this movie always has a fun but morbid comeback for every antagonist in the movie the love affair with a girl who is as twisted as he is makes the characters a prefect match as a couple the end of the movie proves that even more i loved that way it was written directed and performed i am looking forward to next film,comedy
i loved this movie so much i am a huge fan and i love the comics and i gotta say as a fan i was completely satisfied i havent had that much fun in a movie theater in a long time it was faithful to the source material the casting was perfect it was hilarious and all around just a perfect movie ive already watched it three times and it never gets old easily one of my new favorite marvelcomic book movies and movies in general i you havent seen it yet watch it nowi promise it will not disappoint and if your a fan of comic book movies or movies in general this is one of the better ones that have come out his year,comedy
marvel has repeatedly toyed with ways to riff on their overblown antics they had ant man last year where he shrunk and all that and the all important fight to save the world took place among toys they had tony stark in the last iron man as screwy actor struggling with superhero machinery that blew up in his face the first thor of course with the savior hero washing down in real life from his astral world above and shown to be a big jockthats what they do here a superhero narrator plowing his way through the superhero plot while commenting on the absurdity of tropes its mostly matter of engineering gags from that point hes hideous looking rides to the big showdown in a taxi he has only 12 bullets misses a few times in close range then gets a miraculous shot hes only incidentally fighting against evil and would rather chew his own hand out of a bear trap than join the goodytwoshoe xmen hes basically this snarky dude who was plopped inside a marvel movie and is fighting his way out of being a superhero but meanwhile enjoys the mischief possible with playing the partfar from novel but they decided to keep the kids out this time so we have a bit of personality a stoner imagination his flatmate slash sidekick is an old lady and they get to toke together unlike an avengers walmart you dont get the sense that its corporate wash aimed at everyone and no one in particular my favorite bit was probably the relationship with the girlfriend love as unabashedly chasing each other outside norms its not as easy to seduce that twinkle in the eye out of actors as it looks,comedy
this is a great action comedythe action scenes are great and also very funny the 4th wall breaks are amazing just like you would expect from i never read or watch anything about before but after watching this movie i learned the most important things about him in a funny and exciting waythe movie begins off great the first action scene is well made and it has some good jokes in it is able to make you laugh while you are caught up in the action and actually paying a lot of attention to the movie,comedy
is a classic one of the highest grossing movies ever it will be one for the ages telling the origin story of wade w wilson a mercenary turned antihero who uses his raunchy and offcolor humor along with his fourthwall breakingif theres an rrated movie thats hilarious and action packed than you should definitely watch itits also sortoff a love story too because has to safe his fianc vanessa from the evil scientist francis ajax who tortured wade wilson in the weapon x program to cure is cancer wade gets rid of his cancer but he becomes horribly disfigured causing him to wear the red costume and dub the name deadpool,comedy
love this movie thats not an instruction this movie is obnoxious and insulting vulgar and violent puerile and pornographic stupidly sadistic and self deprecating in the most hilarious of non pc ways just great top gears hamster once described a supercar pegani zonda as something a ten year old boy would drawdream of in a good way or something along those lines this is the movie version of that car imagine a plethora of foul language impossible action moves sexual references comedic non life threatening results from ultra violence and some naked lady boobs n bums everything that the inner ten year old in every bloke secretly wants in a movie this movie is that movie awesome dudepart of the opening sequence sets the tone when looks straight to camera and asks i know what youre thinking whos balls did i have to fondle to get my very own movie i cant tell you but it rhymes with pulverine and hes got a nice pair of criminals down undervisually its great the matrix style opening car crash sequence is fantastic and the cgi throughout is spot on although i had watched london has fallen just before so my cgi acuity bar may have been lowered so the script is great the casting is great the action is great the acting is great the directing is great the production is great it is visually great what have i missed oh yeah theres a love story somewhere in there also apparently im sure its great but what does a ten year old boy in a grown mans body care about that im sure the girls will love it alsolove this movie it is an instruction it should be a lawaside from all that great to see gina carano angel dust she deserves more hollywood action roles if you didnt know she is a proper hard ass look her up and shes gorgeous ta boot yes im a fan also rr seems to have found a role that fits his erm acting stylebut what im most curious about the post firehorror makeup that rr wears under the mask to me and maybe it is just me but its the spitting image of a younger if less healthy looking john malkovichwere they aiming for that ,comedy
review this has to be one of the best films that i have seen this year the mixture of comedy and action worked extremely well and ryan reynolds was the perfect choice for wadethe director didnt rely on cgi or fancy camera tricks to tell story which was refreshing for this time and age and especially as it is a superhero coming from the marvel camp the depth to the characters was spot on and the whole cancer aspect gave the movie a meaning even though the jokes were coming thick and fast right from the beginning the innuendos throughout the movie were cleverly written and i sure you have to watch the film a few times to catch them all and there wasnt too much time wasted on the love story the xmen characters colossus and negasonic teenage warhead were also a great addition to the plot and ajax was a decent villain but im looking forward to seeing someone stand toe to toe with the charismatic this movie proves that these comic book conversions for the big screen all need a bit of comedy to lighten the intense story lines like the original fantastic four not the dull remake and the ending left enough space for this extremely funny superhero to grow especially as the budget was so low and it made such a massive profit at the box office its not very often that i say this but its definitely the type of film that you can watch time and time again and im sure that the hilarious jokes will never dry up greatroundup after playing the awful green lantern and actually playing wade in the xmen origins wolverine ryan reynolds has finally come out of his downhill slump of box office failures which include ripd woman in gold selfless mississippi grind and unlikely hero and with a 2 planned to be released in 2018 along with criminal starring kevin costner and the hitmans bodyguard with samuel l jackson the only way is up for this 39 year old actor who has covered many genres since his big screen debut in 1993 in a film called ordinary magic this is the first movie directed by tim miller who supplied the visual effects for hideaway in 1995 and was creative supervisor for scott pilgrim vs the world so he hasnt had that much experience in the movie world but he certainly has started his career with a bang with 2 the goon seasons and gravel in the pipeline this movie has pushed his career to new heights and everyone is looking forward to seeing the sequel to this unique and extremely funny moviebudget 58million worldwide gross 783millioni recommend this movie to people who are into their actionadventurecomedies starring ryan reynolds morena baccarin ed skrein brianna hildebrand tj miller and gina carano 810,comedy
great movie and plot a lot of fun to watch i have to admit its funny to read the other reviews on here about how vulgar this movie is of course it is  thats what makes it so greatits gory  profane and hilarious which is what is making everything great part of what makes this movie so great is how they pushed the action together with stupid jokes from the start of this movie till the end i was laughing reynolds was the best pic for this movie by farwith reynolds playing you can tell that he was able to be himselfthe gore and gun play is great in this movie as well it never gets dull and you never see the same kill twice so far this arguably the best marvel out there,comedy
imho either you get the twisted sense of humor and see a reflectionor you think its a bunch a crap and the worst movie ever for me it was sheer high speed low drag entertainment from the opening second the action was over the top but without looking like cartoon violence the heroine is hotter than hell especially once she grows her hair outyowza yowza yowza the costar super heroes are freakin brilliant and the whole time reynolds just lays waste scene after scene several scenes i had to rewind several xs due to the popcorn and soda spitting ryan has found his new identity and no one could have pulled this off short of maybe mel gibson back in the 80s or bruce willis from the 90s congratulations to all who made this movie happen,comedy
tells the story of wade wilson who upon being diagnosed with terminal cancer then goes to a shady place with shady people ran by antagonist ajax after being cured but disfigured wade goes after ajax in order to fix his facelet me start out by saying that i had a blast watching this movie i thought the action was outstanding and found myself laughing at the films crude and sadistic hummer through out the whole runtime the movie was also incredibly fun if i was rating this movie purely on how much i enjoyed my self during it i would be giving this movie a perfect 1010 but upon analyzing it i can only recommend it as goodmy reason for only calling it good is because the movie relies mostly on its sense of hummer and upon analyzing it what i found is that if you find hummer chuckle worthy at best you will probably not like this movie nearly as much also the plot as well as antagonist are only unique when compared to other marvel movies where as if you look at as just a movie it is cookie cutterin conclusion i had a blast at this movie and any one else with that sense of hummer will but if you dont share sense of hummer you will find it only has action scenes to offer after that and when more then half of the movie is not an action scene you will be disappointed and im giving this one a 610,comedy
ryan reynolds finally plays a comic book character that we was meant for after the disaster of green lantern years ago ryan got his chance to play a role he was destined foras an rrated film and highly discussed by many about how this is not a kids movie the film is kind of tame in its uses of adult subject matter its a good story about the vigilante  antihero it has strong comedy elements it plays out realistically and it really works well as a romance too it hardly even feels like a comic book movie im hoping the atmosphere of 2 is similar morena baccarin was wonderful in the role and fits really well with ryan supporting characters of colossus and negasonic seemed forced however due to limited budget of licensing for more xmen characters most of the action sequences are fun but some people may not be able to handle them very well due to the gore humor is very active in the action scenes and the films rrated content keeps light hearted aside from some of the kills in the film the laidback feeling makes me feel that the film is suitable for some kids depending on agethis was definitely the first mustsee of 2016 is a great film all around and should be seen by everyone even if youre not a comic book person,comedy
this movie was hilarious falls in love but things happen to turn him into and he is now on the hunt  and getting tied into xmeni will say though  for a marvel film this movie isnt for everyone its rated r and yeah  i can see the reasons whyhas got to be the funniest character in the marvel universe  how he cracks a joke or mentions things in the film that are in the film stuff like thatthis movie had some epic action scenes and music that fit well and one hilarious scene in particular that will make you laugh so much that you shouldnt eat anything while youre watching itmy final thoughts in general i like every marvel film so as always i think its superb its a very funny movie but it could have done without some inappropriate scenes ,comedy
rating 85 great movie after so many fantastic xmen movies and two disappointing wolverines has finally been given his very own movie director tim millers very first movie is marvellous and with the talented actor ryan reynolds pleases expectations and lives up to its r  rating if there is one movie i recommend to watch on a valentines day it would be your friendly neighborhood characters  i can guarantee that is ryan reynolds alter ego he was born to play unlike his failure in green lantern 57 and blade trinity 65 is a hilarious violent yet lovable character who can break the fourth wall with ease  ajax and angel although these two mutants are physically dangerous and cunning they try to hard to be menacing for a movie and are considered rather weak motivated villains  xmen the xmen colossus and his trainee are great side characters whose positive motives provide a great reference to the xmen universe and some cute humour along the journey other characters vanessa purely sexy dopinder purely funny and weasel was a pure cheesy sidekickthe story line is is not original it almost like every super hero movie male hero damsel in distress a walk to a strip club it did have a more violent twist then other heroes in movies another difference was there was little themes or motives other than pure love and sex but when a movie is directed with a slick style of humour action and music it can carry its way from pointless to awesome of all marvel movies this is the most unique we will ever have and can hopefully inspire other violent heroes such as the punisher and hopefully this years suicide squad to become successful r  rated super heroes is movie produced for enjoyment unlike batman v superman dawn of justice whether is a hero or villain his movie is purely superonce again please check out my lists and ratings at riyork2 i hope this review was a valuable source,comedy
i have to admit i did chuckle a number of times during the movies onslaught of nonstop jokes however thats really all the movie has going for it the fight scenes are not involving mainly because is invincible and has a lackluster villain the love story doesnt really work either for such a violent character nor does the back story fox probably shoehorned all these elements that really drag the movie downthe superhero movie clichsbecause even though they were taking a risk in making this rrated movie they didnt want to go all out with it all those clichs really stand out against all the parts that do work because they are so lackluster it felt like no effort was put into any of those areas mentioned above compared to the effort put into making the character as good as he wasthe potential is there to make a good movie in the future with though and given the massive boxoffice success the film was im sure the sequel will be better able to focus on giving us a plot worth caring about and more innovative action sequencesaddon some of the jokes are very rapey and offputting,comedy
this title knows what its about unlike other marvel movies this movie keeps it lowscale the plot is not over the top and it keeps to its material it is not too ambitious and stays within reasonthe acting is quite good the actor that plays is so good at the act that it feels like they are almost the materialisation of the character of the comics the humour is on point it does not feel forced and it captures very well the kind of humour that the comic book character has and i am also a fan of how the character recognises that he can not be a hero which makes him feel a lot more human unlike a lot of superheroes that just jumps into this large responsibility by the fact that theyre powerful in itselfthe action and choreography is quite good and the action scenes all were appropriate however i must warn for all viewers that the movie is quite bloody and contains a lot of sex scenes and even involves decapitation and depicts characters being shotmy only complaint is that i am confused as to the role of this movie and how it might play into the other marvel universesi would recommend it as it is good for what it is and deviates from the typical comic book movie genre,comedy
if you like your movies violent and vulgar then is right for you based on the marvel comics character is about wade wilson aka a masked merc with a mouth who is on a mission to find the jerks who physically scarred him and thats about the whole movie right there is essentially one long chase movie with flashbacks thrown in to give the chase context ultimately how much you enjoy the movie simply boils down to how funny you find ryan reynolds filthymouthed portrayal of dont be fooled into thinking this is a fun superhero movie for the whole family this movie has a hard rrating and deservedly so while i personally found a lot of the violence nudity and language unnecessary we live in a dayandage where so many are desensitized to these things i know im in the minority bottom line if you enjoy movies that are as rude crude and socially unacceptable as possible is right for youi give a 5 out of 10,comedy
was an okay movie it was definitely not great as many would suggest it was very funny but that is literally all that it had going for it the film was extremely anticlimactic  i found myself bored midway through also the xmen reference was so forced i laughed at it was a filler movie  something to entertain superhero film fans while they wait for the next blockbuster i am a bit disappointed in myself for spending 499 renting it ondemand the film felt like something you rent while hungover and  even then  thats not helpful because you still wake up wondering why you have a boring movie in your lineup i would highly suggest that anyone looking for superhero fun go see xmen apocalypse which is an awesome film,comedy
i didnt know what to expect with this alternative superhero movie the trailer for it was appealing and i read it was getting good reviews and making a lot of money so i was looking forward to what this next entry from marvel would had to offer basically in new york city former special forces operative wade wilson ryan reynolds works as a mercenary he meets and becomes romantically attached to escort vanessa carlysle gothams morena baccarin a year later wade proposes to vanessa and she accepts but he suddenly collapses at hospital he is diagnosed with terminal cancer vanessa remains by his side but he fears losing her wade is approached by a recruiter jed rees from a secret program he offers him an experimental cure for his cancer wade initially refuses but he later leaves vanessa and undergoes the procedure at a laboratory wade meets and instantly resents ajax ed skrein and angel dust gina carano wade is injected with a serum designed to awaken latent mutant genes then he is subjected to weeks of torture to trigger mutation with no success ajax who wade finds out his real name is francis freeman reveals the true purpose of the experiments is to create superpowered slaves for wealthy customers wade does develop healing abilities but his face and skin are severely disfigured he escapes his chamber but is impaled by ajax and left inside the laboratory that is burning down wade survives and returns to the city he wants to reconnect with vanessa but he is unable to come to terms with his appearance and stays away with some help from his best friend weasel tj miller he decides to hunt down ajax who claimed he could cure his disfigurement wade becomes a masked vigilante using the nickname and he moves in with elderly blind woman al leslie uggams follows a number of leads from various syndicates to find ajax he eventually locates her causing chaos on the expressway cornering ajax wade demands a cure for his disfigurement but he is interrupted by two xmen piotr rasputin aka colossus stefan kapicic and ellie phimister aka negasonic teenage warhead brianna hildebrand they have been trying to recruit ajax escapes is handcuffed to colossus but he cuts his own arm off to escape his arm regenerates overnight now knowing that wade is alive ajax goes to weasels bar and finds out about vanessa weasel tells wade that she is in danger but he is still unable to face her and she is already kidnapped wade is told by ajax and angel dust to meet with them on a decommissioned helicarrier in a scrapyard convinces colossus and negasonic to join him to confront ajax and angel dust colossus and negasonic battle angel dust while battle many henchmen and eventually engages ajax in close combat after the big battle the equipment holding the helicarrier upright is accidentally destroyed colossus who was knocked out wakes and takes negasonic and angel dust to safety successfully saves vanessa and ajax is subdued he reveals there is no cure for wades disfigurement colossus urges to be a true hero and spare ajax but kills ajax he turns to vanessa and removes his mask to reveal his disfigured face she is angered that he left her but she still loves and accepts him they reconcile and kiss also starring karan soni as dopinder michael benyaer as warlord and stan lee as strip club dj reynolds is a good choice as the wisecracking anti hero who calls himself a bad guy going against the worse guys his breaking of the fourth wall sending up the clichs and injokes about him knowing he is in a superhero movie works well he even jokes about his unfortunate performance as the green lantern this xmen spin off is good fun it makes you laugh in the right places the romantic element is alright you really root for the vulnerable and naughty masked mutant the explosive chase and fight sequences and some black comedy violence combined with the special effects are great overall it is a most worthwhile fantasy action adventure good,comedy
i do not honestly see what is to like about this movie as a comic book fan and open to the occasional comicbased movie i was absolutely disgusted with this one i do not understand how this tired film even was considered for the golden globes it just boggles my mind entirely granted ryan reynolds is supposed to be comedy relief in most of his movies he failed to come up to that level in this one when i was forced to watch this by my older brother he loved itas did his own 13yearold daughter for the record with the amount of strong language and violence in this movie and i usually have no problem with violence or language in a movie particularly rrated ones i wouldnt have allowed her to see it even with parental supervisionthe way i see it ryan was just phoning it in on this one i am partial to the occasional breaking of the fourth wall with an actoractress addressing the audience but this was absolutely ridiculous if he wasnt in literally every single scene he was addressing the audience there were so many inappropriate jokes in here even for my liking that it would have driven a high school boy into a frenzy and lets not forget the channeling of ferris bueller in the very end that was entirely unnecessary i had such a hard time watching this movie that it was amazing that i did probably the best word to describe this waste is juvenile if that much it was the worst two hours of my life that i cant get back i have seen many comicbased movies in my time but this one was probably the worst do not sit down and watch this you will get a headache andor feel nauseous,comedy
when was the last time you enjoyed watching an r rated superhero movie if youre thinking a movie like the blade series youre right now here comes a movie based on a character in the xmen film franchise that made its debut in the horrible xmen origins wolverine played by ryan reynolds and now has his own franchise movie kids wouldnt like this movie since it has crude jokes excessive violence some nudity and lots of bad language for adults they will love this movie it feels more like a comedy than an action movie and it shows i missed it in the theaters when it was a big hit and finally saw it on digital hd as well as numerous times on hbo and bluray this movie saved ryan reynolds career after his dismal performance in green lantern this movie is to marvelfox what wonder woman is to the dceu a huge improvement,comedy
a great movie i had no clue who was until i seen a poster of him on a bus and im like what the hell is that spider mans brother i always find superhero movies to be boring not enough action and their code not to kill then arrives turning enemies inside out blood and core and profanity the anti hero society needstypo rules cause me to space out some words i would of like to see dead pools team he has in the comic books,comedy

marvel has delivered yet another blessing to audiences around the world with their hilarious antihero movie in 2016 the movies main characters are ryan reynolds as the antihero and ed skrein as ajax the villain in the original comics is first introduced into the marvel universe as a hitman named wade wilson he learns that he has cancer and is tricked into participating in the secret canadian weaponx program after going through a procedure to reproduce the healing factor of wolverine his the experiment fails and his character evolves into the comic schizophrenic antihero that stole the hearts of marvel fans across multiple generations the movie doesnt follow the comic book origin story but it follows the general story line enough that diehard fans wont reject the movie ryan reynolds nails original persona as the merc with the mouth and the rest of the scripting was brilliantly suited for the situations that would find himself in situations where breaks the fourth wall or times where he talks to an audience that doesnt exist in the movies universe is his main trope and one of the many reasons why he is marvels most loved character personally i felt the movie was cleverly structured in a way that will allow marvel studios to build off of the easter eggs in the movie that hint to other superheroes and create mashups of and other characters in marvels inventory if doesnt appear in more movies in the future then there will be many unhappy fans that will demand another movie i am one of those people but i wouldnt express my anger on twitter or facebook or any other social media because i know that im not the absolute diehard fan that most people in the fandom seem to be to these people is not just a simple character but the pinnacle of a comic book cults hierarchynumerous spin off series were made in the past that overplayed the characters nature and made him more ridiculous than deadly for the appeal of children and with the announcement of the movies release fans throughout the world dawned their best cosplay of these cosplayers have had decently good costumes of the childish but the costume ryan reynolds received truly fulfilled his childhood dream of becoming i myself am a fan but i didnt have much information on the movie before i suggested to my family and now i regret asking them to watch it there was a suggestive scene in the movie that was nsfw and made the atmosphere really awkward i thought oh wow i had no clue that this movie was going to have a scene like this so there i sat shrinking further and further into my seat as the sounds of hot love echoed through the theater after the movie was no better because the first question anyone asks is so did you like the movie of course i wanted to lie and say that the movie wasnt good just because of that scene but i couldnt bring myself to do it because that sort of closed minded thinking just wasnt right the rest of the movie had me at the edge of my seat the entire timein all the movie was one of the best hero movies of recent years the acting and cinematography as well as the comedic timing of raunchy jokes were all important and expertly executed to make the movie into the success that it turned out to be thus is my most highly recommended movie to date,comedy
i walked into this movie with the hopes that foxmarvel would make this movie not be like the trash fire that was baraka from mortal combat you all know what i am talking about i walked out with a huge grin on my face because i couldnt stop laughing the entire time this was the best way i could have seen foxmarvel apologize for their last attempt at the titular antihero firstly ryan reynolds was terrific in the role we all knew he would be but this time he actually showed us that we were right about it the costume was also great as well the main thing i liked about it was his eyes and how they actually showed some expressions and feelings while he was wearing it the story however was very simple while i am not trying to complain about it for it probably would have taken away from the movie if it was more complicated but it was a very simplistic story with the same thing as you would see in most movies these days however you will be completely distracted from that with really cool action scenes and hilarious scenes this movie really is hilarious and you wont stop laughing throughout the entire film the action scenes are also really clever this movie isnt just chop chop here shoot shoot there but it actually goes about how would actually handle it there is a scene in the movie where he chops off a guys head and kicks it like a soccer ball into another guy now that is really cool overall this movie while it has its faults you dont ever notice them because of the humor action scenes and the amazing performance by ryan reynolds,comedy
over the past twenty years the comic book film has exploded and become one of the most profitable and highly regarded new genres in the world of entertainment thanks in no small parts to breakout hits like x men or spiderman we now see 2 3 4 or more highprofile comic adaptations released yearly and because of the high standard set by those early films audiences now look forward to each new release knowing that most not all but most will be of a high quality with talented filmmakers and gifted actors bringing their favorite characters to life and for the foreseeable future this trend shows no signs of slowing downbut one character has been owed his due a character that has long been a fan favorite for readers of marvel comics and fans of twisted comedy a character that had previously been introduced not long ago in another film that failed to properly utilize his trademark wit sarcasm and fourthwall breaking humor i am of course referring to the merc with a mouth himself since being unsuccessfully introduced in xmen origins wolverine fans have been clamoring for a proper reboot of the beloved freakshow in the hopes for a tale truer to his comic book roots and in 2016 their wishes were granted in the absolutely depraved and subversive new origin story in every way a fantastic reintroduction to the character the film delivers the laughs gasps and thrills that fans had been praying forryan reynolds stars as wade wilson a mercenary who spends his days roughing up bad guys for money with the help of his friend weasel tj miller after falling in love with a beautiful prostitute named vanessa morena baccarin things are finally looking up for wade until he learns hes dying from a barrage of cancerous organs that will kill him in mere months feeling he has nothing else to live for and not wanted to ruin vanessa by forcing her to watch him slowly die he enrolls in an experimental program that promises to help him unlock mutations within his own body while he does mutate and gain the ability of superhuman healing it comes at a price prolonged torture and the brutal scarring of his body by the deranged francis ed skrein now wade adopts the persona and becomes a psychopathic murderous antihero who also seems to have gained the ability to become aware hes a movie character who seeks vengeance for his maiming while also trying to work up the courage to reconnect with his lovemuch like the comics a big part of the appeal is the ridiculous and comically brutal tone of the film combined with the savage fourthwall shattering meta humor of the character writers rhett reese and paul wernick brilliantly credited as the real heroes here perfectly capture the spirit of the comics and the character and populate the screen time with dozens upon dozens of bloody battles mindwarping inside jokes and nods to the audience that make us feel like were part of the action its just so much fun seeing doing something ridiculous like shredding a bad guy apart with his swords before looking directly at the audience and cracking a joke about the insanity of whats happening or to see wade joking about how badly they botched his character the last time around the layers and layers of subversion and selfawareness are a refreshing turn here especially as the tendency now is for comicbook adaptations to take themselves way too seriously this is perfectly complimented by director tim millers kinetic visual storytelling he knows how to stage a scene nail a gag and wow the audience and i cant wait to see what he does in the future as a filmmaker its a shame he wont be back for the recently announced sequel but i wish him the bestthe performances are also a key part of the puzzle reynolds who im generally indifferent about defines the role of our deranged anti hero with such a giddy joy you cant help but love him he nails both the drama and humor of the character in a way that can only be described as aweinspiring and his passion is obvious in every frame baccarin best known to genre fans for her role in the cult masterpiece firefly shines as wades feisty and somewhatcrazyherself love interest vanessa shes a joy on screen and her chemistry with reynolds makes her an invaluable part of the ensemble miller is witty fun as weasel a kindasorta friend of wades who gets roped into the story a few times hes always ready with a clever quip or a dismissive joke and is great fun ed skrein makes for a wonderfully devious villain and supporting roles by brianna hildebrand and stefan kapii as two of professor xaviers xmen who are sent to recruit are just a blast particularly hildebrands negasonic teenage warhead who is something of a breakout character here an easilyannoyed teen who steals the show in every scene shes inin all honesty im just consistently wowed by how well the film turned out and by how much of a risk the studio took here its a brutally violent wildly sexual and proudly profane exercise in complete and utter insanity an rrated superhero flick though dont call him a superhero that refuses to conform to any expectations most studios would balk at such a concept we should be so thrilled that not only did fox take the chance but that it also proved to be such a big hit its a nearperfect adaptation of the beloved and brutal character and i cant wait for part twoi give a nearperfect 9 out of 10 pop some chimichangas in the microwave crack open a beer sit back and prepare to laugh,comedy
this movie is so funny with many easytocatch one liners and a re occurring theme of the 4th wall being broken down ryan reynolds is the perfect actor for the dirty and funny superhero the story is based off a love story and how important looks are when a gambler gets terminal cancer and wants to be cured for the love of his life when he is cured his face gets deformed and he gets powers ad uses them to avenge his face and look normal again he goes out to find this man and when he finally does he is stopped by other superheros who use their powers only for good as goes out to find his nemesis he learns many things about how looks arent anything in love and if you love someone enough appearances wont matter,comedy
i give this a 10 outta 10 because ryan reynolds and this was the best role for him i enjoy i cant wait for a sequel i hope its just as good as this one i dont care about anyone elses review of this movie i have the video game and the movie was just as good as the game i love marvel comics i wish i was as cool as hes probably the coolest and laid back superhero in the world i absolutely was entertained by his backstory his backstory was the best i dont want to spoil it for everyone but this movie has comedy action and everything i need his costume because i think its really rad and i love the color red,comedy
this movie proved that you dont need hundreds of millions of dollars to make a enjoyable and great movie after it final hit the cinemas excitement about this was huge is the funniest and most entertaining strip character movie had some holes in it but it was nothing to care about everything how we get to know him before and after was well edited and put together jokes arent the smartest but they are just the one when you hear them you feel entertained as character is funny as hell but at the same time so loving and sarcastic but most of all violent movie just portrayed his power and capabilities reynolds was perfect choice for the role as he is very funny and tends to joke all the time but in the same time looks strong then his girl get kidnapped and he must get to her and save her while taking everybody that made him like that and showing who is the boss it classic story of battle between two guys only that they are both in kind of way bad two characters that helped him get to her are well played granny and are perfect you just love them movie was funny violent entertaining well acted and gci is amazing just amazing despite all that waiting and finally making the movie that had medium budget it was a great hit 44,comedy
ok before i begin i have to mention i was in the cinema with my three best friends and on actual valentines day so there were a lot of couples in the theater and no neither of us was drunk and yes were all big comic fans since we can read d mentioned thati must report the whole cinema was in laughter almost the entire timeand so were we  after reviewing the movie the second time home alone i still grinned at some parts and loled even here and there soooo what im trying to say is it may be not the greatest movie ever produced but its quite a rare one of its kind and please since you are reading this and havent seen it already please do not watch it alone gather some friends bring some beer or equivalent beverage d  and have a great time watching it i promise that ps do not i repeat do not watch it with your parents because some dude said its a great action hero movie d 3,comedy
tells the origin story of wade wilson a former member of the military who now takes on justice under his own terms as a mercenary wade falls in love with a hooker and as his relationship with her flourishes he ends up getting diagnosed with terminal cancer in a move of desperation he accepts the offer of a mysterious man that operates in a clandestine lab who promises him not only the cure of his disease but also greater powers in an unfortunate incident in this secret lab with one of the operatives he ends up with a disfigured face however he also ends up with the power of fast healing and regeneration making him almost invincible dp now faces a life of almost immortality but plans to seek revenge to the man that disfigured him and also fights to get back the love of his life dp teams up with x men residents colossus who spends the entire movie trying to convince dp to join the xmen and negasonic teenage warhead a mutant who comes off as darialevel cold but snarky teenager but ends up being a real powerful and reliable sidekick as a character is a blatant mix of wolverine and spiderman but augmented and then with sarcasm and selfawareness sprinkled all over dp is really your typical marvel flick but what it has going on for it comes thanks to the nature of dp himself marvel certainly had some fun with him as he constantly talks to the audience and breaks the fourth wall theres also a lot of real life pop culture references several of which take jabs at ryan reynolds himself a recurring joke across the film for example is poking fun at ryans old role as the green lantern from the 2011 dc movie the m rating also allows them to take some liberties on sexual and drug references swearing and violence to be honest yes there was a lot of that but still it was all very comicbookish if you ask me nothing too out there except for a few semishocker scenesi wasnt too excited about the first half of the movie i felt that they could have handled dps origin story better it didnt seem too credible in the way it was presented still it was important to follow everything as it would give context to the happenings in the 2nd half of the movie which was much more entertaining and let the character fully express himself but now under the actual motives of the plot this movie isnt very deep it is actually very straightforward on what it wants to achieve which makes it popcorn flick level good it is fun but i dont know if i will care much about it after seeing it the first timein conclusion really doesnt stray any far from a standard formula of a superhero movie and it is not going to win any outstanding awards but it at least keeps you engaged with personality and sass sometimes it works sometimes it doesnt but it is entertaining and thats what matters,comedy
ah it was hyped so high and smashed it in the box office a superhero movie thats rated r i did not go and see it in cinemas due to the fact that most seats were booked for a while and apparently kids were being taken by their parents which is not very responsible but that aside i have sort of been delaying the watching of this movie simply because i had high hopes and i did not want them to be destroyed like they usually arebefore i watched the movie i was told that was a hero but not really ive heard that he has some sort of mental disorder can be quite lewd and raw but that is what makes him so fun and relatable i knew that the movie was gory and also quite sexual given the r ratingoverall i think the movie was quite entertaining i did not know too much about the character what his motive was his back story etc so it was hard to judge or have expectations of him i think ryan reynolds was great as and i dont know if anyone could do it betteris not my favourite character but i understand him and like him to a degree people may call me a party pooper but i am not a fan of his lewdness i dont believe hes a bad character however as for the other characters i had no clue who they were i particularly liked colossus vanessa wasnt too bad either being the protagonists love interest the other characters were mediocre but i didnt necessarily hate themthe movie itself was great in terms of camera angles lighting direction etc i actually dont remember much of the music apart from the end so im not sure if thats a good or bad thing story was solid i really enjoyed the narration and the way that the story was told by starting with a hook and going back it gave the right amount of information and in such a way that makes the audience interested the whole way throughrewatch value i would rewatch it with someone who has never seen it before but its unlikely ill watch it again from start to finish seriously its quite hard to just have this movie as a background thing since it cuts and the story is important i would have rated this a 7 but ill give it to for being charming,comedy
as a huge fan of the comic books this movie was amazing to me the people who have reviewed this movie 1 star etc then they havent read the comics to understand the character some reviews say he talks too much weird giving his nickname is merc with a mouthto anyone who is a fan of the comics this movie is for you it delves into the back story of how he came about to have the powers he does along with the humour you would expect from deadpooli really hope this turns into a huge movie franchise as the stories that have already been made through the comics and any situation you can put in are endlessi also like how they threw bob into the movie for a split secondanyone who reads the comics will know bobso for such a short budget this movie gets an 810 from me im sure the next one will be even better,comedy
i didnt expect anything before i saw this film i know nothing about original comic books i was surprised in a good way while i saw this filmi saw a super hero who is completely not a typical one swearing murdering impolite and rude stupid childish nasty you barely think he looks like a super hero but actually he is only he doesnt recognize it and he is crazy indeed if you observe deeply you may find he still has his principle and boundaryit really refresh me after i saw so many typical super hero movies i totally agree with his opinion if being a super hero means let bad guy live and keep hurting more innocent people id rather being just superalso i like the romantic story between wade  vanessa they both carry heavy burden and very lucky to find each other there is not just sexthe way ryan talk to the 4th wall to make fun of xmen series movie company and even himself is just funnymost people may dislike this movie because the r rate expression and i agree too that this movie is definitely not for children or teenagers it still cant change the fact of is a well making ironic entertainment movie,comedy

after the dull and unfaithful version of in xmen origins and ryan reynolds other comic book films green lanternblade trinity and ripd i wasnt really that excited of the upcoming film even with their smart advertisements and marketingand also the studio that ruined the character is funding itbut again i was wrong the film is great the movie is fun and enjoyablewith its r rating this movie doesnt shy away with sex and bloodthe movie cuts its budget fearing of a flop but instead it was a successthe main douchebag is well portrayed and true to its comic counter part with 4th wall breaking and always cracking jokesthe other one were also great they were funny and has some comic reliefthe villain is okay but not that greatthe plot is much more pf a revenge plot was clich but because of awareness and his offensive jokes are just plain funny because ryan reynolds wants to do the character justiceit really worksthe film is a fresh breathe of air of the superhero genre cause superheroes this days are the same but gave us some laughs and new things to the table the film covers its flaws and shows its potential,comedy
i first saw this movie with the highest of expectations i quickly realized that i had placed an overabundance of faith in my friends and relatives opinions of a movie not only did my opinions of quickly change from a 810 to a 110 but my opinion of my friends and relatives was brought to the same lows i truly love comic books and have always been a massive fan of both marvel and dc but after seeing this movie i have had to take a step back and reconsider not only the genre but my faith in other people if people truly believe this movie to be anything above a 110 or anything other than a complete disaster that clearly was designed for teenage boys or 30 year olds that still live with their parents and spend the entirety of their allowance on video games and snacks i would love to have anything positive to say about this movie but if i said anything nice tha this or gave a review any higher i would be lying,comedy
what a highly stupid and terrible film not worth the money that is spent making such rubbish also  should be rated 18 not suitable for kids at alla thousand shades of terrible im actually beyond words at what people think is funny nowadays its not funny theres no point to it at all im literally on the verge of giving up watching anything anymore that is deemed as a comedy whats funny about someone running around with mindless violence looking like a burns victim best person in it was the taxi driver oh and heres a thing  since when does cancer belong in a comedydont bother wasting your time with this pap take out all sex swearing and violence and whats left  marvel should be ashamed of themselves ,comedy
i heard that the movie would be amazing that was my first empretion now that i have seen this amazing movie i now think that i am in love with a simple movie the only problem was that for some reason it felt short in some weird way what i meant is that there should be more of the humor in the last 20 minuts of the movie i dont need anymore for the middle or star in the start it was perfect and in the middle to it is simply if not the best film in the last 7 years cant wait for 2 cause this is the first time i have ever felt happy for a movie for a week after i last saw it i fell like i am adicted to this movie in some weird way in some weird way i think this movie made me just a little more happy every day for like a month loved it,comedy
i have seen a lot of marvel moviesbut im going to be honesti have never seen a marvel movie that was rated r and i was actually pretty shockedi saw the traileri never knew what was before then i saw the movie and i was dying laughing from the entire film it was way beyond any type of marvel movie howeverit was funny and action packedonly this timeit had that adult touch to itthere was lots of things a marvel movie shouldnt haveit had sexnuditylots of languagegraphic and bloody violenceand just basically any adult movie would have while i was watching the filmi learned a lot of what was before i even read the comics i learned that he wasat first a cancer patientthen he went to some secret facility to cure his cancerbut insteadthey were tortured him until he couldnt feel any pain althoughhe has done more than avoid painhe basically became immortal he couldnt feel painlike literally nothing at all he was an ugly disfigure who just wanted to be normalso thats why he wears the red suitwhich he madehe wanted his face fixed and his woman backbut some bad guys take his girl and now he faces themhe gets his girl backbut they dont fix his face so he lives the life as a person who doesnt care about anyonebut kills the people that mess with him and his womani also learned that he is part of the xmen movieseven though he doesnt join the xmen in his movie he is also a loud mouthwhich makes his enemies mad so yeahi learned a loti had a lot of laughs from the inappropriate humor and also the bloody actionbecause i just love action when people are fighting and i just love this movie and it was a really great start up for a 2016 marvel film,comedy
ive waited for this movie for a long time and went to see it in cinema when it came im so in love with it ive watched it few days ago at home again and i felt like watching it for the first time its funny most of the jokes ill not forget for as long as i live because they were hilarious and unique ryan reynolds is perfect for the role if anybody else was in this role the movie would be no good did i mention amazing soundtrack i cant wait for 2 ryan you look amazing in the suit 333 is definitely most unique and funniest character ive ever seen and hell forever be my favorite one,comedy
is a hugely entertaining motion picture i admit that the comic universe is not something im completely familiar with and i knew nothing about the character before i saw the movie but that didnt matter because plain and simple i can tell you its beyond awesome even the opening credits are pretty darn brilliant great action and lots of humor with some metalaugh out loud moments it kept me hooked right up to the end even the scene after the end of the credits is hilarious behind the humor this movie is a dark violent flick with a sadistic heart if your looking for a great family movie to see look somewhere else because is not for kids its about a exspecial forces soldier who is now an underworld mercenary he finds a screwedup girlfriend and they have lots of kinky sex when he discovers he has cancer he accepts a shady offer from a weirdo who says he can helpthe movie is all about ryan reynolds it stands or falls on him luckily for us this was the role that ryan reynolds was born to play he nailed it cant wait for the sequel,comedy
is a marvel comdey and action movie produced by tim miller this came to theaters on febuary 12  2016 the beginning jumps straight to the action is seen riding in a taxi to find this francis person for some reason after endless amounts of killing and bloodshed you may wonder why this is happening it all starts out with wade wilson an unordinary person who works as a mercenary killing people for money he is often seen as a villain doing things only for himself or for the fun of it soon he finds the love of his life vanessa things go downhill for wade when he gets stuck with a horrible fate that changes his life foreverthe emphasis on the visuals really brings another meaning to the movie especially when breaks the fourth wall it really adds to his crazy and psychotic personality also the music is really unique it just adds to the randomness of the movie but also the intensity how certain scenes such as when hes fighting an enemy as for how the plot is edited it was different m in the beginning it dosnt start out as how everything happened but it puts audiences straight into the heat of the moment the movie transitions back and forth from certain points in the film and this was really well devised and put out the theme of this movie is anything can be accomplished if you put hard work and determination into it as we know wade lost the love of his life his charming looks and just about everything his past despite all of these factors he still seeks out revenge that he hoped was a cure for his illness also colussus achieved his goal because even though he knew was a hard headed person colussus was still persistent,comedy
it was good i enjoyed it but i cant help but feel disappointed sure its a lot raunchier than the usual marvel adaptation films more violent but at the end of the day it really just felt like yet again another marvel film not bad at all but just fine aside from the winkwink self awareness which is also trying too hard at times its really just following the same type of formula any superhero film follows the longer the film goes on the more predictable it gets and the duller it gets as well i would say that i did like it but a few hours after seeing it and i dont think its anything memorable at all for all of the talk about how shocking it was and all of the publicity its really not all that shocking at the end of the day its just like the typical marvel fare just too formulaic for its own goodsounds like i hated it but not at all i do feel like it could have been something truly truly unique but what can you do ryan reynolds is definitely the best thing about it though could have easily been too much but he hits the notes perfectly,comedy
i had been waiting for this movie since the released of its trailer because it seemed really excited as much as i want to rate this movie a 10 but lets be honest it is not that great and i will explain thisthe movie is quite short even though it is more than an hour long but the story line is really brief i felt disappointed as soon as it ended because to me it feels like i just watched an episode of a tv show also the two xmen characters are ridiculous i know that in the movie did say that they dont have enough budget to get more characters however i would prefer not having those two characters then they can add more scenes or storyline to the movieotherwise i really like the character he is really unique and different from normal antihero characters he is really humorous and i love his sarcasm  also i just realize i have a thing for antihero characters after watching this movie and jessica jones tv shows i love that this movie is also kind of helping the people that have cancer like i am not really sure how to explain this but i hope you guys get what i meanso anyway this is one of my shortest review because a lot of people are saying that my other reviews are too long for them to be patient enough to read all of them,comedy
was a lot of fun and van wilder brought the comics to a new level of adult enjoyment ryan reynolds nomination deserves a lot of credit for getting this project off the ground marketing the hell out of this relatively low budget superhero romp and diving into a fanboy character if you missed it on the big screen watch it at home after a couple beers for a good time,comedy
o gamaei kai derneinow in mere english the beloved 4thwallbreaking loudmouth merc with a tendency to poke his nose where its not supposed to but with the equivalent selfhealing to wolvie who cares lolz had his own movie despite what the mainstream audience wants and that is a major success on its ownpersonally i learnt and loved this character from the awesome mini series merc with a mouth that is still the best dp read yet and his best characteristics is awesome nerdypop culture puns breaking the 4th wall with the reader in a good way unlike millars wanted awesome suicidal fights and of course epic scenes and this movie delivers everything so what not to lovethe only flaw i could find is the omega list villains the good guys are ok but the villains not but honestly we have seen alist superhero blockbusterish movies where the villains are unknown eg avengers chitauri and if you would know the 90 of dp stories have unknown villains so that he could kill them with no consequences to the marvel universe so this is faithful to the character tooryan reynolds also nailed it giving all his love to his character and be a real dpin a nutshell dp is one of the best comic adaptation yet brings to the audience a schizophrenic character that we love and i personally hope that he will cameo at the next xmen moviesdp is gonna give it to you and he deliveredepic awesomeness  10,comedy
i loved this movie just everything about it was perfect ryan reynolds was the perfect choice for this role casting him as green lantern was a horrible idea but it seems with this role he can just have fun with it the movie starts out getting into high gear with finding francis i loved the opening intro not saying the cast at all just a brief summary of who they are playing i loved every single joke made my favorite joke would probably be the baby hand the cgi was pretty good not as good as ex machina but still pretty good the supporting cast was great it was just all perfect the cast ryan reynolds the jokes just everything,comedy
yay i waited so long for you was i a little disappointed because the budget was too small for you yes a little was i a little underwhelmed because i anticipated you for ever and day well yeah but its not your fault fox has problems budgeting movies and ryan reynolds still played you  he was still everything i hoped he would be so heres to more  for a giant empire effect in round 2ryan reynolds is awesome as  i am a late bloomer having only gotten into comics in 2010 sure i was aware of the wolverine fiasco but this crazy ass comic book character come to life was cast just right 2 can only be more money less problems as reynolds was born to play wade wilson8 of 10 stars it could have been an easy 10 of 10 for a tiny budget and that thing that fox does to xmen movies in general its kind of like holding a faberg egg and then dropping it its still amazingly beautiful it just has a scuff on it now,comedy
ryan reynolds morena baccarin ed skrein and tj miller star in this 2016 actioncomedy based on the marvel comics reynolds green lantern plays wade wilson a wisecracking exspecial forces soldier who learns he has terminal cancer soon he becomes a mutant test subject of exsoldiercriminal ajax skrein undergoing pain and torture which leaves him deformed but with healing abilities wade becomes masked antihero who is determined to find him and get revenge baccarin gotham plays wades loveinterest vanessa miller plays wades pal wiesel and creator stan lee makes an amusing cameo as usual this is a good comic booksuperhero flick that pokes fun and pays tribute to recent ones like xmen and spiderman reynolds is great in it he  baccarin have good chemistry and theres some neat actionfight sequences i recommend this especially for comic book fans,comedy
excellent movie one of the best marvel movies there is excellent acting of ryan reynolds its impossible to envision a sequel with pleasure this kind of lightning wouldnt strike twice but the first one could hardly be improved loaded with sass sex and sadistic violence is not your youngsters comicbook origin story earns every bit of its excellent rating a quality thats sure to appeal to fans weary of the macho applepieeating altruistic superheroes who buck for attention in the comicbook stables i didnt expect that i will enjoy watching this movie so much other movies about superheroes are usually made for kids and teenagers here we have bloody movie with dirty dialogues and some kind of specific black humour all together is tasty,comedy
this is a great mixture of different types of the humor which is on the edge of the fault sometimes it below the belt but it is just slightly below and i found it quite funny somebody may be stretching his the sense of humor to a certain limits with this movie from the other hand his jokes are so on time and you cannot even predict or expect that this is a very place for a joke like joking while you have somebody beaded onto your swords or jokes about the color of your pantsa story of the former soldier romantic hero and revenger who has suddenly got untreatable disease is always so touching and mostly aimed for the female audience but the producer poured here special effects and humor which finally allowed to get highest scores from all over the world,comedy
well its a great movie and really a resumption for ryan reynolds as a super hero also ryan reyonlds fits perfectly as  thats the greatest thing about this movie not to mention that i liked ed skrein as  ajax  so awesome as the villain of the movie and his assistant gina carano as  angel dust   karan soni as  dopinder  was such a special and funny part in the movie of course though the music was old but also such a great taste of music and had a great effect for whos watching the moviethe animated colossus is just awesome and i liked the comedy between him and so much the best part theres so much to talk about but i will end it here for my first review,comedy
the fact that people rated this movie a 1 or a 2 is beyond me because overall i believe this is a hilarious movie which was not intended for people who cannot see rated r movies on there own and the elderly is a new age superhero movie and is the first r rated superhero movie which captures the attention of people for many different reasons for example the darkperverted comedy action and many nude scenes during the story line meets an edgy girl with a passion for crime just like him this adds romance to the movie like marvel has never shown before the rest of the movie follows his relentless search and aggression towards francis the man who saved his life while trying to turn him into a weapon and also made him extremely ugly and deadly in the process recently i have learned that they may have canceled the making of the next fantastic 4 movie to give a higher budget this means the next movie will have more than 3 superheros,comedy
i enjoyed the movie allot great fight scenes though the scenes are very gore and not a good family movie to watch with kids the humor is hilarious and enjoyed all the jokes i liked how they added a couple of x men but not enough and when i saw the xmen school it was lonely they should have added more the movies was only an hour and a half long and i wished it was two hours long i loved when they showed the funny names at the beginning and its true as well at some parts was a bit confusing and made you feel like why would you put this scene overall its a good funny movie that you should watch with your friends,comedy
one of the most anticipated films of the year has finally come out is probably the riskiest film of the year never mind the fact that their giving ryan reynolds a second chance to play a superhero again and giving the character another chance after the bastardized portrayal given in xmen origins wolverine but this is the first mainstream r rated superhero film in a while if this becomes a success then that tells hollywood that we want more r rated superhero movies does bring the big guns or should this movie have worn the brown pants instead is a cool superhero movie that is by far one of the greatest comebacks for a character since rocky it is not the greatest comic book movie of all time nor is it the train wreck some people are calling itstars ryan reynolds morena baccarin tj miller brianna hildebrand stefan kapicic and ed skrein in the 2nd attempt at bringing the character to the big screen this time instead of a pg13 film with a sewn mouth character we get the good old that fans have grown to love in a hard r film thats balls to the walls insane not the movie to bring your mom to which one of my friends who i went to see it with did so dont listen to when he says you should but i felt as if even though it was making fun of how all superhero movies are the same it also followed that formula a bit too closely even though it changed certain things that made the plot way better and more memorablethe movie has a lot of good humor in it and is consistent even though there were points that were a bit stale they make up for it with funnier jokes and cooler fight scenes thats what i have to commend this movie on the fight scenes the fight scenes are spectacular and some of the best fight scenes in a comic book movie the direction is stellar and they all feel necessary and move the plot they were also shot especially well and since they can show anything there are no tiresome cuts and everything is shown its glorious but the action scenes could have been expanded a bit more but with the budget it had its understandable why they couldnt have a lot of great action scene but they worked around it and made some funny reasons why everything wasnt guns a blazingone of the biggest weaknesses the film has is some of the self referential jokes i dont know about you but it gets really annoying when you keep making jokes about how bad green lantern is and how dumb was in xmen origins wolverine like they made several jokes about it and it kept bugging me like crazyanother big problem was the romance scenes after the sex montage the romance works but but before that its really awkward with funny moments in it this seems like the part of the movie that will make or break the film for people this really just comes down to preference the whole movie seems as if its a film where youll enjoy it if you like certain things if you love superheroes youll love this movie if you dont youll probably hate this movieoverall is a cool action rated r superhero movie with awesome action scenes and witty one liners while certain jokes fall flat and the romance takes a while to get into id strongly recommend this movie fans of will like it a lot but id also say go see this movie so that more rated r superhero movies like this can be made this is the biggest step in taking a new direction with superhero films,comedy
i rated this one 8 stars even though im conscious that there wast much of a plot for such a high ratingi enjoyed it so much that this is it second time i rate marvel movie so high first time was the avengers the difference in the scope and budget is huge but is a proof that it matters not funny clever action packed great movie and the 4th wall thing was nice enough sometimes it felt like 16 walls the wolverine and hugh jackman can suck itthis is my favorite super herovillain now i hope they include more xmen in the next one i hope wolverine cares to show up too overrall its obvious people worked really hard and with passion to create this movie the campaign ryan reynolds led to promote the movie was very extensive and all of it paid of,comedy
going in to i really didnt know what to expect i knew it would be violent i knew it would be vulgar but what i didnt know was that i would enjoy it so so much marvel has proved once again that they are incapable of making a movie that is patently bad even the weakest among them are at least entertainingalmost feels like it shouldnt exist in the current mostly familyfriendly pool of superhero movies and yet here it is theres something very satisfying about seeing the violence that would in reality be associated with fight scenes in comic book movies when captain america throws his indestructible shield into a person very destructible face and he walks out of the movie a hero who doesnt kill i find that pretty hard to swallow this one on the other hand embraces its violence and even the grey area that vigilantes exist inryan reynolds is solid as his comic timing works really well for the character and the fun he pokes at himself throughout actually make him pretty endearing both as the character and as the actor tj miller is pretty solid though that might be more because of my affection for him as a comedian more than his performance morena baccarin is great as well but criminally underused as the love interestthat does seem to be a continuing issue with the marvel films and many action films barring the recent star wars or mad max they just dont seem to know what to do with female characters and it becomes more and more apparent with every new film though jessica jones did break away from that a little bit so its clear that strong interesting female characters arent outside the ability of these writersstefan kapicic and brianna hildebrand are great as the two xmen who show up in the movie and i hope to see more of them in upcoming x men filmsas marvel movies go isnt the best but its far from the worst its certainly opened the door to more adult comic book films coming up in future with the massive success of this one and it will be interesting to see how the next films change as a resultit would be easy to write off the jokes in the movie as juvenile and crass but they really do work in the overall tone of the film and they make it pretty unique no its not a work of comedic genius but its fun to watch and probably wont disappointgive it a watch if you feel like it,comedy
watched a superheroantihero movie with a twist marvel had created a totally different character this time from its pool of numerous heroes in comic sense is bit more extrovert and loud in manner as usually seen with spiderman in marvel universe ryan reynolds acted it superbly as and it seems his second superhero flick set to be a hitgreen lantern movie was disaster our titular protagonistantagonist kills without remorse and throughout the movieas in comics his dialogues are louder than action lots of american popculture reference thrown while creating the superb funny dialogues by characters but sometimes its not very funny for audience from other countries as india because we are unable to relatea funny action movie and tight direction by tim miller literally a remolding of new genre of superhero flicks best part is it breaks the fourth wallwhich is that character directly talks to audience and make us realize that we are watchingreading a fictional character although film seems bit low on production values in some scenes as comparatively budget of movie was just modest as compared to other superhero films a nice film and fun to watch,comedy
dishonorably discharged special forces operative turn mercenary goes on a killing rampage because of his vanity and the sideeffects of a miraculous treatment which have saved his life and made him virtually immortal with super strengthacting was fair photo direction as well good dosage on the special effects side the plot is thin and giving the result directing did a great jobunlike most marvels movie this one is not about super heroes the guy is basically a cold blooded revengeful killer nothing new here i guess its fine lets forget all of his moral flaws the guy thinks he is funny he might be if homosexual sex references are your kind of treats torture sex solicitation tons of killings drug references disfigurement unicorn sex and unrepentance are few of the example that comes to my mind when i asked myself how the hell did that thing got rated pg13 in my area giving the genre i wasnt expecting much despite it all i enjoyed myself and have been surprised with cinematography proceeds not common in the blockbuster industry not a piece of art but giving the quality of hollywood production a worthy 68 out of 10 seem fair to me please consider living the kids home or you might endup having a talk about fisting that you are not be prepare for,comedy
joke another joke and dic jokes this can summarize the plot of the movie that doesnt have a plot but covers it with tons of jokesi usually go with non expectations to comedies movies because they are usually bad but for this one i went with 100 expectations for two reasons 1its a superhero movie 2it has a very high rating almost everywherethe result boring scenes and lots of funny jokes in my opinion this movie is especially for us citizens because the jokes are based on their cultureto truly like this movie you need to reduce expectations to a 3 star movie and you will enjoy it like it was a 4 star movie or morefinally the movie is funny and has a satisfying amount of action but too long and too boring plot 710 ido yam,comedy
note is a movie in which only a certain demographic of people an enjoy it for that reason i decided to bump it down a notch on my rating is a movie about a man named wade wilson who comes across a woman named vanessa at barclub after they have been together for awhile after hooking up with her he finds out he has cancer one night at the bar he gets offered a cure by signing up for the weapon x program which goes wrong once he finds out hes been baited in to joined a testing group of maniacs this along with many other procedures turns him into who now has super strength and regeneration powers is now on a search for the man who put him through this ajax and other of his accomplices if you were expecting the original merc with a mouth your gonna get him with varying degrees of success i genuinely enjoyed the movies humor action acting and sets though however at the end even though it might be parodying other superhero movies at the end does get a bit bloated its a very funny movie that made me laugh a lot especially the fight scenessome people may be a little turned off by the love story plot but after awhile you get over it very quickly i really think this an average movie at best it did what it needed to do with average success and it should be commended for that,comedy
after waiting for this movie for years i was almost sure i would be disappointed with that high of expectations but i was really happy to be wrong the movie was full of hilarious references of pop culture and classic movies but the best ones was selfreferences of ryan reynolds they implemented breaking of the 4th wall masterfullythe movie was both an origin story and a revengerescue story at the same time it had a unique telling and it was effective ryan reynolds was great ed skrein was great all the cast felt genuine and they had great synergythere was some tweaks and some characters were different than their comic book counterparts but as a fan of comics more than being fine with it i loved the said tweakshttpwwwvashikaransadhnacomgenuinevashikaranspecialist,comedy
the goofy rrated superhero story has a very cool opening sequence that has been shown repeatedly in the trailers then a lot of talking after all this is an origin tale ryan reynolds pushes the limit of his comedic ability working to get jokes some hit some are just over the top the fourth wall breaking was fun every once in a while and the awareness of the complications of reboots spinoffs and production company franchise struggle over these money machines will land with the movie nerds who paid attention and go over the head of the regular movie goerthe action was top notch though i always want more fighting and explosions and car chases the fact that there were only really two scenes reflects the limited budget this superhero got as he isnt one of the most popular heroes i do think the stock will rise especially if this movie is a smash at the box office the final fight scene had some cool action beats but was interrupted often by the silly banter of the protagonist there was an unfortunate montage of action that would have benefited from another actual scene of hunting check out more of this review and others at swillikycom,comedy
the more i heard about this the better it sounded i knew ryan reynolds had potential but that isnt always enoughwas it interesting im glad that for a origin story that its not told in a linear way the characters view of the world and how they interact with each other was done well i did think the xmen aspect seemed jammed in2 out of 3was it memorable the fight scenes while some were a bit fast on the editing were great the humor was spot on though much of it was so today that a few years from now will seem dated compared to guardians of the galaxys humor which wasnt as good but will survive longer2 out of 3was it entertaining the acting was fine the special effects werent exactly top notch but adequate and even the music fit the mood well25 out of 3starting with 1 because 1  2  2  25  75 ill give it an 8 but it seems right on the bubble most of the criticisms are nitpicks for a comic book movie this is what to aim for,comedy
starring gods perfect idiot in the role he was born to play jampacked with rrated naughtiness from beginning to end and riding high on the strength of its raunchy humour selfreferential winks  pop culture references tells the story of the odd unpredictable loudmouthed sarcastic  delightfully deranged antihero in an unabashedly freewheeling manner is continually refreshing on more levels than one and is the funniest superhero flick to surface on the silver screen since marvels guardians of the galaxy but i cant help but feel slightly dissatisfied for this film could have been so much more than what it settles for in the final printthe story of follows wade wilson a former special forces operative turned mercenary whose plan of settling down and spending the rest of his life with the girl he loves goes outside the window when he learns that he has terminal cancer after being approached by a mysterious recruiter who offers a cure to his diagnosis he takes part in a human experimentation program that bestows him with accelerated healing capabilities but also leaves him severely disfigured managing to survive the ordeal wilson adopts the persona of a masked vigilante and with his self healing powers  twisted sense of humour starts looking for the people who nearly destroyed his lifedirected by an overpaid tool in what is actually his directional debut the films wicked opening credits clearly indicate the kind of movie it aspires to be and then follows it up with an ingeniously choreographed gleefully violent  exuberantly witted first act that also turns out to be its self defeating moment for the film is never able to attain that same height again for the remainder of its runtime tim millers direction is quite impressive for a first feature but his inexperience also shows up when he allows the film to go into the overkill mode and is clueless about when  where to draw the line and although the story hurls one witty line after another not all of them work out in the films favourthe first act introduces the eponymous character to the audience in flamboyant style and effectively establishes his origins eccentric wit  modus operandi but the rest of the narrative is simply a downhill journey the writers stay faithful to the sardonic tone of its source material the screenplay brims with playful profane  parodic remarks there is sufficient meat on the titular characters arc and it follows an interesting trajectory as well but its middle  final acts fail to duplicate the effervescent zest of its opening segment and apart from there are no compelling characters in the movie many of its oneliners are hilarious  inventive but a few of them become repetitive  wearisome after a whilecoming to the performances the cast comprises of ryan reynolds a hot chick a british villain the comic relief the moody teen  a cgi character with only reynolds leaving a lasting impression reynolds rendition of wade wilson both in  out of the suit makes it one of those perfect actorcharacter marriages and it is actually difficult to imagine someone else playing this role with such remarkable finesse morena baccarin  tj miller play wilsons girlfriend  best friend respectively and are runnersup in the acting department but their work is still no match to reynolds input for the latter carries the entire film on his own ed skrein does well with what hes given while the character of colossus is plainly annoyingon an overall scale is an endlessly enjoyable thoroughly entertaining  downright rambunctious rollercoaster ride that delivers on its promise of bringing the merc with a mouth to cinematic life in his unrestrained unadulterated  undiluted form makes blatant use of adult humour throughout its runtime and even manages to subvert the superhero formula to an extent but its attempt to defy the norm  follow an unorthodox route only happens on a superficial level for beneath its surface lies the same predictable  formulaic narrative that weve seen many times before opening on an extremely promising note but losing its way in the middle works only because of ryan reynolds swashbuckling showstealing  effortlessly charismatic performance and while it had the ingredients to separate itself from the pack it isnt as unconventional as it appears to be,comedy
this movie was fantastic the plot was ingenious and i was rooting for colossus and negasonic teenage warhead as they kicked ajaxs a word the film explores origin and his anger at francis aka ajax it also explores wade wilsons anger toward ajax when his girlfriend vanessa is kidnapped ryan reynolds was the perfect and emitted such a positive vibe that i cant get over the fact that he had the role of the 4th wall was obliterated and the jokes were very funny i was impressed with the cast as they knew their character and could in one way or another relate to himher the references to pop culture and the jokes in general were hysterical for example is having sex with his girlfriend around chinese new year and she asks wade what he wants and he says year of the dog the action was at marvels best trumping that of even avengers age of ultron there was so much going on that you couldnt look away from the screen the movie kept me fully entertained and i was not bored for a nanosecond i especially liked the song played prior to the main fight x gon give it to ya as it radiated within it and was the best choice for part of the soundtrack the best part by far is the final showdown between and ajax as it wasnt only a hero vs villain fight but also a fight to prove who was the better person with the better power ajax couldnt feel pain at all this film was a perfect homage to the character of deadpoolwade wilson although this is a comic book movie this movie is rated a minimal r so dont take anyone younger than 14 and even then consider the choice deeply in conclusion this film was as the title says the ultimate experience the cast was well thought out and the film was treated with love and effort despite a budget of 58 million the film was excellent and made 150 million on opening weekend alone this film also has a lesson  no matter how much you suffer you can do great things in life despite the torturous pain wilson went through to become he defeated ajax and saved his fianc this triumph over tragedy lesson will always stay with me in my heart this movie was the best comic book movie and i would definitely recommend this to anyone over 14 years of age,comedy
what if i told you that 20th century fox made a good superhero movie and not only thatbut a good superhero origin movie you would be surprised right yeah thats right we are talking about we all know that origin movies are hard to be done we are all tired about power and responsibility and nobody cares about batmans parents anymore thats all old news already what fox made not only manages to capture the essence of story all that he went through all the suffering but in an entertaining way get it its not about what they made its about how they seem to give context about all the action and even though flashbacks are nothing in the way of innovation they presented it in a way that feels refreshing dont get me wrong i know that it isnt a 100 accurate representation of the character but its not far from this if you are a fan from comics and you were holding back for being afraid to get disappointed you should definitely give it a shot and if you arent yet a fan but you are trying to get into the comics this movie will get you an idea of what to expect besides if you think you are ready for some gory funny fourthwallbreaking action go for it it shouldnt disappoint you,comedy
i was pleasantly surprised by this movie i went in with low expectations as i do with all movies but i came out of this movie fully entertained and impressed ed skrein did a good job as the villiani do that in quotes as reference to the movie the movie pokes fun at the typical superhero movie not only did it provide laughs but it had a very interesting story line i wasnt too familiar with the character but the movie did a good job building the character great acting pacing settings and style i kept rewinding just to hear the funny lines you dont have to be a superhero fan or know about to like this movie watch this movie if you want a good laugh and great story,comedy
is a great superhero comedy flick that stars of one of marvels popular characterthis movie is good cause it doesnt setup a future sequel but does have so many references to xmen and pop culture through jokes from the merc with a mouthryan reynolds killed as so thus the whole cast in the film who did a great job in their respective charactersthe action scenes is very awesome and it is really funnythe story is plain and simple but because of the main characteryou will still love this moviei love to watch this movie cause its awesomefunny end credit scenes,comedy
i have read comics i have played the game and i have seen him being adapted in some animated movies and series i have done all this after xmen originswolverine there was a severe outrage about the portrayal of in that movie and i had to dig deeper to understand the reason for this outrage and i understood the character and bio in short is merc with a mouth so why did they sow his mouth shutmoving on i think the movie is so perfect because the producers didnt restrain the director and writers from doing anything and the director and writer did a bang on job in making this movie the plot is simple that is why the narration is to and fro most of the references were understandable and extremely well placed within the movie me being an indian missed some so i had to google some of them and i laughed after understanding them the dialogues were bang on character development unexpectedly was therenow to the acting i suppose side characters are not even necessary because you have ryan reynolds playing it feels like he was born to be and after knowing all the hardwork he has done to get this movie made and when you see his portrayal of the mercwithamouth satisfaction is guaranteedall in all for me this is the most perfect adaptation of a comic book character and every movie should be made like this i am not saying every movie should be made rrated but it should be made as the comic book writers had made them and as the readers had grown with the characters one other plus point is that i think this movie was made as a standalone movie after the success the sequels are being planned making a movie to support a franchise always ruins it as a movie itselfyou know what i am talking about chiki chikaaaaaa,comedy
the movie was great but there was a huge mistake that has also appeared in xmen origins wolverine movie where he is turned into weapon xi and he tries to kill wolverine so what is it does he travels back in time or is it some multi verse or is he in some other dimensionthe movie was great but the powers of were extracted from wolverine so how can he be normal first and then mutate moreover according to the xmen the mutation generally occurs when a person is a teen but in this film they are trying to trigger the mutation which is one in a trillion possibilityif you dont believe me go to the links  httpsyoutubetznxqmrihm httpsyoutubeb5ksardpqsthe movie is irrelevant but good action sequences,comedy
ok first of im gonna start by stating this is my first review so if its a bad review thats why anyways does a lot of things right but also does a lot things bad so for this review im gonna make a list of things it did right and a list of things it did bad things it did right the jokes fit right in and were actually a lot more funny than i thought they were going to be the action sequences were great and felt really comic book like which is a good thing because of how well they were donethe fourth wall breaks i know this technically would fit under the jokes section but the were so good it deserved its own categoryok now onto the bad there was only two major action sequences i know this is because of the low budget but for the common movie goer who might not know this might be a little disappointed the sad scenes and the comedy scenes ok the only reason why i dont like these scenes is because of how they were done it just didnt feel right when they switched from a sad scene to a comedic scene because it made the sad scenes less sad or made the comedy scenes less funny some of the best jokes were spoiled in the trailers which made them less funny the main villains powers werent very clear for example when makes ajax crash his motorcycle ajax is able to make an escape even though his legs definitely shouldve been broken also when stabs ajax the shoulder he is able to still drive his bike i know we find out ajax doesnt feel pain but that still doesnt explain why hes able to do these things the clich super strong villain that doesnt talk much i know this isnt worst thing ever but for a film thats so self aware it shouldve at least addressed this overall i would give a 7510 but imdb only allows whole numbers so i have to give it a 710,comedy
this movie is pretty weird in the entire movie there are only 9 characters with more than 1 line i think that made the movie feel very small scale and hollow the humor is hit and miss my salon laughed a few times however the joke the crowd found the most entertaining was just a simple steal from the classic monty python and the holy grailapart from himself the cast is bleak forgettable villain who never really felt threatening and the rest are just generic and boringits just pretty mediocre nothing great really if you really like superhero movies you will probably find this movie great however it really brings nothing new to the table just a basic superhero origins story with some added in humor and 4th wall breakingaction scenes  510 humor  610 story  310 predictability 310 very much so characters  410,comedy
i had never heard of and im certainly not a fan boyof the super hero comics i liked the look of the trailer so went to see it its very graphic violent bad language sexual scenes etc a film not for prudes but it does seem to work and i found it both funny and entertaining ryan reynolds really excels in the roleis a sort of self aware antihero cool bad guy who underneath is a sort of good guy hes also aware hes a comicfilm character and talks to the audience  which surprisingly works too the general plot is pretty typical for the genre but reynolds as is what makes it stand out and is virtually continuously funnymy only mild criticism is i think they could have made the plot stronger and enhanced the sufferingdevelopment of the character id give it 7510 as an action packed unusual superhero romp that will entertain and amuse for the entire 108minutes id also give it a 910 for being original and different a film that is worth paying to see,comedy
i dont believe that any so called industry expert film fan or comic book loving super nerd couldve or wouldve predicted the absolutely mind boggling success of over the last weektaking the world by storm shattering boxoffice records and garnering both critical and audience acclaim the red suit wearing marvel antihero with a motor mouth like no others journey to the big screen has therefore been a bigger event than anyone dared to have dreamedat the time of writing holds an 84 approval rating on review aggregate website rotten tomatoes and an incredible 87 rating on imdb good for 44 on the famed top 250 movies of all time and the same rating as esteemed colleagues like goodfellas the empire strikes back and seven samurai and higher than classics such as se7en saving private ryan and raiders of the lost arkwhen this is considered its hard to agree with the amount of praise heaped upon a film that whilst highly entertaining isnt even close to being worthy of sitting alongside genuine cinematic masterclasses like the few films mentioned above as when you take away the veneer of 4th wall breaking swear word laden and brain splattering violence isnt as original or groundbreaking as some wouldve had us believeopening with a fantastic opening montage of carnage those whove seen the now legendary test footage will recognise this scene well and hilariously listed credits certainly hits the ground running and seemingly forgoes the origin story tropes of old only to fall back into a plot line that feels utterly familiar to anyone thats laid witness to countless other such stories of everyday citizens turned into anything but ordinary heros or in this case a hell bent on vengeance killergetting into a groove that is elevated by preference for addressing the audience and cracking wise every chance he gets ticks off the boxes towards a fairly disappointing finale that ends proceedings in a pedestrian manner but at the end of the day people werent queuing up at ticket booths for a genre shaking narrative they were queuing up for ryan reynolds ott violence and more jokes centred around body parts and bodily functions than a full season of the inbetweeners and on these important fronts certainly deliversplaying the role he was so obviously born to play as really he gets to play himself ryan reynolds has a blast as tough guy for hire turned the nigh indestructible wade wilsondeadpoolits always made clear to an audience when an actor is having the time of their life and thats what we get from reynolds delivering lines like only he can and bringing a swagger to proceedings reynolds is the films mvp and while not everything that spews out of his mouth lays a comedic smack down more often than not you cant help but laugh at how far reynolds takes the character first time feature film director tim miller also deserves credit for his handling of the films action scenes and with a budget that would barely cover costs of catering on an avengers film miller gives a unique feel when it comes to dispatching of the cookie cutter bad guyshighly entertaining and responsible for giving ryan reynolds his true star making moment weve all been waiting for is a quickfire burst of fresh air in a world of kid friendly superhero films that upon closer inspection isnt much more than a fun time out at the moviesone can only hope that the success of this film doesnt mean the originality of our now beloved potty mouthed mercenary turned antihero gets overused by money hungry studio executives as too much exposure of this good time could quickly wear out its welcome as the novelty value wears off on viewers that have at present time put on their rose tinted glasses3  disgusting avocados out of 5,comedy
it was a good watch for those wanting a different flavor of superhero movie most of the jokes were on point and the movie didnt take itself too seriously ryan reynolds really did well in the role and his cocomedian tj miller made the bar situations a lot more bearable there were times when the adlibbing did get noticeable reminiscent of the table talk during bridesmaids although the pacing of the film did help in alleviating the awkwardness there were times the story felt a bit rushed and seemed as if they were just going through a checklist but the humor did carry a lot of it through well enough which could become an issue if the jokes arent your thing really enjoyable but at the end of the day aside from the humor it really brings nothing new to the table i dont plan on watching it again anytime soon and i dont really see anyone other than big fans of the genre who would clamor for a second taste,comedy
at the onset have to mention that though a fan of super heroes wasnt so well educated on the character of so kind of went to the movie blind in terms of back story but that really didnt matter the movie had me at the opening title sequence quirky funny and satirical asshat sticked out for me and i came up with a whole new bad word but more on that later this is an out and out ryan reynolds movie and why not when he has been fighting for it for the last 11 years when one is passionate and has the utmost belief in something it shows the character wasnt just enacted rr was dp we have been used to seeing superheroes always do good kill only bad people out of sight generally save the earth basically be all soft nice and cuddly well this one aint going on that path and am so glad it didnt the path less traveled is what this movie took in quite a lot of t  cs there wasnt any political correctness and neither was there any qualms of making fun of one self the self deprecation was the underlining all the way through wry and witty the scripting was tight the jokes yes sometime a bit skewed only to the other gender but in todays gender agnostic world everyone can laugh about it the only thing i wished we had more was that of the character negasonic teenage warhead she seemed interesting and wish there was some more meat and balls to that character beside only the fire thrust the movie references made specifically that of the fourth wall and mr smith were special though i know that there is a tug between marvel and fox but wouldnt it be just a treat to see how iron man and team up oh that would be a perfect universe where chaos is the new order and the language is pure poetry thats a match made in heaven and romance will overshadow all evil,comedy
if you dont know who is he is an infamous anti hero who is known for not being bound to the rules of comic books or movies he seems to be completely aware of who and where he is remarking on how this film may become a franchise or how he knows that the studio is tied to a budget listening to this character say exactly what you are thinking while still acknowledging the fact that he is in a movie is a blast of course a movie is not a movie without a story the films story may be quite thin and irregular but it is there sometimes naturally we follow wade wilson who becomes stricken with sever late stage cancerafter he learns of this terrible disease he opts to take part in an experiment which would cure his illness but simultaneously make him invulnerable with his new found powers he decides to pursue the man that gave him his awful butter face yep thats it he goes on an hour and a half long man hunt because he was turned uglythe films plot is ludicrously thin but it somehow works for this character his utter disregard for basically everything may make it hard to create a meaningful story yet they couldnt come up with anything a little more you know interesting the only other fault worth mentioning is the villaindo we learn anything at all about him no are his motives and abilities defined and compelling nope he is simply here to be the driving force for this coupled with the uninspired story can make for a rocky experience there are one or two stretches where not a whole lot happens i realize that the origin story needs to happen but it didnt seem necessary to make it near humorless at timesit was strange tonal shift that came as fast as it went thankfully so as the rest of the film is incredibly fast paced and unflinching this is what is so great about this movie for once a marvel film has held no punches its so crude and irreverent in its execution that even the new pool fans will be abundantly pleased the most impressive aspect though is the films humorthe movie walks a thin line with a character like this it can easily go to far or vise versa but straddles that line perfectly its ingenious use of fourth wall breaks slapstick and clever satire make for a timeless comedic effort it very well could become the next airplane in terms of pure comedic ingenuitynot to mention superb action sequences they arent overly edited or shaky to the point of nausea no they are crisp clean and use slow motion in the best way possible this is again where its r rating comes in handy it lets be who is meant to be gritty and gruesome dismembering limps of both his enemies and himself is exactly the movie fans of the character have wanted its gritty brutal and hilariously irreverent topped off with a pitch perfect ryan reynolds performance as the title character is the movie we have always wanted but it isnt without flaws errors that shouldve been easy fixes that seemed to just be overlooked that being said if you like this character you will love this movie,comedy
my inner 17 year old self loved it had everything that any 17 year old boy would want in a movie  sex violence and a smartalec attitude all wrapped up in an unapologetic package that reveled  and did not shy away from  these traitsat this point in the review you are either saying f yeah this movie is for me or you have stopped reading will never see this movie so it doesnt really matter what i writefor the rest of you still reading grab your raunchy comedy sense and head to the theaters to see you wont be sorry pokes fun at itself and the genre it represents right from the get go get there early for the opening credits they arent quite like any opening credits you have seen beforefirst time director tim miller cut his teeth on animated short films most notably the oscar nominated animated short gopher broke and it shows in this film plays like a 100 minute road runner cartoon with star ryan reynolds constant patter sounding more and more like the roadrunners beep beep as the film progressesdont get me wrong reynolds does a nice job as the lead and brings humor and charm to the character but after awhile it just didnt matter as it was just an excuse for fights car chases mayhem violence and explosions  and i didnt mind one bitthere are some interesting characters in this film most notably played by morena baccarin and tj miller  two actors who i felt finally got decent roles to play but they too take a back seat to action and smartassery in this film even the great leslie uggams is brought in as an old blind smartass and she acquits herself quite wellthe smartest things the filmmakers did with this movie is that they did not back away from what they were trying to do  make a superhero movie that was a mashup of the avengers and dirty grandpa they didnt flinch from this mission which is why it is successful they accomplished what the set out to accomplish  make a superhero movie that any teenage boy would love7 out of 10 stars  10 out of 10 if you listen to my inner 17 year old  and you can take that to the bank of marquis,comedy
the acting is great overall but what really makes the characters is the screenplay dialogues comments references and conversations are superbly written and provides a light atmosphere to dark situations i am not familiar with the comics but it seems that the film does follow closely to the comics the humour is consistent throughout the film and brought something fresh to the abundance of superhero movies this film is pretty explicit as there is quite a lot of almost nudity and a bit of swearing though it isnt totally overdone im surprised that it is only rated as 15 and above i would give it an 18 and above there are quite a lot of adult jokes that young ones should not be exposed to additionally i was not expecting the breaking of the fourth wall and was caught quite off guard i generally do not like it because it triggers me out of the film however after the initial shock it was used quite well it adds to the character of as someone very blunt and direct the way that the screenplay explicitly mentions and refers to things that are not in the context of the film itself is what makes it unique a little teaser example the beginning credits show a green lantern playing card that is what primarily makes this film so entertaining to watch also the visual effects and slow motion scenes are very well done right from the beginning you get the sense that this a not a typical film not only is the film told from multiple points un chronologically but also slows down certain scenes or even stops the time sometimes i am very impressed with the beginning credits scene and how the camera moves through the different obstacles a to the visual effects and editing team the soundtrack also does great in complementing the mood and trolllike humour of however there are certain ideologies at play in the film that i do not care for for one the girlfriend happens to be a stripperprostitute is that really the only profession that they could think of also the cab driver dopinder is indian must we really depict all cab drivers as indian other than that i do not think there are other races portrayed in the film that get a significant part perhaps it was written in the comics but that does not mean it has to be enforced in the filmoverall an entertaining film with excellent visuals screenplay and great acting it is just a little explicit at certain points and the stereotypes are a definite negative,comedy
oohh lord i saw and it was freaking hilariously funny who wrote this stuff if you are not a marvel fan i suggest you watch it online at thingamajigus i think dc is gonna have to take some notes from this movie so just go watch it at thingamajigus where they heck is part 2 to this movie do not forget to bring popcorn for this film and snicker candy bar also i suggest this movie is not for kids a lot of cussing unless you had raised your children to be like then good for you also the special effects was well developed also the action scenes were cool too seems like they brought back some 80s shooting style to this move there is no spoilers here so go see the movie,comedy
is there is no other way to describe him we have never see something like this character before in the superhero universe the closest being chris pratts star lord is seen as a wise cracking all attention on him kind of guy with eye grabbing displays of action talent and charisma the red suit anti hero provides a sprinkle of something a little different on a giant marvel icecream he doesnt try to be your everyday superhero and you need to love him for that he manages to use any means necessary to take down his foes with creative and and sometimes questionable techniques like who else would shove a car lighter down a mans throat other than of course the use of nsfw jokes reinforced the youthfulness feeling of the film but can at sometimes feel a bit cringe and leave the viewer thinking that maybe the studio is trying just a tad too hard as i found myself sitting beside a friend who found every joke funny while i just sat there awkwardly laughing with him for his satisfaction i didnt say there werent funny jokes in the film dont get me wrong and the archetype for is that of a humorous anti hero though maybe they needed to tone down the humour a bit as i felt almost as if i was being spoon fed as many jokes as they could fit into the movie the use of the xmen took away from the high production value of the film as i felt it was a bit cheap during the scenes whenever we visit the college for mutants as it is as if colossus and whoever the hell the other xwoman is are the only occupants of the entire mansion like why were the x men even needed it was clear that didnt accept collosuss ideologies at the end of the film so basically it was like we were being forced into the x men universe and collosuss cgi was awful we can see this movie is a step in the right direction for ryan reynolds after having two attempts at a superhero role i suppose third time is the charm i am now excited to see him in the next and believe he can recreate his career around the success of him and this film to get down to himself he does the job for me he is portrayed as the i wanted to see on the big screen and is an ample display of marvels talent and use of their base material to create a film if you enjoyed comics you will no doubt enjoy this,comedy
first of all this movies break the superhero clich because is a movie adult and hilarious movies dont pass a moral lesson just make fun of yourselftherefore this movie has a strong argument for support his crazy way he is crazy moral sense isnt like all superhero as superman batman or xmen his own goals are just to help herself and his girlfriendalthough the main point of this movies is about nothing still has a secret message about how a man get so lost when meets a amazing girl a eternal lesson he still has heart but is a kind eccentric in his ownfinally this movies has a great artist direction he break the fourth wall in a gorgeous way and most of all he has personality a difficult characteristic in the current wave of superheroes he is just insane and hilarious i recommend this movie and if possible watch with your girlfriend it is really fun,comedy
well the promos promised us how the movie will be in fact they kinda warned us marvel always takes its movies to a whole new level but here they have taken it to a parallel universe kind of level being the first r rated marvel movie is as vulgar as it can be but it is all very well balanced in an entertaining way ryan reynolds has gone beyond getting into the skin of the character to portray is new age filmmaking at its best especially when looked in a sarcastic and satire waythere is not much to be concerned about the story here it is merely an introduction of the character along with his love story in fact the movie did surprise me as it revolves around the love story of the lead character the best part of the movie are its opening credits and ending credits be sure not to miss them it is a hilarious mockery of the movie and hollywood in itself but who cares when the movie was meant to be that when you start finding the movie leaning towards the mainstream boom comes a funnysarcastic moment to elevate the scene the dialogues are extremely well written and this is definitely not recommended for a family viewing even though if all are adults action sequences though a little over the top manage to keep up the pace of the movie there are many xmen references in fact this might be a build up for the upcoming xmen movies the only flip side for the movie is not having such a strong story but it is hardly noticeable in all the chaos and comedyryan reynolds is so unclassicaly classic as wade wilson aka it is hard to forget his character in years to come morena baccarin is hot and we know that  ed skrein as the main antagonist ajax looks menacing in fight sequences stefan kapicic is unintentionally funny and gina carano looks hotter as angel dust other characters are hardly significant but they do bring some funny quotient into the movie is inyourface new age cinema you can love it or hate it but it is here to stay,comedy

flip foulmouthed hilariously selfreferential comic book adaptation is the longawaited solo project for infamous marvel character wade wilson a savvy exmercenary who makes a living as a bad guy paid to take out worse guys in the big city having found some degree of stability in his violenceprone unpredictable life he receives some devastating news but then undergoes a rogue experiment that grants him accelerating healing powers and the potential to become a superherothat is if he can keep his thirst for vengeance and various other antihero qualities in check fans thatve gotten tired of conventional origin stories will be surprised to find that this lacks any of the usual qualities of a traditional comic book tale amusingly demented and unapologetically profane with overthetop violence and sexual underpinnings to boot this earns its r rating with a big smile on its face reynolds ebulliently vulgar approach is perfectly suited to the material and helps overcome any predictable story elements subversive loud flashy and literally inyourface this is certainly not for everyone nor is it the most memorable film that the genre has ever produced but its a twisted guilty pleasure for sure ,comedy
with the superheroes movie being one of the major blockbusters in the film industry they were churning out a lot it every year while trying to up the game with each new installment whether it be with more action more explosions more bigger and convoluted plot a film like this shows that even a superhero movie doesnt need much of that to be a really good superhero movie of course i think 2016 would have been better if it had a bit more budget to it but it still gets the job done when it comes to the total package i think one of the reasons why was such a huge hit on its opening week was because of its refreshing take on it sure it coming out on valentines day might have played a part in that but i personally didnt see a superhero or antihero movie such as this one it literally breaks the 4th wall and goes all out the makers of this movie really fought to get this movie to get greenlit especially the actor ryan reynolds he fought for almost a decade to get this movie to be made because he really liked the character the character was born before the comic book came out and his name ryan reynolds i can think of other actors that can play certain superheroes however ryan reynolds is one of the few when it comes to no one being as fit for the role as him he has been playing wade wilson in a lot of his movies except now they gave him a costume and a healing factor and allowed him to have no restraintsand you have when it came to the plot and direction of this film it did a really good job especially when trying to carry on the comic book style on screen and having the right balance of action comedy and a bit of drama however i wished they would have gotten more in depth in certain areas its sort of how i felt when watching the first iron man 2008 because it didnt show enough of iron man but that is only a small gripe this movie does a lot of back and forth from the past to the present and for good reason its to keep the momentum going and keeping the story as fastpaced as it can be it doesnt have a really well paced story but its good enough and they did what they could with the resources they had in their arsenal i mean they had nowhere near the budget of the green lantern movie which even ryan reynolds took shots at however its not really the story that makes this movie stand out but its the execution when it comes to the character who is a fresh and very unique character that doesnt shy away from being wacky and fun when it comes to the marvel universe on screen while trying to stay true to the comic book source material a lot and i thought they did a great job with that i got the similar excitement shock value and thrills from this almost to the level of kickass except i liked kickass more when comparing to the first time i saw it in theaters overall this is a balls to the wall kickass superhero or antihero movie that i would recommend checking out they really pull no punches when it comes to what they wanted to show with the r rating was a huge hit during opening week for different reasons7910,comedy
why cant get plastic surgery it will solve his problem normal face with super human abilities in addition he doesnt have to fight the bad guy he can remain dead get his girl and live happily thereafter but then there will be no movieryan reynolds killed the movie i dont think anyone can do a better job than him the role comes naturally to himthe script is well written and delivered even better soundtrack and songs are awesome the idea of going back in past from time to time to tell the story doesnt make the movie monotonous well timed dialogs and some amazing action scenes make the movie enjoyable to watchthere is not much to the plot the trailer pretty much sums it upthe car chase and bullet countdown scene are amazing add funny ryan reynolds to that there is no shortage of jokes the opening credits is different and rr doesnt even spare the studio friends negasonic teenage warhead dopinder the old lady and the barguy compliment him well my favourite scene is the trio walking to rescue the damsel in distress with dmx playing in the background score definitely a must watch,comedy
is the absolute worst movie iv ever seen in all my 17 years iv lived on this earth the cinematography is trash the plot is so bad it makes suicide squads plot look like a masterpiece ryan reynods cant act and he does not stay true the original character the main villain is so blank and boring and why does need a team to take revenge it should only be one person to take revenge especially for who is practically immortal and why does he take a teenager wih him and a giant metal man who is that guy in the taxi and why is he in the movie and who wrote this a child with adhd and why do i hate this movie so much its not as bad as blade 2 but still i hate this movie and im never watching 2 thank you and good night,comedy
not a fan of ryan reynolds at all buried and green lantern had me shouting at the screen and were among the worst movies of the new centurybut this r rated superhero outing was pretty good it had some funny moments and did not take itself too seriously ryan played his part well and i give him a great deal of credit for making this workit had a good supporting cast especially gothams morena baccarin and ed skrein playing girlfriend and nemesisthe violence was comic book silly but kickass style fun the xmen tie in was quite funny as treated those worthy marvel characters with complete disregard for their worthiness the story was basically a darkman style revenge story with our hero hoping that he could be restored to his normal ryan reynolds lookthe marvel and dc universes has been a bit hit and miss with some truly awful outings green lantern being one of the worst although iron man gets on my titsone of the few comic book heroes that deserve a second outing enjoyed it,comedy

let me start by saying that ive been a fan of since i first picked up issue 1 of the newer series back in 2012 and ive been reading the comics ever since including many of the older issues i love i went into this movie expecting it to be mediocre after all is the kind of character that really needs to be done right and i felt that if the movie changed anything about the story or the character it would be awful but at the same time i had heard how passionate ryan reynolds is about and that the writers really wanted to stick closely to the source material so i was hopeful and then i saw it opening night and i was absolutely blown away as a movie is everything i ever hoped for and more the visual effects are stunning the acting is superb and everything about it was absolutely positively the movie is practically a comic book that came to life on the big screen with everything perfectly tuned to feel just like a comic fortunately the writers did a great job of making sure that this is not just for diehard fans my wife went with me to see it opening night and she liked it nearly as much as i did even though shes never read a single issue of the comics this is a great entry point for anyone wanting a more brutal superhero or antihero technically but with a lot of humor that you wont find in other dark comic book movies like punisher or blade for example this movie is rated r and for good reason this is definitely not the kind of movie you should show to your kids just because the main character wears spandex theres nudity gore and language that would make a sailor blush you know in the comic books when the speech bubbles say  that doesnt translate to live action so all those grawlixes thats the comic book word for them turn into reallife curse words and all the comic book violence is exponentially stronger when brought to the big screen so please do not rent the dvd and put it on for your kids and leave the room just because its a superhero movie this is an adult movie based on an adult comic book overall i was blown away by how well ryan reynolds portrayed my favorite comic book character and the entire movie was exactly as it should be if youre a fan of already and havent seen the movie yet do yourself a favor and grab it may 10 when it comes out on bluray ive already reserved a copy if youre not a fan yet but you like comic books superhero movies and tons of immature humor drop everything and go see this instant you wont regret it,comedy
is a great movie  comic book fans movie lovers comedy lovers  just plain people should go see this movie if they havent is full of tons of action tons of comedy  tons of references that will give everyone something to laugh at  keep them entertained the movie gives jokes  seriousness along with 4th wall breaking just at the right moments definitely not for kids or teens that are ages 116 not only does this have major use of language  sexual language but has two scenes of female nudity along with one scene of male nudity there is also a sex montage where spoiler wade  vanessa have sex  it shows their sex over a time period of the different holidays it also has a ton of blood  gore with a scene where cuts off his own hand  multiple scenes where a couple of heads will be cut off  all of this is caught on camera there is a scene where we see wade masturbating but he is under the bed but you can still see what is going on with the movements this movie is a great film for  they picked the perfect actor for every character 1010,comedy
my son loves character and i was worried about taking him to see this rrated movie but in all honesty there are much worse that kids nowadays are exposed to games and movies yes has violence and it is a little bloody but i think the humor really helps to tone down the heaviness the violence in doesnt compare to 300 or old boy which i would never let my kids see as far as the sexual scenes there were a couple of scenes and they are far in between i do think they can tone down on the unnecessary swearing that seem solely there just for the sake of making it rated r im by no means sensitive to it but just stating there are many rated r movies that definitely can carry the same message without unnecessary swears every 5 seconds that makes it seem more annoying than meaningfulif they do decide to do a sequel hoping they will stay true to the characters humor and essence my son did mention that in the game was a bit stronger than portrayed in the movie most sequels destroy hit movies by trying to overcompensate and thus going overthetop with bad jokes story lines and more violence more is not always better this one was nicely done but can tone down on swearing a bit just keep it simple but effective,comedy
i think the title says it alli am one of those few guys who have never read any comics i know so like all other marvel comics movie i went in without knowing anything about what to expectso if you are one of those guys then you are going to like what i have to say nextdid you like pulp fiction what about inglorious bastards kill bill do you like blood sputtering everywhere do you like when you can see the inside of the brain of a person after a bullet has hit him do you like to watch beheading with a sword if the answer is yes to the above it is very highly likely that you are gonna love this movieany movie from marvel comics has a certain standard it will never be too bad and there have been a lot of them in the last few years and they needed to stand out and the way this movie decided to stand out is by being gorybloody and unchildlydont get me wrong  as we expect from any marvel comics movie this is full of action amazing special effects great characters decent storyline but this also comes with a villanish hero its almost like the black spiderman a superhero with an evil spirit inside of himfor me to review a movie is to think about what i will remember about it a year from now and i will remember this marvel comics got heavily inspired by mrtarantino and created an evil spirited superhero who likes to take head off with a sword at any chance he gets,comedy
i have never been very interested in superhero movies although there are some rare exceptions these mostly come from dc the dark knight or v for vendetta for example and not from marvel yet i was highly anticipating the new film by marvel studios starring the merc with a mouth let me tell you why and how these expectations were satisfiedtells the story of wade wilson a mercenary with a very dark and sarcastic kind of humor wilson is diagnosed with terminal cancer in his liver lungs brain and prostate he takes part in an experiment to develop regenerative powers which as a side effect leave him permanently disfigured then follows a typical revenge story to the people who have disfigured him the story is not really the high point of this movie and the villain seem uninspired they are just bad because they are and have no real motiveshowever strength lies in his very special and meta humor it already starts of perfectly in the opening credits where the writers are described as the real heroes here and the director as an overpaid tool this is the sarcasm and hilarity people want to see in there are many other funny moments but sometimes audiences have to wait to long for the next laugh there are two interwoven time lines in this film which eventually combine the wade wilson pre time line and the time line i personally found the time line much more entertaining than the formerthe acting is solid but nothing special the visual effects are very good but also not the best we have ever seen the soundtrack features among others a song from george michael for comedic purposes but also actually good songs like hit the road jack or x gon give it to yain the end is a great actioncomedy with its flaws it features hilarious humor good effects and a diverse soundtrack but also has a bit too clichd plot boring villains and sometimes a bit too much waiting time until the next good joke 810,comedy
is a good take on the comic character of the mercenary wade wilson its nonlinear in that it ends where it starts and the plot is explained throughout the film in a flash back fashion it has a similar dynamic to fight club in that way it was a good mix of comedy and action it makes use of dark and ironic humor it definitely justifies some of its major hype it compiles lots of story and action into one small film through narration the action and effects are very well done and engaging the narration is important because it really emphasizes the character of and the way he thinks the fourth wall breaks were also very accurate to the role of it was a very fun and entertaining movie,comedy
to summarize my taste in marvel films i love the captain americas the iron mans except the 3rd one and think the two avengers films have been good but have not lived up to their potential i was also a big fan of antman thanks to paul ruddalways been a fan of reynolds but dont think hes a great actor however hes found a role which plays to his strengths mainly his motor mouth and has done well here with the support of studio he has finally unlocked some of his potential and shown us he can be a blockbuster actor a money maker just not an award winning one to the film yeah it was fun we all new what was going to happen before we went and it happened well the plot was obvious as we expected if youve read the reviews you know the type of gag youre going to get if youve watched the trailers you know the characters involved and their best punchlines i went into this film knowing all of the above but i still came out smiling job done by all in my eyes 810 in my eyes  and it would be even higher if i didnt believe that the next could be even better which is the biggest achievement for this film,comedy
ryan reynolds was born to play the role of he even did a decent job of portraying the merc with a mouth in the beginning of x men origins except at the end where everything went downhillthe movie was everything we could have hoped for in an rrated marvel comics movie yet i cant help but feel that there was something missing this is just my opinion and does not reflect everyone elsesmaybe there should have been more violence more blood more xmen more everything maybe when they come out with the sequel there will be more just hopingif you havent seen the movie just remember it is not for children there is a reason why it has been rated r r stands for restricted not red roses and lollipops,comedy
guysif you seriously want to have a good time watching a movie then this is itthats yet the best entertaining movie i have watched no matter what genre you like be it romanceactionthrillercomedyand drama it caters all of it in a single piecethats a rare combination in a movie we know thatalso the thing i came to know after watching this movie was that in the movie originsthe wolverine the one wolverine fights in the last part of the movie was onlyso the movie basically derives its roots from xmen seriesryan reynolds confirms through his acting that no one can replace him in this roleseems like the guy has been made for this role,comedy
i know im late with the review stuff happens man what can i tell you this film has a lot of sexual stuff a shadow image of some frontal nudity and gore so please be warned dont take small children unless you like answering a whole lot of sex questions the expletives are creative to say the least so thats another thinghowever if you can leave the small ones with grandma or your lonely best friend do that and go see this filmso pros vs conspros great costume effects are a little on the frugal side but very good in keeping with the personality of nonstop action and comedy both over the top and subtle some dramatic moments xmen baby as youve seen from the trailer both colossus and negasonic teenage warheadthe coolest name ever are in this in all their collective glorycant comment on the guys but the ladies are gorgeous in this gina is fantastic and if you like her as a fighter you wont be disappointedalso its not linear yes none of that this is what happened front middle and end nonsense no brooding in a cave or fights with best friends it goes to the action then back to story then back to the action again fantasticokayconswellthey did a fantastic job on look and colossus and even negasonic looked like an xmen his girlfriend and main antagonist did not granted hard to do the weapon x program with hugh wolverine jackmen retiring but the look of all the characters would have been nice now i enjoyed looking at ms baccarin as she is but a little nod to her comic book character counterpart would have been nice just a little sexiest just having her as the girlfriend that gets kidnapped which made no sense seeing as was already after francis speaking of francisvillain he was just another comic book character that was a pretty face instead of the gruesome character hes supposed to be also this is a film by fox and you know what that means lack of diversity yeah if your looking for minorities you will only find two and no it was not fantastic not in the slightestotherwise if you can stand some deviations gore sexual content and foul language then you will enjoy this movietil next time,comedy
i bet 20th century fox are kicking themselves that they didnt take off the shelf sooner big thanks should go to ryan reynolds for sticking with it since xmen origins wolverine he reprises the role as wade wilson which was considerably underused in origins running free in the new marvel expedition profanity follows even cruder profanity as wade or pulls us into a kamikaze of nonchalance and amusement rather than follow the same formula as other marvels starts near the end backtracking to parts of wades life that eventually brings us up to speed without the humour would lightly suffer and blend in with other superhero movies origin save the girl final showdown its comedy outweighs its action but when the action comes round it flourishes is at its most beautiful and crass when wade breaks the fourth wall mocking everything these types of films set out to be the title credits alone let you know what youre in for and dont forget that end credit scene,comedy
may contain spoilersi would give this movie a 76 or 77 if i could but ive given it an 8 because it deserves more than a 7this movie was a breath of fresh air compared to the usual weve got to save the worldmankind superhero movie that hollywood has been pumping out in recent yearsryan reynolds is perfectly cast for the role of i dont think any other actor could have played the part better i think he has a natural delivery for the jokesquips being delivered from start to finishhimself is unashamedly selfish and is the first superhero i have encountered who is not concerned with moralsethics or helping anyone else but himselfthe storyline wasnt brilliant but it served as a great way of introducing to new audiences and ill look forward to the sequel and hope they do something cleverer with the plot next timei didnt think i would like this movie but im glad i went to see it as i laughed all the way through its more of a comedy than an action moviei enjoyed the film  go and see it peeps,comedy
this movie was very well done it portrayed in a way a lot of us fans were hoping for the movie was very entertaining but i believe too much was shown on the trailers for instance about 75 of tj millers lines in the movie as funny as they were i had already seen them what people are saying of ryan reynolds being born for the role is absolutely true this will go down as his best performancewhat was upsetting was seeing all of the children that were in the theaters parents this movie is not for kids but overall this was an entertaining movie and worth seeing if youre mature and not squeamish ,comedy
we sure enjoyed the superhero movies in the last years didnt we a look at the box office gives sufficient evidence for this thesis however as much as i and everybody else loved these movies theres always been something missing by something i mean violence sex and a psychopath who tends to break the 4th wall yes we had frank miller adaptations namely 300 and sin city but these trends never seemed to set foot in mainstream superhero movies batman superman even iron man all of them had some kind of asexuality to them furthermore the lack of blood somewhat made it hard to believe the action i witnessed scenes in which whole buildings collapsed and cities have been destroyed yet you couldnt see one civilian get harmed what bs i am certain that if there would have been buildings collapsing in with some random civilians in it and debris flying around the writers wouldnt have been afraid to break with the clich of people not getting harmed in this kind of situationwhere does this conclusion come from you want to know its because the writers werent afraid to break or ridicule any other superhero clich either this is what made such fun along with the overthetop violence nudity and the hilarious comments of course on a side note being immortal persona also had more credibility to himself than lets say captain america if you let both fight against 20 guys with mps captain america would have to dodge every single shot abilities which he does not possess and which make you wonder how bad the aim of the bad guys has to be that he can survive such stuff whereas you actually can see getting hit but you know it doesnt matter anyway because he just regenerates he cut of his own hand and he was glad about it why because in the aftermath he considered it would be nice for the purpose of masturbation and yes thats the reason for the spoiler warning in this review anyhow this universe really does make sense also on the plus side vanessa wades girlfriend is played by the wonderful morena baccarin who has been reduced to the role of the girl with the crazy eyes in how i met your mother to his point hopefully this is a game changer for her as wellthis sure isnt a movie for sophisticated movie goers also if you dont have any clue about nowadays popculture if you arent entrusted with marvel movies in general and if you arent a fan of obscenity like there was a scene another spoiler of wade getting a strap on up his butt dont watch it also dont watch it if you arent 18 yetunfortunately the movie had some downsides to it as well the plot wasnt that great the enemy was kind of lame most of the characters somewhat felt flat looking at you cab driver wades friend the enemy sidekick megasonicsomething and all of the bad guys also people all around were somewhat too cool with the things happening to them and not everyone of comments was as funny as it was meant to be then again being annoying kind of is part of his character as wellin conclusion i sure hope other studios took notes whilst watching this movie and may the second installment be at least as good as this one,comedy
im only writing this review so the annoying notification telling me i should write one will go away see i can break the 4th wall as wellanyways imagine all the superhero movies youve seen up till this point with a twist the twist being that the main character knows that hes in a superhero movie or in the case of the comics knows that hes in a comic the movie plays out like a comedy with a superantihero where the executives or something forced them to put in this sappy drama subplot that basically just detracts from the insanity that is if youre going in expecting a comedy i assume you will be satisfied by the jokes on display if youre in it for more though luck this aint the superhero movie for you they kind of mangled the origin story for but this is the movie universe i guess and putting ink on a paper isnt as expensive as everything that comes with moviemaking thus here we area decent comedy with not so decent drama half the punch of the original origins story blown out its asshole heading for a bright future in the comic book superhero movie adaptation business cause a complete anal evacuation is still a notch above the regular marvel treadmill710,comedy
is an extremely violent film picture an adult version of tom and jerry if you will only the characters are not a cat and a mouse the film also dishes out a steady stream of obscene oneliners many of which are over the top because it alludes to previous films of the director but both these should not deter you from enjoying a wellconstructed spoof of the superhero genre of films unless you are queasy about intestine churning violence andor prudish about offensive obscenities the film makes its irreverent intention clear right in the beginning with a hilarious credit sequence that almost begs you not to take it seriously lest you begin to start taking the violence and vulgarity a bit too earnestly the film breaks the fourth wall putting things in proper perspective for you amidst all this style violence and vulgarity the film also manages to tell a solid story and it is nothing less than a love story just when our hero finally finds the love of his life he is struck down with cancer the torturously exotic cure that he seeks out leaves him horribly disfigured but endowed with superhero powers does he get back his girl does he get back at his tormentor i am no fan of superman spiderman batman or xmen but i liked it stopped me dead for 100 odd minutes,comedy
this movie was a pleasant surprise in a world where marvel super hero movies are impossible to avoid the story was far from original but the humor and the acknowledgment that is was a movie gave it nice feeling predictable as the script was they were able to keep my interest because of the personality they gave the hero like james bond where sean connery insisted that the jb movies had a humour element and without that the jb franchise would have lasted two or maybe three movies this movie does not take itself seriously at all it is comic book and much better than it first appears it will get no oscar nominations not even for special effectsand the violence is token rather than graphic dp kills people but there is no blood i would like to see a luc besson version,comedy
anyone remotely interested in this film already knows what to expect so let me just say what is promised in the trailer is absolutely delivered with no deception and only adds so much more of the kind of humor violence and other goodness synonymous with the idea of a solo hero drawn from the xmen stable getting a standalone movie hasnt been looked forward to greatly or pulled off successfully up until now if only by virtue of being such a truly unique character however they did also take into account that unlike the wolverine omitting other mutants to the point that you dont even need all the fingers on one hand to count them all is a truly horrible idea and this film did not make that same mistake so while the primary focus was on and rightfully so the two other xmen members got plenty of time to shine both in terms of exposition and personality as well as exhibition of their powers i wasnt expecting to see a scene that could have in another movie been something like hulk vs shehulk but this film delivered that pleasant surprise and i was loving every minute of it95 of the humor hit particularly the meta style humor where breaks the fourth wall directly or at least acknowledges to the other characters that something beyond their understanding is looking down upon them and the other 5 is stuff that is just soso or was said too quickly for me to completely pick up on i think that was one of the main flaws some things were just cut too fast to either see and enjoy completely or hear with complete clarity but the vast majority is what we get and i was extremely satisfiedalmost every character was fantastic in their role and the only real complaint i can think of is in that regard is i would have preferred to either get more from the blind al character who got very little background or development or not have had her there at all and maybe save her for the sequel so we could get a fresh start with her and be more fleshed out perhaps with a situation closer to the comics but tj miller morena baccarin and gina carano none of whom id seen in anythingor at least nothing that majorbefore all did very well in what roles were written for them and while it seemed utterly ludicrous for colossus to spend 100 of his screen time being animated i felt like this was his best portrayal yet in an xmen universe movie and newcomer negasonic teenage warhead was a fantastic new addition and i would be disappointed if she did not make a return appearance at least somewhere if not the sequelthe only other nitpick i could really say is that obsession with fixing his deformed skin was very bothersome that he could think something like that which actually varied from time to time would break a relationship was laughable and the very idea that him also having a healing factor that could then somehow not also fix his skin problems just felt too inconsistent wolverine looked a lot like that after being burnt up by the explosion of an abomb and went back to looking like he always did if there was a significant reason why it was not satisfactorily explainedin summation if you were expecting this to be the deservedly rrated slice of fried gold deserved to have his name slapped across you will not be disappointed this should wash the bad taste out of your mouth from both previous portrayal and with luck the recent fant4stic debacle i saw it in imax not 3d but id say based on my viewing 3d would totally be worth it too,comedy
i dont know about anybody else but i am sick of asexual comic book movies do you know that 95 of the comic book movies from that last 20 years have no sex and worst you get teased with platonic love to give you an example winter soldier captain america and romanoff flirt with each other kiss and what happens romanoff talks that whole time about setting him up with someone else and nothing wtf what a stupid tease and how annoying is that you have some of the most beautiful people with powers and i am suppose to believe that no one gets it on in the comic book world seriously i am glad that brings back sex and common sense,comedy
i enjoy cool and witty masked heroesantiheroes as the summary line suggests its why ive liked spiderman since childhood  of course they had to increasingly fudge it up with the franchises sequels clowns like batman or the xdorks dont do it for me they either take the stuff too seriously or just make them for serious nerds the dark knight 2008 was neat though because noncampy and with ledgers joker anyway i was vaguely aware of the comics and got intrigued by the recent promos also due to reynolds good showing in selfless 2015 costume and character are great so the premise of a mutant goof thrown against the usual fantasy action mashup works just fine while the comedy is sometimes forced or just silly it is mostly funny and entertaining throughout despite the mandatory xwhocares how could a metal hulk be choked and tj miller who shouldnt appear or be heard in anything if they shoot a 2 i hope they make it even better,comedy
after watching this film it made me feel so much for the character of but also how he stays true to his character it broke me when i see him in the streets after wade got into the project and then survive it made me feel for him because i care about him and even for his love also the other characters in the film bound off perfectly from each other and cracks up jokes and it hits real hard like the action figure that wade picks up in the film is himself from the xmen origins woverine is himself and made me chucked to put that little easter egg in there to make fun of that film also the actions scenes are well made and very smart and made me believe that is the most overpowering character in the marvel series always i had fun time watching this film i was on the edge of my seat watching this film because i did not know what is going to happen because it is is and i liked how this film fix everything and put it in the marvel cinematic universe,comedy
this is different from the other marvel action movies its primarily a comedy and a grown up one at that with lots of dirty jokes the action is funny and inventive lots of one liners some too quick to process or catchthis movie suits ryan reynolds because he is a better at comedy than more serious roles morena baccarin is very beautiful in this movie and deserves to be on the big screen more not just television shows that not that many people watch gina carano is suited to her role but she has become a very stockyprefer this to guardians of the galaxy worth one watch,comedy
one of the very few modern era heroes or antiheroes whose daily life is somewhat similar to a standard citizen compared to other marvel or dc heroes is a movie that should be seen by everyone who likes comic multiverses i think that in the overall sense the movie slightly fails the overhyped expectations of the internet community but it is nonetheless a very important milestone in this sense the narration style fun moments and mature content makes this otherwise uninteresting film a 7 star one of course the lead actor have a large part in this as well if you have not seen this yet you really should do so,comedy
i really wanted to rate this movie 9 mostly for the the marketing and that the film was near perfect also it has a lot going for it with a groundbreaking combination of pacingactionlots of laughs and a good dramathe movie knew what it should beplays with its limitations and is very entertaining and thats why you go to see movies the rated r was refreshing and so was the build up of the story which makes you say at the endi want more of thisryan reynolds did a good job as the antihero and the supporting cast played just as strong making all there roles memorablesothe 8 rating is because of a possible sequel and also how it holds up after some time has passed i think second could be even better so than ill rate that 9for nowthis was a great moviei really recommend it and i know that ill watch it again a few times and try to spot the jokes i missed the first timebecause i was laughing to loudprobably the best superantihero origin story i have seen so far and i mean as a movie i dont know the comic bookthis movie is awesome for everyoneexcept families with kidsi enjoyed it a lot and i hope theyll go even a little darker with the next one and raise the stakes and keep the momentumi liked this movie all the wayi hope it will be a good franchise was my 100th review on imdbthank you if you ever read this or any of my other reviewsthanks again and enjoy the movie,comedy
i hate superhero movies i used to liked them until i outgrown them or maybe until they started to become a show of cheesy characters in some sort of idiotic pose trying to spout cool sentences as empty as their heads a sign of what is also going outside the big screen the new spiderman thor batman vs superman the avengers iron man xmen days of the future past which ruined the memory of the first xmen comic i ever read by the way and in general every single dc and marvel production particularly the latter banging out filmsseries like theres no tomorrow has been a nightmare for people who like me are adults with a brain fitting their agethats why i love this movie i cant get enough of the dark humour of the jokes about xmen and the whole clichd superhero franchise so loved these days i wish there were more movies making fun of superheroes and their stupid and silly behaviour its great to be able to watch something which one of its main purposes seems to be to laugh at everything particularly at established and forced social patterns and itself so many people seem to miss that this movie the whole thing is a joke stop talking about a better plot and character development you just want another clichd superhero movie special mention to those claiming this to be the worst marvelsuperhero movie please go watch captain america profound psychological struggles and avengers heartfelt sacrifices and leave the rest of us with some serious right funill end up this review by pointing you towards some funny and silly contributions i noticed before starting my review let us take our friend joshhanks777 with his 110 rating 16 april 2016 this guy seems to have been so bored with the movie that he felt asleep because he enlightens us by letting us know that the main character is very unlikeable  and the other characters are not memorable at all particularly the bland villain and his girlfriend who is a stripper erm wait what was i perchance the one asleep no that couldnt be but then how can this individual who comments on the movie like he watched it all mistake the main character who is supposed to be with the bland villain because i didnt see any other stripper girlfriend but wades although she wasnt technically his girlfriend anymore or maybe he didnt realise what looked like without the mask and thought that he stole the girlfriend from wade the bland villain at the end or perhaps he considered the plot of this simple movie so twisted and labyrinthine that he got lost in the deluge of deep emotional characters with complicated relationships it couldnt be that he doesnt have a clue about what he is talking about thatd be impossible next user mufcsince and hisher love for childrens shows barney the dinosaur is more entertaining than this movie there you have your mindset and continues if one wants to watch porn theyd watch porn you seem to be confused about the meaning of the word porn check it out learning can be fun does bernie not teach that moving along you have to wonder what the francis a person is thinking when heshe writes a review that is in fact a summary of the plot without even a single personal opinion which is actually better considering the shiny jewels people drop for opinions take the user goodhandsomelad as an example review simply excellent 13 february 2016 so much for brilliance such genius and originality then we have muhammadwasim40771 with his indecent movie post entry the title should say it all i quote untouched grammar is a marvels super hero movie and is supposed to watch by more kids than adults  this guy seems to be so sure of himself than he doesnt even care about reality superhero movie wake up if kids watch rrated movies well you are not doing a good job as a parent these kind of movies are destroying new generation morally and physically physically indirectly or do kids hit themselves with new acquired bluray discs in a maelstrom of hilarity and decadent rapture of joy sure they could not instead be destroyed by sending them to fight wars so the elite can have cheaper oil or having to cope with irresponsible and alienating parenthood or indoctrinating them with tales about some guy in the sky wanting to punish anyone who doesnt do as he commands it must be surely this movie oh and marilyn manson of course  superhero movie should not be like this bcoz its a marvel character and kids dont understand why we r forbidding them to see the movie again with the superhero did you hear about the antihero archetype once more you seem to be a lousy father muhammad perhaps you should have considered abstinence particularly in light of human overpopulation and third world hungeranyway i finish here this my homage to and his disappearing lot i hope you enjoyed it and didnt find it abusive in any way after all my only wish is for all of us to get along until our politicians order us to go kill each other in some remote land for a madeup reasonwritten by a wannabe,comedy
as the big guys and gals of superhero legend slowly wind down their cinematic reign more obscure characters are now being tested for multiplex domination which according to the film takes place in the xmen universe is perhaps the most daring comic book adaptation yet with the redsuited antihero a troubling figure of cynicism sarcasm and murder with his journey very different from the troubled but noble titans audiences are used to instead of soberly working through yet another origin story looks to spice up the norm with a freewheeling sense of humour and loads of rrated mischief separating itself from the pack and its a successful experiment jazzing up the genre with a blast of unexpected energy from an unlikely source a mercenary with a military background wade ryan reynolds makes his living doing odd jobs for people in need reporting back to his only friend and sister margarets bar employee weasel tj miller falling in love with vanessa morena baccarin wade finds a true connection in his lonely world making big plans for the future however a latestage cancer diagnosis cuts the party short putting him in a difficult position of commitment leaving vanessa wade signs up with a shadow group dedicated to human experimentation with ajax ed skrein and angel dust gina carano put in charge of the new recruits mutant evolution when wade is betrayed and fried by ajax he begins to plan his ultimate revenge testing out new selfhealing abilities as he works his way up the criminal ladder followed closely by xmen members colossus stefan kapicic and negasonic teenage warhead brianna hildebrand who want the new crimefighter rechristened to consider a life of heroism isnt an honourable guy joining the ranks of comic book characters with less than savoury attributes graduating to a visual medium that always has trouble with shades of gray when it comes to costumed heroes however instead of another sullen war machine in the vein of the punisher is largely known for his irreverent sense of humor  as quick with a oneliner as he is with a weapon this shift in tone benefits tremendously especially after wades last screen appearance in 2009s xmen origins wolverine treated the goofy brute as a mad science project scraping off his personality and gluing his lips shut rights the big wrong returning the mercenary to his roots of ultraviolence and pop culture references giving reynolds another shot to portray the specialized hunter as he was meant to be played giving fans of the comic series which debuted in 1991 an adaptation they deserve despite a substantial amount of cgi utilized to bring and his balletic moves to life reynolds is the true visual effect of the movie gamely going wherever director tim miller leads the character is an improvisational machine with a streamof consciousness delivery thats secondnature to the star who gives an impish wit to go along with devastating finishing moves the picture earns its restricted rating  its no family film hes also a sight in red leather and as wade whos covered headto toe in horrible scarring keeping him away from vanessa its an exceptional performance and while isnt nearly as funny as it thinks it is select moments are executed perfectly with wadebreaking the fourth wall even messing with the camera referencing his own tattered screen history and reynoldss people magazine covers and habitually messing with everyone including roommate blind al leslie uggam an elderly women who shares a fetish for ikea products while theres an agreeable supporting cast the effort belongs to reynolds whos a perfect fit for the material making not only palatable no small feat but a real candidate for an ongoing franchise that may one day collide with the xmen allstars miller making his directorial debut does a fine job with expansiveness and storytelling making feel big as it jumps around in time interrupting an opening freeway showdown with flashbacks to wades once semipeaceful life with vanessa its an anarchic movie but theres something resembling an emotional core with wades state of shock over his death sentence giving the film a touch of sensitivity to go along with all the sliced limbs self referential jokes one punchline features questioning which professor x hed possibly meet patrick stewart or james mcavoy and sexual humor theres a precise atmosphere of rascally behavior presented here and miller gets it mostly right pulling off an impressive helming job that keeps lively and fierce goes for the bigbangboom finale ordering up a showdown of mutant powers an accidentally exposed breast and some medium scale heroics it carries on for longer than it needs to but bloat doesnt keep the picture from becoming pure entertainment always pushing reynolds in verbal diarrhea mode with maximum effort often devoted to making fun of ajaxs real name the movie remains down and dirty to the end but its never meanspirited riding a fine line between parody and purpose made not be known to a wider audience and hes certainly not a courageous figure but his debut is one of the better ones in the marvel universe adding some needed filth to the superhero routine,comedy
i saw and i can only way that it was enjoyable i wouldnt call it amazing honestly the movie made me laugh but i felt like it needed more to it dare i say actually had a real plot the movie definitely had me excited once or twice but i personally feel it needed more the movie trailers definitely ruined a lot of funny parts to the movie but get ive seen worse i enjoyed seeing colossus in the movie and sonic as well if i could i wouldve made colossus a lot stronger all in all it was good but i feel like the movie needed more i also wish he had his vanishing move as well that not only would have made the movie more awesome but more accurate as well,comedy
first off im not a comic book guy i usually avoid comic book movies like the plague unless theyre about batman which has been a steady part of my media consumption for a long time to start off with the negative the fact that is a parody of marveldc superhero blockbustersand is actually successful at parodying the genremeans that the whole superhero blockbuster has jumped the shark where do you go from which lampoons the genre down to the last detail while also paying homage to superhero movies mocks the clichs and tropes of the genre so effectively that it is nigh impossible for me to take any action blockbuster superhero movie seriously ever again weve reached peak superheroblockbuster people time to follow a new genre of film not even mel brooks could parody the genre like deayou get the point of what im saying while also dating myselfthat said i loved the movieand i rarely like movies from what i could tell the comic was one twisted story more akin to comical comic books like howard the duck and tank girl the nostalgia chick said years ago that adapting tank girl into a movie which most people didnt like was like trying to make into a movieonly this time the results were excellent ryan reynolds is hilarious as the merc with a mouth the film is the definition of a meta movie is aware that he is in an overthetop superhero movie and constantly makes references to people movies and songs from the real world reality and fiction are melding people the movie doesnt just break the fourth wall negasonic teenage warhead nukes it to oblivion wisecracks make spider man seem like an amateur in short the films an ingenious parody that fans and haters alike of superhero movies should seei think may be for action films what pulp fiction was for films in general a totally original take on a shopworn genre that could get the public excited about movies as an art form again that said heralds not so much the revival of the superhero blockbuster as its death kneel again where do movie makers go from here id call this film the reductio ad absurdum of comic book films if it wasnt a completely selfaware parodyps would be an excellent cartoon on adult swim the execs of that channel should get together with marveldisney and make it happen,comedy
i thought this movie was hilariousextremely well acted the characters were memorable and likable and ryan reynolds is hysterical and makes the perfect the fight scenes were well choreographed the female love interest is believable and dead pools friend is just as hilarious as he is the whole thing was marvelousthe only reason i didnt give it 10 stars is because for some reason they thought having it excessively gory would make it better and it doesnt a flying limb can be funny but we dont need to see all the dangling tissue and stump of a leg attacheddefinitely an r rated movie i would not take kids to this period,comedy
entertaining as hell and explosively raunchy is a very welcome change of style in the genre bringing to life a movie with many merits and ideas yet in my opinion it is not the breath of fresh air everybody is sayingill just skip talking about ryan renolds since everybody out there has pretty much already said what there is to say he is perfect for the role born for it what really surprised me about him even more is how much he was willing to make fun of himself actually i was surprised overall by the whole movie in how many times it went in certain places i clearly remember saying aloud in the theater amidst all the laughter i cant believe they went there some of the references some of the irreverence some of the hidden movie quotes it was definitely the part i loved and that surprisingly i wanted more ofthe movie also shocked me in how much it had heart they found a way to make a batshtcrazy love story actually work thanks to the pitch perfect use of comedy for storytelling the whole setup of it was really strangely charming and absorbing and it being so good in the first part actually made the second part kind of decline because other than the final moment which is kind of fun the love story really looses some steam and is sidelined for a big chunk i really get why but i just think that it was a mistake to divide the film into these big storytelling blocks than dont get to mix into each other it made for some repeatedly poor stakes which made the film really loose the tight rhythm it could have hadthe action scenes are a mixed bag here on on side it is amazing to see some good old rrated action that also manages to make out of the action some very big laughs and it does this a lot on the other hand it is really poorly put together it is fast cutting and cgi enhanced a little too much it isnt in no way ales cross level of crap it is just a little underwhelming and could have been handled a lot betterthe secondary characters also have their ups and downs on one side they are all integrated into the movie very organically and play their role perfectly both in the story and in their relationship with but sometimes i saw a lot of character being given up to transform them into witty braggers yet i am a little exaggerating here for the most part they all serve a good part of the film and even the villain who isnt the most three dimensional character to say it cheaply manages to still emerge colossus is a welcome addition to the film and he has multiple moments of his that are really funoverall i enjoyed the experience a lot and had a blast with the comedy in the film still i would have liked all of the other elements to work just as perfectly,comedy
short review take your loved one and see this movie why even waste time reading a review just golong review spoilersthis movie is so good its sinful the opening scene alone prepares you with a credit role that goes hot chick comic relief director  overpaid toolall while scrolling over bits and parts of what looks like a freeze frame of an action scene just for the camera to zoom out and you see its giving someone a wedgie out of a car window ryan reynolds as is pitch perfect as both the the normal mercenary wade or the antihero and his delivery is amazingthe writing is pretty good with the jokes coming at you from unexpected angles and the fourth wall being made of paper make no mistake this is a hard r rated movie they held nothing back however id like to point out that this movie really does have a little bit of everythingyou have a comic book hero or antihero really you have a light seasoning of romance that doesnt feel forced at all some slice of life and a lot of comedythey did attempt to throw a moral dilemma in there in the end but by then youd have taken in the overall atmosphere of the movie and in your head youd be like ehhh shut up and shot already which to my glee did and called the other character on his monologuingis the movie perfect nope its perfectly insane and i loved it it was a ton of fun and refreshing change from the usual superhero genre,comedy
i enjoyed this film you will laugh from the opening credits to the very end but i think the coolest parts of the film werent just the jokes but the character himself aka wade wilson a rip off of dcs slade wilson deathstroke but still a cool unique character nonethelessand a tormented character with a lot of baggage i thought the film actually did the character a disservice because they could have used all that inner torment to make a great revenge story but instead we got a bunch of clich scenes and a really flat villain a villain whose name i couldnt even remember after leaving the theater and a villain who had as much depth and motive as any typical villain of the week on a superhero tv seriesnow for my biggest gripe i just hate it when actors talk to the audience throughout the film or when actors refer to themselves by their real name like ryan reynolds mentioning the name ryan reynolds that just takes me out of the film and tells me that im watching something akin to an snl skit i am not really a reader and so i dont know if they do this in the comic books but if so they should stop is a really interesting character more interesting than the character he was inspired from deathstroke and he should be taken a bit more seriously okay maybe im taking this too serious i love the jokes but this was overkill i take my superheroes seriousi score this a 7 out of 10 a movie with a score of a 7 or higher means that i will watch this movie again at least one more time,comedy
is the sameold exchangeable marvel happygolightly formula wrapped into a very naughty very blackhumored often cynical violent and sexually loaded package that might appear fresh and shocking at first glance but once youve unpacked it there is not much left than just a slight feeling that youve just seen nothing more than solely a bizarre persiflage of a good superheromovie and not just that you also discover that deep down is a rather naive story about true love acceptance and the unwillingness to grow upthe main hero is such a chatterbox that he not only wont shut up even when a bullet pierces him another bhole he also speaks directly to us beyond the screen on a kind of meta level this together with his ability to fully regenerate his body when injured really takes away something that every unforgettable movie should have which is suspensesure many lines are very funny and worthy to remember and some of the action scenes really kick a the somewhat kinky erotic dimension brought in by m baccarin playing a role reminiscent of her iconic appearance in the series firefly all this combined make the movie entertaining nonetheless i just wished the plot itself would have been as provocative and crazy as the way it was presented to us,comedy
good soundtrack funny jokes about movie budget my beloved dirty jokes ryan acted amazingly i believe that guys did a big research before filming such a movie all good funsome of movies suffer from overpriced effects these guys didnt have that money and the result is still awesome i wouldnt be afraid to go even further with dirtiness as far as jokes goesi was bit worried about if my gf is going to like it since i suppose its more of guys movie and she loved it1010  for the movie cost  delivered fun and happy girlfriend  thats the way to do it,comedy
part 1 the movie reviewit was funny  ryan reynolds nails  nails ryan reynolds i laughed through the whole film butttt as a movie it wasnt amazing very basic story line and they revealed way too much in the trailerswas hoping for more cameosmarketing teams deserves a pay rise keen to see more of him on the big screen defs a must see good to see a fresh hero movie6 or 7 out of 10part 2 cry babyall of a sudden people i know are saying is their favorite hero and are happy he is finally in the limelight yet you didnt know what i was talking about when i was furious about how they screwed up wade wilson in xmen origins wolverine or how fun his game was back a few years i aint a super fan and i dont pretend to be ,comedy
hilarious extremely entertaining very clever great hardhitting fastpaced action awesome origin story told in a great nonlinear way likable characters i immediately love the character 6 viewingsspoilersi was shocked at so many things when the movie started i was not expecting that i didnt know it was rated r didnt expect the swearing dirty jokes violent action and ridiculous hilarity all shocked me,comedy
great movie to enjoy with your family hey its a super hero movie kids love those why not put in as many hardcore sex scenes as possible this is what you get when perverts get to make a movie,comedy
the perfect combination between a superhero and a comedy movie,comedy
id watched this movie a few times the time it was released i remember laughing my ass off throughout the movie ryan reynolds was the perfect choice for his voice and his humor fit his character perfectly its definitely a movie that you need to watch at least once in your life if you love comedies then this is the perfect movie to watch its a 1010 for me,comedy
brilliantly donethats all i wanna say watch this movie just unapologetically roasting and for voilently romantic with some story telling,comedy
i was entertained from start to finish i chuckle from time to time and i enjoyed the r rating for what it wasalso the movie is juvenile all the time the story and characters other than are totally forgettable which is fine and most of jokes passed without producing anything on me why so serious you asknothing the movie it was ok i enjoyed and thats itthose who get to enjoy more the adolescent humor would get a better time because thats a huge junk of the movieit is good,comedy
this movie has good humour and action togather i really enjoyed to watch this movie also its 2nd part is well,comedy
is refreshing in that it subverts the cookiecutter style of almost all superhero movies these days its funny and pokes fun at many of the conventionswhile it doesnt fully detach from the standard tropes it does extremely in many areas which makes it a refreshing and much needed change from the norm,comedy
great movie well written ryan reynolds was perfect,comedy
the begining was quite well  rest of movie was interesting enough,comedy
so dope funny asf love this movie cant wait for the second installment,comedy
everything done risky in this film pays off in the best way possible the jokes are great fun and each get a laugh big or small the characters are very fun to watch especially due to the fourth wall breaks the story is very fun and enjoyable however id be lying if this movie is perfect its a very specified movie and if youre not going to laugh or smile at the first few jokes this movie might not be for you aside from that for people who love movies like this itll be a blast to watch theres not much else to it its simply a great and successful rrated superhero movie that really pushed the envelope 910,comedy
a movie long overdue it does not disappoint i had high hopes when this movie was announced that it would be good the people who made this were going make the opposite of the we got in xmen origins wolverine which brought on the high hopes they mixed the raunch and action of an r rated film to make a self referential masterpiece they poked fun at everything from superhero films it brings the same feels as when i saw the first scary movie ryan reynolds is amazing in this a role he was born to play lets hope he gets to keep playing this character for many years to come,comedy
love the complete film  some great moments awesome credits both at the start and the end watch again and again still makes me laugh  maybe you need to be a complete tool to match the marvel credits as it states watch the complete movie with a totally open mind to what you think you are about to  doubt marvel will be able to create a totally fresh idea and approach like this again even with the new writers bringing in some brilliant new ideas to what technically is a superhero movie not  and great for it the way it stands alone from the rest  maybe i have lost it but i love it  even ryan gosling seems to have grabbed the roll and shaken it up good on you chap might have cut off your own head with certain same old same old directors  writers who are not willing to take the risks with marvel for the sake of a pay chequeanyway i think its well worth a good watch and to enjoy something totally fresh from the studio keep it coming,comedy
this has got to be my favourite comic book film  funny poignant full of action wit sarcasm and a brilliant plot,comedy
its one of the first in this genre to combine gore with humor and superheroism if you liked kickass youd like this,comedy
thats what superheroes fight for reduce some emotional drama reduce some monologue nonsense strengthen the combat effectiveness of boss,comedy
puts on hipster glasses i loved before the original trailer leakedin all seriousness i loved it ryan reynolds was born to play and i am so glad he had a huge part in making this i do wish they played on his insecurity about his skin more it was only in one small part where he was first following vanessa but thats mostly because i am personally more of a angsty fangirl im so happy reborn from the film that shall not be named,comedy
setting aside direct adaptations like sin city and 300 brought the comics to life panelforpanel this was the most faithful adaptation of a comic character to screen in the modern era ryan reynolds was born to play this role and tim miller rhett reese and paul wernick did a tremendous job of translating the comics attitude unique style and humormost adapted movies have to be talked about in degrees weighed with the good and the bad but when a movie gets it this right the breakdown becomes remarkably simple if you love the comics you loved the movie if you hate the comics you hated the movie if you love the movie and have never read the comic you should pick up some trades of the joe kellyed mcguinness runand maybe a plush unicorn,comedy
this movie is a typical pathetic movie with to much swearing and absolute rubbish being shown the humor is there but stupid and absolutely not funny due to the swearing wow  so sad,comedy
after watching superhero movies like antman and antman and wasp recently along with iron man xman and others in the past this movie stands apart you may ask how well for one the protagonist is the narrator and he refuses to be classified as a superhero seeing himself as more of a bad guy fighting other bad guys so in that way perhaps the film does subvert the superhero genre perhaps its funny as well still like every superhero movie it connects to the others apparently more so in 2 creating a marvel universe web bringing more money in for hollyweird producersthis movie does tie into the xman movies but it also has its own style i think it effectively uses the tactic of talking to the camera which doesnt always work in these movies but it does work here the playful nature of this movie which is still relatively violent should make it no surprise that this film did relatively well at the box office you could also say that this film is part of an antihero superhero movie brand and that is probably accurate as well but it does not pull away from the nature of this movie as a wholeall in all this is a fun movie i dont think i would watch it again but it was a nice break from other movies especially typical superhero movies nonetheless,comedy
in this movie was okryan reynolds tries his best but i feel they can find a better actorisnt funny and they love to use rehash jokes from previous filmsif you skipped this movie then you arent missing anythingthor films are way funnier than borepool movies,comedy
this was very refreshing rarely am i blessed with a near perfect experience the action is edge of your seat and funny at the same time only gripe is the villain he was a little underdeveloped but the rest of the film makes up for it,comedy
sehr unterhaltsames popcorn kino mit einem hauch von ironie,comedy
and that disaster is because of ryan reynolds does this guy ever shut up apparently not,comedy
review i really enjoyed this movie because it sets the precedent for what a superhero movie could be if the censors dont get involved the direction and screenplay are both incredible the casting and acting are both incredible the only issue i have is they make the character too much of an unlikeable asshole all in all i would give this five out of a possible five stars,comedy
nearly the perfect movie  fun fast paced hilarious true to the source material,comedy
the only problem is the sexual snapshots that took 5  8 minutes of the film,comedy
the 12 bullet scene is exceptional the rest is not still funny entertaining probably the best xmen movie i have seen so far but i missed a few too bad that was all this movie was about a single long scene,comedy
the humour in this superhero action flick is a bit hit and miss overall it was a fun watch but some very cliched moments,comedy
refreshing take on the absolutely none crushingly boring comic book film fashion we have to endure nowadays this is good comedy and doesnt take itself too seriously whilst being engaging and gritty but dont be expecting a genuine 80 film because it is children who have flooded the votes,comedy
watched it everytime and never get boredcombination of funnyviolence and 4th wall breaking is awesome,comedy
well i love these movie it has interesting story good group of actors i enjoyed watching it,comedy
this was hilarious with the 4th wall break and the comic relief,comedy
one of the best superhero films to date mainly due to the humour and how much fun you can tell the actors were having a fun romp that drags on near the end but recommended for those who are a fan of comics or deadpoolpersonal enjoyment scoreimdb 710movie score letterboxd 710,comedy
good movie good acting good ending and last good is good luck,comedy
its the best movie ever supersonic and they all have meaningful dialogueits a comedienoire oeuvre with centennial impact,comedy
i dont like talking about the movie because i dont want to spoil your experience i will just say that i enjoyed the movie and like the fact it is not pg or pg13 wished more marvel movies will do these kind of format,comedy
the way the movie unfolds its just awesomesense of humor is lit even if there is a slight chance the can show us some fighter skillssome shots the movie doesnt misses it i feel like now i can die peacefully,comedy
now this movie may have had what some would call  a paper thin plot and a cookie cutter villain those were actually deliberate choices by the studio ryan reynolds was beyond the perfect choice to play wade wilson personally my favorite part of the movie was when had francis ajax pinned to the ground and was about to shoot him in the face colossus starts giving a speech about how it only takes about 4 or 5 moments to be a hero but you can tell doesnt care so he shoots and kills francis anywaybut they did make some changes to backstory but that doesnt detract from the movie one bit like in original backstory ajax didnt manage the workshop that gave his powers he was the assistant to doctor killbrew in the original backstory was handed over to the weapon x program or how in the original backstory the was a gambling ring that dr killbrews other prisoners formed where they would place bets on each others survival under the knife but again none of these changes detract from the movie in the slightest,comedy
just loved it this actor dialogues are amazing one of the best movies i had ever seen,comedy
honestly before i ever watched this movie i actually did not know much about even though i saw him in two animated incarnations and that midcore origins film which completely ruined himafter watching this movie i got to know him a lot better and learned more about who he is how he got his powers and how he became an antisuperheroits really funny as well my favourite scene is when he is looking for francis and he is in a zamboni also that green lantern jokethe acting was good ryan renolds did a lot better as then he ever did in orginsif you love you will enjoy this movie,comedy
one thing that is important to remember is that this is an r rated comedy first and an r rated action movie second with super hero syrup all over and inside its crevicesif you werent a fan of the first one well i guess it depends why but dp2 probably wont tickle your jimmies there is all the swearing brutal violence blood dismemberment jokes irreverence and metareferences that you would expect every scene with a serious tone is completely cut out by jokes but this is still a bit more of a movie with plot and characters and motivation and all that sort of jazz definitely tried a little harder to make more of a narrative than guy kills dude to save girlfriendthe stakes are really only relevant to those onscreen sure there might be some larger implications if you really think about it but theyre never stated the implications that are stated are small time but that makes the stakes personal and better for a plot involving a bunch of selfish charactersits also nice to have a movie that doesnt take itself seriously in a time where most blockbusters with ridiculous premises are also trying to be like but this is real lifeits more of what was successful the same dish but they just changed the presentation that isnt a bad thing,comedy
deapool got justiice from the horrible way that xmen origins wolverine portrayed wade wilsonand we finally got a movie that delivered on what we wanted from our favorite merc with a mouth and ryan reynolds is always going to be the actor that i associate with and for good reasonsthe cast has a amazing cast with ryan reynolds leading as wade and the energy that he brings to wade and the comedy is why i love this movie and why the braking the 4th wall works also in the cast is ed skrein who plays ajax francis and he is a villian you would not want to mess with and he works well as a villian and he is not boring or not interesting and that is very good to see for a villian like him in a xmen universe also in the cast is karan soni stefan kapicicbrianna hildebrandmorena baccarintj millerleslie uggams and gina carano the cast is well balanced with lots of diferent talents thrown ini love it is finally the movie that we all wanted and it satisfied the inner comic book movie nerd in me and was funny and filled with action and has plenty of 4th wall braking which is right for the character of and also the way that we get the origin of and its a movie that i can watch mamy many times and still love,comedy
the atmosphere was great the merc with a mouth was given justice in this film adaptation ryan reynolds was the perfect choice as hes wisecracking and really takes anything seriously you gotta love the constant fourth wall breaks and easter eggs in this movie the storys nothing new but still pretty great as the way its told has originality and action scenes that further the story still morena baccarin was also great she holds her own in this movie enough said though you need to watch this movie as thats how good it is,comedy
when ryan reynolds originally played in that wolverine movie i saw flashes of excellwnce i have see all of ryan reynolds movies blade trinity and coolege being the most obvious and was screaming for a film to be made which was true to using ryan reynolds i dont think they could have done the character any better justice the films awesome funny and simply true to character,comedy
the movie was predictable and im confused as to why people love this so much the comedy was cringey and cheesy the ending was uninteresting the only things i liked were the action scenes since i love gore people praise this movie for being violent and sexy but thats just it theres not much more i did enjoy the movie mostly the side characters and they did a good job of making the villain hateable in a good way but i have to say i was expecting a bit more it was a good movie just not a great one and definitely overrated,comedy
 amazing outfits and super natural tactics matched with the characters  humour humour was very treatable and of this century exactly  cast director did a commendable job couldnt imagine anyone elsei laughed the whole movie the soundtrack was very genius colour of the movie and the way the scenes were chosen and switched from the dump to the school pretty amazing,comedy
i personally havent seen many movies so i wouldnt know but this one seems pretty original the main character keeps breaking the 4th wall and makes tons of good jokes unlike cringy family movies also has good nice action sequencesgood comedyaction movie a bit of originality thats about it,comedy
this is a good movie batman vs superman dawn of justice is better but still this a great movie green lantern is better but this had great acting it is a good acting movie but it could have been better with out the humor,comedy
this was a great hilarious and fantastic movieit has a little something for anyone and i am so glad they made this a movieit was so worth watching,comedy
was a movie was a movie i was never able to watch but when the credits rolled in i was ready to see the sequel if you love lots of cussing funny moments and just overall great gruesome action watch deadpool,comedy
exploits brutality and gore to get better ratings,comedy
the idea was good the comedy was on point but i just found the runtime to be too short for an action film that shouldve had more to it but whatever it was worth watching in the end,comedy
i laughed through out the movie but did notice a lot of people didnt exactly seem to get some of the references and what made them funny  as any move there was some corny spots  but overall good adult humor ,comedy
the first 30minutes is freewheeling funny and very violent the last hour drags as it tries to flesh out a plot has another terrible marvel baddie and the usual boring 30minute punchup,comedy
the 2016 box office hit tells the origin story of the antihero the performance of ryan reynolds is stunning and turns a potentially disgusting or scaring character into a likable one the film would have become a failure if it were another actor is a nobody in comic books but an instant success in the film industry largely thanks to the underlying comedic tone people began to realize that rrated nonfamilyfriendly movies could be even more popular than pg13 ones if they were entertaining enough,comedy
disney chief executive bob iger sat down for an interview with the bbc and uttered a sentence that horrified most of the film worlds highbrow crowd  or at least those who consider themselves above the pleasures of a superhero blockbuster with marvel youre dealing with thousands and thousands of characters  that will go on forever forever yesnobody should have been surprised by igers statement the man is in the business of making comicbook movies and his company is obviously going to keep doing so until it has exploited every possible avenue of profit but that doesnt mean were all doomed to an eternity of rote superhero formulaics  films where the wisecracking whitebread hero saves the day while doing everything right for all the right reasonslike any other cinematic genre the superhero movie is one ripe with opportunity for invention  even subversion hollywood may envision a neverending future of spandexheavy adventures but like the onceinescapable and oncebeloved western the superhero film can be twisted and torqued to last for decades weve already witnessed some mild pivots the sleek and gory vision of guillermo del toros blade ii for instance or the crude and immoral antics of kickass as some filmmakers  and the daring or possibly oblivious studios behind them  have come to realize if we must live in an era of superheroes lets at least make things interestingto call the new film merely interesting though would be an understatement it stars not a patriotic ubermensch out to protect the world but a reprehensible killing machine interested only in literally saving his own face his superpowers arent flashy just gross and his weapons of choice arent mighty fists that knock out  yet never kill  but assault rifles grenades and swords soaked in enemy bloodin short is everything that hollywood has raised audiences to believe heroes are not crass selfish and with a vocabulary that would have made george carlin blush yet here he is on the big screen slicing and dicing his way through his own origin story one that somehow exists within the squeakyclean xmen cinematic universethe plot is refreshingly simple and lowstakes aka wade wilson aka the walking talking smirk that is actor ryan reynolds is a simple mercenary whos out for revenge after a generic british bad guy ed skrein mutates him leaving his face a scarred freddy kruegerlike wreck there are a few side characters in the mix  including a disappointingly onenote hookerwithaheartofgold girlfriend played with verve by morena baccarin  and amusing cameos but this is mostly show and hes eager to steal itthe film has long been a passion project for reynolds  who played a watereddown version of the same character in xmen origins wolverine  and the actor clearly relishes the opportunity his is an irrepressibly charming madman  as if a standup comedian decided one day to drop the mic and pick up a glock if reynolds lays it on a bit thick here and there and everywhere its only because hes scared 20th century fox will wake up and realize what theyve unleashed upon the world and hell never get such a chance again its not every day that a major studio film for instance features a love scene in which the hero is sodomized by his girlfriend in a loving act of sexual explorationyet it would be dishonest to call something truly subversive sure the title character often pauses the violent action to break the fourth wall and there are many winking metareferences to the genre as a whole including reynolds disastrous outing as green lantern but firsttime feature director tim miller has created a work thats both aggressive and not aggressive enoughis a coldblooded killer but one who still must save a damsel in distress hes a smartass but only about half of his jokes land and while the films violence takes squishy delight in showing how realworld bodies would react to otherworldly superpowers the action is strangely muted in sections and poorly executed in others its cultural irreverence designed for the mainstreamstill as iger and the rest of hollywood prepare for an endless era of comicbook franchises its heartening to glimpse a future where not everything is wrapped up in a tidy package as himself well knows sometimes you just have to play dirty,comedy
deads poolsit had it all i really liked this movie and stuff,comedy
is this a movie or parodytrash as crap tbhwho literally pay tickets to watch a comedy for fungets whooped regardless of his actions like really dude,comedy
75i anticipated finding this a bit of a eyeroller but i honestly cant find much fault with this other than the fact that it wasnt entirely to my personal taste its slick surprisingly funny and quite rightly doesnt pull any punches the casting is good  reynolds is an excellent lead and ed skrein really makes the best of what is unfortunately a rather dull villain character the story is occasionally a bit thin or just misses the mark slightly  possibly owing to the budget constraints although these seem to have been approached creatively  and there is a tendency to slightly overdo the key elements of fourthwalling quips references etc for my taste it just missed a little something but unusually for such a situation i found myself really appreciating the way the film was put together frankly its a damn good piece of work with enough invention to make it fresh without being cringey it kept me guessing i didnt look at the time once always a good sign both of an engaging production and a good length and i enjoyed myself a lot more than i expected to definitely happy to see more,comedy
i really really liked and you know what i didnt expect to seriously i was never a fan of the character in the sense that i hardly knew anything about him and the humor as well as the violence seemed forced and overdone in the trailers still i remained interested in the film i just never expected it to actually be good  until the reviews arrived after most critics unexpectedly showered this newest superhero movie with praise i went in cautiously optimistic but still fully prepared to hate the filmthe first thing i noticed was how inventive the storytelling is the film throws you into the action from the first moment literally the very first moment and then it goes back and forth in brilliant and unexpected ways to slowly unspool the story of this insane  but oddly charming  antihero flashbacks and fastforwards can be annoying as hell but when done right they can help render even a somewhat simple story fresh and exciting and thats exactly how felt to me right from the start like a fresh if somewhat dirty jolt of energythe action itself is beautifully designed employing playful visuals and using pretty much every camera technique available it never feels repetitive and the pacing is close to perfection but and that was probably the key to me liking the film so much theres a beating heart underneath all the action and carnage and that has a lot to do with how brilliantly ryan reynolds portrays the character and the great chemistry he has with costar morena baccarin what came as a complete surprise to me was how unabashedly romantic is the love story in this film is probably the most sincere ive ever seen in a superhero movie and it gives the film the strong emotional core which so many of these movies lackthe humor which i initially feared would just be nonstop juvenile wisecracks and soon become distracting also works surprisingly well not every line or every joke lands  but thats the beauty of this character they dont really need to cant help himself as long as hes able to breathe hell crack wise and make fun of himself and those around him its a clinical condition hes not a standup comedian whose jokes need to land hes a madman albeit a very entertaining one and the comedy in his case is born out of tragedydespite all my praise its not a perfect film the villain in this revenge tale could be more memorable and the story itself is a bit too derivative to really do its highly unconventional protagonist he insists hes not a hero justice but its a damn good first entry in a franchise that will hopefully explore the character and his world to a much larger extent in the sequels and its actually a very important film for another reason if is a financial success  which at this point is already clear it will be  this could play a vital role in how studios henceforth view the financial prospects of rrated superhero films and well hopefully see more of them in the future,comedy
my personal rating 6410is film that makes its audience laugh because of some jokes but even that wont hide that its not different compared to any other marvel superhero films but just like what i have said its not meant to be a unique film but to be a film that is kind of childish and makes fun of everything perhaps thats why most people like it and i didnt find it bad but in reality it is nothing really specialprosfunny scenes fun to watch with some of your friends or familiesfor everyone perhapsconspredictable story cheesy scenes sometimesnot for people who is serious about watching filmalmost everything on this film is nothing really specialrating on each aspectstory 610cinematography 610atmosphere 610soundtrack 610acting 6510dialogue 610,comedy
some of the jokes are funny but i was mostly irritated by ryan reynolds and the general puerile nature of this film a passable two hours but the film makers need to try harder to produce a decent wellrounded movie experience next time,comedy
the screen version of the comic story of one of the most controversial heroes of the marvel universe whose adherence to the camp of positive characters remains questionable and the biography so confused and chronologically incoherent that it has the role and place of even the scandinavian god loki not just demonstrated another pattern but finally approved the trend of modern mass cinema which causes a steady decline in the quality of the drama of films that are in wide hire and reduces the status of the ticket purchased for the movie from a reasonable the interlocutor to the feeble consumer who has the skills of thinking elementary school levelmentally unstable seemingly unattractive and overlooked morality the character named first appeared in the marvel universe in 1991 and since then has secured the title of merc with a mouth derived from the persistent habit of addressing the reader and in the film  to the viewer and also received the recognition of fans of strong expressions atypically cruel relative to the ordinary level of violence of the battles of heroes marvel action and humor on the brink during the promo campaign the adaptation of was positioned as strictly corresponding to the tonality of the canon and the creators of the film were especially proud of the work permit they received from the rating however the potentially possible demonstration of violence sex etc was updated as a set closeups of the protagonists ass and utterly farfetched jokesthe controversy over whether the format of comic books belongs to the field of art or is nothing more than a kind of entertainment for dreamy teens was decided at a time when a subculture called geeks proved its originality and consistency with respect to the cultural sphere and the handdrawn original of is a very worthy example of this genre which can not be said about the film cinema version does not even solve an elementary problem on the representation of the hero besides not adding to the totality of its characteristics nothing new swears and moves with plastic that makes you think about his sexual orientation  nothing more happens on the screendespite numerous conversations and suggestions the creators of did not dare to make the central character gay which would be although not so original for marvels paintings it is only necessary to recall sebastian stan and his interview on love story but would allow based on the rules of good taste not to include to the frank thrash which he is declaring r but focusing on the interests of a limited virgin teenager for whom the phrase anal sex is something incredibly intriguing  on level entertainment famous hero of oscar wilde in the interpretation of the series horror on the cheap and automatically raises the in the rank of cult filmsaggressive marketing and thematic entries in the social accounts of the starring role of ryan reynolds trying for the second time to try on a superhero costume after an unfortunate green lantern preceded an hour and a half story without culmination with a string in the second half of the timing and the fundamental lack of both dramaturgy and director style  the debutant in the full meter tim miller apparently pretend to the laurels of matthew vaughn trying to combine a serious subtext and colorful full of specials effects the embodiment of the selected story on the screen but the result of the efforts seems to be exclusively cinematographically faceless even the most fanatical lover of collages and artifices will hardly find in at least a few frames ready to serve as a base for visual creativity a product in which the director is a man whose role is to be found next to monitor during filming but not to professional ingenuity and creativitywriters from the team wrote those several notebooks which served as the literary basis for the franchise gi joe  do not justify the directorartisan but only emphasize the problems of staging and the lack of camera work filling with jokes about sex asses limbs and vaginas hardly able to cause even a shadow of grin among the potential age audience admitted to the cinema for a session  marked with the letter r that is the level of the humorous component of is not just approaching but completely coincides with what was shown in the famous scene of the satirical comedy idiokratiya where the audience laughed and came to ecstasy that on the screen to him without any comments demonstrated causal placesin other words while the rousseau brothers and zach snyder are sophisticated and i must say do this very successfully trying to cover up the extremely brutal scenes of the civil war and the dawn of justice with the letters pg13 tim miller and his team use the opposite strategy is nothing more than a compilation of a number of sketches with a lot of questions computer graphics,comedy
the protagonist is extremely unpleasant you cant cheer for him at any time of the film the scenes of humor i think a better definition would be moments of humor they are very rare and do not last longthe story isnt very well and cant keep the interest at anything thats hepeningcertainly one of the worst movies ive ever seen,comedy
theres many nude part on the movie and this is make it very ugly sometimes,comedy
shcoked this awful movie is rated to highly then again when you think about how dumbed down society is one should never be shocked this film is for pubercents at best awful in every single way if i could give lower than 1 star i would,comedy
i honestly dont understand why people love the characters to be humorous and full of toddler fodder regardless of rating unlike hulk 2003 or logan 2017 it prefers to be formulaic while pretending to be original,comedy
i know a lot of comic book nerds wouldnt like me for this but i never really knew much about until i found out this movie was coming out then i decided to do some research on him and ended up getting into his comics and now hes my favorite superhero  ended up being my favorite movie of all time i made my ex watch it with me so many times and i swear i was getting it in almost every time we watched it definitely a most excellent movie,comedy
takes the two elements of comedy and action and blends it so well together ryan reynolds who has played in other movies like green lantern and the proposal plays as the main protagonist the quick summery for the movie is that he finds out that he has cancer and doesnt have much more to live so he is visited by this stranger who says that he might be able to cure his cancer so nothing much to lose he accepts his offer and goes with him they do a all kinds experiments on him and put him trough a lot of pain he sees that it was a bad idea and tries to escape he then goes trough a near death experience and gains his super power that is regeneration so that the cancer will never kill him but after all those experiments he is left deformed he then goes on to take revenge on the man that did this to him and of course like any other super hero movie he finds the man and kills him i think that the movies strongest points are the comedic scenes it might be just me but the comedy makes the movie what it is there might be a few cheesy moments that are just bad but thats what the movie is all about this is one of my favorite movies so far in the later years and im already very hyped about the next movie that comes out in a few years i would recommend this to anybody that loves comedy and action,comedy
heres an inventively original super hero comedy unfortunately not one for kiddies i expected laughs all through but was sold short on that where instead they come in durations and ones of some pretty hysterical st but too its very smart humor thanks to lines from a screenwriter you have to envy because theyre that good from the opening credits of originality you have to admire played against an 80s track you do not expect and the opening scene youve got one loud clever superhero flick with some gruesome moments mind you as revengeful reynolds now donning a bland spiderman looking costume is after the badarse skein  who makes a great english villain topping reynolds performance easily who horribly disfigured his beautiful baby face where hes wears the congressional medal of ugly where that big guy from fantastic four doesnt look that bad thats sheer motive to go after and kill his guy the movie starts half point of story which is clever where we rewind to find out reynolds life prefore to his little misfortune where he was a kind of secret vigilante working for an secret agency he has a hot girlfriend but his healths not that good i was pretty happy from what delivered better on a second watch it was just the laugh factor that let me down its a smartly original film where reynolds who like charlie sheen has great comic timing and i did like the way he played it despite not being oscar attraction the girlfriend but its skein youll remember the young superhero girl who with reynolds old protg a big monstrous fantastic 4 figure helps him dispose of this evil looks like that creepy hate driven girl in the crush theres a nice vo after note that ends this ambitious piece of film making too a must see again not for the kiddies,comedy
weve seen this character before and it didnt go well xmen origins wolverine so i didnt know exactly what to expect from this movie actually this was probably the superhero that i knew the less i didnt know exactly what his powers were or how was he created but with all the amazing advertising for this film i got excited  i did some research before watching this movie i went prepared and i have to say i loved every single second it was great i got home and wanted to know everything about this characterthe fact that this movie was released in february was already something different and unusual its perfectly aware of the enormous amount of superhero movies that were getting every couple of months we have a new superhero movie and even if its awesome to see our childhood heroes on the screen the scripts start to be very similar and it can become unexcitingscript is by far the best attribute of this movie people come out of the theaters and theyre all excited about all the action and how cool the fight scenes were like in all of the superhero movies nowadays but the script is phenomenal its super funny rude sarcastic and they didnt back off  they had no problems saying things that we usually only think of and never say it out loudthey constantly break the fourth wall to remind us of the state that films are in today and thats brilliant i love when makes fun of his sewn mouth in the xmen movie or of ryan reynolds failures throughout his career he even makes fun of actors or movies that arent from comic books its just awesome also the opening credits scene its amazing one of the best this year for suretim millers directing is pretty great the movie is fastpaced the action is well shot without shakycam and the cgi is perfectly used especially with the charactercolossus everything looks clear and fluid few cuts which proves that you dont need an enormous budget to make a really greatlooking filmthe only thing that could have destroyed this movie was like most of the time the love story it could have been just a plot device so could save the love of his life or it could make us not care that much about the relationship and vanessa  however they handle this story like they handle the rest of the film with sarcasm and rudeness and that made this story so much better and entertainingthe acting is great the soundtrack is amazing the film was incredibly hilarious and ryan reynolds was born to portrait this character ed skrein who plays the villain in this movie could have done something more to be more interesting but he works well for the movies plot and as revenge target which was what this film needed him to beis this movie going to be nominated for a bunch of oscars no is it a cinematic masterpiece no is it the perfect movie for suremsb reviews  if you like my reviews please follow my blog ,comedy
the movie i guess is one of the first of its kind with respect to a combination of superhero action superheroish only because of the presence of superhero powers as a result of genetic mutation and a superhero suit and comedy no doubt it was a risky experiment but quite clearly came out to be a successful one all credit goes to the beautiful execution of the concept,comedy
ryan reynolds was made for he is youve gotta give him praise for his performance as the character then again i feel like hes just playing himself the movie was a fast funny and fourth wall breaking it was a straight forward and entertaining movie youd get a kick out of this nonetheless i enjoyed the chemistry ryan reynolds wade wilson morena baccarins vanessa had loved every scene when theyre together only problem i had was the character is constantly trying to tell jokes during moments where it wasnt needed which in my opinion kills the flow as a long time comic book fan i understand character but that obviously isnt my cup of tea overall a very good film director tim miller to me deserves a lot of credit too,comedy
a light movie with a light humor ive always despised marvel movies for their simplistic design of the world and people  their world is composed by good people against bad ones this one tried to break up with all this schemes with humor and we can salute this try but waiting for better in the following sequel the movie seemed sometime like a funny farce  the link between and xmen universe have been made light so to harden the satiric aspect of the movie  it still movie suffer from of a lack of work in personages composure except of and dialogues the director seemed to made this episode like an introduction of the personage of more than anything else ,comedy
this is perhaps the only film during which i laughed from beginning to end when i first saw it i think i annoyed quite lot of people in the cinema with that so many surprises and easter eggs the film is out for one year and i think ive seen it more times than pulm fictionits original it was made with love by the filmmakers who wasnt afraid to take risks i am looking forward to see something new not like most blockbusters copying old scheme of films that just makes moneyryan reynolds nailed this role he is simply and nobody else can it be with that he deserve more recognition because the film was was quite possibly made thanks to himif you are easily offended by violence language or nudity this is not the movie for you but if you have a sense of humor and want to be entertained for 2 straight hours you will love this movie,comedy
although ive personally never been a fan i went into this movie with fairly high hopes i love the xmen franchise enjoy ryan reynolds and love action comedies this movie however fell flat on all levels after constantly hearing about the game changing fantastic hilarious i was excited to see it after all i did enjoy reynolds take on the merc with a mouth in the horrendous xmen origins wolverine i will start with a couple pros the flashback proved interesting and new dynamic for a comic book movie the homage after credits scene tj miller a couple jokes literally everything else is a con and would take far to long to get into then i want to spend on this so instead i would like to recommend that anyone looking for a comic book comedy go watch guardians of the galaxy this movie and its fanboys desperately wishes it was gotg if you would like a r rated action comedy please check out kiss kiss bang bang i feel like this movie was written attempting to be a mixture of both those and failed dont trust the fanboys dont believe the hype,comedy
there was a lot of clever marketing around this film  marketing which not only got the sense of humor of the film but used it really well to get to and expand upon the target audience like the film itself it was all done with such irreverence and lack of respect for the genre that i found it quite refreshing  particularly as superhero films continue to puff themselves into bigger and more serious epic franchises mostly the film itself manages to deliver in the same vein but it is not as consistent as i would have wanted  and i can understand those that hate itfor all its subversive humor the plot of the film is a collection of familiar tropes  the kidnap the revenge the origin story etc an added downside is that this flaw doesnt really matter because the plot always feels like it is an afterthought that the writers added once they had all the jokes and scenes they wanted down on paper these are pretty funny and the irreverent tone helps it work but if you are not in the right frame of mind then it will probably grate quite a lot the action setpieces are pretty enjoyable though and it does play well as a fauxsubversive entry in the genreit is fun rude and gory and it is enjoyable for it it does have its weaknesses though and in the end it is not as clever or different as it thinks it is,comedy
love the love scenes in the movie were really beautiful especially at the end where the movie puts forward the message love is more than just looksaction the action scenes in the movie make you go woah peppered with delicate humor and wonderful screenplay the action scenes were both superheroistic and also very close to realitythe direction was bangon as well as the wonderful especially directing a fight which is less of a superhero kind and more of a realistic kind is very difficult and the director pulled it off really goodoverall a super awesome movie from the xmen cinematic universe must watch for xmen action and humor fans,comedy

i am personally very disappointed with the film as it was a fairy tale love story the kind of hero which i was expecting since the time of wolverine origins wasnt there yeah i would say that the comedy was fantastic but i didnt pay the money for that i wanted action scenes plus some solid story with the same kind of comedy but it wasnt there to be and the worst part was that i went to watch this movie on the valentines day without a girl alongside me and you know what this movie did it made fun of all those guys who didnt have a girlthe years of waiting for this movie was simply not worth it but if you are willing to pay for comedy and love story and that too with a fairy tale ending then this movie is definitely for you the sidekicks from xmen are terrible,comedy

is a slightly different take on the superhero genre is he a good guy perhaps questionable he is self aware hes in a movie but noone else is something i simply didnt understand the reasoning behind it took me by surprise it was something different but i did think it made the movie unique the storyline is simple but it does a nice job telling you the origin of story by switching between the current action and he moment he becomes i find most origin stories are often very long winded and you start to lose interest this simply isnt the caseryan reynolds is perfect for this role which to me comes as a big surprise after seeing his last effort as in xmen origins wolverine not to mention his performance in green lantern which i think we can all agree were awful so maybe superhero movies are not in his repertoire so needless to say i didnt have high expectations  however you cant fault his performance i think he did a great job and just dont think this movie would have been as likable without himthis superherodark comedy isnt really for children its not a great movie and perhaps slightly overkill with the tryhard jokes however the movie makes fun of itself throughout and there is something very likable about this film review 710,comedy
if you like your superheroes straight and serious as opposed to camp jokey and totally foulmouthed if you prefer a narrative that is linear and third person rather than one with lots of flashbacks and a firstperson dialogue which regularly breaks the fourth wall if you like violence to be quick and clean rather than brutal and disfiguring then i guess is not for you think more kickass than xmen if on the other hand youre up for something rather different  a central character with special regenerative powers who is out for revenge for himself rather than justice for society and whose constant witticisms are as often about sex as cultural allusions then you will find this movie a refreshing change from the usual superhero farefive years ago ryan reynolds starred as the green lantern in a disappointing movie but here he has created such an original and fun character than we might well have a new franchise certainly there would be scope for more bridges to the xmen franchise but for now we have only two new xmen in the varied shapes of metallic giant colossus stefan kapicic and young sian oconnor lookalike negasonic teenage warhead brianna hildebrand also it would be good to have a more original villain than yet another londoner ed skrein and to see more of wade wilsongirlfriend brazilian homelandstar morena baccarinby the way be sure to stay till the end of the credits ,comedy
although i am not a superhero fan who knows the whole back story behind it was a funny movie nonetheless it contained many witty jokes and great but graphic action scenes that really draws you in especially during the beginning scenes it contains everything movies about superheroes do even though we are constantly reminded is no superhero his romances ability to overcome the great physical damage caused by the experiments and final victory over the villain was easy to foreshadow in contrast it definitely has its unique characteristics that stand out comparatively to any other comedy superhero movie overall it is a great feel good movie with comedy but it is easy to tell how it is going to play out from the beginning,comedy
i watch a b15 rated movie in order to have more viewers every theater en mxico shows somethingyou know less than i expected i was hoping that gives the audience specially marvel and superhero movie fans some refreshing smarter darker or surprising i dont knowsomething different like nolans batman but while i was watching this film ive just thinking this is just a badass spiderman i felt very uncomfortable when talks to the camera i have to admit that i laughed when he says that joke which professor stewart or mcavoy but thats it buy anyways my little sister 14yo enjoys this film a lot and post every day in facebook about how great and hilarious was just like the others 14 yo friends of her for me its just like another bounty builder movie,comedy
was good just like i had prayed it would be for the most part everything the film had to offer was at the very least well executed however through all the comedy and action the thing that really stole the show at least for me was the story the storytelling in this film was honestly better done than anything else which is a compliment because the other aspects were quite good you will come for the jokes and was overall a pretty funny movie but the admittedly clichd story will likely impress and surprise youso should you watch children stay away everyone else yes go watch it,comedy
is supercool with awesome fight sequences and cool visuals direction is not at its peak but it is good fight choreography is good especially dialogues written for is pretty coolkinda sarcastic all the timewhen it comes to the story of the movie it is pretty basic revenge story with love angle there is nothing special you gonna find interesting from the plot apart from the fight sequence and punch dialogueswhen it comes to casting ryan reynolds did complete justification for his role and the job he did for giving voice over to his character is absolutely commendable it is completely hilarious the way talks and the rest of them did their part well finally its a movie with foulmouthed merc who tries to seek revenge and making fun with all of them who comes in his way,comedy
its a marvel superhero movie but with a lot of adult jokes which i could not understand all of them because i am not native a lot of people laughed so most people enjoyed it i guess that was because of those adult jokes but i gave 7 because the story is very simple the action is ok i can recall some similar scenes in other movies it was valentines day there was love element in the movie too but only for adorning so far more than half of its box office comes from domestic which approves that this movie more suit for local people because for these kinds of superhero movies domestic box office generally only accounts for one third,comedy
is said to be one of the most impossible material to put up on the big screen this soon this hero is crass the content is more vulgar and violent that may not be marketable for the mass but the studio is smart enough to take risks staying faithful with its nature and let things go wild and as it goes its undeniably hilarious and really crazy fun but for its ambitions of breaking new grounds for the superhero genre however falls short in that case the tropes are kind of the same except its more selfaware and lurid but this doesnt negate the joy the movie still providesit begins with an opening credits that pretty much name calling however typically involves in major superhero films the movie then cuts establishing what kind of a character is hes coldblooded with a sense of humor it also flashes back to his origin story and how he lost everything after the experiment that is supposed to cure his disease the main plot is basically a simple revenge story only filled with the otherworldly craziness and breaking the fourth wall jokes and as the story go its not that fresh but its all about the personality of the hero must shine and it does deliver he also keeps poking fun at the clichs of the superhero genre and the limitation in the production of the film its amusing all and all and thats pretty much what we wanted to see herethen again its nothing groundbreaking but what we wanted to see here is just playing around putting aside the playful stuff the romantic subplot is actually kind of endearing the villain is ought to seem like a stock one but his petty weakness is what defined him the action is pretty fun to watch which mostly has headshots and decapitations the cgi isnt always that impressive but it doesnt keep the action from being watchable as long as the velocity and clarity are good the acting is a delight ryan reynolds seems like hes having the time of his life playing this role and that shows in every scene he is in as deadpoolisnt quite that revolutionary well maybe for the confidence of major studios making more r rated superheroes like this as the plot goes its all familiar then again the movie is all about the personality and it works delightfully people may just brag that this is just kickass except with higher budget and a more known property and that can be true the movie doesnt have too much of a novelty but as it executes your expectations has that passion and that alone may satisfy comic book fans anyway,comedy

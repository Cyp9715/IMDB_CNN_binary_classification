oh come on imdb users how could this film get only a 65 yes its a kids movie but i know plenty of adultsnot including myself who loved this film it touches our hearts and tickles our funny bones not to mention i think in one way or another we could relate to it thats why it remains a classic christmas comedyis not only one of the highest box office successes of all time but it deserves more praise mac showed a talent that very little child stars have nowadays he brought in a great comedy about a boy who accidentally is left when his family goes on vacation and takes on two burglars yeah its quit unrealistic about the burglars but honestly this is a terrific family film joe pesci and daniel stern are the perfect comedy duo of two idiots who cant rob the place because a 8 year old child has out witted them and set some clever and very funny traps around the houseplease give this movie a chance its just terrific and i guarantee nothing but great laughs for you and the whole family1010,comedy
1990 rating 810it might be dumb and corny but ive actually liked this highly entertaining flick the plots unbelievable but who cares its funny macaulay culkin plays 8 yearold kevin a misunderstood kid who lives in a big ass house with his family theyre about to leave for paris where theyre gonna spend christmas about 20 people are running around the house frenetically preparing for the trip kevins mad at everyone because no one pays attention to him unless its to yell at him hence kevin goes to sleep wishing that his whole family would disappear and the next morning they do the thing is that they somehow woke up late left home in a hurry and hey they forget lil kev at first hes happy as a monkey but after a while things get messy two dumbass robbers are planning to rob his house but kev aint gonna let themokay i know this is one stupid story but its developed into a wonderful family film as enjoyable as it is warmhearted mac culkin is awesome in the lead he really carries the film hes got style hes funny and hes even a good actor too bad his personal life screwed up because he had the talent to become a grownup movie star the idiotic criminals are also really cool because they cast good actors instead of some erneststyle lameo overactors oscarwinner joe pesci and daniel stern the narrator on the wonder years are hilarious but they also bring a bit more depth to what could have been cardboard characters pesci plays an aggressive thug and anyone whos seen him in a scorsese film knows how good he is at it stern plays a total dufus and hes also really convincing at it the films humor might seem dumb but hey its funny john hughes screenplay has kevin protecting his home by turning the thieves into human wile e coyotes and like the cartoon it made me laugh the gags might be old but theyre played with inventiveness and the acting is always right i just love this film and you will too if you look beyond the fact that its a family film,comedy
has succeeded in establishing itself as a christmas tradition spawning off three sequels including a madefortelevision flop and a whole franchise in and of itmacaulay culkin plays kevin mccallister the average american child he has an attitude almost expected of a chris columbus film from the eighties he lives with a large family which right now being around christmas time is about quadrupled flooded by relatives children all of whom pick on poor poor kevin sympathy long lost later into the filmone day kevin wakes up from his sleep to find his wish has come true his parents john heard and catherine ohara have disappeared enthralled by this he proceeds to do everything and anything he was not allowed to do before including eating ice cream in the morning watching violent gangster films jumping on the bed wrecking his brothers room and having some fun with a bb gun unfortunately for kevin his parents have not just disappeared  they have accidentally left him at home before going to paristrouble really starts when two pesky burglars harry lime joe pesci and marv merchants daniel stern decide that their next burglary will be at the mccallister residence little do they know kevin is more than prepared arming the house with an array of boobytraps that would impress top spies in the american governmentjohn hughes writerdirectorproducer of my favorite comedy planes trains and automobiles wrote this film and it is no wonder it is just like hughes humor it mixes emotion belly laughs and a warmhearted ending all into one little bundle called a movie john hughes films in my experience are usually very good mainly because he approaches films at a very classic level he doesnt resort to crude kid jokes like the master of disguise or the tuxedo to name a few recent flops he almost always levels everything out perfectly in his scripts and nothing is different here also he places kevin and co in a large brick home in a large neighborhood in chicago a home that very much resembles those in planes and uncle buck i would not be surprised if it is the same homeas for the actingmacaulay culkin is not at his best here his best performance would have to be in an earlier john hughes film named uncle buck where he had more of a cute charm than an acting charm here he could barely act his way out of a plastic bag fortunately with great performances by john heard catherine ohara pesci and stern his bad acting is long forgotten by the time we become absorbed into the filmjohn heard and catherine ohara bring kevins parents to life they seem almost complete opposites kevins father peter heard is very calm and laidback his mother kate ohara is extremely nervous almost all the time fretting throughout the film she is aggravated very easily and like all mothers her instinctive nature to care for her child is what drives her to the point she goes to in the filmand then theres pesci and stern my favorite lot of the film they perfectly blend humor pain and aggravation to the filmpescis character harry is very strict easily agitated and picks on marv for a great many things marv the stereotypical tall stupid one is completely stupid he does things that would make a hamster blush yet he is the character i have found many like the most mainly because he is so stupid you have to feel sorry for him stern brings a great trait to the character of marv and i am very pleased he got the part its a hard choice to decide which baddie is better so i just say i like them both the sameall in all is probably the best christmas movie to rise out of the film industry in the last twenty years it seamlessly blends humor pain emotion human instinct and some great boobytraps all into one little bundle this film has stood the test of time greatly455 stars ,comedy
the overwhelming success of it spawned two sequels is enough to guarantee that most people will love this story of a family that departs for paris on the christmas holidays mistakenly leaving an eightyear old boy to fend for himself and fend he does when burglars threaten to break in unless he can rig enough boobytraps to keep them outthats the simple plot in a nutshell macaulay culkin seems to have no problem carrying most of the film with a wide variety of looks gestures and expressionsbut for my money its daniel stern and joe pesci who get the main laughs as the bumbling burglars intent on outwitting the kids trapsothers in the cast dont have as much to do but do well enough by their roles particularly catherine ohara and john heard as the parents who only discover on the plane that kevin is missing the laughs are steady the color photography is great and the slight story is probably every boys fantasy of what it might be like to be left add to that the holiday flavor of christmas and a pleasant musical score by john williams and you have the makings of a classic the proof is in the puddingthey must have done something right,comedy
is a hilarious film about a young boy macaulay culkin who is accidently left home during the christmas holidays after the rest of his family goes to europe  at first culkin loves the situation but soon he is scared to death when he learns that burglars joe pesci and daniel stern are targeting his house  however culkin is pretty smart for an eightyearold and he has plans for them when they attack  chris columbus direction is smart and so is the overachieving screenplay  this film has a little bit of something for everyone and the fact that the backdrop is the christmas holidays only makes it that much more special  all the performers do well and in the end the film also does  4 stars out of 5,comedy
in the eighties john hughes churned out a handful of movies and scored many many hits quite rightly as most of them were seriously funny  im definitely not referring to curly sue so relax in one particular scene from uncle buck macaulay culkin interrogates a babysitter through the letterbox to make sure shes not a baddie this inspired hughes to write a whole new movie who would have known that this and its sequel would go on to become two of the biggest hits of all time both hughes and chris columbus seem to prefer setting their movies during the holiday season gremlins planes trains  automobiles christmas vacation and manage to pull them off without too much sentiment or sickening amounts of gooey lovethere are two reasons why was such a big success the first is that its about a kid who outsmarts grownups something that happens every day only theres a worldwide conspiracy of silence this movie yells it out loud and clear the second is john williamss magical score which elevates the movie way above slapstick family fare to something more serious and regarded it was nominated for an academy award along with the christmas carol somewhere in my memory but lost to john barrys dances with wolves damn in a mad rush to the airport one morning the maccallister family forget one little thingkevin culkin he is an eightyearold kid who wants nothing better than a peaceful christmas and some time to himself its hard for him to get this when living in a house with seven other peoplethe exact same house from planes trains and automobiles dont you know0 with the rest of the maccallisters in paris kevin runs wild doing whatever he wants eating whatever he wants and watching whatever tv show he wantsbut theres one major problem the wet bandits harry joe pesci and marv daniel stern are on the prowl and have knocked off every other house in kevins street his is next and seeing that hes manofthehouse now he has to defend itusing whatever tools are at his disposal rusty nails blow torches micro machines he sets up a labyrinth of booby traps so that the wets cant break in their idiotproof determination proves to be their downfall as they are tortured and tornup upon entering kevins domainalthough this is not the only point of the film there is an important message that family is what really matters to a child or to anyone and having them home for the holidays is better than wandering a huge house all by yourselfthere are some movies that work best at christmas and this is one of them im not saying that in a couple of decades it will be the new its a wonderful life but it will be remembered fondly at the very leastdont be a scrooge its christmastime go rush to check out ,comedy
this type of family comedy truthfully works better if you are grown up with the stooges  because this film has a climactic scene with more slapstick than most can take  i can though  but if you think this is strictly a kids film parents will like it too i bet the plot follows a kid macaulay kulkin who gets left behind in a chicago suburb while his family leaves for paris  and though the house is all his 2 burglars joe pesci and daniel stern who give the best onscreen duo of 1990 want the house  but not without the climax  while most of the film is unbelievable both good and bad most of the film should keep families in good spirits unless parents dont enjoy seeing pesci getting his head on fire and stern screaming like a girl  funny even if its not john hughes writerproducer here best  b,comedy
is one of the most popular movies from the early 90s its success was phenomenal and it also made macaulay culkin a superstarthe plot is quite original and surreal a child who is and capable of making the banditss lives miserable sure its an impossible story but who cares far from being a perfect movie it is however okay and fun to watch entertaining and contains slapstick humor too although i dont like some of the language used our story takes place in chicago at christmas time which makes this a christmas film in fact the movie has lots of christmas decorations lights snow and many other details which create the feeling and magic so characteristic of christmas to accent the christmas atmosphere even more there are a cup of nice christmas carols such as rockin around the christmas tree performed by brenda lee youre a mean one mr grinch white christmas carol of the bells oh holly night and have yourself a merry little christmas and some brilliant instrumental musicskevin mccallister is the hero of the story hes not just any kid hes a very smart one he also knows all about the intentions of the wet bandits harry and marv and prepares them lots of unexpected surprises their lives wont be easy with kevin defending his house sure they are the villains and as such they get what they deserve but they do suffer a lot too we almost feel sorry for themthe wet bandits were nicknamed like that by marv because their calling card according to him was to let the water running in every houses they robbed that said both wet bandits are hilarious harry is more cranky while marv is the most stupid of the two although both are stupid and maybe thats why people tend to sympathize more with him marvs stupidity also makes him the funniest of the two marv is the typical tall and clumsy guy with no brain a bit like averell dalton from the lucky luke comicsthe movie has lots of funny moments the funniest for me is when harry and marv pretend to be santa claus and his elf and the way harry speaks in that scene followed by the even funnier part when kevin fires at harrys pants whenever kevin fools the bandits in a try to make them believe the whole family is at home when kevin is all alone is funny too for some reason i also find funny whenever kevin screams maniacally particularly when he says hes not afraid anymore and sees old marley and screams out loudthe scenes which kevin fools and scares the little neros pizza boy and marv with the gangster film angels with filthy souls are hilarious but in the case of the pizza boy it is unfair for him there was no need to scare the hell out of him  he was just delivering pizza and wasnt after kevinold marley is an interesting character i always felt sorry for him because of the lies buzz tells about him and the man never did anything bad to anyone buzz is a jerk and uncle frank is even worse buzz is mean for kevin and uncle frank openly dislikes kevin when uncle frank tells kevin look what you did you little jerk kevins parents should tell him something like frank stay out of this and shut upthe church is magnificent its one of the biggest and most beautiful churches ive ever seen in a movie macaulay culkin is terrific as the clever kid kevin mccallister joe pesci and daniel stern are awesome as the wet bandits and roberts blossom is great as the character old marley its also delightful to see john candy as gus polinski the polka king of the midwest,comedy
an eight year old boy is left at christmas when his family leave for a france vacation not realizing he isnt on the plane with them two crooks attempt to rob the family home and it is up to kevin to protect the place is one of my all time favourite christmas movies i couldnt get enough of it as a kid growing up there was something powerful as a child seeing another child around the same age face the bad guys and be able to defeat them is basically about a family that leaves for vacation but in the rush of getting out on time they forget that young kevin mccallister was not with them on their way to the airport so while they take off for paris kevin wakes up to find that he is all alone in this gigantic house its all fun and games at first for kevin until he discovers that a pair of thieves plan on robbing his house thinking that the place is empty whiz kid kevin sets up a number of booby traps and set ups that severely injure the bandits examples include one of the thieves named harry getting his head set on fire the other marv gets hit in the head with an iron these kind of stunts could kill a person in real life but the magic of movies allows the bandits to shake it off and continue their mischiefthe acting in is top notch macaulay culkin is brilliant as kevin mccallister the scared yet empowered young boy who takes on the wet bandits those bandits are played by joe pesci and daniel stern who add so much to the film with their performance and you get some good screen time from stars such as catherine ohara john heard and even john candy the traps that kevin sets are smart and witty and the location shots are perfect for the tricks he has planned for harry and marvall in all is a classic film not only for christmastime but all year round this should be seen by everyone at least once810,comedy
my all time favorite film macaulay culkin did superbly as a child actor but as he grew up he simply disappeared into oblivion his last good film being ritchie rich 1994 liveaction film adaptation of the harvey comics comic book character richie richso from his highest grossing film to richie rich is only a 4 year reign in this film we have the pairing of two talented actors in joe pesci and daniel sterni really like the way this guy acts  his sense of humor they are a pair of burglars harry lyme pesci and marv merchants stern specializing in housebreaking when the occupants are off on holiday this time its on christmas the mccallisters have planned a trip to paris meanwhile harry has his sights set on the mccallister househowever things dont necessarily go as planned kevin has been forgotten at home and the mccallisters realize this too late now kevin is all alone against a duo of hardened professional crooks 2 vs 1 is not a fair fightor so you thinkwhat happens next is why this film has become the most grossing american comedy film of 1990 i wont reveal what happens next so either go see it at a cinema you like or watch it on dvdcable or online or buy the dvd either at a dvd store or online this film has a decent sequel 2 lost in new york which follows the further mishaps in the life of kevinother macaulay culkin films worth seeinghaving uncle buck the good son my girl getting even with dad and richie rich,comedy
this movie made me very warm a little boy is fighting thieves he is act smartlyso drive back thieves i felt a warm heart of family i was impressed last scene it made me cry there are my favorite scene the house was decorated beautifully with christmas ornaments it really beautiful i like very much it actually i like christmas ornaments my family like christmas ornaments too so my house do it moreover the music of this movie is also wonderful i can heal it even by music this movie made me think of winter when the winter of every year comes in japan it broadcasts it is a very popular in japan movie all children and adults was loved,comedy
there is no film to put beside by way of comparison it is a film genre of its own i read and hear reviews of this movie that express disgust and horror and i picture john hughes chuckling this was the intent it was meant to upset the status quo and in politically correct times that we live in isnt it a small surprise to see this film come to the forefront again this is a movie that will freak out the uptight for as long as it exists in any media it was meant to as much as clockwork orange talked about ultraviolence this movie is all about ultrabad pranks we can numb ourselves to sex and violence but is a movie you just will never get used to there will be something in this movie that will get to you as a last resort to make sure everyone is offended before you leave the theatre john includes the always discussed paint can scene no reason for this scene except to make sure he gets you and also to make sure you leave talking about it obviously filmed on a budget and using hughes stock cast this is a movie simply about a young kid whose parents forget him while they go on vacation all the characters are bizarre in one way or another this movie reminds me of rocky horror picture show in that everyone in the film has something odd about them and both movies joyfully celebrate these uniquenesses not a movie to buy for mom on mothers day but worth seeing just to say you did,comedy
angels with filthy soulswhen i first saw i thought this black and white gangster movie that inspires kevin was a real movie but i recently found out it wasnt and much effort into making the clip as authentic as possible vanity fair did a great writeup of the making of angels of filthy souls in the article inside the making of  s fake gangster movie by darryn king which was published online on 22 dec 15sure may not fit into the traditional canon no girl wistfully wishing for a house on 34th street but its one of my favorite christmas movies next to die hard of course in a way and die hard share similar themes of survival against the vicious criminals with the hero using his wits and ingenuity to fight back and ensure the crooks get their just desserts,comedy
is arguably one of the funniest movies ever its really good the cast is very good it was sweet to see john candy in it the team work of joe pesci and daniel stern is just not insanely hilarious but its also incredible that the two are so good together and i like how their scenes of punishment is followed right after the other i think john heard looks like bruce willis i like catherine ohara she is a fine actress look for larry hankin and roberts blossom john williams has another great score herethis is a perfect movie for people to watch around christmas and if you need a big laugh watch this as it will crack you up also i strongly recommend 2 it arguably funnier then this plus time curry brenda fricker and rod sell appears in it both movies are strongly recommended,comedy
im a young adult and not a huge fan of the kids movies these days some people would classify this as a kids movie but i think its more of a classic i grew up seeing this on tv every winter and its still one of my favorites the sequels are awful as are most sequelsbut the original is fantastic i still laugh when i watch it its really one of those feel good movies the kind that make you want to cuddle up on the couch with family and relax and enjoy itif you havent seen it yet youre missing out on a great christmas movie heck its even great for a rainy day watch it youll love it i wish it were on more often,comedy
the great virtue  its simplicity a story who escapes from surprises inspired use of clichs the role of life for the young culkin and family humor in a fascinating style short  one of the dreams of each child the great fear of each parent and the danger few lovely scenes so beautiful than defines the film as perfect the gags the resistance against bad guys the chaos behind the trip the competition between brothers are prepares for admirable meetings a christmas film but a real special one because it is one of great occasions for rediscover the beauty and joy and force of life as an unique form of miracle,comedy
its that time of year again the time of year when it is acceptable to binge on christmas films the first one i watched this year was it is a classic for me certainly a child hood favouritethe story is a very simple one kevin mccallister macaulay culkin is accidentally left at home over the christmas as his whole family fly to paris they board the plane without realising that they have left one of their children two small time robbers are also in the area looking to break into houses they target the mccallister household as they believe they are all away for the christmas holidays it is now up to kevin to protect his house from the burglars by setting up traps and playing pranks some of which are absolutely brilliant the two robbers marv  harry played by daniel stern  joe pesci give fantastic performances they portray the classic dumb  dumber routine harry thinks he is the brains and sees himself as the leader  marv plays the really stupid gullible one who falls for much more simple traps the on screen chemistry between these two and the relationship they have is fantastic it comes across very realistic and hilariousmacaulay culkin was 9 or 10 when was filmed and given such a big role with this much screen time must have been a big challenge but he walked it and gave a very convincing performance the films are pretty much all he has been known for which is a shame really he had a few other films but none are as wellknown and successful as these of course this isnt the most realistic films and it does have massive plot holes and ridiculous scenarios but who cares its fun its christmassy  its got great characters with some truly hilarious momentsoverall is a very fun movie i have the relation to it as it was always on at christmas when i was a child but even if this isnt the case im sure many adults who are new to this will love it just the same as us who have fond memories of watching it as a child810,comedy
reviewis a warm family comedy film made in 1990 it was written and produced by john hughes and was directed by chris columbus the main part of kevin mccallister is played by macaulay culkin his parents are played by john heard and catherine ohara and the villains the wet bandits are played by joe pesci and daniel stern the signature tune is made by john williams musician of star wars harry potter and lord of the rings 20th century fox bought the plan for from warner bros and upped the budget for the movie by 4 million it turned out as a bargain for 20th century fox because it raked in 476684675 at the box office and as of 2009 was the highest grossing comedy of all time the mccallisters go to paris for christmas however their eightyearold son kevin is left behind after sleeping in and not being awoken but being forgottenbad parenting in the mothers defence she moves heaven and earth attempting to get back to her son at first kev loves being alone by himself in his house eating junk food jumping on beds watching scary movies going through his brothers personal belongings without anyone telling to do otherwise but eventually the young boy has to fight for himself and his home as two wannabe robbers plan to raid his house he does this while helping repair the broken family of a man who once scared the life out of him can an eightyearold really manage to do this mend cook clean and kick butt after writing my hobbit review i reread my previous reviews and of course i came across my 2 review it stated that the s were really good christmas films and conveniently my parents had bought me the box set the previous daygood parenting so i decided to do some christmassy things decorated the cake that my grandad baked and put up my tree whilst watching it this movie is just as good as its sequel which means this film has to be quality because number two had an automatic advantage due to the fact it was in new york this film is the first of its kind an individual not repetitive a breath of fresh air which i pointed out its sequel review john hughes must have been just as tired as me with boring ol movies that are remade every year he must have had to rack his brains for a while in order to think up a plot like that its pure random gold anyway i love this film the plot is magic the actors are magic the music is magic and i think it well deserves to be the highest grossing comedy of all time i think thats why its followup had to be something special in order to not be one of the biggest movie let downs of all time and thats why three and four were so well done john hughes and chris columbus for one and two not three and four because they were a massive let down rating 8310best parts kevins initial reaction to being left alone the booby trap fight the ending oh how cute,comedy
kevin mccallister is part of a huge family including his big brother buzz and his uncle frank and he feels that everyone is against him because his parents dont like his behavior and he gets sent up to the attic and wishes he never had to see his family againkevin is accidentally left while his family is on vacation and of course he is very happy about making his family disappear but now he has to defend himself and his house from two burglarsthis is a funny and well directed movie with great preformances and it will never get old,comedy
if you dont like then youre either a robot or a zombie was one of the best comedies of 1990macauley culkin plays kevin mcallister who as the title suggests is left when his family goes on a trip at first he enjoys life as he gets the run of the house but soon starts to miss his family then things get worse as two bumbling burglars played by daniel sterns and joe pesci target his housealthough i was an adult when i watched this film i could still see why kevin mcallister appealed to kids around the world what child hasnt wished they could spend some time alone in their house free to stay up and do what they want there are some fun scenes throughout especially one when the pizza delivery man comes callingthe burglars are very well played by daniel sterns and joe pesci both as clumsy as each other at first kevin fools them making them believe he is not but they soon become wise to his act and break inthat is when the fun starts as kevin uses dozens of household items to fight them everything from irons which he uses to hit their heads to christmas decorations with sharp ends which daniel sterns steps onits hard not to thoroughly enjoy a film like this especially as it appeals to all of us adults and children who have wished we could just have the house to ourself and do what we please this is a great film which i thoroughly recommend and it was followed by two great sequels,comedy
has a rather thin plot but makes up for it with all that cartoonlike violence joe pesci and daniel stern give wonderful performances and are the best thing in this movie macaulay culkin is an okay actor nothing special but okay is best watched during the holidays that is when it can be most enjoyed,comedy
if you like a really good family film at christmas then theres a big difference there is no family in this film or at least for most of it the mccallister family are preparing a christmas holiday to paris the night before they leave the youngest child of the family causes trouble and is sent to bed early he wishes that the family would disappear the next morning the family leave and realise when they are in paris that they have forgot one thing kevin golden globe nominated macaulay culkin kevin now has all the fun that he wants only problem is that two crooks harry and marv joe pesci and daniel stern are trying to get into the large house to loot it this is just wonderful for goofy live action gags kids entertainment and christmas fun also starring john heard as peter mccallister roberts blossom as marley and catherine ohara as kate mccallister it was nominated for the oscars for best music for john williams and best song for somewhere in my memory it won the british comedy award for best comedy film and it was nominated the golden globe for best motion picture  comedymusical it was number 22 on the 100 greatest family films and it was number 17 on the 100 greatest christmas moments very good,comedy
my favorite movie is i think that this movie is interesting because kevin is intelligent about science if i defend my house i can not defend my house as him my most interest scene is kevin fight thief i think this scene is laughed scene i really like this scene and i also like kevins intelligent because i dont have his intelligent idea by the way there is a sequel in this movie i think that interesting movie is a sequel i also like these movies sequel but i have not remind this movie scene i remind only scene is happy end this movie is representing family is important i think also kevin is lonesome,comedy
i have reviewed over 400 c h r i s t m a s  movies and specialsbeware of some reviewers that only have only one review when its a positive there is a good chance they were involved with the production now i have no agenda i am honest i review movies  specials as a way to keep track of what i have seen i have discovered many gems in my quest to see as many christmas movies as i can maybe the most successful christmas movie of all time and its easy to understand why the film made macaulay culkin a household name and the biggest child star since shirley temple in this film a child get left behind on accident in his chicago home while his family has flown off for christmasthis film takes place in chicago the mccallister family is preparing for a christmas vacation in paris on the night before their departure the entire family gathers at peter and kates home where their son kevin is ridiculed by his siblings and cousins after a scuffle with his older brother buzz kevin is sent to the third floor of the house where he wishes that his family would disappear during the night heavy winds cause damage to power lines which causes the alarm clocks to reset consequently the family oversleeps in the confusion and rush to get to the airport in time to catch their flight kevin is accidentally left behindlater kevin wakes up to find the house empty and thinking his wish has come true is overjoyed with his newfound freedom however kevins joy turns to fear as he encounters his next door neighbor old man marley who is rumored to have murdered his family with a snow shovel in 1958 he also encounters the wet bandits harry and marv a pair of burglars who have been breaking into other vacant houses in the neighborhood and have targeted the mccallisters house kevin initially manages to keep them away by making the house look as if the family is home but they eventually realize the deceptionthis film is one of the best christmas movies however at first it is a little slow on the setup,comedy
this an absurd storyline hollywood loves to show movies in which kids are smarter than adults for some reason also we are expected to believe a big family can go all the way to the airport and then fly to france before finding out one of their kids was left at home i dont think so i know a lot of big families and this would neverinamillion years happenhowever its just a movie and it isnt real and you cant take any of it seriously thus the idea is to go along with the wild premise and enjoy the antics that followand there are plenty of thosea share of the credit for the big success of this film should go to god who made maccaulay culkins face without it i doubt this would have been anywhere near the hit is was but culkins cuteness helps makes you root for him and his facial expressions provide a lot of laughs he turned out to be a fine child actorthe two guys joe pesci and daniel stern that play incompetent crooks are funny and some of the humor is clever although slapstick rules in this filmthere are some really nice messages in here such as families suck says the kid oh well some think this film did too i am not a big fan of it but i did enjoy it along with most other people i thought the sequel was better though,comedy
when it comes to enjoying that jolly time of year there are several movies that must be viewed or else it just isnt christmas one of those is 1990s written and produced by the late great john hughes and directed by chris columbus it follows the story of young kevin mccallister played by macaulay culkin arguably the best child actor since shirley temple whos constantly picked on and looked down upon by his large extended family but especially by his older and much hated brother buzz devin ratray in what has to be his best role on the eve of the big family vacation kevin lashes out and gets sent to the attic by his impatient mom the talented and ravishing catherine ohara and right then kevin makes the prophetic wish of never seeing his family again little does he know his wish is about to come true when due to a convenient power outage his parents alarm clocks fails to go off and the result is sheer holiday hell as everybody scrambles like theres no tomorrow to catch that flight everybody that is except little kevin whos forgotten by everyone and as the title says is left shock turns to happiness as kevin realizes his wish has come truebut its not all fun and games as two naughty burglars harry and marv joe pesci and daniel stern who give a wonderful performance together as the two bumbling thieves are on the rampage in kevins neighborhood rather than running away like most kids might do kevin decides to fight back using his creativity and some simple but potentially bone shattering traps it all might sound like a simple holiday comedy to be watched and then put away but theres something more to the film that keeps me and many others coming back year after year to be sure the physical comedy of harry and marv getting their asses handed to them by kevins traps is nothing short of a laugh riot traps include anything from heated door handles to slippery stepsbut the film also manages to include a lot of heart as kevin slowly but surely begins to realize that family is what the holidays are all about and without them its pretty lonely a lesson he learns first hand by the at first feared but then loved neighborhood recluse old man marley the late great character actor robert blossom john williams score to this is undoubtedly one of his best as it is both grand and yet not overbearing in the least on the contrary it manages to invoke the spirit of christmas in all of us while giving us the chills because of its beauty and of course who can forget the performance of macaulay culkin since the film rests on his shoulders more than anything else with his mischievous grin and resourcefulness we just cant help but love his character and root for him all the way through the film i should also mention that the movie includes a small but very memorable performance by the legendary john candy try not to laugh at the conversation he has with kevins mom in the back of the van is one of those films that no matter how many times you might see it it just never gets old the movie is a time capsule in many ways because it somehow captured not only the holiday spirit but also the magic of the time it was made in the 90s a time where not only were the movies better but so was everything else it is for that reason that movie will live on forever and ever much like the spirit of christmas itself so without further adieu i urge you to watch this modern classic and if youre ever going on big trip with the family make sure that you have all your children also starring john heard and a host of other memorable actors merry christmas everyone,comedy
is a nostalgic film for me having watched it religiously when i was a young kid growing up roger ebert gave this film a 25 out of 4 he calls the film unrealistic and says that it goes in another direction from the original premiseplays on the scary scenario every kid fears at some point in their life kevin mccallister macaulay culkin is forgotten at home in chicago when his family rushes off to the airport for their trip to paris soon after kevin is visited by home invaders marv daniel stern and harry joe pesci and its up to him to stop themebert complains that this film deviates from the main premise and simply brings in stunt doubles and fills the film with wacky traps that would otherwise cost the mccallisters tens of thousands of dollars to accomplish what kevin does while this is not far from the true youre supposed to suspend some disbelief when watching thisi enjoy because an 8year old handles two grown up burglars i dont enjoy watching people getting hurt but i think in this case there is an exception the moral of the story is that even when youre young you can still be responsible and handle your home from being invaded it shows that its wrong to rob people and that even children can be heroeshowever i find that the sequel is much better than this and its due to the far superior story setup kevin being left was a great initial start and opening up to the opportunity of a follow up storyto review this film without the mention of macaulays acting is a crime macaulay portrays kevin with amazing talent and its great for the simple fact that the 90s werent really big for their child actors as far as i can remember macaulay is able to hit all ends of the acting spectrum showing being scared showing emotion and showing confidence and hilarious comedic relief too he was a great actor and i was sad to only see a few of his films before he retiredanother great point about being a cult classic is the musical score provided by legendary john williams he gives the film the final emotional touch that allows us to forever remember as being a classic film and never forget macaulays performance somewhere in my memory has always been a favourite track of mine by williams and its just a great piece of music on top of a great filmthis film is a classic for me and i would never say that this isnt a wonderful film despite being a tad bit unrealistic but the fact is most films exaggerate and force you to suspend disbelief dont allow for this film not to be a favourite because you dont think this sort of thing could happen,comedy
is a good family film i enjoyed it i saw the film with about 500 young children and it was an overwhelming experience although i didnt think the film was as funny as they did i had a great time listening to them laugh kids will laugh more than adults will but i think thats what this film is aiming to do,comedy
this movie is a classic in so many ways  macaulay culkin is brilliant in his most famous role  i have watched many times and have never tired of macs genius and incredible talent  its amazing how such a young actor can carry a movie with such seemingly effortless style and boundless enthusiasm the movie works on so many levels enjoy it as a carefree comic romp or a comment on the dysfunctionality of the modern family or a tribute to the independent spirit of the younger generation  culkin is a genius,comedy
from the john williams score to the terrific acting of literally every character to the wonderful plot this is not just one of the best christmas movies of all time but one of the best movies ever hard to believe how dumb some of the critics are must be a depressing existence,comedy
im 34 now and i watch all the corny cheesy xmas movies i love them but this is number 1 for me and 2 is my 2nd favourite yes its unrealistic and a little cheesy but my god its funny harry and marv are just as good as kevin in the movie with marv being particulary funny it has christmas spirit it has laughs galore some good acting and a decent but unrealistic story the kids will love it i only wish they made the 3rd with the same characters it could genuinley have been one of the greatest trilogies ever made how its at 75 on here is beyond me the best christmas movie ever made a classic,comedy
the first time i saw this film was when i was a child and it pleased me a lot because i only saw its comic side i saw it recently and it disappointed me although the story is original during christmas holidays the mccallister family decided to celebrate christmas at paris unfortunately they forgot one of their children first of all kevin is elated but he realizes that two thieves want to burgle his house in order to get rid of them he puts in several traps the thieves are under arrested and kevin finds again his family if i had to choose one adjective to judge this film it would be the term conventional several sides of the film are showing it for example kevins family seem to ignore and despise him and consequently he feels rejected and outraged and at the end his family and especially his mother discovers how much she loves him moreover they say that kevins neighbour is a killer and hes got a wicked reputation but kevin finds out that hes not a murderer and he had an unhappy life not only is the film conventional but the screenplay is sometimes predictable  when kevin finds out that is he wants to have fun as much as he can and finer feelings are often put forward  nevertheless daniel stern and joe pesci the two thieves are very entertaining and the sequence where they have to endure kevins traps is very funny at last i think that this film was especially made for children and young teenagers and it was useless to make it follow by two poor sequels,comedy
it is recommended because it is excellent because it has excellent history excellent script and is a movie for the whole family and because the performances are the best of all excellent christmas movie and masterpiece by chris columbusexcellent movie i loved the performance of macaulay culkin the best joe pesci and daniel stern also the best performance of all i wonder what happened to macaulay culkin  is a movie to see as a family a movie to watch at christmas i loved 10 points and the man with the excellent shovel as i said the best performance of all the part that kevin puts the tarantula to the thief marv daniel stern killed me with laughter and the face that joe pesci puts on when he leaves in the police car made me laugh safety pin very recommended i suppose everyone saw it the one who did not see it i recommend it you can see it it is a film suitable for all audiences the mccalister family goes on vacation to france they leave kevin macaulay culkin alone at home kevin learns to fend for himself and even protect himself cheat him and confront some thieves who come to harrys house joe pesci and marv daniel stern are two thieves who intend to raid all the closed houses in their neighborhood when his mother realizes that he forgot about him he makes a trip back to chicago to recover his son its fun entertaining comical dramatic and also for the christmas season,comedy
well theres 5 but theres only one series and no matter how many movies try to copy the idea none of them will ever come close to the original this is one of the most enjoyable fun movies ever made and will continue to be for years to comeis such an iconic christmas movie and there isnt a year goes by without it appearing on our televisions over the festive period it is such a crowdpleaser a movie that can be enjoyed by anyone regardless of age and movie preference frankly if you dont like there must be something wrong with youmerry christmas ya filthy animals,comedy
its not without its flaws thats for sure the acting isnt amazing some plot points arent great and it doesnt have a dialogue thats anything special but this is an american treasure i would never call it one of the top 10 movies ive ever seen but it is definitely one of my top 10 favorite movies its a movie that if you havent watched you havent lived its one of the most defining christmas movies with values and life lessons entrenched in the plot its just such a fun movie that everyone will love even if they dont think its a great movie in and of itself its kind of hard to explain but you just have to watch this movie if youve never seen it you definitely wont regret it,comedy
in the movie kevin does a great job making his character likable and fun to watch the bad guys in the movie depict not so smart villains but create a slapstick style comedy for the whole family to enjoy this is a great holiday movie to sit down and watch with your family although the movie is unrealistic it is a movie so thats ok the creative traps set by kevin let the viewed think of what else they might do to protect their house against burglaries grab a cup of hot chocolate popcorn friends and family and enjoy this classic,comedy
is a very funny christmas classic of the early 1990s i thought that this film would be good but its much better than that the story is about a young child whose family leaves him at home when they all go to paris two dimwitted burglars realize that as well they planned on robbing the house with no one in their way little did they know that kevin would be the hero of the household the acting in this film is good especially the robbers played by joe pesci and daniel stern they were the funniest part of the film i also like the music in this film then again i always liked john williams music the only thing a little wrong is the violence a pg13 rating would have been more suitable otherwise this is perfect i rate this film a 1010,comedy
take a cheeky eightyearold put him in a situation he has to slapstick his way out of with the kind of antics most cartoon characters wouldnt survive and what you have is one of the most wildly popular commercially successful comedies of all time  and when its over though most likely youll have had a good time youll be tempted to ask the question  why because directed by chris columbus and written by john hughes is mediocre at best though it does have its moments  its a matter of the filmmakers being very astute perhaps and wisely mixing in a potpourri of elements with universal appeal and touching upon that common nerve they calculated would give just about anyone in the audience something to which they could relate  and they were right  kids christmas family vacation independence a scary situation its all in here  but interestingly enough it lacks the sentimental value that would seemingly have made this a movie one could truly embrace  as it is its engaging fare but somehow manages to keep the viewer at arms length  then again maybe thats even part of the appeal it may be that audiences at this particular time and place were more comfortable just watching without having to invest anything of themselves in order to have a good time,comedy
everybody tries hard but doesnt work nearly as well as its popularity suggests macaulay culkin became a household name starring as kevin mccallister a precocious eightyearold accidentally left behind when his family heads out on a holiday vacation if fending for himself werent enough kevin must also contend with two bumbling burglars joe pesci and daniel stern who have targeted the family homei first saw when i was 10 years old i didnt find it at all funny then and its genius still eludes me the alleged humor that everyone seems to love stems mainly from a series of violent booby traps kevin sets up to stop the bad guys among the deterrents the burglars so wittingly fall for is a redhot doorknob looks painful but hardly funny the film tries to handle such physical abuse like an old road runner cartoon but when the action involves real people instead of an animated coyote something is lostyet isnt a total disaster the performances are great and the story is at times quite charming particularly the subplot involving the supposedly scary old neighborhood man interestingly the sequel  2 lost in new york  marked a notable improvement,comedy
this is just one movie that i cannot stand  i am not wild about movies that are mainly about kids who get the best of adults and this definitely fits the bill as one of those movies  what really gets me is this kid would not have gotten into all the trouble he did if he wasnt such a brat  the family is trying to organize this big trip with all these other relatives and all the their younger son can do is whine and complain  i dont want to sleep with that kid i have to have my pizza a certain way stuff like thatand he is supposed to be the kid we are pulling for  we get to see him left alone and do all the things kids do when they are left alone watch black and white old movies  yes and this kid is such a wimp that a black and white mobster pick scares him  though he uses it so wisely later in the movie yeah right that would work  this kid somehow outsmarts the two thieves even though earlier one of them is smart enough to impersonate a police officer and check all the security of the houses in the neighborhood i guess his intelligence went down a notch or two  then there are the many clever traps that usually consist of someone getting hit in the groin areaha ha ha  it is always so funny to see someone get hit there and writhe in agony  all in all this is just one bad movie that i did not care for at all  i just wish the kid got into some kind of trouble for all the problems he caused,comedy
i had never seen this and got the opportunity recently when the child in my life begged to rent it as she had heard wonderful things about iti expected fluff a simplistic plot and two hours of enduring the smarmy child actor macauley culkin not too bad a trade off so that the child would enjoy a movie she wanted to seeoh dear halfway through it i looked at her and said what would you rate this one out of 10 5 was the response we are expected to believe that an 8 year old who cannot tie his own shoelaces comes up with incredible booby traps for some burglars who want to rob the house rigging lines between trees heating up door knobs to name very few out of many one with a masters in engineering would not be able to figure out most of thembut the very worst features were these dimbulb parents who sit in first class while their children go unsupervised in economy on a flight to paris 9 hours peoplewho cannot fire up a brain cell between them in paris to get the police childrens aid emergency services they never have friends and relatives in hollywoodlandto go to the house and get the childhow hard is it to count your children when you have only three the child has not been streetproofed and does not know to call 911 either and on and onit is one of the most appalling movies i have ever seen at the end the child and i agreed 4 out of 10the old man roberts blossom was sweet and catherine ohara whom i normally admire is right up there with horror moms of all time,comedy
when i heard daniel stern speak at lewis  clark college in september 2004 about his uso tour in iraq he said that while had a bunch of silly gags at least it only had them once the sequel just repeated everything when you think about it that makes sense this movie was funny the first time i certainly loved it when i saw it in the theaters but not much after that i gotta ask what happened to john hughes in the 80s he made movies like the breakfast club ferris buellers day off and planes trains  automobiles in the 90s he got into dropping things on peoples heads think and babys day out oh well life goes on and for the record daniel stern also said that when he was in iraq some iraqi children recognized him from this movie that made him understand the reach of american culture,comedy
this is an odd one i cant tell you how many times ive seen this film yet every time is like the first it just makes no lasting impression and im always left feeling kind of cheated the real problem here is that the only truly entertaining thing in the filmnot the only funny mind you are the scenes of kevin scaring off the burglars and the finalewhich i wont write here in case anyone reading this review hasnt seen the film yet thats it the rest of the film sure there are funny scenes lines and such but no real entertainment the scenes of kevin by himself in the house doing adult stuff are cute but once youre over the age of ten you wont really find them entertaining or funny maybe you wont even see the charm im certain i must have seen in the scenes when i was younger so what are we left with plenty of humor some of which actually works and a few scenes of entertainment about ten minutes of actual entertainment scattered over just over 100 minutes of film thats just not enough the plot is decent but derivative and unoriginal the characters are cardboard cutouts the acting is fine but no one is particularly impressive john williams score is pretty good what really bugs me about this film is the portrayal of violence as fun and ok as long as its against criminals this is a film for children is it really a good idea to show violence like that to make it fun and ok i recommend this film only to people who are too smart to copy it and it helps if you have a childish sense of humor 610,comedy
is one of those movies that gets better every time i see it ive always been a fan  i saw it when it first came out at movieworld in douglaston ny but each year i find myself enjoying it more and more i laugh at new jokes every time i watch thats no neat trick macaulay culkin should have won an oscar hes terrific i keep forgetting how small he is until the wet bandits hang him on the coat rack towards the end hes a little boy yet he carries a whole movie its amazing the scene that puts in the classic movie category is the church scene its one of the top ten greatest scenes of all time its all about forgiveness it always is merry christmas,comedy
i do like this movie even if it makes zero sense it would take a very disturbed child to think all of these traps up and two immortals to survive all the injuries they suffered if you can ignore logic for a while though its a fine film,comedy
this film really is a must for both children and grownups it tells the funny story of a boy who is left home at christmas by his numerous family when the house is attacked by robbers he does his best and succeeds to keep the house safe and teach the robbers a lesson and in the meantime he has lots of fun macaulay culkin is fab as the boy and joe pesci plays a magnificent part as one of the robbers this fun filled film will keep you posted in the couch laughing with tears and if you like true comedies then this is perfect for you so if you havent yet seen i  ii youd better get down to business enjoy,comedy
a fun family film for the holidays macaulay culkin stars as a young inadvertently left behind at christmas when his parents go on holiday who foils some inept housebreakers played delightfully by daniel stern and joe pesci from the great john hughes this one is still nice to pop into the vcr at times just to ask yourself what ever happened to that handsome little kid catherine ohara john heard and john candy costar,comedy
wasstill is a wonderful movie its perfect to watch through the holiday season this movie did not disappoint it has a great cast and a great storyline it has laughter throughout the movie love and thrilling moments as well a film,comedy
its a movie that i really have laughed at in certain sections the plotline is also interesting as it takes place during christmasgreat classic,comedy
is a classic comedy and adventure movie which was made in 1990 it stars macaulay culkin kevin who played kevin the movie does a great job showing some themes like broken family kevin is left alone by himself not on purpose but he has to take responsibility he is brave and doesnt fear anyone also the movie raises a variety of scary moments strange noises play an important role those normally scare children but for kevin it didnt scare him when the bad guys were trying to kidnap him he set traps for them meaning he was not scared of anyone his ingenuity approach to problems kept the movie entertaining and always kept me to my seat wondering what would happen next i would rate this a 4 out of 5 this is one of my favorite movies,comedy
directed by chris columbus is easily the best christmas comedy ever made growing up with this film means theres definitely a sentimental love for it but upon recent viewing i can really see why this movie has been loved for decades the writing casting and direction is prefect is such a well made film the performances are some of the best in the genre the script is so compelling with its successful humour and authentic line delivery one thing that makes this movie so memorable is the outstanding score by john williams he captures everything from the christmas spirit to moments of serious tension this movie also contains such a deep message around family with necessary character arcs which are able to relate to both adults and children will forever be a christmas classic so therefore i give it a 9,comedy
its a comedy and family film it was released in 1990its directed by chris columbus and john hughes is the directorthe main actors are macaulay culking who plays kevin joe pesci who plays harry and daniel stern who plays marvin kevin is a boy and he lives in england he lives in the biggest home with his family cousins unclefor christmas his family go to paris and go watch the filmim a fan of this film its so funny kevin is brave and he doesnt get scared he builds traps to keep burglars its an amazing filmkevin runs around its a great cast because macaulay culking kevin is the most talented actorthe soundtrack is stressful its a great film and to me its the best film ive ever seen the cast is perfect the music is perfect but there arent visuals effects,comedy
i remember this coming out and to be fair i remember it taking the world by storm or at least kids worldsi even remember having to preorder it in woolworths and then going back on release day with my ticket as if i had found one of the 5 golden tickets from charlie and the chocolate factory haha macaulay culkins performance is brilliant as is pesci  sterns who play the bungling thieves perfectlyits surprising how quickly this film has become most peoples go to christmas film its not christmas until you have seen the film is well shot the location scouts selected the mccallister residence brilliantly to be fair this has to be one of if not the most iconic properties on filmthe whole thing is just perfect and to top it off john williams created the score for it  10 out of 10 all day long i never tire of this film and it always gives you the feel good factor,comedy
this film was definitely loved when it came out and now its seen as a christmas classic do i agree with that well yes in different ways then others see it i saw this recently after many years of not seeing it with a more critical mindset its a decent movie but its not great you see when i say its a christmas classic i dont mean its a great movie my reason for my usage of the term christmas classic is because there arent many great christmas movies out there besides elf and christmas story there arent a lot of great christmas moviesit certainly is a good movie to watch around christmas but it does have its flaws and problems macaulay culkin is pretty good in this movie as well as joe pesci and daniel stern but the rest of the actors arent too good the story has a lot of flaws first of all why doesnt kevin go to a friends house surely not everyone he knows has gone to paris or something he lives in a suburban neighbourhood in chicago with a bunch of people and he cant go to a friends house all these flaws i can kinda look past but i cant pretend theyre not there this film is good but not great,comedy
i havent watched for a long time so i wacthed this film yesterday on my television and i gotta say it still holds up 28 years later is one of the funniest adn delightful christmas films of all time i would love to watch this movie againso the story is about a young boy named kevin maccallister who gets aaccidently left home during christmas after his family goes to europe at first kevin loves the situation but learns that two burglars are targetting the houseso i watched this film yesterday and i enjoyed every second of it the performance of macaulay culkin as kevin is great and for an eight year old boy he is very smart the burglars played by daniel stern and joe pesci are also great and fun to watchhowever it does have its problems there are a couple of times where kevin uses the tv to talk instead of speaking i understand the situation but there are at times where some of if could be cut outbesides that this movie was awesome the performances were great and the hliarious moments where hilarious ill give it a 9 out of 10,comedy
how old is this film well the day im writing this its actually 28 years old but it really holds its own in the world of big cinematic releases at this time of year actually i cannot really think of any recent christmas orientated films that come close to thisits child star is macaulay culkin is a very good actor who with his funny expressions and fun characteristics make it a 1010 for me joe pesci and daniel stern really do add a very comedic side to it allstory is a family all rushing to get to the airport and what happens they leave a kid behind meanwhile the street they live on is having a spate of burglaries and when they get to the childs house they are in for a big surprisethis really is side splitting funny maybe a laurel and hardy take on things will give you some idea of the capers that occur great film with a laugh a minute,comedy
greatest holiday movie ever  so funny and hilarious ,comedy
best christmas movie ever not counting die hard,comedy
hands down my absolute favorite christmas movie all other holiday flicks pale in comparison,comedy
i think after this many years we can safely call this a classic and a true must watch ofthe holiday season,comedy
this movie is one that i would sit and watch at christmas even anytime its hilarious and i would really recommend it great for every audience,comedy
i think this is the best family movie of all time so i gave 10 stars its my childhood hobby to watch this i dont know how many times i watched if i see it on tv i can watch it again without doubt creatively written and well played movie,comedy
a magnificent vision from chris colombus a film for the family and for generations to come,comedy
the writers actors and production team smashed this out of the parkyou cant say anything else when here we are some 20 years later marvelling at just how good of a film it isa must see at christmas,comedy
a christmas classic that the whole family can watch and enjoy during the holidays,comedy
this is a very enjoyable christmas movie suitable for the entire family joe pesci and daniel stern are excellent as the bungling burglars all of the actors in kevins family are very good uncle frank is an annoying jerk as he is supposed to be as his part is written so the actor turns in a good performance causing the audience to truly dislike him as intended i do have some issues with the story line of this movie though kevin is portrayed as a troublemaker which he is most definitely not buzz is the troublemaker well played by devin ratray the audience is expected to dislike buzz the way buzz treats kevin is deplorable buzz is the true brat buzz is the instigator of all of the troubles yet he gets away with it and the relatively innocent kevin gets all the blame buzz is the one who should be punished not kevin this shows bad parenting on the part of kevins parents they punish the wrong son a good parent would realize that buzz is the instigator this bad parenting sends a wrong message i despise buzz good acting devin you made me hate buzz,comedy
i guess back in 1990 if you left your eight year old son for almost a week children services wouldnt get involved my how times have changed now you leave your kid alone for five minutes and children services and the media grill you on the five oclock news however had a good premise i suppose a boy defending his home against burglars over christmas breakwhat could possibly go wrong almost everything that could possibly happen thats what maccaulay culkin plays kevin mcallister who gets left thats when the antics start chris columbus did a great job directing the film from a story by john hughesjoe pesci and daniel stern costar as the bad guys who call themselves the wet bandits a duo who bumble and burglarize in the end though good wins out over evil and kevin is reuinted with his family,comedy
its hard to separate my feelings when watching now from the pure joy i felt when watching this movie as a kid i know there are flaws i know there are plot holes and i know the acting is overthetop at times but i still love this movie it still makes me laugh and it still makes me feel the christmas spirit i plan on making this film a holiday tradition as soon as my kids are old enough to know they shouldnt reenact certain scenes,comedy
i have loved ever since i was a little kid i dont remember a christmas where i havent watched the movie the plot is perfect and the way the actors portray the characters seems like a real familygroup of people i feel as if i have a real connection to the mccallister family and i feel like i am part of the family perhaps its because im an only child and maybe the black sheep of my family but i feel a strong connection to kevin and i understand what hes going through i also like the adults in the movie even if they are horrible for leaving kevin i am glad that hine alone was made when it was because the plot would be virtually impossible today while is marketed as a christmas film it is also a film that i can watch any time of the year often multiple times of the year,comedy
now dont get me wrong this movie is a classic for a reason its highly entertaining and macaulay culkin does as good an acting job as any child actor can be expected to especially when hes carrying the whole filmhowever the treatment of kevin by his family has not aged well at the beginning of the film his parents stand idly by while his uncle brother and cousins verbally abuse him angrily calling him a little jerk and a disease for doing nothing that was even that bad this will not sit well with modern audiences who will rightly say that if someone called their child that they would bichslap them and kick them out of their house the issue was not even addressed in the movie the parents did nothing to defend him and thus verbal abuse of small children was normalized given that its such a popular movie i would otherwise give it ten stars but this really stuck in my craw,comedy
i have loved this movie since it first came out it is a great family movie that my whole family enjoys there is action comedy and a lot of fun its a great movie for family night,comedy
a super classic full or memorable quotes moments and pretty much infinite replayabilitythe movie in its genre  intent delivers everything we need its entertainment at its higher level and the actors are all amazing i dont know why but it just works all of it from start to end,comedy
the strange slapstick turn that the silly third act takes is an odd choice which remarkably doesnt stunt the films growth but is still an odd departure from the relatively downtoearth proceedings that precede it its only because it acts as a natural extension to the expert character development already done that it slots in so successfully to end 1990 on an uproarious if strangely slightly sadistic note which represents the heros transformation from navely vulnerable to cunningly independent the layered screenplay puts everything in its perfectly imperfect place during the impeccable setup allowing for the forgetting of a child to become wholly believable and entirely empathetic and the wonderfully ostentatious performances place everything in a state of heightened reality ripe for ribtickling laughter and heartwarming sentiment a true christmas classic for any season 810,comedy
the music the booby traps the dysfunctional family memories during christmasthis movie will make you laugh so hard youll be rolling in the aislesperfect for viewing with the entire familybe nice to your loved ones,comedy
8 year old kevin mccallister macaulay culkin is accidentally left behind while his large family on a christmas holiday to parishe does everything all by himself such as eating junk while watching tv taking a shower shopping etche also sets up booby traps for two burglars harry and marv joe pesci and daniel stern who are trying to break into one of the houses on the street,comedy
this macaulay culkin as so much talent that he know how to entertainment the peoples around the world he lucky actor he made million of kid get funny also family and everyone who want to cast away they own problems of live i dont think an future remake as they do it today will be perfect as the original 2018 gen 12,comedy
best kid perdirmancetog all time mabye its really good anr a classic its so good its a perfect movie for christmas its funny it has serous things its emotional it has a really good score by john williums john candy is also a pretty small role but really good the mom is very good to but that big really of a role when you think about it and buzz of course has a great performance as a bully just a perfect movie really kevin is and bergalers break in and try to steal stuff kevin makes traps and hurts them the bergalers have great performances as well 1010,comedy
this is the perfect holiday movie to watch with the family it has fantastic funny moments and genuine emotional moments the acting is superb and the direction is perfect the movie is very smartly executed joe pesci is hilarious in this avatarthe boy who is accidentally left is very well enacted by mac the movie has the moral that family is important and that we cannot live without our irritating families,comedy
i know this is a triple f and triple c feelgood fun family and classic christmas comedy so youll forgive me to be a triple ass and introduce this review with a downer opening here it goeswere in 2017 john candy is comedy legend sadly of the dead sort since the mid90s john hughes died in the same untimely fashion eight years ago followed by robert old man marley blossoms two years later and john heard the father with such a lovable face has died this summer sorry to go on this eulogy but even roger ebert and gene siskel who gave two thumbs down to the movie because of its implausible narrative and sadistic treatment of the villains are also gone this is just to show how this 1990 classic is already surrounded by an aura of nostalgic sadnessof course chris columbus joe pesci and daniel stern are alive and much alive but look at macaulay culkin another sad example of the devastating effects of child stardom although hes probably richer than i but he didnt exactly follow the natalie portman path not even the anna chlumsky one whenever i see him on the screen i cant help but think of how this cute little face has turned to but there are so many sad things about the lives that contributed to the movie that it almost plays like a sort of shelter for laughs a time capsule for december 1990 or the whole early 90s where we can comfortably enjoy christmas in the lovable and cozy mccallister house and forget about the real stuff the time of a movieits funny that theres so much escapism in such an enclosed moviebesides watching again in 2017 allows us to appreciate a time where even a good oldfashioned comedy could hit the boxoffice jackpot and be the highest grossing movie no superheroes no transformers no magical superpowers the revolution was on march sure but it didnt take much at that time to draw audience to the theaters what counted was a simple concept and an appealing main character the concept here is simply terrific what would happen if a boy was left alone in his home and during christmas holidays at that and when the kid is played by such an adorable and talented kid as macaulay culkin half the work is done theres also an interesting implication every kid would love to be alone in such a big home granted hes got enough to eat or buy food but how about when it happens at the very time where you count on the presence of adults even for selfish reasonsi concede that john hughes didnt really try to make an existential plot out of the concept and picked the easy way which was a confrontation between the boys and bad guys but what bad guys as hitchcock said a film is as good as the villain and joe pesci and daniel stern form a very interesting variation of laurel and hardy george and lenny george and junior or pinky and the brain the interaction between the two burglars while not reinventing the wheel is the perfect foil to little kevins quick wits agility and ability to come up with the most ingenuous devices in order to defend his home i think its safe to consider that the film was already a winner once they got the concept the kid and the villain the rest was just a sort of icing on the cake what kind of booby traps to install in the house how to make it impossible for the parents to reach their kid or for him to get help and of course the spirit otherwise it wouldnt be a christmas movieso of course its going to be implausible with such a title as you either have a comedy or a horrorthriller and if the movie had to be realistic it wouldnt have taken more than three hours movie time to get kevin out of the house and arrest the burglars but we wouldnt have a movie either we wouldnt have the playboy scene the aftershave moment inspiring the iconic recreation of the edvard munch painting with kevins trademark scream whose only match was marvins shrill arachnophobia reaction the film is a christmas classic because it has filled that overthetop category if you want a movie that recreates the fun of christmas in a realistic way you have the noless iconic a christmas story but the concept of could only work with that level of slapstick andculkins performance is so good it even conveys a sort of edgy attitude hes not your typical kid either but hes still convincing enough as a kidits not just a matter of suspension of disbelief but of let it go for the sake of innocent fun of course watching this right now reveals some baffling contrivances we couldnt spot where the film came out yes we know the supposedly shovel murderer isnt a bad guy we know kevin relies a lot on the assistance of luck and perfect timing we know it will all come down to the powerful family reunion and catherine ohara provides the emotional arc of the film yes its true marv and harry arent so bad they really deserve all the hurtful stuff that happen to them and kevins scream can get annoying at times but the film is closer to a liveaction cartoon than a realistic comedyand there is no way for not to make it in any top 10 of classic xmas movies but maybe im biased because it was totally the kind of movies we used to watch countless times as kids to the point i always identified tchaikovskis nutcracker music as the theme,comedy
its safe to say i think that along with movies like the goonies and ghostbusters is going to be on of those for people of a certain generation as a must go to when it comes to sheer nostalgia its notable that it catapulted then 10 year old maccaulay culkin to international stardom and brings back fond memories for people like myself who remember going to see it at the cinema as a kid as it comes that bit closer to hitting the thirty year anniversary of its release its still lost none of its appeal and has thus far stood the test of time all this said and in all fairness i cant say its a brilliant movie and given its premise your enjoyment of it will probably depend on how much youre willing to suspend disbelief this is after all about a an eight year old named kevin whos criticised by the fellow childhood members of his family for not being able to pack his own suitcase their family is travelling to paris for xmas and yet proves remarkably resourceful when fending off the movies antagonists the burglars harry and marv played with hilarious brilliance by joe pesci and daniel stern written by john hughes who sadly passed away several years ago as incidentally did actor john heard who plays kevins father in the movie he makes good use of its basic premise with young kevin attempting to temporarily adjust to finding himself on his own and without any parental supervision fun moments include him being questioned by a suspicious checkout operator while hes grocery shopping and tricking harry and marv in to thinking his house is still operating by constructing a fake party using cardboard cutouts its certainly one of hughes most inventive movies as a writer despite how far fetched it is the now legendary final act is a masterclass of slapstick comedy and youd be hard pressed not to find yourself rolling on the floor with laughterof course with this being a hughes movie or just any family comedy of this nature theres going to be some life lessons learned for our plucky young hero by the end of it thankfully however its beautifully handled and while predictably sentimental it never becomes cringeinducing maccaulay culkin brings innocent charm to the role of kevin and displays natural comic timing he also handles the transition from obnoxious brat to lovable sympathetic young scamp effectively well the rest of the supporting cast which includes catherine ohara the late roberts blossom and the late great john candy making a relatively brief appearance are all on top form no doubt this is a film that will be well remembered for years to come even with its glaring flaws you cant deny its charm and i defy anyone not have a lump in their throat in its moving final moments,comedy
you just cant help yourself watching this movie again and again every year has officially become christmas tradition movie im wondering is out there someone who has not watched that movie i dont believe so lulactors are great idea is perfectand you cant stop the overflowing christmas spirit that this movie has,comedy
some movies are made strictly for adults others will bore the heck out of us seasoned viewers and appeal only to children luckily this movie is made for everyonefor a basic plot summary sees young kevin mccalister macaulay culkin waking up a few days before christmas in a completely empty house his extremely large and rather disorganized family having left him behind on their trip overseas while the family tries to get back home kevin must outwit a pair of twobit thieves played by joe pesci and daniel stern who want nothing more than to loot his homewhat really makes this film special is the wide appeal of the humor one could literally sit down with the entire family from young to old and watch this movie and everyone would be laughing all the way through from young kevins attempts at holding down the fort to the bumbling burglars played brilliantly by two veteran actors this is the type of movie that you will be quoting long after the tv is turned offthus i highly recommend to quite literally anyone especially during the christmas season if you have a list of mustsee holiday movies this one should be right next to frosty wonderful life and claymation rudolph,comedy
this has become one of my favorite christmas films over the yearsthis is a classic that has everything to please children and adults with a killer mix of adventure comedy melodrama and embedded moral the main thing to me is that the christmas spirit is there so the rest just clicks into the puzzle easily the movie is predictable of course but that is part of the charm you expect from a christmas story unless you are watching an horror movie or a proper adult comedyi loved macauly culkin when he was a child he is brilliant in this movie he fuses with his character in a way that is difficult to separate the two showing the great actor he was even at that age the good son would would highlight his maturity as actor so he is not a pretty face here macauly and his character kevin looks angelical but is far from being an angel he has a good heart has an insight into what is good and bad is ready to be advised by wise people at the same time kevin is also creatively ruthless with the baddies because well they brought it upon them and deserve it despite kevin being alone this is a choral movie it wouldnt have been the success it was if it wasnt because the performances of joe pesci and daniel stern who are brilliant as the mischievous yet naive baddies daniel stern is especially funny and has one of the best onscreen yells in movie history i dont want to forget john candys secondary role in this movie who is deadpan funny in one of those garrulous characters that were one of his trademarks roberts blossom is also great as the lonely grumpy old neighbor the rest of actors were believable in their respective characters as wellwarms my heart and cheers me up every time,comedy
a quarter of decade was gone still hold sentiments of many people released on november 10 1990 as a christmas family comedy movie it is a unique and gripping blend for these genres is directed by chris columbus and written by john hughes centered around an eightyearold defending his house for burglars the first two grossed over 835 million worldwide and made a star out of macauley culkin as kevin mcallisterit all started when kevin mcallister who was a naughty mischievous kid was punished by his mother catherine ohara on the day before their familys vacation to paris and as his wish not having family came true kevin was left behind in the chaos of waking late and a rush to the airport at first he was very cheerful and got into his siblings things he shouldnt and did everything he wanted but when the burglars joe pesci and daniel stern began invading his house he had to become more mature to protect the place like a real man kevin outwitted and set bobby traps to cope with the burglars before his mom came rushing back from franceoverall it is a good movie albeit unrealistic the plot is enjoyable not too deep and suitable for all ages it makes you laugh with the methods kevin used to fight off and how the burglars got hit although many people adopt a view that there was a certain amount of overacting in fact this is the main reason why i think draws attention and reaps applause pesci and stern handled theirs characters very well they fit the molds of the bumbling oafs likewise a perfect and charming performance by macauley culkin makes it stand our among holiday movies is not a story about christmas it is about a little kid met obstacles when he was at but with stunning decorations joyful sounds festive atmosphere coveys a message christmas is the season of spending time with family it is one of the best movies to watch with your family on christmas,comedy
it was my favorite movie as a kid it featured my very first crush and while there have been many copycats there will only ever be one i highly doubt that anyone reading a movie review blog hasnt seen this film by now but those select fewthe film centers on kevin mccallister macaulay culkin a bratty kid whose extended family is preparing for christmas in paris during dinner kevin starts a fight with his older brother buzz and is sent to sleep alone in the attic an overnight power failure leaves the family rushing to catch their flight and kevin gets left at the same time a pair of idiotic home invaders working his neighborhood and want to rob his house kevin sees himself as the man of the house now and knows its his job to defend it as his parents rush to get back to him kevin prepares for war is the epitome of a family film and is what all family films aspire to be these films all claim to be fun for the whole family but lets face it theyre geared toward children most of the time you take the family to see them and twenty minutes in youre on your phone or falling asleep but not here the chemistry between joe pesci and macaulay culkin is fantastic we all know pesci for his mobster roles so its easy to forget that he got his start as a comedic actor and it is actually what he does best paired with a great cast a legendary director and a terrific story this is simply the best family feature film i have ever seen has something for everyone it will make you laugh cry and beg for more and thats why there are five god awful sequels and a whole bunch of other films trying to duplicate the magic of this film but as i said earlier there will only ever be one and it is an absolute must see movie,comedy
christmas staple for anyone born in the midlate80s the mccallisters an upperclass chicago family rushes to the airport for a holiday in paris accidentally forgetting the runt eightyearold culkin the real fun and danger comes when the youngster decides that hes the man of the house and challenges two dimwitted burglars pesci and stern with a funhouse of traps some slapstick others legitimately harmful writerproducer hughes and director columbus do a pretty good job of working around the incompetency of the whole fiascobut a lot of things in the film comes together so well thanks to an underrated supporting cast particularly bamman blossom heard and ohara instantly entertaining and has a lot of replay value with some suspension of disbelief out of four,comedy
is great a film that i grew up watching and absolutely loving it it really is a film that appeals to everyone and is just really funny and festive basically the outline of the film is kevin accidentally gets left while his family goes on vacation while he is we see the fun and outrageous things he gets up too but things suddenly change when two sneaky burglars decided to try steal his neighbourhood the film is seriously funny and has a good cast kevin is the main character and all though some of his acting falls flat overall he is great in it and the two burglars are absolutely hysterical the way he plots to keep his house safe with all the quirky little boogie traps absolutely great watch,comedy
one of the best comedies of 90s for the inspired use of clichs for the fireworks of imaginations for one of the most remarkable children actors of our time for the delicacy of last part for the powerful flavor of christmas family spirit childhood it is more than a movie but a kind of experience for its public  this status defines it with profound precision because it is one of films who after years preserves in perfect form the image of a period the traces of 80s  the social change of 90s the manner to discover and understand the world the courageous work to transform it a comedy of course but not only one maybe useful support to remember an age and its beautiful colors,comedy
i have a friend who i once saw call the holiday season the season its amazing to think how this movie was made many years ago but is widely remembered and still regularly watched it seems like almost all of us have seen and it seems like most people have seen it more than once for one i wouldnt recommend watching this movie outside of the holiday season just how you likely wouldnt listen to christmas music outside of the holiday season even though you could i mean this movie just gives you the christmas spirit when its around i watched this movie around 6 months ago and it just didnt seem as enjoyable as it used to seem and i just thought its best if i wait until the holiday season to see it even though you can probably find it on tv all year round and during the holiday season it will be on abc family its just better to get into the christmas spirit when christmas is around anyway i just left a review on the 2nd movie i prefer the 2nd one over this as i feel like the 2nd one is more funny and we see kevin in a more exciting place than home as in the 2nd movie hes in nyc in this movie hes in his quiet neighborhood where most of the other neighbors seem gone and a neighborhood thats being burglarized at the same time by marv and harry however while watching this movie i noticed there arent many exciting scenes until the climax of the movie kevin is also somewhat of a brat especially during the beginning of the movie like the way a kid who is supposed to be 8 talks to his mom this movie shows family time as showing a rich family inviting their extended family over and all trying to leave for paris so we remember the opening scene showing a family that is in a hurry all around the house and kevin feeling ditched by his family and being a brat about that while this movie has its flaws it is still somewhat enjoyable i mean weve all seen it and i think a lot of us are tired of it because weve seen it many times and basically know whats going to happen also im surprised this movie has done so well as a movie one similar movie i prefer over is blank check i think blank check has more of a plot than by all means this movie is still good and entertaining ill want to watch this movie again during the holiday season just to get myself into the christmas spirit i give this movie an 810,comedy
doesnt this movie make you all warm and tingly inside okay the story is not entirely credible but its a good idea the story buildup is pretty straightforward and easy so it can appeal to a very wide audience youve probably seen this movie a thousand times by now and theres a big chance you didnt get tired of it if you love christmas and the christmas spirit youll probably love this for those who havent seen the movie yet the story is about a little boy whose parents go to paris for christmas and forget their son he wakes up all alone and his mother only discovers she forgot him when shes already on a departed plane a burglar duo fully aware of their departure drops by to steal some valuables and the little boy kevin as new man of the house feels responsible and obliged to defend his fortress of solitudeit has all the cuddly and mellow themes of christmas like unconditional love for family and friends the destructive power of prejudice and fear values like charity mercy and generosity and whats wrong with a little corniness in life,comedy
eight year old kevin mccallister macaulay culkin in his appealing break through lead performance is frustrated enough with his family to wish them away and he gets this wish sort of when the entire family  parents siblings aunt  uncle  cousins included  is in such a rush to get to the airport in time for a trip to paris that they leave him behind at first he has great fun with his temporary freedom and independence but will eventually have to save his house from being burgled by a bumbling pair of oafs harry and marv played by joe pesci and daniel stern this he does by staging an elaborate series of booby trapsis a pretty charming little family comedy that does have quite a bit of heart to go along with all of the farce and slapstick this material is indeed pretty funny with pesci and stern playing their slow witted lowlife criminals for all that theyre worth some of their facial expressions and reactions are just hysterical some of it may be a bit much and may not jibe that well with the more serious portions of the movie but its doubtful many kids watching are going to care that muchit does in the end make a very good case for the need for family how were perfectly capable of taking our loved ones for granted how to deal with ones fears and do some growing up and in the case of old man marley the excellent veteran roberts blossom how its never too late to mend relationships the wonderful scene between culkin and blossom in the church where they make a connection is indeed the best moment in the entire picture kevins been administered erroneous warnings about the old mans supposedly sordid past and is understandably afraid of him and realizes how one shouldnt be too quick to believe that sort of thinglovely funny woman catherine ohara also does extremely well in the role of the mother willing to do anything thats humanly possible in order to atone for what she feels is an unforgivably stupid mistake its truly a treat to see her reunited with sctv costar john candy whos as engaging as ever in his cameo role as polka star gus polinski john williams supplies an expectantly catchy score and touching song both oscar nominated with song lyrics by leslie bricussegood fun overall with a bright wrap up its not surprising that the movie would have been such an enormous hit over 20 years ago and it continues to entertain todayseven out of 10,comedy
this is a pretty great film i think that its a holiday classicjoe pesci is hilarious in the film and macualay culkin brings a real sensibility to the role he should have done more films after this too bad there are a lot of great scenes in this and very funny too the keep the change you dirty animal line is a classic i remember watching this years ago and was one of my favorite childhood filmsultimately everyone should see this film its really entertaining and very funny you really cant do much better than this please give it a go and just be prepared because you will be laughing very hard without being able to stop,comedy
having just watched this for the first time in ages and at the cinema for the first time since its release i am reminded of what a fun film this is it works very well as a feel good christmas movie and as a live action update of a loony tunes cartoon my feeling s about this film have not really changed at all in the eighteen years since its release it is a small idea with a huge pay off when kevin a never bettered macualay culkin is left over christmas when his family leave for a trip to paris and accidentally forget him he is left to fend for himself as a pair of burglars tries to invade his home for a child actor culkin does a remarkable job practically carrying the movie on his own appearing in pretty much every scene the burglars are fended of in a string of comedy sequences that a very funny and aided no end by joe pesci playing the leader of the pair harry there is a convenient sub plot where kevin finds friendship from the unlikely source of the neighbourhood old man all the kids are scared of all in all this is a movie to be enjoyed at all times and that is guaranteed to make one feel better,comedy
this movie tells a childs fantasy about having no family lot of kids wish they could have the whole house to themselves so they can do whatever they want and not be told what not to do or told what to do even i remember wishing the same i envied kevin but couldnt understand why he wanted his family back they were all mean to him now i understand kevin does indeed do things his would never be able to do with his family around but then he starts to miss them when he sees harry and marv two burglars want to rob his house they have already hit the other houses on the block and now they want to hit his now he has to do everything he can to keep them away by pretending people are home but he cant even go to the police because he thinks he has actually made them disappeared and he would get in trouble with the police for making them go away but what he didnt know is they all got up in a hurry because they all slept in and went to paris and they took the shuttle in not their cars its obvious kevin a pain to his family and his parents dont listen his siblings are mean to him buzz likes to play mean tricks on him its obvious uncle frank doesnt like him because he calls him names wont let him watch a movie with the other kids pulls his pants down in a deleted scene and didnt care he was left if it makes you feel any better i forgot my reading glasseswhats funny is harry poses as a police officer and there he sees kevin who is helpless and a trouble maker to the family but when the family is away he sees kevin isnt as helpless and he is capable of what he didnt know what he was capable of kevin is obviously very bright and smarter than other kids his age despite not knowing how to pack a suitcase or tie his shoes what kind of eight year old knows how to set all those traps and come up with a plan to catch those bad guys and figure out their moves with his family away kevin grows up a little by concurring his fear of the basement and showing his family he can take care of himself and what he is capable of and he isnt as helpless as they thought he was,comedy
this is the best christmas film of all time in this writers opinion the film undoubtedly has faults like any film and the fundamental basics are at times a little embarrassing as far as acting and continuity are concernedhowever this film as good as it is has a personal value to me as a person i watch this film once every year in the weeks leading up to christmas because i used to watch it every day of december up to the 25th when i was a child so there may be a considerable amount of bias in this review and for that i apologisethe basic plot is frankly classic and as soon as you see the plot unfolding it is impossible not to be entertainedthe over the top acting is at times good and at times bad but it is all tongue in cheek the two criminals joe pecsi and daniel stern make up for little macaulay culkin who is good in his own way i suppose and while not as hilarious as his co stars of previous mention he does have his momentsthen of course everybodys favourite part of the film the pranks obviously it is why every child of the last 20 years of the existence of our universe loves the film the fact that an 8 year old child could out wit and over come two adults for such a long period of time simply does not come to mind because how well the events of the film are set up it seems like in reality this helpless rude and ignorant brat could not make toast for himself but com onwho caresi not to go to much into the story on the off chance that you are reading this without having watched the film all in all it remains the champion of christmas film and will most likely never be beaten although bad santa came close as did jingle all the way  the latar for a different reasonperhaps i am being to generous but perhaps not 8 out of 10,comedy
this is a classic moviei remember seeing bits of it a long time agobut i dont remember it being so funnytheres lots of slapstick moments where i laughed hardbeyond thatthoughits also a very fast paced moviebut doesnt seem that way while you are watching itit isnt frenetic or anythingbut its very well pacedit takes place during christmasand it has some heartwarmingtouching momentsi had a tear or two in my eyemacaulay kulkinat 8 years old or sosteals the showwhile joe pesci and daniel stern are also great as 2 hapless burglarswho mess with the wrong kidit seems kevinskulkin family has flown to parisbut they forgot one thingkevinso hes all alone in his bigexpensive housebut far from helplesswhen he matches wits with 2 witless thieves who try to rob the housesome of the traps he sets up are ingenious and elaborateits not likely mostif any 8 year olds could come up any of the ideassoin that respectits silly but in a good wayits all lite hearted funbut i would give it a mild pgrather than a g ratingjust because there is a bit of very mild languageand a one scene of violencefrom a moviethe things that happen to the two thieves are cartoonish violencevery funnyanywayi really enjoyed this movie and have to give it a 9510,comedy
this is a classic christmas movie the plot cast and the acting are all top notch the story is about young kevin who gets left behind when his family leaves for paris while alone he must fend off two bumbling burglars while his family is on a desperate race against time to return home the acting by young mac is exceptional his performance is one of the reasons this movie was a huge hit way back in 1990 i also love 2 but i think 3 and 4 are crap 1 and 2 are the best the new dvd is great it is packed with tons of special features including 15 deleted scenesalternate takes games a making of featurette how to burglar proof your home featurette and more the deleted scenes are hilarious one of them is an alternate take when uncle frank is passing out shrimps and buzz takes a tray full if youre a fan of this movie you should get this dvd its great since i bought this dvd i have watched it numerous times you will not be disappointed with this dvd i also wish they would release a new dvd of the sequel,comedy
i think that film is really brilliantamazing oh i dont have any word to describe his perfection always that i do zapping i see it is great and macauly kulkin is the perfect kevin mcalisster with his unmistakable shout he was gained an important place into the hearts of so much peoplebesides the idea that they have both movies they seem to me of the most original and entertaining thingi think that macauly mulkin is one of the best actors in the planet and this film is is a living probe of it and the second part is really funi liked very much also that the movie had a sentimental side  besides that i have a sentimental very developed he he hei recommend him her to the whole world they will not repent seeing heri am sure that his success in ticket office was welldeserved well,comedy
roger ebert gave a mere 212 stars which is the same rating he gave teenage mutant ninja turtles another one of my childhood favorites for comparison he gave that same rating to mediocre movies like six days seven nights and superman iii the reasoning he gave for giving that rating was that he liked the first half of the movie but then didnt like the burglarbooby traps plot in the second half at first i was going to say that roger ebert has simply lost touch with his inner child but im going to give him the benefit of the doubti watched today after many years and i still loved it and i still laughed even though i had practically memorized the movie as a kid and still remembered it all as a kid i remember always wanting to get to the cool stuff when watching this movie the parts about pulling pranks on the pizza man or boobytrapping the house id fastforward through much of the first half even though i liked it this time around i had a newfound appreciation for the beginning half where we get to see how an 8yearold copes with waking up and discovering that his family has disappeared i still love the second half of the movie but i saw the first half in a new light this timei think the reason why that happened is the same reason why roger ebert didnt like the second half of the movie as an adult one watches family movies to remember what it was like to be a kid to remember the dreams of being grownup and independent and the silly little fears of things in the basement thats what the first half of the movie offers and it works for both kids and adults kids relate to it and adults reminisce about itthe second half is for the kids and for the inner child sure its pretty outrageous to see an 8yearold devise clever boobytraps that work like clockwork and are encountered in precisely the right order ebert says that our little hero gets too smart and doesnt have the budget for his fancy boobytrapping maybe but thats not the point adults watch and say man this can never happen but kids say man i wish i could do that it is after all one reason why we go to the movies to see things that can only happen in the movies as a kid words could not describe how awesome it was to see an 8yearold take on two adult burglars and pummel them especially after one of the burglars had the nerve to say kids are stupid it is a childs fantasy come truethat is why this movie was so popular when it came out why it stayed 1 at the box office for 12 straight weeks its also why every family movie from the 1990s tried and failed to imitate it kids love it because its a dream come true and parents love it because its a dream rememberedby the way parents i should warn you that kids will want to try and imitate our little hero and unless you want your house boobytrapped id advise that you let them know not to do that also theres one scene where our hero celebrates his newfound freedom by watching a gangster movie where he sees one gangster blow another one away with a tommy gun a scene that scares him and makes him remember his mom older kids and adults will laugh at the scene because its way over the top but little kids may actually get scared just a cautionmacauly culkin is great as our hero kevin he was a pretty talented child star and its too bad his career never really went anywhere our two burglars are daniel stern and joe pesci who are the pinky and the brain of breaking and entering i think sterns character marv was supposed to be the funnier one but i personally liked pescis character harry more one thing i love is the way hes muttering nonsense under his breath every time he gets caught in a boobytrap since he cant curse in a family movie actually true story he had to do that because he had just finished filming his oscarwinning and totally awesome role in goodfellas as a foulmouthed quicktempered homicidal maniac of a gangster and so he was quite prone to cursingwhat can i say i love this movie it makes me a kid again,comedy
ive saw this film many times and ive always enjoyed it the most recent time i watched was sometime last year and as always i enjoyed it there are plenty of laughs and a decent storyline as wellits about about a boy named kevin who is accidentally left hence the title and thinks his family have disappeared kevin wished that they would the night before and at first enjoys this but as time goes on kevin starts to miss his family and wishes they would return and also he has some burglars to deal with luckily his mum decides to get on the first available plane home leaving them both very happy and then suddenly the rest of the family returns and are happy to see kevin safe and soundall in all this is a pleasant comedy that i would recommend to anyone710,comedy
is underrated according to the imdb it only has a 64 out of ten it deserves to at least be a 7 this is a great family movie but there are many adults and teens out there who also love it it isnt a dark movie but it isnt all fluffy like some of the movies released today that are considered family movies it is also one of the best christmas movies ever made and is still the last great christmas movie released to this daythere are three sequels 2 is pretty good 3 is bad but 4 is a made for tv flop so i wont say anything else im not sure why but it seems like many kids prefer the 2nd and 3rd movies over the first one i dont see their reasons for thatthis is a great movie for kids and many kids can relate to it im sure every kid out there has wished they could be alone and away from their family but what kid would know what to do if two burglars were after him that is where all of the fun in this movie comes fromyou should see this movie it has become a tradition for me to watch this every christmas maybe it will become a tradition of yours as well,comedy
this movie was made during the christmas holidays starring one of the best young movie stars named macaulay culkin the holidays started off well when the mccallister family decides they want to go to paris for the holidays kevin feels the family does not notice that things just dont seem right until the night before the family was leaving for paris that things go down hill the next day when leaving for paris they do something that no family would ever do like leave your child at home and be 1000 miles away what happens next while his family tries getting back will make you wonder can kevin prove to his parents anything is possible to protect himself being alone i think that after seeing this and buying it that anything can happen when children think before doing kevin has to not only care for his self but protect the home from the burglars that are out there can kevin do it and his family get back in time for christmas you will be anxious to find go out and buy it it was a hit,comedy
box office smash hit nearly watched by every one is still a fresh bite for everyone to see it againfine performances by macaulay culkin in the leadthough he earned a golden globe nominationjoe pesci and daniel stern and other supporting cast members film goes really nice and has an original sharp script which allows viewers can see it many times all the time viewer is surprised to see what kevin would do next with his devilish plans a mustsee ratingout ofhassan haiderali karachipakistan,comedy
i must confess i really like  its part of popular culture for good reason  im not going to try and defend culkins acting except to say that worse child performances than his have been considered charming as in the somewhat overrated a christmas story  this movie is charming memorable indeed touching and perfectly paced so that the hilariously extreme violence that is its trademark a really fresh perspective on slapstick in my opinion starts late and builds to an actual climax  by contrast most of the movies in this genre drag on and on with no real development and little cohesion and could end at almost any arbitrary moment ie baby geniuses mouse hunt look whos talking too why did i ever watch those anyway  anyway very well made good supporting performances shouldnt be dissed,comedy
was one of the funniest film released in 1990 and is still a christmas classic to me  tweleve years later macaualy culkin became a star with this film and joe pesci showed more acting talent om this film the ending in the film is one of the funniest and when i have kids ill show them this treasured classic,comedy
i first saw this movie when i was six and now that im eighteen it still a great movie it has a great cast a new kind of story starring the now famous macaulay culkin as a child who is left over christmas and has to fight off burgulars trying to rob his home,comedy
starts out very promisingyou can already tell that the movie will be very goods plot was very originala kids parents go out for a vacation and they leave their son the best part of this movie is the last 25 minutesbecause of all the traps gives out a high level of entertainment that will please adults and childrensome of the comedy material isnt all that funnybut children would probably find it funnyall of the actors gave great performancesi would say that joe pesci and daniel stern were the bestone thing i didnt like about was that it took a very unrealistic approachi mean kevin is like 8 or something and he has the skills of a full grown personi would strongly recommend this fil to children and adults9 out of 10,comedy
rambunctious comedy features culkinin a starmaking performanceas a troublesome but clever and precocious eightyearold whose dysfunctional family inadvertently leaves him behind after they leave town for the christmas holiday he makes the most of his situation by doing all the things he couldnt do without his familys permission but then unexpectedly finds himself defending his home from local wet bandits pesci and stern provides some poignant messages about the importance of family and friendship but is most likely to be remembered for its hilarious slapstick goofy bad guys and a very appealing young star ,comedy
went on the become a box office sensation when first released in late 1990 it stayed at the top of the box office as the 1 film for its first 12 weeks of release quite impressive kids of all ages just loved this movie about a little 8yearold boy who gets accidentally left home all by himself after his family rushes off to spend christmas in france macaulay culkin is terrific as kevin the boy left he pretty much is the whole show here his charisma and presence help make as good as it is however this movie is not a classic if it wasnt for the ridiculously crazy climax this movie would have been better of course the climax is the part that made everybody laugh out loud when the kid takes on those inept burglars by setting up booby traps that are just too farfetched to be believable this part still makes me laugh but i just cant believe that an 8yearold could dream up of stuff like that and writerproducer john hughes would inject this style of slapstick humor into alot of his following movies including babys day out curly sue and of course the two sequels the slapstick violence is at times a bit too much but it doesnt go too far though the first sequel 2 lost in new york did get more violent in its slapstick comedy director chris columbus had his first smash hit with he followed this with 2 mrs doubtfire and most recently harry potter and the sorcerers stone columbus knows that he can work beautifully with kids and is where he got his start he makes culkin look as good as he is the supporting cast is fine catherine ohara and john heard are good as culkins parents joe pesci and daniel stern are wonderfully bumbling as the clumsy burglars and hughes script has some wonderfully heartfelt touches may not be the best comedy movie ever made but its still a good one ill take over hughes idiotic babys day out anytime out of four,comedy
this movie got me laughing the boy really messes up the burglars the sequel 2 is much worse because the tricks he uses there would kill the bandits in real life so i did not enjoy it anyway this one gets my vote as 810,comedy
is a lovely movie and i consider it the greatest family film ever made because of the storyline and the well developed plot  the actors are fantastic also  im not going to comment on it much but my suggestion is that if you havent seen this movie you should  you will feel better throughout the movie,comedy
this film is one of the alltime great holiday films probably ranking a distant second behind a christmas story i remember when ten years ago i saw at the theater i said you have a instant classic i guess my prediction was right i know when i hear many people talk about a film for years that the popularity is overwhelming and also it must have sent a good message to people continues to get many airings just the other day i watched this classic on hbo the ingredients for success in the form of the writing from john hughes really made this film so enjoyable and you know how good john hughes delivers a sweet and likeable film the story is crazy but also funny as macaulay culkin as a precarious 8yearold who accidentally is left behind by his vacationing family in the meantime culkin must battle a twosome of goofy and inept burglars wonderfully depicted by joe pesci and daniel stern i must say that joe pesci is a great actor not only is he seriously funny but he is just plain and simply the best at anything he does qualify pesci as a very underrated actor and culkin enjoys the adventure of a lifetime filled with many laughs and giggles to crack you up it just goes to show you many times an individual can have the most fun when left alone no matter how many times you have seen watch this classic every holiday season its a film to enjoy for a lifetime,comedy
this movie has to be one of my alltime favorites columbus proofed himself as a director in this one and so did culkin as an actor i also liked the performances by pesci and stern as the two clumsy robbers this movie is great from beginning to end and unfortunately the last great one from hughes         but this movie gets a well deserved 8 the sequel gets the same rating,comedy
if i had to pick a movie that was a smash that did absolutely nothing for me would be at the top of the list oh im not saying the movie was awful but overated yes and after all these years i still dont get the appealim an adult but was fairly young when this came outand i love all types of movies this movies premise bothered me seeing a kid get terrorized by robberseven in a comedic sense was not my cup of tea and i spent most of the movie feeling sorry for the poor kid who got left behind and wishing the movie would end yes mcauley culkin was cutebut aside from that i dont think rates more then a 55 maybe a 6 i have definetly seen better kid movies family movies etc it was hyped so much and so sickeningly sappy the most i could say about it is that its a cute little movie,comedy
directed by chris columbus from a screenplay by 80s golden boy john hughes has pleased millions of people and is a notunintentional holiday perennial as well taking place as it does during the christmas season it is a film that operates at a level at which any sort of professional criticism is no longer helpful youngster is improbably left behind after his large family packs up and leaves for the airport to vacation in paris he fends off two inept burglars while mom makes her way back home macaulay culkin plays the main character kevin but there really is no character culkin succeeds in the role strictly by playing up his inherent precociousnessmost often directly to the camerawhile we admire his spunk and resourcefulness both unrealistic for easy laughs the picture looks immaculate sparkly and shined to a faretheewell often times just the reassurance that what were watching is a big expensive bauble made solely for our enjoyment is enough to keep the masses happy the holiday trimmings trigger nostalgia in adults and joy for children while the thieves joe pesci and daniel stern both overthetop arent scary mean or nastyjust lovable irascible losers who cant topple our pintsized hero no matter how hard they tryand oh how the audience wants them to keep trying followed by two sequels in 1992 and 1997  from ,comedy
it was good and it is one of my childhood memories,comedy
dude what a great movie there are so many things wrong with it and so many things i could predict but dear god was that a good movie i will watch this movie every single christmas season to get into the spirit and i will love every single minute of it every single time this is the perfect christmas movie for anyone who feels alone or hates the season it will open your heart and make you believe again in the things that are good its a true triumphant battle of good vs evil and is done in such a fashion that is seen by the eyes of an honest child watch this and tell me you dont love it watch it i dare you,comedy
this is good film kevin really has person as criminals come you thrillingwho win badguys or boy,comedy
my sister made a good point about this movie the last time we watched it together she said i dont know why people think this is a christmas movie there is hardly anything related to christmas in it after hearing this i realized that she was correctis a holiday classic but not because it has the typical christmas traits you would expect it is a classic because it has aged well and its a universally loved family movie set in winter with that said it is misleading to call it a christmas movie sure there is references to the holidays here and there but does that make it a christmas film no not reallythis is an example of how family movies should be made ill go as far as saying that is one of the greatest family movies of all time if you still havent seen this one in 2019 you should,comedy
8yearold kevin mccallister is accidentally left behind when his family takes off for a vacation in france over the holiday season once he realizes theyve left him home by himself kevin learns to fend for himself he eventually has to protect his house against bumbling burglars harry and marv who are planning to rob every house in kevins suburban chicago neighborhood kevins mother kate is frantic when she realizes that she and the family have unintentionally left kevin behind in chicago and she tries to make it back to chicago as fast as she can getting help from a polka band leader named gus polinski,comedy
this film is gripping and the acting is perfect is in my opinion best film at xmas i really enjoy watching this film its the best family comedy which i have ever seen the story is about young boy his name is kevin he is small but he is big troublemaker in this film he did a lot of crazy good and bad things which you will see when you watch this great film i think the main character kevin was created for this role he was really good actor in this film you can see how kevin did a traps for two guys who want to rob his house it is really entertaining in film there are some stunts which are real there were no stuntman or stuntwoman the characters perfomed stunts themselves thats crazy characters kevin are brave impressive and wily and bandits are thoughtless bad sharp and one interesting thing about this film is that at the end one of the guys tries to bit kevin to his forefinger and he bit him for real and after shooting kevin has a real scar so at the end i must say that it was a great film and you must watch this thank you for reading,comedy
a movie that very much came to define the decade it started is a cheesy lighthearted popcorny actioncomedydrama and a really good christmas movie to boot kinda like die hardwe all know the story i trust kid gets left behind during the holidays and then has to defend his house against a couple of bumbling burglars traps are involved traps to make the looney tunes proudand it works it really works but i would argue that the reason this film has stayed with people and the reason we still watch it is because the director chris columbus injected in so much christmas spirit that youll be stuffed to the brim with it this is a colourful movie with beautiful sets and enough christmas lights to provide for an international airfield it has christmas songs christmas classics on tv it has a great tree great morals and its just to very christmassyat the center of this is kevin played by macaulay culkin a wideeyes precocious little brat that manages to pull off the almost impossible feat of acting realistically childlike  you know like a sociopathic greedy little monster  but still coming off as sympathetic and sure in his heart hes a good kid but the reason we like him is because hes so cheerfully blood hungry and because he honestly and purely loves christmasis it an odd movie when you think about it yeah a bit is it a bit painful to watch all those traps as an adult with a working knowledge of physics yes oh very much so is it still a ton of fun absolutely,comedy
as a child i grow up watching that movie and i think i still watch it every year on christmas time never get bored of it really its the best christmas movie for me without any doubts,comedy
a christmas classic worth watching every christmas time and it never gets old just wish there were more of marv and harry getting hurt for more laughs but the story makes sense and the concept of a kid fighting off people trying to break into his house is interesting,comedy
we watch this every year at least once its always a fun ride even after seeing it tons of times just a great timeless holiday classic,comedy
over the years this kind of became the comedic equivalent of eggnog gingerbread and the nutcracker its tedious during any other time of the year but it works perfectly well come late december this was the one and probably the last time that anyone fancied macaulay culkin as an actor who developed from michael jacksons homebuddy to a thespian hasbeen with alcoholic issues and managed to emerge from it only a short while ago however its a pleasure to watch him in his acting prime however sad that may sound here hes the cute little kevin who gets left behind at home when his family goes on a christmas trip to paris two burglars eventually notice that hes all alone in the big house and they decide to have a go at it theyre taken by surprise when they run straight into the trap of the sadistic kid who turns their effort into a hilarious neardeath experience the comedies nowadays dont really reach the quality level like this one it doesnt insult my inteligence and the message isnt ironic or too tacky apart from the overthetop christmas decor that looks as if the rockefeller christmas tree exploded inside the pranks kevin pulls on them are plain silly and the huge family looks like an embodiment of a norman rockwell painting exaggerated to borderline cult this movie spawned numerous sequels but its only the two with culking that are really fun to watch the plot is simple the pranks are silly and the whole thing works just because the context of it is undemanding just like culkins onecharacter hit this is a onetime movie and thats why its likable and so enduring thats unlikely to change any time soon,comedy
i consider this to be 1 of my favorite christmas movies,comedy
just a good old christmas movie nice to watch when ur bored or with family funny just a great movie,comedy
a museum of artistic accomplishment in cinema maac review director chris columbus  career catalog 3  review 0001910after a series of unforeseeable events an eightyearold boy is left alone at christmas time and must contend with two neighborhood crooks this ridiculous premise is made quasibelievable by the warmth the writers imbue in their creation and the characterization of childhood innocence star macaulay culkin brings to the screen while his family members are painted with familiar colors they never devolve into the realm of stereotypes or onedimensional representations they function well together and its easy to imagine they have been interacting with and getting on the nerves of each other long before the camera intruded upon their presence catherine oharas iconic histrionics over realizing she left one of her children behind are particularly fascinating her roundabout road trip to return home provides a good counterpoint to culkins main storylinethen you have the acerbic wit of joe pesci thrown into the mix its hard to believe he filmed this role in the same year goodfellas was released the two performances are such polar opposites of each other and yet when combined stand as a testament to pescis abilities as an actor his comedic compatibility with daniel stern is off the charts and its hard to see anyone else filling their roles as admirably as they didi really like the fact that the filmmakers never took the easy route and wound up exploring more than one fear for our youthful hero not only does he have the fear of criminals invading his home however bungling the burglars might be he also has to deal with his fear of the basement and his fear of murderous local legend marley whom he continually runs into over the course of his exploits its not just fear that culkins character has to tackle but the daytoday aspects of living a life on his own the filmmakers were aware that sometimes the simplest of things can make the funniest of scenes from torn grocery bags spilling their contents over a suburban sidewalk to the application of aftershave there are a thousand little details other films would overlook that make this one a memorable experiencethis film has all the magic of the month of december in one place from hectic holiday travel schedules to the inarguably argumentative confrontations uptight relatives will inevitably share i cant imagine the holiday season passing without indulging in this yuletide favorite it just doesnt feel like christmas until ive had my fill of purposefully cartoonish violence and heartwarming heartland schmaltzon a side note as this is my first cinematic review i would like to say that it is my firm belief you get out what you are willing to put into a film no more no less everyone has a different idea of what makes a film important or enjoyable because everyone has a different set of experiences they have lived through which color their perception of what they see and hear youll never read the words pretentious overrated or the emperors new clothes in one of my reviews many people misuse the word pretentious when they actually mean snobbish many people misuse overrated and the emperors new clothes when they actually mean i dont like this film and i cant imagine why anyone else would either these statements are limited ideological viewpoints which cheapen the medium of cinema as a wholemany people forget that critical analysis is nothing more than the opinion of one person there are no setinstone rules for any avenue of art nor should there be creation is as wide and as varied as human imagination itself your opinion    my opinion    anyones opinion from that of a professional critic to an armchair reviewer should never be accepted as fact or gospel good reviewers understand this concept and often provide for interesting reads bad reviewers who forget or scoff at this concept become nothing more than parodies that waste time effort and space so i bid you good watching    and good reviewing    at this joyous time of the year2018 berringercrossreviews,comedy
it is a movie that is impressed with laughter a main character is a boy who have a lot of brothers and sisters one day his family go to travel however he is forgotten and stays at home by himself at such time robbers come to his house then he decided to protect his house from the robbers it is exciting that the boys plan for protect his house he uses a lot of everyday items such as iron toy cars bolls and more the robbers are mad at the measures it is very funny scene moreover audience will get impressive when they watch it to the last they will feel that family is important especially the movies construction is great there are some turning points and pinch main character experiences some relationship with people and pinch and he learned something at first he is enjoying his lonely life however he feels cry because there is no one in the house at the last of the movie he learned that his family is important for him,comedy
an absolute classicfamiliar to everyone mcculkins most well known film which is still fun with every watch the gimmicks the voices the wet bandits feel good viewing ,comedy
is about a boy living in a big house together with quite a view family its almost christmas and the family is preparing to go on a holiday to france everyone is busy picking his clothes the next morning they are leaving to go to the airport in all hustle and bustle they forgot kevin hes now two thieves are making plans to break into the house where kevin is still spending his holiday is kevin too clever for the two thievesthis film is absolutely my alltime favorite christmas story the main characters and places were chosen well and everything is fitting great there are very much funny moments in the film and the pace is perfect nor too fast neither too slow i watch this movie every year with christmas and im still not losing my focus while watching it the film creates a nice christmas feeling maybe its not the best plot but its hilarious and i recommend you to watch it with the whole familycompared to the other films i think part one and two are the best after part two the cast changed and that made it for me less well,comedy
iswellits one of my favourite films as a child and is one of these films you would see countless number of times the film was amazing from start to finish and it was kevin who made this film entirely the story was very good the burglars were amazing the film was funny you name it what i enjoyed the most about this film is the fact that it can teach you a lot about life in the real world and that you cant take anything for granted and that a kid can actually take on the responsibility as an adult and that the adults or grownups can be the silly ones you have to see it to know what im talking about when it comes to the christmas season be sure that is one of those films you would see on screens by many people  it truly is a classic,comedy
oh come on imdb users how could this film get only a 65 yes its a kids movie but i know plenty of adultsnot including myself who loved this film it touches our hearts and tickles our funny bones not to mention i think in one way or another we could relate to it thats why it remains a classic christmas comedyis not only one of the highest box office successes of all time but it deserves more praise mac showed a talent that very little child stars have nowadays he brought in a great comedy about a boy who accidentally is left when his family goes on vacation and takes on two burglars yeah its quit unrealistic about the burglars but honestly this is a terrific family film joe pesci and daniel stern are the perfect comedy duo of two idiots who cant rob the place because a 8 year old child has out witted them and set some clever and very funny traps around the houseplease give this movie a chance its just terrific and i guarantee nothing but great laughs for you and the whole family1010,comedy
rising child star macaulay culkin first worked with the late screenwriter and producer john hughes on his 1989 hit uncle buck in which he starred alongside the much missed john candy hughes was impressed by the young mans talents and remembered him for when he set about writing his next film which of course was eight year old kevin mcallister is constantly the butt of his familys jokes particularly his eldest brother buzz  devin ratray  after getting into a fight with buzz over a pizza the night before their christmas vacation kevin is sent to his room whereupon he wishes that his family would disappear that night a huge storm knocks out the power lines meaning that the mcallisters sleep through their alarm as they leave for the airport in a tearing hurry they are unaware that kevin is still in bed fast asleep the first the family realise of this is when they are halfway to pariskevin is initially overjoyed when he realises that he is but when he learns that two burglars harry and marv also known as the wet bandits are planning to raid his house on christmas eve he wishes his family would come home in a bid to protect his home from harry and marv kevin sets about rigging his house with booby traps to outwit the bad guys fortunately a kindly neighbour  who is wrongly accused of being a murderer  who kevin has befriended is also nearby to helpis my favourite christmas romp of all time excellently delivered by its cast  devin ratray as kevins troublesome brother buzz catherine ohara and john heard as kevins overwrought parents roberts blossom as old man marley the old man who came to kevins rescue full credit however must go to of course its star macaulay culkin as the cheeky but likable kevin and the brilliant and underrated joe pesci and daniel stern  who in my view was a comedy legend in his own right as his performances in bushwhacked and city slickers will testify  as the bumbling wet banditsalso impressive in the short time they are on screen are john candy as gus polinski the polka king and macaulay culkins brother kieran culkin who as kevins younger  and weak bladdered  cousin fuller  was he named that because of his regular consumption of fizzy drinks do you think  had me in stitches especially in the scene in which he is pinned against the wall by a chairin 1992 a sequel  2  lost in new york  which was the last to feature macaulay culkin   appeared and did just as well commercially as the first film video game versions of both films were also released for both the sega and nintendo consoles in 1998 3 appeared with alex d linz as alex pruddit it was not as popular as the first two movies but was worth watching nonetheless unfortunately in 2002 4 which had mark weinberg inheriting the role of kevin mcallister was made it was a crushing disappointment for fans of and is generally regarded by fans as the worst in the series a view i share wholeheartedly surprisingly ten years later a fifth film entitled  the holiday heist was made this time as a televised film rather than a cinematic release it fared better than its predecessor though in my eyes nothing will come remotely close to equalling the originalfunniest moment  the fight between buzz and kevin over the pizza i really cannot begin to do the scene justice here but it is a classic moment of comedy wonderfully delivered by all concernedsecond funniest moment  harry and marv continually falling foul to kevins various booby traps each one being more pain inducing than the last,comedy
is the most comedian and adventurous film i have ever seen the story is about a kid who his family traveled and forgot him at homethenthree thieves tried to steal his houseisnt based on a bookthe film was set in 1990californiathe main character is macaulay culkin and hes my favorite character because hes bravefast and funny i recommend all ages to watch that film ,comedy
this is one of the better christmas films in this comedy a child is accidentally left at home when his family go to france on holiday he has to defend the house from two burglarsthere are some parts of the story which are ridiculous for example how could everyone forget kevin how could he have slept through the huge amount of noise from everyone else getting up getting ready talking and leaving,comedy
child stars peter out so fast dont they one minute youre the most highly paid 9 year old on the planet next youre a drug addled loser in a deadend band i think you know who im talking about and no its not mr pesci although his career kinda hit the doldrums in the new millennium toostill this is decent xmasstyle fun and a good deal more enjoyable than its overlyderivative sequel some might say only the boobytrap laden last halfhour is any good but those peeps would be missing out on some funny lines poignant moments and screaming lots and lots of screamingactually forget that last part 710,comedy
is my favorite christmas movie ive ever seeni have loved it since i was young it tells the story of kevina young boy who is often bullied by his siblings but probably most by his brother buzz one nightkevin wishes his family would disappear and when they leave to go on holiday to paris and they forget kevinkevin has the time of his life until two burglars try to break in looking for rich things and kevin is forced to protect himself so he sets up a set of violent booby traps showing the robbers the movie stars our favorite child star macaulay culkin who starred in my girlthe good son and many other classic films and hes still out there doing ehya knowstuff the movie is directed by chris columbus who directed the first two harry potter films which i love so so so much obviously the movie i think is written by comedy legend john huges who is most recognizable for his work on the breakfast club and sixteen candles is one of the best christmas movies but i wouldnt recommend it to small children aged 4 or 5 due to some bad language and violence,comedy
there are two reasons why was such a big success the first is that it is about a kid who outsmarts grownups something that happens every day only there is a worldwide conspiracy of silence the second is john williamss magical score which elevates the film way above slapstick family fare to something more serious and regardedmoreover there is an important message that family is what really matters to a child or to anyone and having them home for the holidays is better than wandering a huge house all by yourselfthere are some films that work best at christmas and this is one of them,comedy
this is a comedy that a young bot tries to save his home from the thieves by himself a family come to travel for palis in full force however the youngest son kevin is left behind alone in his home because his family is in a big rush in the morning of a departure date he feels gladdened for his first single life at that moment a party of two thieves have their eyes on kevins house because they misunderstand there is nobodyi have seen this film for many times but its really interesting and i cannot stop laughing whenever i see kevin is always buried by his older brother and sister but he can grow stronger through saving his home from the thieves by himself in addition his way of fighting for the thieves is so funny and cute its also humorous that the thieves are defeated easily by such childish strategy i especially like the scene that kevin drives off them by using a gang movie,comedy
it was a real fun movie and its real fun to watch it especially the part where the criminals get punishednot from the police from the stairs hot door thing buckets in general the whole defending procedure its a lesson that you shouldnt leave your kids alone because bad things can happen during it its not the best movie but its definitely a decent movie with decent actors and funny story although it is a little bit better than the second kevins movie the 2 as i am a member of imdb since 2013 august i watched many films and i know which films deserve it and which dont so my rating for this is 910,comedy
here come chris columbus 1990 classic with a young mccauley culkins at his hight of his fame with a xmas film with tear jerking end at an 1hr43mins the perfect film to to watch with the whole family 1010 an 8year old troublemaker must protect his home from a pair of burglars when he is accidentally left by his family during but his family count13 kids or something like that but a nosey child is not kevin and leaves i only realized this in 2014 you will always find something new with this film christmas vacationwith a star cast and young lead actor what can go wrong macaulay culkin  kevin mccallister  joe pesci  harry lime daniel stern  marv merchants john heard  peter mccallister roberts blossom  old man marley  catherine ohara  kate mccallister john candy  gus polinski it is christmas time and the mccallister family is preparing for a vacation in paris france but the youngest in the family named kevin got into a scuffle with his older brother buzz and was sent to his room which is on the third floor of his house then the next morning while the rest of the family was in a rush to make it to the airport on time they completely forgot about kevin who now has the house all to himself being was fun for kevin having a pizza all to himself jumping on his parents bed and making a mess then kevin discovers about two burglars harry and marv about to rob his house on christmas eve kevin acts quickly by wiring his own house with makeshift booby traps to stop the burglars and to bring them to justice so with the others away he grows up doing the shopping or so accidental shop lifting because of the next door neighbors legend but finds out he lonely and kevin tells him about his and tells the man its never to late forgive and help each other but in his fortress he builds funny booby traps videos with angel with wings ill give you to the count of ten stuff to get out of here but any way the wet bandits are at it again but cant beat a 8 year old at his own game but fools every one but his action plan works for him and friends this holiday classic has a class line up not to be missed as they family forgot one minor detail,comedy
i dont want any family families suck producer mark levinson said that once in a while every kid thinks that if they could get rid of their parents and vice versa life would be great chris columbuss 1990 hit christmas film shapes that wish into a clever tale with the addition of burglars left kevin the eightyear old victim of sibling bullying becomes the man of the deserted household and like a responsible child enjoys everything once forbidden by his parents washes the clothes shops for milk and dinner and defends the house with all the wild resourcefulness a child can muster against a pair of burglars who are fishing for silver tuna homes during the holidays is a well written tale with clever booby traps comical lumbering burglars and strong family valuesunfortunately this film is not completely laudable in both content and quality due to kevins deterring but simple snares mildlystrong language is steadily and sporadically spouted out by the angry bandits with kevin rejoining every so often to discourage them also kevin his siblings and other family members repeatedly namecall each other near the beginning a classic for most ages the entertaining plot held me on the edge of my seat while keeping me laughing and wincing at the asinine sufferings of the bandits but however wellwritten the script and storyline was i downright detested the unpleasant acting chiefly of kevin and his family although a couple veteran actors made appearances in it even their performances were particularly rotten excepting joe pescis convincing performance as harry lime the dreadful awkwardness of blank and unemotional neophyte actors constantly diverted my attention away from the themes of the film ive mentioned theme and plot frequently written by john hughes the characters of the film though some appear useless to the films plot fit flawlessly into the importance of the film for instance old man marley seems to be just another object of dread and fright for kevin but throughout the course of the film we learn the truth about him along with many lifelessons exchanged between them although slightly overused by family movies the positive elements in this film are quite strong and emphasized significantly engulfing the expletives and violence hence earning my high content rating when they discover the loss of their child kevins mother kate catherine ohara expresses her remorse and love as she sacrifices all her possessions and sleep while she attempts to return alone to their home in chicago with caring donors providing transportation for every leg scored by john williams s memorable somewhere in my memory yet again illustrates these ideals while not the best acted or produced christmas flick the superb plot humor lessons and implications make an engaging heartfelt annual tradition,comedy
on the last day of a year kevins family toward to france kevin is the youngest child in his family his mother forgot to count kevin so when kevin got up in the morning kevin found alone in his home at first he enjoyed his own life one day two thieves aim for kevins home then he cheated as if he lived with his family so two thieves thought that they cant enter kevins house but they decided to come again another day kevin decided to fight with them using kevins wise and humour finally kevin beat them and he met his motherthis movie is so humorous we can enjoy kevins childish idea besides we can watch deepness love of his mother for her sun we can enjoy christmas atmosphere also,comedy
this is a pretty funny christmas comedy starring macaulay culkin in his signature role as eight yearold kevin mccallister who was accidentally left by himself in his home by his family after they jetted out to paris for a vacation kevin must make it on his own for several days and protect the house from a pair of crazy burglarsthis movie started out frantically with kevins dysfunctional family scrambling to ready their trip to paris while giving off a vibe of overzealous humor and corny personalities but the film picks up for the better when kevin found out he was left and as a result we get to see his resourceful survival tactics and his plans to deal with the burglars culkin did a good job playing kevin giving off that innocent but intelligent characteristicwhat ive found surprising was that this manic comedy also has some heartwarming moments about the christmas spirit family and faith the subplot of kevins old reclusive neighbor gives the film a good balance of drama and actually also gives some meaning to the overall christmas theme of the storythe plot features some heartwarming moments and some offthechart humor featuring fasttalking loudmouth joe pesci and accidentprone daniel stern as the burglars who gave us a good dose of slapstick comedy them tripping over kevins house traps and slippery slopes was pretty entertaining overall its a good ol christmas comedy that will lighten you up for the holidays grade b,comedy
if there is one movie i would never miss during the holidays it would be it is hilarious and sweet as the same time macaulay culkin is so adorable as this resourceful little child who was left alone by his own family and had to defend his house against two resilient clumsy burglars who preyed on his home while trying to cope with his situation of a 8 years old boy all the gags are hitting their mark it is absolutely joyful to see joe pesci and daniel stern falling in each trap set up by kevin but it is also so sweet to follow kevin trying to act like a man for example when he used aftershave and he screams because it burns i find this so cuteis a marvelous holidays movie all the family can enjoy the children will love it as do the parents,comedy
i like this movie so much because this is just so funny each trick the main character makes to hide form two thefts is incredibly high quality we can easily guess whats going to happen to the two thefts next and we can enjoy their actual reactions of being trapped i watch this movie every year even though i already have known the story actually i like the thefts better than the boy because they act idiot thefts really well and they made me laugh so much time irecommend not only all of families but every single person to watch this movie on christmasi will definitely watch this movie this christmas and have a great chrismas,comedy
a great 4 out of 5 star movie the 1990 classic christmas movie called overall its a great movie to watch with the family every christmasthe reason i rate this movie a 4 out of 5 is because the movie keeps you on your feet towards the end and it also shows life lessons that you have to go through later in life probably not the part where you have to defend yourself from the wet bandits this movie shows how it feels being for a couple of days its fun at first but then some of us begin to miss the family it shows that you need to be brave and be responsible which kevin shows a lot of it in this movie kevin didnt get along with his parents or siblings in the beginning of the movie all the other kids there always made fun of him and picked on him kevin didnt get his cheese pizza because his brother buzz took it and thats the only kind of pizza kevin ate kevin got angry and hit the other kid and got in trouble and his punishment was being locked into the attic for the night the next morning the family woke up late to go to their plane because they were leaving for vacation they hurried and got into their taxi forgetting kevin in the attic as he was still sleeping kevin woke up wishing his family wasnt there from the previous day and came to see he was kevin was so happy that his family wasnt there he was jumping on the bed eating all the junk food he had making the place a mess i like where kevin had a huge fear of the wood burner as it opened and closed thinking it was a monster but as kevin was he had to face his fears and later in the movie he was no longer scared my favorite part in the movie is when he has to defend his house from being robbed from the wet bandits he has to set up a bunch of booby traps and make sure his house doesnt get robbed the only thing that strikes me is that these two men otherwise known as the wet bandits run into these traps that kevin lays out throughout the house if any ordinary person was to run into these traps like they did they would be pretty severely hurt it is a childrens movie and it is entertaining the mother realizes that they left kevin behind as they are already on the plane leaving and she goes through many obstacles to make sure she gets back to kevin after two days of kevin being his family finally comes back now kevin feels a part of the family and they actually all missed him and gave him hugs i believe the theme of this movie is that no matter what your family is important you may go through rough patches but they raised you and there all you got in the long run this movie shows bravery responsibility and really shows that family is important this movie is great and should be watched 10 years from now and its a great classic and reminds me how close this movie brought me and my family too,comedy
ahh christmas an abandoned child brutally assaults almost murders two nasty burglars and subjects them to all kinds of elaborate slapstick glory such is the joy of chris columbiss a seminal holiday classic that contains no message very little arc and all the booby trapped hilarity thats more demented than my dads endless cackling when he sees it on tv for the zillionth time dont get me wrong i enjoy the film and re watch it whenever i get the chance its just pretty demented macauley culkin back when he was a cute kid before he grew up and looked like something that dr frankenstein made using steve buscemis dna plays feisty little kevin accidentally left behind at home when his massive dysfunctional family heads off for christmas vacation feeling a bit blue after harsh words with several of his clan he sets out to live life on his own over the break which includes shoplifting a toothbrush eating copious amounts of junk food and the classic prank pizza delivery ya dirty animal things get weird when two scruffy relentlessly dumb burglars daniel stern and joe pesci set their sights on his home he takes the phrase holding down the fort terrifyingly seriously and devises a onslaught of evil traps gags and medieval style defense tricks that would make the huns proud seriously i wouldnt wish that tarantula misfortune on anybody pesci is grinning glee as the smarter of the two which isnt saying much and stern plays up the banter as the colossal idiot catherine o hara and john heard play his neurotic parents john candy has a puzzling cameo as the undisputed polka king of the midwest and roberts blossom plays a menacing show shoveller who figures in the plot quite the holiday romp im not including the sequels in this series but i will say the second one is fun but stales a bit as its essentially just a retread of this just in ny and wayy more implausible i really love the third which is probably my favourite of the series come fight me avoid the 4th and 5th like the plague unless you want to see french stewart and malcolm mcdowell embarrass their careers terrifically,comedy
christmas is coming therefore remembering and reviewing some classic seasonal movies is imperative the first one shall be the classic comedy for all family that made macaulay culkin a superstar in the age of 10 the movie even got two oscar nominations music song and score as well as two golden globes nominations best comedy movie and best performance by macaulay culkin as probably everyone already knows this movie is about an 8year old who must protect his home from a pair of burglars when he is accidentally left by his family during christmas vacation the fact that he manages to bring terror to the burglars is of course completely unrealistic but no one cares since this is an absolutely hilarious comedy although not a very believable one there are some classic scenes that will have you rolling on the floor laughing even if you remember them so its strongly suggested as its a classic christmas comedy indeed,comedy
watching offers a nearly completely different experience as an adult at least it did in my case i was far more invested in the mcallister house than anything else what the hell did dad to for a living to afford that place john heards character didnt seem like an highlevel executivewhat does stand the test of time is the violence and physical hell visited upon joe pesci and daniel stern the three stooges live on in a john hughes family filmi can see myself slamming this movie for the more sentimental kodak moments    but my kid loves it and i love her giggles and i love the production design that went into creating the mcallister house and the surrounding environs its a heartwarming slice of upperclass christmas,comedy
that cover shot of young mccaulay culkins goofy face has put me off watching this festive movie for years but in mid december on a rainy cold afternoon and having watched most of the best of the christmasthemed movies around i turned to this at last and sure culkin gets more screen closeups than greta garbo ever did either due to the director wishing to emphasise his cuteness or maybe in some way to cover up his inexperience at acting but the movie is so fun that you get used to it as it rolls entertainingly alongseems to me that young kevin gets the best christmas present ever when as he thinks he makes his horrible family disappear over the holidays but when house burglar joe pesci and his hapless accomplice determine to loot culkins parents house the fun and games commence as the kid fights back plus of course theres time for a big dollop of yuletide sentimentality as the youngster makes friends at last with the sinisterseeming old man next door sorting out the latters family problems in the processthe movies really fun as you warm to the initially brattish kevin and have to admire his methods of keeping the baddies at bay firstly with his automated mannequin show and then of course when he seemingly boobytraps the whole house to repel the invaders pesci is very good offering us a familyentertainment version of the psychos he plays for scorcese with nary a cussword in sight but its the kids movie with young mccaulays acting improving as the movie progresses which almost makes me think the film was shot in chronological orderi have to admit that before watching i expected this to be an indigestible slice of over sentimental nonsense but instead was wellentertained by a clever and funny family feature which rightly deserves its reputation as a latterday christmas dare i say classic,comedy
it is a very funny movie and excited full of adventures and gives her account as play actorand he had eight years at that time i love to watch every year for christmas with my friends and pariiniti it is very funny especially the story you explain how stupid can you be a people and these two criminals who have played incredibly laughed a lot and only the house 2 is a very good movie i recommend it unfortunately that acotorul not really make movies or have important roles but i like it as it is written the scenario a child of eight day to crack when his family left and the two criminals are willing to jefuiasa this house but a modding i see that the house is not empty yet someone is in it the more i liked the detected signals which they built,comedy
this is a very funny movie for kids and people of all ages i love macaulay culklins character in this it also teaches the kids about defending their selves when kevin beats the bad guys this movie deserves 810 stars not just 610 this a really good movie and it is a classic i think it spreads the christmas spirit i think this movie took place on christmas for a reason this one of the best christmas movies i love the christmas music that john williams wrote it is the best christmas music in my opinion 90s stuff is really good i like the classic movies i love any movie that involves kids this has been my favorite kid movie since i was 6,comedy
i first saw this as a kid and i liked it mostly for the slapstick during the last 30 minutes or so of the movie as an adult i still enjoy this movie a lot however i like it more for the atmosphere than for the comedythe overall atmosphere of is what i think adults might like most about this film it just looks like christmas with all of the lights decorations and even the songs it really gets you in the holiday spirit and just gives you that heartwarming feeling of christmasthe slapstick comedy doesnt totally hold up for me i dont find myself laughing at it as much but i know kids like that stuff and even some adults so if you like it then thats totally finei have seen a couple of the original trailers for this movie and based on that the film doesnt look like anything special or anything that good it mostly focuses on the slapstick and doesnt look too promising but is so much more than that and i think thats the main reason why it was such a huge box office hit since it wasnt a major success with criticsto sum it up is a great christmas film that is a prime example of not judging a book by its cover its nicely shot well acted and just gives you that warm feeling you get with the christmas holidays,comedy
has life become so mundane are you yearning to go back to those childhood days when existence of life was never given as an afterthoughtwhen the present was flamboyant with petty quarrels with our siblings the cherubic smile on our faces when we did the so called mischiefs time to relax with those memories and be on the hangover of the little mischiefs of childhood well the eight year old kevin of sways you away with his naughty actingthough the plot is unbelievable the hilarious acting of the burglars holds our attentionthe mischievous trap set by kevin to teach the burglars a lesson is fascinating the american christmas comedy film is simply worth watching watch out its time for me to watch out the rest of the series,comedy
i really love this movie its funny and its just a great family christmas classic sadly the sequels were not as entertaining in fact most of them were quite sadin this movie an eightyearold boy who is a member of a big family accidentally gets left at home when his family goes away for christmas for a trip to france he actually doesnt mind the piece and quiet that he normally doesnt get but then a due of robbers decide to rob his house he makes it his mission to not allow them to whilst setting them on fire getting them to step on broken glass and fall down stairs its very entertaining but when you think closely about it why was this kid so into hurting them they didnt have guns why didnt he just call the police like a kid is supposed to be taught to overall i give this movie an 8 out of 10 which in my ratings book is awesome,comedy

john hughes and chris columbus teamed together to bring us one of the biggest box office smashes of 1990a little thing called a comedy that not only made a lot of money but made a genuine movie star out of the young actor playing the lead rolemacaulay culkin lights up the screen as a young man named kevin mcallister a young boy who actually gets left behind when his family goes out of town for christmas surprisingly kevins realization that his family got a plane without him sits pretty well with him and he settles into the ultimate kids fantasy of having the whole house to himself unfortunately playtime is cut short when a couple of bumbling thieves joe pesci daniel stern somehow get wind of the fact that kevin is alone in the house setting in motion a cartoonlike cat and mouse game between good kid and the bad crooks that puts the best tom and jerry cartoons to shamethe films enjoyment lies in the viewers complete acceptance of the premise as a fantasy yes kevin is part of a very large family but there is no way any family would get on a plane to leave the country without double and triple checking to make sure that all the kids are present and there is also no way that two grown men couldnt overpower a child if they wanted to if you can check these two large lapses in cinematic logic at the door the film can be enjoyable yes the cartoonviolence that occurs between kevin and the crooks is a little over the top but it is what makes the film so funnyculkin charms in the title role and pesci and stern work well together as kevins bumbling tormentors mention should also be made of catherine ohara and john heard as kevins parents who are very funny in the opening scenes chris columbus direction seems to be based on warner brothers cartoons but who doesnt like warner brothers cartoons so check your brain at the door and youll see why this film was one of the biggest hits of 1990,comedy
i love because it was so hilarious there parents leave to pairs the most funny is marven and harry they are both robbers kevin was scary he dont know what he do next so he went to the store and he was stealing a toothbrush because he went to somebodys house and the basement was getting filed with water kevin ran up stairs and marven and harry hung him up on the hook the old man marley he had a shovel and he hit both of marven and harry on the back of the head kevin fell asleep in his parents bed room kevin went to the door to peek out the window and few minutes later and kevins mom came in the house and she was in the living room so kevin was in the dining room they both hug together with a mother and a son so kevin was peek in the windowsill he saw old man marley with a granddaughter she was home for christmas it is worm that is so funny,comedy
i know that its highly unlikely for an 8yearold boy no matter how smart to have singlehandedly pulled off all those burglar traps but i still love this movie as the youngest child in a big family kevin is somewhat spoiled and is consequently seen by his siblings as a pain the night before the familys yearend holiday to paris he gets sent up to the attic as punishment for fighting with his siblings stung by the seeming injustice of it all kevin wishes for his family to disappear amid the hustle of getting to the airport his parents forget about him kevin is at first delighted that he got his wish but soon finds himself having to defend the house against burglarsis so funny and kevin macaulay culkin is so adorable its one of the few movies that made me laugh out loud the first half was a bit slow but it was refreshing to see the world through the eyes of an 8yearold  believing the scary tales spun by an older kid and letting your imagination run wild the second half where kevin ordered pizza and played cat and mouse with the burglars was hilarious and just believable beyond the humour i liked the movie for the message that it sent  family is precious truly the perfect family movie for the holidays,comedy
this year it is already 24 years ago that chris columbus starring macaulay culkin was released and the film gets shown pretty much every holiday season here it also scored 2 academy award nominations probably mostly because it was by far the most commercially successful movie in the united states in 1990 of course that is also why so far there have been three sequels with only the second starring the lead actor and most of the original cast in 2 lost in new york columbus directed this sequel as well and later worked on mrs doubtfire and several harry potter filmsone of the strengths of is that also all the smaller characters bring quite some charm and fun kevins uncle especially during his scenes in the plane is my favorite smaller funny character and old man marley brings the emotional highlights here that church scene was particularly wonderful what a shame the actor is not alive anymore same goes for the films writer john hughes and john candy who both died way too early mentioning john hughes i was a bit surprised that the smoking santa was not him in a small role he exactly looked that way you may have seen some of hughes other very known works such as the breakfast club ferris buellers day off 101 dalmatians and many moreanother mention goes out to joe pesci who has had a true career year in 1990 here he plays the chubby slightly smarter villain over daniel sterns character compared to his completely sinister mafiosi gangster turn in goodfellas which won him the oscar that year culkin was nominated for a golden globe in the musicalcomedy actor category but lost to gerard depardieu who won for the only movie from all the nominees which is not considered a classic or close to that description todayruns for roughly 100 minutes and will make you laugh a lot and also touch you the latter happened for me mostly with the old man with the snow shovel and how meeting kevin impacts his life my favorite funny scene was the gangster film playing with the poor pizza guy coming along i saw it so often already but it never fails to crack me up i am not sure if i would call this movie a classic or even an epic but it is certainly worth a watch recommended,comedy
macaulay culkin joe pesci daniel stern john heard and catherine ohara star in chris columbus 1990 comedy this tells of kevin mccallister culkin a troubled young boy who wishes his family would disappear in a way he gets his wish when hes accidentally left behind at home while his family heads to france for christmas vacation kevin has a run of the house but also faces 2 inept burglars harry pesci and marv stern trying to rob it in the process heard big and ohara beetlejuice play kevins parents peter and kate who try to get back home to him plus the late john candy uncle buck also appears as polka king gus ive always liked this film and watch it every year near christmas the cast is great as well as john williams score i recommend this great holiday comedy,comedy
is about a boy name kevin mccallister who is left behind with his family that they have gone to paris as he takes care of the house and deal with some burglars i grew up with this movie as it is part of my childhood and it is still fun to watch from being a kid to an adult this is one of my favorite christmas movies and i do watch it when it comes to the christmas holidays john hughes script is extremely well written as well as chris columbus direction john williams music is so memorable and beautiful at the same time the cast in this movie were great but i give highly praises to macaulay culkin for his performance as the main lead he is star of this whole movie and fun to watch also i give highly praises to joe pesci and daniel stern as harry and marv who they are known as the wet bandits the movie is filled with slapstick like the three stooges when kevin sets up the traps as both harry and marv go through a lot of pain as the movie goes toward the end the movie is not only funny but it has a lot of heart to it that is filled with the spirit of christmas this is the best of all the movies and nothing beats them the only good sequel is the second which i will get to that later but the third and fourth were terrible they tried to be fun and entertaining but they were not and they were not needed to be made so anyway is definitely the one to watch during the christmas holidays as well as the second which again i will get to that later if you havent seen the first movie please feel free to check it out because it is fun entertaining and it really does have that christmas feeling when you finish watching the movie toward the end credits you come out feeling good at the end of it is definitely an unforgettable christmas classic and i give it a 10 out of 10,comedy
i like the movie because kevins family goes to paris for christmas  they forgot kevin and they left him he look out the window and everyone left to go to the airport and kevin watched tv in his brothers room robbers they went to kevins house set up booby traps kevin call the police kevin went shopping for his family kevins mom and dad was on the airplane to go to paris and the bad guys follow kevin did the familys laundry kevins mom came home and the whole family came home and the bad guys went to jail i like the part when kevin argues with his mom it was funny because theres a lot of entertainment i like when the robbers crashed into the brick wall,comedy
i love because it was so hilarious there parents leave topairs the most funny is marven and harry they are both robbers kevinwas scary he dont know what he do next so he went to the store and hewas stealing a toothbrush because he went to somebodys house and thebasement was getting filed with water kevin ran up stairs and marvenand harry hung him up on the hook the old man marley he had a shoveland he hit both of marven and harry on the back of the head kevin fellasleep in his parents bed room kevin went to the door to peek out thewindow and few minutes later and kevins mom came in the house and shewas in the living room so kevin was in the dining room they both hugtogether with a mother and a son so kevin was peek in the windowsill hesaw old man marley with a granddaughter she was home for christmas itis worm that is so funny,comedy
i though was good because it was funny and it was also funny how bad guys gets hurt in felt bad for kevin because he was and his parents wasnt there kevin wished that he didnt have any family but at the end his family came back home and kevin was happy when they came back i thought was cool and kind of funny when kevin was he had ideas to how to stop the bad guys from getting in his house kevin learned how to do his own laundry and how to cook by him self kevin went to church to watch people sing i recommend to watch this with your family it was funny you should watch because it is funny in the movie i didnt like when kevin was home by him self because i felt bad for kevin when he was home by him self my opinion would be i thought the was funny and i thought it was awesome,comedy
this movie is a classic and is really funny and kids love this moviethis is a movie about a boy and his familythe family leaves to go on vacation and leaves kevin behind by accidentwhen kevin figured out his family had left him he was scared and wondering what happened to his family after a little he got hungry and went shopping for foodafter a while of getting back from the store he seen a van in his drive waythe people in the van were two burglarsthe burglars were trying to break into the house but kevin set up traps to keep them out of the houseevery time they tried to break into the house they got hurt but that one time did not stop themthey came back a few more times every time they came back kevin found a way to keep them out of the house every timethe last time the burglars tried to come in they got hurt and got caught by the policewhen kevins mom came into the house calling kevins name when kevin got down stairs and saw his mom he was so happy and gave his mom a big hug shortly after the whole family came home and kevin was happy to see everyonei though this was a great movie and was real funny,comedy
the basic story seems so simple little 8yr old kevin is accidentally left behind when his family jets off to paris for christmas so its riddled with continuity errors and plot holes the garage has a separate entrance but is somehow connected to the main house who cares there are so many things going on here its an incredibly complex screenplay which pays homage to so many other movies the burned brass handscar raiders of the lost ark the three stooges impossible stunts and injuries that would have killed any mortal man angels with filthy souls is a parody of angels with dirty faces clips from several christmas movies sure its totally implausible that an 8yearold boy could actually execute such complicated stunts but the micromachines actually candy are genius as is the zip line to the treehouse its maculay culkins best performance john candy plays a great cameo as the polka king and the subplot of old man marley and his grandchild add much heart to the film there are so many scenes that i love but the toboggan out the front door and the stinging after shave lotion are the best i love buzzs tarantula and the bloodcurdling scream dubbed from daniel stern the tarantula on marvs face is considerably smaller than the one used in other scenes a great score by john williams with some dusty 1950s carols thrown in for good measure of course this whole thing could never really happen the whole movie is a fantasy but the dream house that the mccallisters live in is real also magically most of the mess of the house is cleaned up by the time mom is finally united with kevin who is no longer ,comedy
is known worldwide we all know the story and we all know at least one line from the movie and it was only lately that i decided it deserved to be re watched and so i did and i found that the film was great but it did have some errors which i will discuss in this review anyway to start this short review lets have a look at the story we have kevin mccallister the child of even though they never say rich couple who are going on a vacation to paris in the madness of trying to get out of the house the leave kevin behind then we have some burglars who want to rob the place and kevin must defend his house now i found this to be believable but some of the things that happen throughout the story are strange such as i think we sometimes see the world as kevin sees it such as the oven downstairs and old man marley at the grocery store these were just some unusual points in the movie which is nor a good or bad thing you could say the whole movie is about growing up and becoming more selfless rather than being selfish and this is a good message to tell it also seems to make an entertaining movie onto directing what can i say chris columbus is a good director when it comes to kids films he is definitely a safe choice now i think i will mention a few mistakes in the movie i noticed such as buzz could not have seen old man marley from where he was standing as the curtains were half closed and old man marley was on the far right not in the middle of the window therefore buzz could never had seen him also one other thing was the church scene sort of like in kevins mind showing old man marley coming from the dark scary side over to kevins light nice side just what i saw in the lighting anyway to sum up the film i personally think it is one of the best kids films out there and is a must watch for everybody gets a 710,comedy
this is one of the christmas movies many rememberalso a start of the many now forgotten kids and teen stars of the 1990s tooits about a boy named kevin left after being forgotten by his parents that are on vacationbut two robbers comes into the houseits up to the boy to stop the invadersthe boy is using trap after trapthese two villains returns in the second movie after having a looney tunes moment in kevins houseits a half christmas movie and half slapstick comedy that deserved its pg ratinga well deserved oscar for the music and joe pesci deserved one too for his typical villain role1010,comedy
an absurdist comedy a great ride if watched in the right frame of mind on a cold christmas nightan eight yearold boy is accidentally left behind when his family goes on holiday in paris for christmas when an amusingly inept pair of burglars set their sights on his house they get more than they bargained forthere is a kid in the lead but it isnt really a kids movie occasionally gets a bit too violent for the lighthearted tone in the rest of the film but more often than not it is a fun ride watching this little kid outwit a pair of nitwit stooges with his macgyverlike ingenuitydaniel stern and joe pesci work well together as the most determined thieves on the face of the earth at what point in time would real burglars have given up beautifully photographed in a winter wonderland it provides a good backdrop for the road runnerlike hijinks,comedy
will stand the test of time methinks watching it tonight i just find it too much fun culkin is certainly a bona fide star here the groundwork laid in his wonderful work opposite john candy in the john hughesdirected uncle buck the plotas if you didnt know it righthas 8year old culkin quite wise beyond his years if a bit precocious and at times mischievous left accidentally alone while his parents and family go to paris by plane to visit the fathers brother for the christmas holidays he must fend off two cartoonish oafish burglars calling themselves the wet bandits robbing rich suburban houses on his block their eyes mainly focused on thieving from his familys home pesci and stern are positively hilarious as the notsobright thieves winding up punished by culkins vast array of traps laid at the house they so desperately want to rob theres a lot more to the film than just seeing the bandits fall prey to violent traps set by an intelligent kid touched on is culkins loneliness without his family dealing with a scary neighbor roberts blossom who is simply delightful that has more to him than meets the eye and a mothers devoted trip back home to her son of course generations of fans will remember culkin applying aftershave and shrieking and the filthy animal footage scaring both stern and a pizza delivery boythe visual silhouette trick where culkin fools pesci and stern into believing there was a party taking place is brilliant terrific casting with the likes of catherine ohara and john heard as the parents and even the smaller parts the aforementioned blossom and john candy as the leader of a polka band who offers a rented van ride to ohara he and his traveling buddies use to get to a gig in milwaukee passing through chicago on the way only enhance the whole experiencewhile the raison dtre might seem to be culkin outsmarting dimwitted numskull burglarsusing violence from a loony tunes cartoon to do sotheres plenty more to enjoy here personally i think culkin as the anchor is one of the chief reasons this film remains so timeless and specialits the perfect example of justright castingthis is my house i have to defend it after building up some good will throughout credibility does go out the window but this final stand between culkin and the bandits is so highly memorable i think its excusable plus despite what we know would really happen if these two actually were shot by bbs from a bb gun slip on purposely icy steps get hit in the head with a crowbar touch a doorknob heated extremely stepped on a long nail received an iron to the forehead tripped and landed on hotwheels get a blow torch flame to the top of the head  step barefoot first onto ornaments yikes and take a shot to the face by loaded paint cans part of the fun is to suspend disbelief and take it all in stride sterns reaction to the spider and the iron stamp on his face is priceless as is pesci covered in feathers stern trying to hit the spider and instead crushing pescis chest only adds to the outrageousness of the final minuteswhile i loved and anticipated the finale as a child with all its three stooges violence i think as an adult the film prior to this leaves a great deal more of an impression theres a lot of heart here accompanying the pain of picking the wrong house to rob and the wrong kid to antagonize after blossom bops the bandits in the heads with an ice shovel the film pretty much tells you its only a movie culkin reuniting with his parents is the heartwarming ending you could only expect include especially blossom reuniting with his estranged sons family and theres much to find beyond just two nitwits enduring bodily injury most normal folks would never recover from,comedy
i loved this movie since god knows when so i was lucky to buy this as a double bill with this one and its sequel 2 but back to this moviemacaulay culkin what a cutie he was when he was 10 here now his the same age as zachary levi from tangled 33 years oldplays kevin a young boy whos family goes off on holidays and accidentally leaves kevin as kevin wished his parents to go away for goodleaving his family to forget all about him he soon realizes that family is all his got and as he is enjoying some time by himselftwo robbers played by daniel stern and joe pesci are up to no good in the neighborhood and discover that kevin is little do they know that kevin means business and causes havoc with the two robbersbut will kevins parents remember that kevin is absent on the airplane and will his mother come back all the way from paris to be with her sonoverall this movie has some hilarious momentsbetween the famous scream impression kevin does as he accidentally puts aftershave on his face leaving him screaming when he puts it on his facethe iron falling onto the robbers facestern and the other robbers headpesci goes up on fire along with this it has a very touching finale that will leave you sorta teary eyed i saw it last night on dvd and i swear i got all teary eyed in the endoverall this gets a solid 10,comedy
kevin mccallister macaulay culkin is the youngest of a large family they are preparing to go to paris for christmas the power goes out overnight and none of the clocks work the family rushes to get on the plane and leave little kevin behind the wet bandits harry lyme joe pesci and marv merchants daniel stern come to town to rob the mccallister home only to battle kevin and his home made trapsdirector chris columbus and writer john hughes team up to create one of the most iconic comedies of its era its in no small part due to the iconic scene of macaulay culkin slapping his face and scream take it away its a rather crass juvenile kiddie movie im not complaining just explaining expect a lot of slapstick stupidity with the annoying wet bandits,comedy
one of the best if not the best christmas movies ever funny witty emotional and clever it has the lot its supposed to be a fun laugh out loud film but with touches of the awwwwww moments thrown in trust me kids and adults alike will love this charming film especially in the run up to christmas i did find a previous review comment about how bad macauley culkens acting was quite baffling he played the part brilliantly although the stars of the show are the 2 bungling burglars you will find everything you are looking for in a christmas film with a must watch,comedy
i cant believe that this movie only has a 73 on imdb i was born in the mideighties so i saw this film a couple of years after its release it was on too late so my older sisters had to tape it for me they were even nice enough to pause the recording to cut out all the ads people who grew up with dvd recorders and harddrives wont understand this i loved this film so much kevin was the coolest kid i could think of at the time and i wanted to be like him more than anything in the world i even used to play with my friends and we would go around the house and attempt to set traps all of them harmless and stupid but it was awesome to usi own on vhs and dvd i think i still have the recorded vhs tape that my sisters taped for me somewhere i have watched the movie at least 40 times i cant wait to have kids and show them this movie it brings back memories of my childhood and that is something that a crappy review from someone cant take away i still remember my parents letting me stay up late just because was on tv they knew i had already seen it multiple times but knew that i loved it so much and how happy it made methis movie is amazing watch it with your kids and let it be apart of their lives like it is mine,comedy
is a fun family comedy starring macauley culkin as young kevin who accidentally gets left behind when his family and extended family leave on a hasty departure for paris for the christmas season before this happens he and his mom catherine ohara have an argument and she is terrified when she finds out her little boy has been left behind while in midflightis a little boys journey of being alone at home learning how to survive in the big world and having to fight off a couple of house robbers the wet bandits culkin is brilliant in he sets booby traps such as shaded mannequins he makes dance on strings behind the picture window curtains to fool the robbers into thinking there is someone home and continues to set booby traps until old man his next door neighbour who he initially was very scared of intervenesled to four more sequels and three video games culkin won several awards including best young actor starring in a motion picture the american comedy award and funniest actor in a motion picture leading role in 1991 cast includes culkin kevin ohara kevins mom kate john heard as kevins father peter joe pesci as harry and daniel stearn as marv pesci and stern were the wet bandits is pretty much one of the best christmas movies out there,comedy
with more arguments upsides and cheesy jokes here i am again with another review this time on a childhood favorite this movie makes me laugh every time and im not joking it actually does joe pesci as harry the burglar is purely great casting and daniel stern is a hilarious marv the sidekick burglar this film is just a joy to watch and just so easy to watch too then final plan scene is probably the funniest and gets me each time especially when marv enters the window only to step on glass christmas decorations for the tree other hilarious parts include the pizza man getting stone scared when kevin leaves the tv on triggering the pizza man to hear a rude chat and gunfire is a great film as well as its predecessor which will soon have a review of its own and without further discussion we will now end this review on a film i really recommend see my review for 2 reviews for 3 and 4 have been canceled due to their unofficial status sorry for any let down,comedy
on christmas morning a family went on trip to france they hurried and forgot to take their son he is a little boy but he didnt cry at all rather he enjoys the situation because no one scolds for his behavior i was impressed by his intelligence when two thieves came to his home he predicted the thieves way and trapped them i like this movie because there is an important lesson as well as funny scenes in this story it told us the preciousness of family this movie is great but at the last scene of this story i wonder why he didnt tell his family about what happened if he had told he would be praised a lot interestingly similar thing happens and he meets the same thieves in 2,comedy
what a great family classic and a good performance by the awesome macaulay culkin who starred as kevin mccallister this film was great family comedy full of laughs full of fun and christmas adventure this film touched our hearts and all was a great success and one of the best family christmas comedy films of alltime if you love macaulay culkin and funny holiday films this one is must see cant agree more macaulay culkin was a true talented gifted child star back then and he shined in he brought on a electrifying character and performance terrific family film for all families to enjoygreat direction by chris columbus great writing by john hughes a must watch film that you cant miss out onthis is my house i have to defend it  kevin mccallister macaulay culkin ,comedy
kevin mccallister is one of the most unforgettable if not the only unforgettable 8 year old character to swoop through hollywood when he was left behind one christmas nearly over two decades ago his story headlined all over the world and became an international phenomenon his feats of fighting the wet bandits while his family was away in paris can never be forgotten nor will it ever be too old to watch every christmas seasonwritten by the late john hughes is one his best work whilst hughes has always a tendency to write along the line of mostly family entertainment my personal favorites of his work is and mircale on 34th street directed by chris columbus who a decade later brings to us harry potter is the man that requires absolute recognition in this instance chris columbus always knew how to aggressively reach out to the audience and tamper with our emotions through his work if you have watched his work in bicentenial man you will know exactly what he is capable of a comedy for the family is a movie of many sorts its entertainment to the younger audience its thrills and booby traps for the younger teen its christmas magic to all the children and its family ties for the mature audience kudos mr chris columbus before hogwarts you still knew your work right sirthe 10 year old marvel that is macaulay culkin has been recognized for his role in acquiring awards back in the 90s he is absolutely brilliant in his performance culkin who was 10 years when he played the role did the magic in making this a movie a hit with the guidance of chris columbus culkin is confident different and lovable and is just as naughty as an 8 year old will be attracting all the attention and creating the most atrocious of troubles before the late john hughes wrote dennis the menace he wrote and now its clear where the thinking began for him the supporting cast is good however when you watch the movie you will not see anyone but culkin at his best since his 10 year old talent is beyond all of the other support cast combined in no way is this critic intending that the rest of the cast is bad its simply that culkin for his age is the best there has beenmedia states that culkin is the most successful child actor since shirley temple unarguably this would seem so whilst shirley temple has been from a time long ago it is with certainty that no child actor shot to international stardom over night like culkin didtis the season to be jolly and there is only a handful of christmas classics out there with nostalgic value for the viewer that hunts for classics during this time of the year reaching out especially to the expats of the uae who are far away from family during this time this movie may help to bring in some warmth to your living rooms with some fond memories of the christmas of yesterdayif you are on the hunt for christmas classics to watch with your family and friends this season chalk up this title on your list and hop over to the nearest video store this isnt a nativity play but it indeed has some christmas magic if you watch closely happy viewing dear readersmerry christmastitle directed by chris columbus starring macaulay culkin joe pesci daniel stern and catherine ohara rated pg13 rating 0810 runtime 103 minutes,comedy
when the action hits its climax this treads a dangerous line between cartoon violence and the real thing but a powerful dose of john hughes sentimentality and a side of christmas spirit mostly smooth things over macaulay culkins acting in the lead is utterly unbearable for anyone over the age of ten and the cache of gimmicks and booby traps that fuel his story often asks far too much of the audience joe pesci and daniel stern make up for that as a duo of over amplified burglar stereotypes played with a wink and a nudge at just the right moments and catherine ohara shines in a rare straight role as the flustered mother an ocean away from her youngest child straightforward and light for the majority of its run time the film works best when it remembers to pluck the heartstrings with a few seasonspecific character moments and subplots,comedy
this is another classic christmas filmi do think it has been over played over the years but i cant help it i love it at christmas time for me it was the start of this kind of movie that has now been ripped off a million times dunston checks in babys day out etcthe acting is not particularly good but with this kind of movie it doesnt need to bethis is the film that made and probably destroyed macaulay culkinthe comedy is brilliant joe pesci and daniel stern are fantastic they are so funny they know how to take a fall and their faces are classic comedyclassic christmas songs are played through it too it has a very good soundtrack and scorei probably dont need to write too much about this as 99 of you have probably already seen it more than oncei will give this film 8 out of 10great to watch at christmas time but there really should not have been any sequels even thought part 2 was not that badfor more reviews please like my facebook page httpwwwfacebookcompagesordinarypersonmovie reviews456572047728204refhl,comedy
is a good movie with a well developed plot and a talented cast its a fun and very sweet movie that i always enjoy to watch at christmas time a simple story that is consistently funny and contains enough spirit to keep the whole family entertainedthe film lacks depth i felt kevins relationship with his family members could have been established much better before he was left so that we could fully understand why he was happy to be on his own at first and be able to feel for the character when he begins to realise how much he misses his family the last twenty minutes of the film are way too frantic though it may be fun to watch pesci and stern fall over and get hurt it becomes overly slapstick and completely drops the sentimentality and christmas atmosphere that it was establishing very well previously it should not have thrown hat all awaythe cast is terrific particularly macaulay culkin a very charismatic and natural young actor as well as joe pesci and daniel stern too funny characters that you love to hate their on screen chemistry is fantastic roberts blossoms performance is very passionate in an inspired way his story is the heart and soul of the movie its a charming harmless film that you can appreciate for what it is it certainly has its imperfections but mostly makes up for that by being entertaining and will bring a smile to the whole family kevin is left while the rest of his family go on a vacation to france during christmas at first he enjoys it but soon finds out burglars are planning to rob his house best performance roberts blossom,comedy
brilliant family film hat still stands the test today culkin was very good and the film had everything from laughs to action to some moving scenesunlike the latter films whilst much of this is of course unrealistic it still manages to keep the right side of plausible and you never feel anything is too ridiculousif it had one fault the scene where the cop banged on the door couldve been rewritten much better but otherwise its a classici wouldnt touch the next 3 in the series but this was outstanding and can be enjoyed by everyone from 4 years old to 104,comedy
when released in 1990 i was about 12 so i was the perfect demographic and i loved it i remember seeing it over and over again in the theatre it was a huge runaway success and made culkin one of the biggest stars in the world ive probably seen the movie dozens of times but it has been a few years so i sat down to usher in the christmas movie season with this one last night my goodness what a fantastic movie i mean everything just works brilliantly for it to be a stone cold classic never mind the eventual battle against marv and harry which is hilarious with the quintessential gag and trap moments that had me howling out loud but the overall story is sweet and touching and has so many layers to it when you think you immediately think of the traps against the burglars but that doesnt even begin until 34 of the way through the movie everything just fits together perfectly from the cast to the scenery to the story and made me laugh out loud and even cry at the end while i think it should be geared towards older children just because of some of the thematic elements this is still a fantastic classic holiday movieit is easy to see why macaulay culkin was compared to shirley temple his on screen charisma is inexplicable and palpable i say inexplicable because he honestly doesnt exactly deliver lines particularly well even awkward at times but it matters absolutely none because he is perfect and adorable and charismatic the casting only gets better joe pesci who i always find overly dramatic and hyper is born for the role as the headstrong bossy robber harry watching him get bested and beat up is legendary daniel stern plays pescis sidekick and the bumbling robber perfectly the two of them together could not be a better fit for their respective parts this was sort of sterns pinnacle and it is easy to see why the supporting cast are all just amazing john heard catherine ohara devin ratray and roberts blossom all have such important roles and they are so terrific some are more subtle than others and they arent necessary standout roles but theyre fun and they work so well in the story and of course the legendary john candy makes a fun appearance in the story as wellchris columbus is a legendary director he goes underappreciated i think but he has such a bold style and everything is colourful and the setting is always as important as his characters and is just a perfect fit for him add in the brilliant talent of the amazing late john hughes and you have an absolute film making power couple maybe im overstating the film because it certainly isnt an academy award quality film and im sure it isnt critically acclaimed but it is sweet and so much fun and i forgot how truly great it was i could have literally put the movie back in and watched it again make this part of your holiday routine 1010,comedy
john hughes 1990 classic story directed by chris columbus  not only did this slapstick family comedy singlehandedly launch the career of its childhood star macaulay culkin it also holds the distinction of being one of the highest grossing christmas film of all time with over 475 million in box office revenue worldwide culkin plays kevin mccallister an eightyearold boy frustrated with his family who wishes he didnt have one we as the audiences dont blame him as most of the family members really do treat him horrible mostly the uncle and brother buzz the family is made out of mother catherine ohara father john heard devin ratray and roberts blossom in other family roles when he wakes up on christmas morning the next day he discovers hes been accidentally left after his entire family flies to paris on vacation and forgets about him its does feed the same story as its a wonderful life in a very odd way when it applies to both the main character and the supporting cast where both sides wish that the main character never existed and when they are apart they realize they really do love each other and want to be together for christmas at first hes relishing the time with himself im surprise that the pizza guy didnt call the cops in one of kevins pranks but the closing it get to christmas the more he miss his family and matured matters are complicated when two bumbling burglars attempt to rob the large house kevin is in played by daniel stern and joe pesci known as the wet bandits the two adult idiots quickly get outsmarted by a kid is always fun in a sick demonic way and protected his home kevin eventually manages to outwit them with a series of booby traps and tricks now its a race between time as the parents rushing home to rejoin kevin and the bandits trying to hurt him i wonder what would happen if kevin accidentally kills them would he be charge for man slaughter parents should still watch the movie just in case if the movie has way too much violence and swearing in the movie the characters in the movie are presented as cartoonlike but the fact remains the actors are real people and not animated images and the visual effects are done with a very high degree of realism its a bit disturbing that the protagonist is himself a victum of child abuse is a bit disturbing in itself the violence he inflicts on others is only an acting out of the resentment and rage he fosters towards his parents so there might be something wrong with kevin indeed still one of the most memorable aspects of is the score by john williams its amazing to hear i love the planning song the slapstick might be cruel but in heart the movie does have a christmas theme with the story of kevin and his snow shovel carrying neighbor its truly a xmas movie indeed,comedy
the night before eight year old kevin and his family are due to depart for their christmas holidays in paris he misbehaves and is sent to bed early feeling hard done by he wishes they would disappear in the morning events conspire to cause a rushed departure and kevin is accidentally left behind in the panic when he wakes up his wish has come true his parents meanwhile have discovered their mistake and are struggling desperately to find a way to get back to chicago with nobody to look after him kevin quickly learns to look after himself meanwhile harry and marv a pair of burglars are robbing houses in the area and the one they consider the best target is kevins he will have to be extra smart if he is to prevent a robbery on the first night he tricks them into believing there is a party on but he wont be so lucky the next time but the neither will harry and marv by the time they return kevin has prepared an interesting welcome for them one that will leave them bleeding burnt bruised and batteredwhen i first watched this film over twenty years ago i was surprised just how much i laughed and watching it again now it is just as funny the early part of the film has a decent number of laughs but later on when the attempted burglary takes place it is hysterically funny in a slightly malicious way harry and marv may be unpleasant criminals but im not sure anybody deserves what happens to them young macaulay culkin does a great job as kevin he really managed to carry the film joe pesci and daniel stern were also entertaining as the two burglars while it is primarily a comedy there are some touching moments most notably when kevin talks to the scary neighbour and learns that he hasnt spoken to his son for years because of a silly argument overall id say this is a great film that can be enjoyed by young and old alike definitely one to watch,comedy
 spoiler alert as far as i can tell john hughes has never written a movie that didnt have a human touch thats his magic touch the plots of his movies are not complex but the characters always contain a level that makes them slightly more dimensional then most hughes is mostly known for adventures involving teens and adults like ferris buellers day off sixteen candles planes trains and automobiles and the breakfast club films that are simplistic in their plots but wonderful in their humanitythose films stayed pretty close to the ground plotwise but is a little differentit is not about teenagers but about a plucky little kid with a story that leans more toward fantasythis one involves possibly the greatest kid in the history of the world and his adventure foiling two burglars who try to break into his house on christmas evethis is an adventure that the little rascals might have gotten involved in decades ago thats a good thingthe kid is kevin mcallister macaulay culkin a cute 8 yearold whose overlarge family is getting ready to take a trip from chicago to paris to spend the holiday with relativesthe night before their departure the power goes out and the family wakes to find that they have only 45 minutes to catch their flightin the rush to get to the airport the family inadvertently leave little kevin behindkevin is an amazing kidhes resourceful mature he remembers to take a bath and even does the laundryhe even goes to the store on funds pilfered from his older brother buzzhowever he also has free reign of the house especially his brothers room where he makes use of the bee bee guntheres no reality to kevin but i dont think that was the pointno kid would do many of the things that kevin would do and if indeed a kid were this smart he might even think to call the cops and let them know that hes been left at home by himselfthis is a fantasy so we just have to sit back and enjoy it at that levelmeanwhile two separate events are taking place elsewhereon a plane somewhere over the atlantic the realization dawns on kevins mother catherine ohara that she has left her son behindas she does her best to get back home a potential threat is looming for the pintsized hero in the form of two idiotic burglars harry joe peschi and marv daniel stern who are taking advantage of the fact that the people on kevins street are away for christmasharry sees the mcallisters luxurious house as a gold mine kevin finds out their coming and sets up a series of booby trapsis a fun goodhearted moviedirector chris columbus and writer john hughes do a nice job of creating a film that is both heartwarming and very funnythe heartwarming stuff comes from a relationship that kevin develops with the old man next doorthey seem to have a mutual problem but in a touching scene in a church they talk about the meaning of their problem and of the meaning of familywhat makes the film really work is the performance by macaulay culkin a cute kid but not a cloying onehe has pitchperfect timing in his comedy and there are moments when he hits his mark so perfectly that you wonder if the filmmakers worked with him for days on end or if he really is that goodi like to think he isthe funny stuff comes in the films third act as kevin attempts to defend the house against the burglars using traps that no 8 yearold kid in the world could ever devisethey involve a lot of carpentry engineering and foreknowledge of where the burglars are going to stand when he springs the trapsit is violence on par with the road runner cartoons or more accurately with the inspector clouseu pictures it is violent but not bloody or unpleasantyou have to put that stuff in the back of your mindisnt a perfect movie but it is a good oneyou have to take it at face valueas i said this is all pure fantasy and its a lot of fun,comedy
spending christmas in sunny australia threw my christmas spirit array and i needed something to make it feel more christmassy was the perfect film to do this watched by families every year the film never fails to bring a smile to the face and a christmas feeling in your heartreleased in 1990 the film is still a classic however what i hadnt remembered was how slow the film is to get going the vast majority of the film seems to concentrate on kevins adventures in the house but thats not why kids watch it they want to see the bad guys meet their comic demise it just felt a little dragged out before the action finally began likewise as much of a legend as macaulay culkin is he just wasnt as good as i remembered when he was trying to act sad it just felt a bit wooden he really came to life when he used comedy or was setting up the traps against the bad guys in comparison to his family though he was superb the other group of actors were just slightly too dull for me and i didnt particularly enjoy their scenesfor me the two robbers were the highlight of the film two actors have never been picked so perfectly their timing their facial expressions their tone was just fantastic and even in my 20s i still laughed out loud at their performances the film is pretty basic but thats all it needs to be the stunts are fun and childish and didnt need to use any special effects to make them any better its simple but just right a fantastic film that will never lose its charm its a christmas mustsee every year,comedy
is a christmas classic about a young boy named kevin mccallister who is accidentally left behind during the chaos on a trip he then realizes that two burglars are about to break in and so he must defend himselfwhy on earth is this movie so lowly rated 73 on imdb for this film is simply said not high enough cmon this is a christmas classic and is widely regarded by many as the 2nd greatest xmas movie this film has heart fun and absurdityi first watched this movie 6 years ago when i was back in the 4th grade not only did i cry and laugh my head off but so did everyone in our class we as a class had a blast and even today when i just watched it i love the film there are so many things i love about this film i love every single actor even the little kids who dont get very much screentime thats how good the acting is in particular little macaulay culkin perhaps the greatest kid actor before he became drug addict joe pesci and daniel stern were the perfect burglar pair that was just perfect i loved how this film had heart like when the band offered to drive kevins mom all the way home saying sure its christmas time i also absolutely loved the hell outta old man marley and the character background story they gave him i also loved how he looks evil but deep down you see him as a nice character perfect film,comedy
before his first debut in the fantasy genre starting with the first two harry potter films for warner bros he makes his debut in the family movie genre starting with adventures in babysitting heartbreak hotel and this holiday classic known as it takes place at the macalister place where 6year old kevin macaulay culkin who is tired of being treated unfairly by his cousins and his family wishes that he wants to be all by himself his dream came true when his parents forgot to bring kevin along with them to paris france for christmas but when two bandits named harry joe pesci and marv daniel stern try to break into the house he sets up a bunch of housetraps to welcome themtoday is christmas eve and i would recommend this to all yuletiders who love christmas because this is one of columbus classic from the good ol 90s the acting is great catherine o hara did a pretty good job as kevins mother joe pesci and daniel stern did great as the two bandits but arguable the best performance in the movie this far goes to macaulay culkin for doing such a compelling job as our likable protagonist kevin i liked the concept about a young kid who realizes that hes all alone in his familys house and learns that he has to love his family and the music score done from the famous john williams was beautiful including the tune somewhere in my memorythere are two problems that i do have with this film the slapstick although funny seemed too overthetop at times and the moral lessons sometimes get corny but thats what make this classic worth watching and is an entertaining holiday classic from the 90srating 8610,comedy
the film is about kevin mccallister played by macully culkin who is left for the holidays while he is there are 2 robbers known as the wet bandits marv played by daniel stern and harry played by joe pesci who are after kevins housei don not see a reason why not to review this film right around the holidays i could have chose to review gremlins but i already did in my 31 days of horror this film is very funny and has great story telling and perfect casting if you do not love this movie well then what in the world is wrong with you check it outrated pg for slapstick violence mild language and brief smoking1hr 42min102min,comedy
is often compared to something it was never trying to be plausible it is a very fictitious film one only a child might like parents will be divided i can see some laughing some cringing and some sleeping young children will appreciate it the current generation of teens might and those who grew up with it will continue to watch the constant reruns on television during the christmas seasonwhile the concept is implausible the story is simple eight year old kevin mccallister culkin is accidentally left by his forgetful family during a hectic morning rush to get to the airport for their family vacation kevin enjoys having the house to himself after wishing he didnt have a family the night before but then he becomes the target for two bumbling criminals named harry and marv pesci and sternkevin creates many booby traps throughout the whole film he uses them to his advantage so that the criminals can suffer many many obnoxious blows to the head some funny some not its all up to the films way of timing it some traps can be hysterical while others become very redundant i can see how plausibility clouds the viewers enjoyment to the film because you know that no eight year old would be able to concoct if he was fed cough syrup to help him stay asleep during a coldbut ultimately accomplishes one crucial element giving cute and inspired scenes for the purpose of childhood escapism children love watching unrealistic things happening on screen especially when the protagonist is right around their age this film is ideal for children of that age because it will tickle them that someone of their age can create such things like that then they will try and find one of their friends at school who can do the same sort of thingits delightful and cheery but very dopey and slapsticky i mentioned the jokes dont always work but many times they certainly do after all there is something that tickles my happy place when i see someone of such a young age outsmart two criminals theres something lying in that premise that brings out the child in methis was of course produced by the teenagerwhisper john hughes himself it seems after a very successful run of high school films he wanted to calm his brain and do one about a child its strange to watch a john hughes film that occupies little to no coming of age elements but still kevin is a bit too young to be truly finding his selfworth and purpose on earthmacaulay culkin is a delightful young actor but sadly hasnt gone on to do very many things in recent years unlike his two brothers kieran and rory respectively culkin did however play a paraplegic in the christiansatire saved which i instantly fell in love with here hes a lot younger and livelier and you just knew he would go on to play the cute innocent young boy in many other films while he was still a cute innocent young boywill also resurrect memories from your youth when you were left for the very first time the house seems so much bigger emptier and more silent than it ever has before its the strangest feeling that only weakens over timelike i said before a persons generation and age will factor in greatly when judging if they like or dislike this film personally it still holds up today its fresh entertaining and satisfying but can be redundant at points was a cute concept but the sequel treatment was anything but left alone still as long as there are still devoted supporters of this cherished film i can say that the repeated airings on popular cable networks will not cease in the immediate futurestarring macaulay culkin joe pesci and daniel stern directed by chris columbus,comedy
is about a young boykevin mccallister who gets left behind in his house accidentally when his family realizes this it is already too late seeing as they already took the plane and are thousands of miles away from home but despite that they still try all that they can do to get home and contact kevin meanwhile back in kevins neighborhood there has been reports of ongoing robberies kevin with his many tricks and fast wit does his best to protect his home from the burglarsthe movie is a bit unrealistic but the again there wouldnt be any movies if nothing outoftheordinary ever happened to enjoy this movie it is best if viewers dont overthink about what happened and just sit back and take in kevins crazy anticsi admit that i began getting bored when it was the climax of the film i felt like the humor was very cheap and it wasnt at all engaging i did however like the message and the heartwarming feeling that i felt during the endingfor me this was a mediocre film im sure i would have liked this film more if i had company this film may have many people saying its very hilarious but i found that i only really laughed about twice maybe if i had company i would have appreciated this film more ill keep that in mind when december 2011 comes aroundviewed on april 5 2011,comedy
i think this film is showed every year on tv but it still maintains its christmas charm the music really goes well with the story especially the song in the church macaulay is wonderful and funny its a definite christmas must this year i wanted to see how they forget him at home and if i can find a problem in the plot well the way they managed it was quite ok with the power lines and the way they where in a hurry i think they thought about it a while so they could keep at bay all those seeking mistakes another thing that was very funny was the shots in when tarantula was crossing the frame it added a nice feeling rather a strange one but still nice,comedy
will long be remembered as a seasonal workable hit comedy that will stand the test of time the huge hit of 1990  amazing to think it is nearly 21 years old  spawned 3 sequels that came nowhere near mastering the original but john hughes is in top form here and delivers a worldwide global hit it was the movie that made macaulay culkin an overnight star and thankfully for him his cutesy acting is pitched perfectly well it would be easy to side with joe pesci and stern as the bad guys when faced with an obnoxious smart ass kid but culkin shows us his vulnerability through the loneliness of being left at home and it is this that works well the humour is decent the slapstick almost painfully real this is a good movie with heart that deserved the success bestowed upon it at the time,comedy
this movie came out in 1990wow i just saw it again in 2010and its still great in fact even though i find it great now i think i see more that makes it so than i did as a child as an adult i notice things i didnt previously the mark of a good movie is if that can happenif you can come back years later and see some new thingsand you still like it this is a good movieas a child it was scary and funny anc clever and cute as an adult im noticing how timeless it is even the setting makes it difficult to tell its 20 years old and im just now realizing how well off the mccallisters were the house is the bomb and taking a family trip to france who does that how awesome is that now i find myself wishing i could have that lifestyle before i dont think i even noticedto sum it up the people who created this movie were forwardthinking they pushed the envelope as far as characterization and dialogue kevin is a character you just dont see everyday the supporting characters are all a everyone seems to just fit their roles beyond that the plot is clever and the setting is very realistic notice the details in the house decorating next time you see it no corners were left unturned it seems basically this is just a wellmade movie that should make all of us proud to have it as part of our american culture 810,comedy
the kid is fan of kid movies so i think to those movies because i count them as masterworks they knew how to blend a lot of strong elements and are unique for that they mix the best holidays christmas and its wonderful spirit the values of family the cartoon fun with the thieves and a great soundtrack magical score from john williams as well as christmas songs my preference however goes to the first movie the setting in this huge mansion with snow outside is what everyone can dream for christmas and its true that when you are a kid you fantasize about being a lot have been said about culkin but he was truly good for the job not a spoiled brat but a kind and witty kid beyond the cast was really great from the mother to the exceptional joe pesci and dont forget heatherthe kid was under the spell right away as soon as we watched it he recognized the sound of john williams its like harry potter and i realize why the pair was chosen on this adaptation as soon as it was finished he wanted to see the sequel its a musthave for all homes because it brings joy every time,comedy
i just got to say that this is the best movie ever made and its my favorite movie of all time its funny entertaining unrealistic which makes it great i know a lot of people say this movie is unrealistic but i think thats what makes the movie so much fun and im sure john hughes was aware that this movie was unrealistic and i think a lot of movies should be like this whenever i want to escape reality for a couple of hours i pop this movie in because its a childhood favorite and i grew up watching this movie i am upset that i never got to see this movie in theaters but i did catch the sequel in theaters back in 92 and i will review that movie next because i love that one just as much anyway i highly recommend 1 and 2 for everyone 3 is tolerable but i dont highly recommend it and dont see 4 please unless you want to watch garbage,comedy
for all of you smarties leaving too many blank rating stars above i bet youll feel 100 times more guilty one day watching this movie together with your 68 years old son and for him this will be something best ever made for people of his age actually in his view for all ages no ninjas mutants creatures or supers heroes just a boy as he would like to be and his nemesis on a side note i couldnt convince him to do some things at the house by himself no matter what i tried but this movie did just by exampleat the end imagine watching something 20 times and enjoy it like first not even fellini or kubrick could not come close to that quote  genuine admiration  end of quote same goes for ha2,comedy

im a fan of christ columbus john hughes mccauley culkin and catharine ohara the film is a classic a must see though it stars joe pesci a very dirty actor dont be deceived it is completely appropriate and now in honor of john hughes one of hollywoods greatest writersdirectors a tribute from to babys day out to ferris buelers day off to weird science youll see the name john hughes he wrote 39 things including class reunion weird science mr mom vacation breakfast club ferris buelers day off some kind of wonderful planes trains and automobiles uncle buck the great outdoors and of course the s view a complete list of all tv shows and movie written or directed by john hughes at httpwwwimdbcomnamenm0000455 john hughes made many movies and inspired many laughs in his time all leading up to his final film drill bit taylor so in memory of john hughes watch this movie,comedy
is a moderately enjoyable film kids will love it adults wont be bored but they may be turned off by the cartoon violence which is sometimes excessive macaulay culkin is cute as the young kid kevin who gets left behind at home and battles with some burglars i thought macaulay was way too smart and the adults all shown as shallow and dumb still its a family movie and in that respect it works joe pesci is an inspired choice and lifts the film with his energy most of the films humor comes from him the film is better than its sequels and best seen during the christmas holidaysoverall 610,comedy
beautiful film as to the usual one the usual negative comments which talk about a classical film some years 80 which everyone does not like it to the nostalgic ones are metsure heros that this film had to have a judgment in this site in fact reviewers good part has put a high vote to the previous episodes because this contrast i know the reason since assumptive reviewers good part favorably sees the past and as the past is better than the present they have given several credit to the preceding episodes being still the last episode more explosive and spectacular at this point should reject also the old episodes but there are here two weights and two measurein fact also cinema masterpieces have been criticized and denigrated good part some reviewers of this site belong to the very bad reviewers better think separately with its head i was sure that the god fun old episode did not like it who has to be withdrawn is not george lucas but the last reviewer sampat go away cary guffey,comedy
you get a lot of kids these days fastforwarding until they see somebody get hurt i dont know perhaps they should that last half hour is one of the coolest bunch of movie sequences ever thrown together its all childish as hell but i cant not laugh at the villains walking into a bunch of really obvious traps the redundant sequels tried to get the same kind of flow between all the physical gags but i think its safe to say they just sucked you cant touch the grand finale of however i think what comes before all of that is pretty enjoyable too or at least i used to as a kid being able to do whatever you want its not too bad of a christmas present it gets boring because the setup takes a bit too long but i understand they had to have an excuse for that brilliant main event im usually not that excited about a movie aimed towards children but is just really really cool,comedy
the last halfhour of this 1990 film is hysterical as mccaulay caulkin turns the tables on 2 dimwitted robbers played phenomenally well by joe pesci and daniel sterncome on even with a lot of children around how could 4 adults leave young mccaulay behind of course thats the plot so that he can make mischief but its a little silly here complicating matters the christmas holiday makes it difficult to get back homethe next door neighbor an elderly gentleman is regarded as an eerie individual only our young lad talks to him in church and gets him to try to contact his longestranged son how convenientwhile there is love of family here our little hero did quite well when left to survive for himself he may very well be our young robinson crusoe,comedy
family is important that is the key point in kevin mccallister wishes his family would disappear and when they take a holiday to france and hes accidentally left behind in chicago alone to face two burglars pesci and stern he wants his family back the acting in this film is great and the soundtrack and the morals are meaningful it even goes as far to be upsetting because it shows how much family means in an effective way this film is also great because it incorporates comedy into the plot how an 8 year old can outwit two burglars with a series of funny yet painfully clever traps i love this movie and its sequel 2 lost in new york should live on forever i give this movie 1010 incredible must watch,comedy
is a very enjoyable semiclassic film its about as good as a movie about a kid being left at home and terrorized by burglars could bemccully culkin plays kevin mccallister the youngest in a family of many children he is picked on by the older ones and a slip of the tongue gets him in trouble after a power shortage and a rush to the airport he is left to make matters worse marv joe pesci and harry daniel stern two police officer burglars are trying to break into kevins house while the familys away this is a really fun movie the acting is all around good from paranoid mother catherine ohara to johny candy the situations kevin is put through are unrealistic but who really cares theyre funny and clever mccully culkin is really good in this actually considering for much of the film its a one man show with the good comes the badthis movie can get annoying at times his nonstop screaming in the film gets old as does his constant looking and talking to the camera but nonetheless this is still a fun movie for kids and pretty painless for adultsmy rating  out of  100 mins pg for language and mild violence,comedy
where would the holidays be without the antics of kevin mcallister when released it became a huge hit and made macaulay culkin a mega star it was directed by chris columbus who was also responsible for bringing harry potter to the big screen for a kids movie it is pretty violent but that only adds to the overwhelming appeal of this classicjoe pesci and daniel stern were superb as the burgles who are no match for an 8 year oldin fact is reminiscent of the tom and jerry cartoons where someone would get hit over a thousand and would still be able to stand back up and go back for more some of the traps kevin sets for the burgles for ingenious spawned 3 more sequels but only the second movie could come close to matching the genius of the original violent but immense fun for all ages,comedy
i have seen this movie probably 1000 times since i was like 4 or 5 and that was 13 years ago and i have consistently watched it at least a few times a year and it always seem funnyi do not understand why people on here dislike the movie they obviously dont have much of a sense of humour to not even laugh at some of the jokes pesci and stern are an amazing duel and really the only on screen duel that i actually like more is jackie chan and chris tucker almost everything they said made me laugh out loud especially stern who was marvmacauley culkin had an amazing job in playing the bratty too cute kid the heartwarming moment at the end of the movie just added to the greatnessi recommend for all families to watch you will not be disappointed,comedy
on a sudden hint the mc callister family got news that there will be going on christmas vacation to france so in a hurry they all had to rush to the airport forgetting one small thing at home every one son and everyone brother kevin mc callister macaulary culkin they all only realized this on the plane while traveling to france two men known as the wet bandits as marv daniel stern and harry joe pesci is going to rob and flood all the houses in that area that has no one in side of it but they were unsuccessful since kevin had made heavy and cunning plans and traps in order to interrupt the bandits from competing there jobs that they were surprise to see that but at last he was caught by the two bandits but kevin was so cunning that he made friends with an old man in that area called marley and marley quickly inform the police and also save kevin from the clutches of death,comedy
absolutely hilarious film about an eight year old boy who is accidentally left by his parents who have flown to paris for christmas and so must fend for himself when his house is threatened by burglarsmacauley culkin is enjoyable and sufficiently cute as the abandoned child whilst joe pesci and daniel stern are both very funny as the misfit crooks chris columbus film written and produced by john hughes is a damn sight more impressive than his directorial debut a night on the town as he handles all the movies moods well and john williams catchy christmassy score caps it all off this ones bound to warm your heart as well as make you laughsaturday november 21 1992  videojohn hughes pleasant and humorous film doesnt really hit top gear until joe pesci and daniel stern come into the action but when they do things really get out of control and the comedy from here on is hilariousthis is good old fashioned slapstick at its very best pesci and stern are riotous and even if the plot meanwhile isnt brilliant it fills in time nicely enough very very funny even on return viewing far superior to the sequeltuesday november 30 1993  video,comedy
was the top moneyspinner of 1990 and thrust chris columbus to the alist of hollywoods filmmakers im not exactly an enormous fan of columbus because there is something sickeningly twee that seems to infect just about everything he gets his hands on is one of his more successful endeavours although i tend to think thats more to john hughes screenplay which is full of tiny amusements rather than anything on columbus partafter all this is not the first time hughes has tackled the nightmares of holiday travel he previously directed the quite wonderful thanksgiving comedy planes trains  automobiles he got a tremendous amount of mileage from what could have been a thinly plotted scenario and enlivened the film through rich nuanced performances from steve martin and john candy a film of equal heart and humour a true comedy classicis not quite as successful if it had been directed by the sure hand of john hughes instead of the simplistically banal hand of chris columbus it might have elevated the films premise to classic status instead its a film of amusing diversions and interesting ideas trying to get out but when they do is a very good film indeedwe really dont need to go into specifics about the plot had such an impact on people the world over its entered the english language indeed its the intriguing concept at the heart of the film that drew so many people to it in the first place an eight year old boy kevin mccallister is left at home by his neglectful parents during the christmas holidayswhile theyre in paris kevin has free reign of the mccallister house that must be the dream of any child the freedom to do whatever they want whenever they want no parents to hold them back or discipline them when they step out of line the whole film rests on little macaulay culkins shoulders and he does quite well tooi dont think culkin is all that much of an actor after all he peaked at a very young age and his career went into steady decline after that but his obnoxious precocity wasnt quite as pronounced here there was still a little bit of innocence left in the boy which is what gives the film its conviction without it wouldnt workwhich is exactly the reason why 2 didnt work by that time culkin was 12 years old and his childlike innocence had long since left him his ego had thoroughly taken over and the film seemed a much more calculated attempt on columbus part to replicate the things that made the first film work so wellhughes quite well written screenplay puts kevin through his paces i enjoyed watching the shifts in little kevins emotions first off is kevins astonishment he wished for his family to disappear and so they did well theyve only gone on holiday but to a childs mind it could seem like wish fulfilment this leads to unbridled joy at living life on his own termsbut gradually the reality of his situation begins to sink in this leads to loneliness fear and eventually horror when the mccallister mansion is targeted by two dimwitted burglars harry and marv joe pesci  daniel sternthe point where kevin must defend his home by outfitting it with booby traps from top to bottom provides one of the best sustained 15 minutes of comedy youll ever see i did find it hard to swallow that kevin could come up with so many different booby traps from blowtorches to tripwires and even micro machines especially with only an hour to work with but columbus directs these scenes with such breathless energy it will have you laughing harder than anything else in the filmthere are some smaller pleasures to be found elsewhere the film adds an external character of a snow shoveller kevin believes to be a mass murderer but in a nicely written scene he turns out to be a lonely man estranged from his family i like this scene because it very nicely sums up kevins predicament what started out as an answer to his prayers is beginning to feel more and more like a punishment being alone can be fun for awhile but eventually we want it to end its a very overlooked scenei also liked the scenes with kevins mother played by catherine ohara her desperately trying to get home to kevin is pleasantly reminiscent of planes trains  automobiles all the more so because she even ends up travelling with john candy along the way he plays a character not all that far removed from del griffith and the interplay between the two feels natural and warm like pta candy proves to be oharas ticket homehas its flaws here and there but it is a reasonably polished film and it makes you laugh at all of the right moments its not quite the holiday classic planes trains  automobiles was but youre bound to find something fun about it and kids will most definitely love it since theyre the intended target audience has accomplished what it set out to do you really couldnt ask for anything more,comedy
any kid whos had that one theory i wonder what life is like when you live alone needs to see this or if they already have good on you but try living alone without your parents for a week im 17 and ive done it once it is not fun its rather boringbut then again marv and harry wernt trying to break into my homeok now to the story kevin mccallister an 8 year old kid hes 7 in the movie to novel adaption is going on vacation with his whole family which is about 20 or 30 people cousins uncles aunts etc etc and he makes a wish that his whole family would just disappear after things go bad at dinner but unfortunately the power gets knocked out at his home and while everyone is rushing to get ready to leave he gets left at home while his whole family leaves for the airport but they dont bother to wake him so when he wakes up he discovers his wish came true hes but his dream soon becomes a nightmare when two robbers want to hit his home so how will he deal with that this movie has got to be one of the best family comedies ever made its got its fair share of coarse language so if youre not into that watch the tv version its fair share of scares music and the christmas atmosphereand speaking of which they say a christmas story is a christmas tradition this should be a christmas traditioni say you should see it its 910,comedy
i saw that movie this year and it was excellent macaulay culkin as kevin mccallister was excellent joe pesci as harry and daniel strens as marv where hilarius john heard as peter mccallister was brilliant catherine ohara as kate mccallister was beautiful sam dosent like uncle frank this movie is when the mccallisters go to france paris to a family christmas trip just then kevin mccallister stays at the house and lives alone they where two bad guys named marv and harry they where the wet bandids to steal and ruins people house like when marv sinks the house with water this movie is excellent you will like this christmas movie and so does the characters,comedy
i wouldnt say this is the best movie i ever seen but i must say it is one funny movie the second one was pretty good as well but the third and fourth ones were just a little kids movies the first movie of i think is the best movie and it is exactly what ill never get sick of it even though ive been watching it over and over again the funny thing about this movie is that there is so many people in the mccallister family and kevin is the only one who causes trouble and when he wakes up the next morning of their vacation in france he finds that his family has left him i really like the two idiots harry and marv and they are the guys that makes this movie so good and of course the guy who people thinks is a shovel slayer and kevin always screams when he sees him but eventually him and the shovel slayer make friends i like the part when he has to make a battle plan to defeat the two idiots who were going to break in his house one night and the battle plan music is very good and catchy i think this movie deserves to be a quite good movie for 1990 and i always thought this movie was made in 2000 because it is so good this deserves at least a 6,comedy
this is a great movie for the whole family the best movie that mac did what a talent he is it would be nice to see him act again i know he has done some indy movies but i would like to see him back in the main stream i always enjoy the movie during the holidaysthe ones with out mac were not as good as the first two that was all they needed since they did not have any luck with the third and fourth movies should not fix it if its not broke one of the best holiday movies ever we need to see more great family holiday films like this one even my two year old enjoys it and so does the whole family we have seen it at least 100 times,comedy
this was the worlds best macaulay culkin film ive watched it is one of my most watched films ever watched mac did his best in this film and the second and made billions of bucks its about this kid who wishes his parents would disappear then he becomes man of the house and has to deal with these retarded burglars who just are dying to break in then he must rid of them forever if you arent watching it now you should its really worth watching so if you dont own it go rent under comedy section enjoy it and if you love it own it if you love youll love 2 and his other films i feel sorry for those who havent seen it i know 99 of the world has seen it,comedy
my take not a holiday classic in the lines of its a wonderful life but a mild classic all its own ever since i watched it since i was a kid until now that im a big movie fan is still a very hilarious and effective comedy it may not just be up there among the highestgrossing films of all time but also among the funniest films ever its fast with the laughs yet still not ignoring the family values which the film must have the story is very memorable and fresh and always worth a look little macaulay culkin delivers all he can in his performance as kevin while joe pesci and daniel stern are fantastically appealing as the two burglars who gets into sticky situations when they underestimate the power of a little eightyear oldfor those who havent watched it yet which is very doubtful goo watch it now for those whove seen it several times like me go watch it again this time with the entire family honestly it doesnt disappointrating 12 out of 5,comedy
after being accidentally left by his family kevin mcallister macaulay culkin must defend his residence from the wet bandits daniel stern and joe pesci who are for some reason obsessed with the idea of hurting the little boy and stealing useless knickknacksthis film is a legend and a classic released in 1990 it captures both the more serious 1990s with the fun 1980s two 1980s masters come together to film this one john hughes as writer sixteen candles pretty in pink the breakfast club and chris columbus as director adventures in babysitting this makes for the perfect blend in young adult situation comedythis is the film that launched macaulay culkins career while he had previously appeared in jacobs ladder and uncle buck this was and remains his biggest and most cherished role i would find it safe to say no film since has really captured the essence of macaulay while saved and party monster are both possibly equally as good movies they do not have the mass appeal of what is best about the film is its sense of fun the plot really makes little sense how does a family not notice they have an extra plane ticket or that a sibling is missing why would burglars break into a house where they can be identified how can joe pesci get beat up relentlessly and not curse once is it possible to not have a single friend family member or neighbor in all of chicago the scream joke was used too much four times at least one and probably two instances could have been removed do we need to see a little boy twice getting burned by aftershave of course not the repeated use of the keep the change you filthy animal joke seemed to work very well though strangely enoughoverall this is a great christmas movie along with die hard this is one you really need to make sure you watch around the holidays at least once if you have never seen you are one of five people on earth or something it was a huge success with good reason so see it,comedy
who could forget the famous scream done by macaulay culkins character kevin made when he puts on that aftershave i wouldnt its the holidays and everyone is jumping for joy to go out of town to visit other families but not kevin he gets left behind accidentally so when he he can raise some serious hell in the house the family board the plane and later realize they have left kevin behind the entire family regret what they said the night before and they go on a frantic quest to get to kevin however unknown to the family theres a couple of burglars robbing the neighborhood calling themselves the wet bandits marvdaniel stern and harryjoe pesci try their bes to rob kevins house boy are they in for a surprise any kid would crawl into a corner and cower not kevin hes the home commando and he really kicked butt it goes to show you picked the wrong home to rob it can be fun to be but time after time it will get old his wish to see his family and its heartwarming the movie has chemistry it has heart and it has fun great for the family 5 stars,comedy
john hughes has really produced some great films throughout the 80s without a doubt ferris buellers day off the breakfast club pretty in pink etc but in 1990 he really cracked it in the original is without a doubt a must watch film for all audiencesas always hughes creates a situation for the film that is a crowd pleaser in this case an 8 year old left at christmas while his mother and family hope to get back home in time for christmas meanwhile young kevin mcallister is left to defend his home against two idiotic robbers with a house full of surprisesthis film is certainly a christmas film but its what hughes puts into it that makes it an essential one the story structure the laughs and the joyful christmas feeling this film will make you laugh and maybe even cry it has it all in this family pleasing christmas topper,comedy

scream your lungs out eat maccoronies and cheese on christmas ever watch rrated movies while eating rubbish when youre parents are not home and show them who is the boss of the house perhaps one of the most enjoyable and memorable christmas movie in history with great performances memorable scenes and screams plus plenty of good christmas music and nice scene of actual people eating pizza and drinking milk with it in the christmas spirit i give a nine and hope everyone will watch this one over the holidays hey i have reserved the day before christmas eve merry christmas everyone and a happy new year,comedy
i cant believe liking a kiddie movie but i do this movie is very funny mccauley caulkin displays great talent for his age as the child trying to defend his home from two dopey burglars played by daniel stern and joe pesci pesci has never been funnier as a competitive burglar who cant believe that he is being beaten by a kid pesci and stern end up making complete fools of themselves caulkins parents are played by john heard and catherine ohara they are both funny as different personality parents who completely forget their son on a holiday trip there is also an amusing scene with john candy as a polka clarinetist i liked the part where caulkin helped out his neighbor by advising him to contact his estranged son all and all a delightful children film  up there with a christmas story and dennis the menace ps  one flaw a lot of characters were speaking in a definite new york accent the movie was set in chicago,comedy
this is a very fun movie from john hughs breakfast club maid in manhattan its a bit like a cartoon tho in that what we learn from watching it is that its funny when someone falls down or gets seriously hurtthis is a great movie especially when judged by the number of laughs it earns can it be 16 years ago that this movie came out i dare say this is a christmas classic a christmas classic that could be enjoyed any time of year i believe in the world of literature what 50 years must go by before a novel can be judged a classic how long is the wait for a movie,comedy
good i dont think its as good as the second 2lost in new york but its not bad its not very often that sequels pass there originals but i think 2 has but is is very good the tricks are goodnot quite as good as 2 tricks its funny enough and its about the right length for a film like this i know i give 2lost in new york  out of  but i still give this one  out of  even though i dont think that this original film isnt as good as the first sequel to it 2 i still think its passes 3 and 4 but i think its an  out of  so ignore the 65 out of 10 rating on imdb and watch the film,comedy
6310 i mean what do we have to watch these days to give a movie a flying color grade is one of those few movies that can be enjoyed by all by all men women and children can sit together any day of the year and enjoy a heartwarming film no its not the godfather benhur or the ten commandments but it is sixteen candles a christmas story and its a wonderful life the casting is excellent the screenplay is tremendous and the overall effect and lore surrounding the film is luminous there is a reason this movie still is one of the highest grossing of all time i know that we as critics on imdb strive for the best in motion pictures but to those out there who are grading with 5 or less cmon were not talking about 3 here but instead the timeless original,comedy
is one of the most memorable holiday films of the 90sstory revolves on the mccallaster family who live in an average neighborhood in a large house they traditionally like to go on winter vacation with the relatives they were all looking forward to it till the mccallasters youngest son kevin causes some trouble with the family and hes the only one who doesnt get along with every one elsehe wishes he could enjoy christmas without them and without hesitation everyone leaves for their trip to paris with the hassle of getting up at the wrong time when the power went out and cause their alarms not to go off it took awhile for kevin to figure out where everyone is he thinks he wished them to disappear this is what made him happylife seemed good till he keeps noticing a mysterious van in the neighborhood with 2 guys who so happen to be burglars their names are harry and marv 2 easy going burglars with a scheme in robbing the homes of those who are already on their own christmas trip this makes kevin scared and tries all he can to protect his own homeand when his family and relatives noticed hes not with them thatll make things interesting to watchis a great comedyholiday film i recommend it for ages 8 and up or those who are mature to see a pg movie,comedy
is one of my favorite movies in fact i have memorized almost every line from the movie there is one mistake not mentioned on this site in kevin is 8 in 2 one year later he is 10 in 2 its made clear that its the following christmas this mistake has never come up before and i thought others would have noticed also notice how calm the mother is considering her 8 year old is alone its amazing that the movie did as well as it did it was a great film though but i wanted to point out that mistake with the age difference how did he skip an age by the following christmas is a year round film in my house,comedy
this is my favorite holiday movie yes that must mean that i am a caring person because its sweet and funny i didnt see this because i was 3 at the time and i didnt watch movies in a theater until 1991 but i have seen this on tv every year and i used to watch the dvd and vhs versions of this and yes they are all great and so are things like using a fake movie to scare pizza delivery guys and burglars away using train sets with sticks and cardboard people and loud music to fool people into think that theres a party going on and more is in fact one of the greatest holiday movies ever made what else is there to say,comedy
my earliest memories of watching christmas movies lie with this film i am now 17 and i still love it christmas is usually a time where filmmakers go wild churning out any film with big name stars in the hope of making a fast buck but is so much more than that the plot is slightly unrealistic but that adds to the magic of the film macaulay culkin really belies his years and gives an amazing performance as kevin mcallister an eight year old boy left by his family this film really encapsulates the feelings and emotions of christmas for me and although the ending may be slightly predictable it does bring a tear to my eye a real classic film for all the family without a doubt my favourite film of all time,comedy
theres nothing better to watch on christmas time than its a funny well written family film with good slapstick and idiot burglars that stole the show really the credit for this film being so funny goes to daniel stern hes probably the best movie comedian since john belushi and he plays a great idiotthe film is about two idiot burglars joe pesci and daniel stern hitting every house on a block except for one because kevin the brilliant nine year old fooled them that someone was there and they skipped it then when they find out that kevin is the only one there they set out to rob the house but theyll have trouble getting through kevins little house of funwatch it you wont be disappointed the slap stick for such a young kid is great pesci and stern are hysterical and its all good,comedy
question does anyone know who the bearded man was at the airport this was the scene where catherine ohara is trying to buy a ticket home to fetch her son kevin there is a woman in white next to her behind the woman in white is a tall man with a beard who looks exactly like the late elvis presley just wondering who he was the movie is from 1990 and elvis died in 1977 very strange he is wearing a lot of makeup but you can tell its elvis he even has the same smirk who is it really please comment on this or i will go and get my eyes checked striped and polkadotted he is not listed in the credits as an extra please help thanks joe,comedy
is a christmas treat which will make you feel all warm and glowing inside by the end of the film and have you laughing hysterically throughout the almost 2 hours kevin played by culkin is one of the youngest boys in a large family that live in a large house in the suburbs while the family go away for the holidays kevin accidentally gets left behind and he becomes the hero of the film by protecting his house against a couple of idiotic bandits the film is filled with slapstick humour which will leave you laughing hysterically theres also some subplots which will leave you nice and warm for the holidays generally it is a excellent feelgood film made just for the holidays for everyone in the family in my opinion it is one of the best christmas films and i think that nearly everyone of any age will appreciate this film,comedy
this is recognised primarily as a childrens film for children to enjoy at christmas however i beg to differ mainly due to the fantastic on screen chemistry between joe pesci and daniel stern playing the hilarious inept burglars okay so the plot is ridiculous but the comedy and action are fantastic this film made a star out of macauly culkin playing kevin but the real stars on show are pesci and stern this film never fails to make me laugh irrespective of what month of the year i watch it this is a great film to watch if you want to be cheered up and dont forget the all important message of christmas being a time for families,comedy
tbs airs so many good specials lately and especially during holiday season this is a pass for it culkin plays kevin mccallister a snotty boy whose family accidentally leaves him on a holiday vacation while home he starts to realize that he likes it that way until harry and marv joe pesci and daniel stern intrude into the area as 2 bandits who attempt to rob every house in his neighborhood when they find out they get more for what they bargained for realizing that theres someone in the house the 2 try and kill him and yet get away with some stuff but it wont be that easy as culkin the prankster that he is sets traps to stop them in their path and it goes from there as a wild goose chase in a race for the finish grades acting b humor b directing a script c family quality it is a family movie is it not a get the fire started its going to be a long night,comedy
is by far one of the best christmas flicks i have ever seen one reason for me saying this is because i thought the entire cast and crew did a superb job especially macaulay culkin i loved all the traps that kevin macaulay culkin set for harry joe pesci and marv daniel stern they were absolutely hilarious i would have done the same thing if there were two bumbling burglars trying to break into my home before i wrap this up id like to say kids dont try any of the traps that kevin set youll hurt yourselves severely now in conclusion to all you macaulay culkin fans who havent seen this christmas classic i recommend it if you havent seen it if you like this one see 2 lost in new york and 3,comedy
yes in a sense we all are sometimes we walk down dead end allies not a hope in the world eyes dead to all that belong to justice and peace we look up at the skies but a cloud cover destroys all we can hope for in the stars there is not much life around us any more and indeed all things seemed to have faded into blurry fog and remain loose forms colored in black and white where is the happiness where the dreams where the love of days past and future through the years we all may be together if the fates allow  that is the one statement that holds true to all things our family may leave us we may have no real friends in this world we may scream to let munch know we are still alone but through the years we all will be together just so long as we can make friends with that which scares us most christmas is about setting traps to destroy our enemies have you discovered christmas merry christmas whatever day it be,comedy
what can i say about that nobody has ever said possibly nothing to me is possibly one of the funniest movies ever made yes it is full of sentimentality yes it is a good wholesome family movie but it is as anarchic and destructive as any predator or clockwork orange any film that gives gives a ten year old unconditional licence to p i s s their pants for a full ninety minutes without repercussion from their parents should always hold a place in our heartsmacauley culkin no matter how much he may annoy us is adamant of his willingness to be rid of the family unit we all felt this when we were 11 years old and the fantasy of leaving our parents behind as we become ingratiated in our own behaviour upon the world is undeniablei may be reading too much into a film that is full of the most basic humour in our nature but if anyone out there is my age im sure they will feel the same wayin kevin maccallister all our childish dreams come true its fantasy on the most base level he takes care of himself he thwarts the bad guy and he still does it with enough acumen to realise that growing up can be done on our own for example kevin realises that preconceptions can be misjudged when old man marley comes to his aid just as were sure that he is also one of the bad guysthese are exactly the same choices we had to deal with when we were the same age even if we didnt have to make them with quite the same repercussionsbut all in all no matter how much you want to read into this film it will always be a movie when the little man wins and we always need that in our lives no matter how old we are,comedy
kevin macalister mccauley culkin is left after his family go on vacation and forget about him at first he likes the daily routine but then he is scared when he finds out that 2 robbers harry lime joe pesci and marv merchant daniel stern want to rob kevins house kevin makes a plan to save his house and himself kevins tricks work and harry and marv end up in jail i really enjoyed this film and i think it should have won millions of awards it was nice to see joe pesci and daniel stern working together and i thought they were hilarious everything was fantastic the acting the scenery and the whole storyline it is one of the hilarious films ive ever seen,comedy
ive recently decided to watch this film again and no matter how many times you see it you simply cannot get bored of it every time you watch it you will notice something you havent seen beforethis film is for all ages it is a good film choice to watch with the family as there are many anecdotes and lines which will make adults laugh and there are bits of action that will send children in stitches it flows very well there is no fluff and you can make sense about what is going on how things are going pretty much all the way throughout the film i thought the cast was excellent all the cast took their parts seriously but aside from culkin i think daniel stern and joe pesci deserve a lot of credit for playing two idiotic and incompetent burglars who get their notorious reputation broken and humiliated because they get rumbled by many sets of booby traps that foil the bumbling bad guys this film is a must see and not because i am rating it so highly but because it is entertaining and comical for everyone of all ages,comedy
easily the best christmas movie for kids growing up in the eighties and nineties and deserves to be mentioned along side the classics from previous decades for kids the movie has everything action excitement humour and for everyone else the story and acting are engaging the idea of being left for a while especially after your relatives have been so annoying will appeal to kids as they will have peace to do anything they want and let their imaginations fly cue lots of ice cream and sled rides down stairs the film shows depth by letting us see the initial down side to being alone the house can be scary when it gets dark and you know your parents are not there to help the plot sees the massive macallister spelling family planning to go on holiday for christmas after a pizza incident at the dinner table young kevin is sent to bed and locked in the next morning there is a rush and the family leave for the airport without kevin only realising what has happened when they are on the plane they try to find a way home but this is not easy as its chritmas meanwhile two crooks plan to rob the macallister house knowing its empty but soon realise that kevin is inside kevin sees that it is up to him to protect his house and begins setting up traps for the intruders what follows is great entertainment yes it may be soppy but it is a family christmas film it is much smarter than you may think probably accounting for much of its great success and the acting particularly from culkin and pesci is impressive the set pieces are ingenious ensuring that every 10 year old boy will come up with their own ways to stop bad guys ohara is also good while the rest of the cast in small roles do well 8 out of 10,comedy
too cool kevin a bratty little boy is accidentally left duh by his parents who are heading to paris this movie is hilarious and well hilarious it also contains bad words and the most important thing near the end of the movie kevin and old man marley have a talk in a beautiful church about the true meaning of christmas its about being with family and celebrating the birth of christ this movie is brilliant and perfect for children older then 8 any younger and well its not exactly appropriate for children younger then 8 my favorite scene is gasp spoiler anyway my favorite part is when harry one of the criminals that tries to rob kevins house is when harry gets his head burned by a blowtorch wheeeeeee well jane,comedy
has been one of the most cherished and beloved christmas movies since its release 14 years ago and nearly every time it runs on television around the holidays i feel obligated to watch it to get in the mood for the yuletide season this is a wonderful family comedy that everyone can enjoy if they open their hearts and minds kevin mccallister is ungrateful towards his family who treats him like he is invisible and wakes up one morning to discover that he has made his family disappear actually his family unawaringly abandoned him when they hastily left to spend christmas in paris this puts the clever mischievous and industrial kevin in the position of being and he plans to make the very best of this long desired vacation from his family in jumping on the bed watching obscene violent movies indulging in rotten food and riding down the stairs in a sleigh perhaps every childs dream come true all is fun and games that is until he discovers two ominous crooks by the name of harry and marv who deviously plot to steal from residents of kevins neighborhood including his own house now this becomes a matter of outwitting and thwarting the two crooks through a series of clever contrived traps and gags which will discourage harry and marves criminal efforts and leave them with splitting headaches sores throughout their bodies and eventually a pair of cold steel handcuffs this is such a wonderful delightful premise perfect for holiday viewing regardless of age admittedly however this film was better when i was very young and even inspirational this is how you stop the bad guys it also contains some valuable morals as keven learns through his experiences and acquaintances in being never wish for your family to disappear for once they are gone you will be praying for their return dont prejudge others based on their appearances and rumors kevin is at first petrified of a man who is believed to be a shovel murderer yet once he becomes acquainted with him the man is harmless genial and kind and finally when you recognize a threat being posed to yourself and others dont stand around but take immediate action of course one cannot be nearly as devisive as kevin in but you get the picture is a wonderful clever funny and entertaining christmas classic featuring an enchanting musical score by john williams some hilarious if inane dialogue a solid maccauley culkin performance the finest of his career and some very endearing qualities that always make this the quintessential christmas watch 12 out of ,comedy
i remember watching this movie all the time while i was growing up i never got bored of it the gags are funny the acting is great and the atmosphere is quite scary actually the music is also quite haunting candy was also brill in his cameo the plot is wellknown so i cant be bothered to get into it but the thing i love the most about this movie and the 2nd one is the lovely subplots thrown in the one with that old man whos supposedly a killer is done in a lovely way and it really sends out a message of dont judge people by their appearances the end as well spoiler where the guy is reunited with his family because of kevins advice is one of the most touching moments ive ever seen on film in my lifethis movie is brill 1010,comedy
i remember i was 8 years old in 90 i used to watch that movie at my old house where i grew up but i was sitting on the floor near the tv in the living room oh yeah my favorite part where macaulay culkin kevin mcallister was in the bathroom then he put his derodant under his arms then singing then later he put his hands to his cheeks to cover then he screamed very loud like that sound aaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh around the world from the house but it was so funny because i loved macaulays screaming that make me laugh so hard i remember macaulay as kevin put everything for his ideas of his plan to do for these 2 bad guys but it is so funny his brother kieran culkin fuller mcallister  kevins cousin was a cute kid and wears glasses in that same movie as his brother macaulay i loved that movie very much since i was a little kid that movie is the greatest and funniest one that i ever seen im a huge fan of macaulays and kierans on for 14 years,comedy

is a cultural staple in the lives of millions of people ask anyone from the ages of 15 to 50 and theyll remember this movie with a simple plot great acting and slapstick out the wazoo is an indispensablemovie not to mention the film that launched macaulay culkin to stardom like previously stated the plot is simple kevin mcallister culkin is an 8year old kid the youngest in a rather large family and he hates it for those of us who grew up in huge families we can identify with kevin when he shoutswhen i grow up and get married im living alone did you hear me imliving alone that night after ruining his familys dinner of course he was provoked by his older brother kevin wishes that his family would disappear the next morning kevin gets his wish while he thinks his family has justcompletely disappeared little does he know that they left early for paris and miscounted they mistook the nextdoor neighbor kid as him realizing now is his chance to do whatever he wants kevin has the time of his life going through his brothers room jumping on the bed watching rrated movies the works however kevin is smarter than he looks and notices that two moronic burglars played perfectly by joe pesci and daniel stern have been snooping aroundhis house when he overhears them deciding to rob the house on christmaseve he pulls together some of the most complex and elaborate boobytraps that would be the envy of professional snipers the audience roots for the endless slapstick laughing even harder as the burglars get more and more determinedto find kevin and get rid of him while this is going on kevins mom catherine ohara is trying desperately to get home and make sure her son is ok is proof that american audiences love to see the bad guys get thesnot kicked out of them with paint cans in the face tacks up the foot broken glass on the floor heads getting set on fire and trips galore we just cant stop laughing of course the moving also has heart including a sweet reunion with kevin  his family plus his friendship to a street shoveleri recommend this movie to anyone 1010,comedy
may contain spoilershas got to be one of the best films ever made  it is a great hilarious and enjoyable movie  this is a good film to watch in the christmas and thanksgiving seasonthe acting in this film is so well done and the tricks kevin pulls on the robbers are hysterical  my favorite part of the film is when hes defending the house with all the traps especially when he throws the paint cans  that part had me laughing nonstopoverall i love this movie and suggest everyone should see it the second i also love tho the third and fourth arent that good i give this film 1010 stars,comedy
i loved this movie for its originality style atmosphere feel good ending humourwelland a whole lot more other stuff i dont care if it wasnt very realistic i think realism is a let down when i go to the movies i wanna see something that makes me feel good and inspired maybe movies are entertainment arent they is an entertaining movie and in this time where family breakups and divorces are rampant this movie is a refreshing look on what families are all about and its importance though it was made more than a decade agobecause this kind of feel good movie is so rare i rate it 910,comedy
one of the greatest movies ever made  probably the best family movie that came out in 1990 it appeals to kids of all ages and adults joe p and daniel stern are great together and make you believe they really are the bad guys theyre portrayingbasic plot macaulay culkins family decides to go to paris for christmas the night before the entire twenty some family members leave for the airport kevin culkin gets sent upstairs to the attic for acting out however because of this and a wish kevin makes alone in his room to never see his family again his family forgets that he was left alone upstairs and by the time he wakes up the next day he discovers he has made his family disappear all alone and nothing to do but take care of himself two unsuspecting burglars decide to rob the house but they arent expecting kevin to be ahead of their plana great family movie and still great to watch even as an adult i give it a 10 out of 10  great to watch at christmas as welland thats my review,comedy
i really enjoy watching this movie over and over  this movie is great for the family to enjoy  the kids are cute and the family is believable the plot on the other hand is a little ridiculous but all in all the actors worked well together and it is still a great film to add to any christmas movie collection,comedy
its very interesting story about clever boywhy is that everybody dont like him without any reason there is a very bed mistakeanyway i love this movie and saw it a thousend timesand kevin a great guyand he is certainly right about everythinghe is very amazing actor toothats so funny,comedy
this movie rates up there with all of the other greats such as all of the karate kids footloose rocky 5 and 3 ninjas it is the perfect blend of awsomeness and gnarlyness not too lame yet not too radical for years have i longed to be like young kevin mcalister living on my own working with my hands making christmas ornamints with dads new fishing hooks and making macaroni and cheese dinners but there is only one kevin and its not everyday you come across two crazy sidekicks like marv and harry oh god those guys crack me up overall i give this movie a 1232443 out of 10,comedy
is a well written well acted and well made family film that will appeal to adults as well as childrenpossible spoilersplot the mcallister family are planning a great family holiday at christmas the night before kevin macaulay culkin ends up being sent to his room after ending up in a fight with his cousin buzz the next morning the family wake up late and are then in a rush to get to the airport and leave kevin behind  they only realize theyre mistake when they are half accross the atlantic very improbabble kevin has the house to himself and before long has to fight off burglars harry  marv wonderfully played by joe pesci  daniel sternthe comic violence that befalls the burgulars throughout most of the film might make it unsuitable for very young childrenthe movie is very improbbbale but is great fun none the lessits slightly better than the 1992 sequel 2 lost in new york in which kevin is left behind again by getting on the plane to new york and has to foil harry  marv yet againmy rating 810,comedy
first off i would like to say that john hughes has fallen in ability since planes trains and automobiles  this movie is a shining example of that my sister saw it when it was first released in 1990 and told me that it sucked she was in third grade  i didnt see it until last week and can almost agree with that but not totally  as far as socalled holiday movies go die hard and gremlins will remain my pop culture mainstayracks up plot holes faster than the wet bandits fall down  they are so dumb that they make the three stooges look like the untouchables  to think that joe pesci belittles himself into a role like this is beyond my belief  being outsmarted by an eightyearold is not the best thing to include on his film resume  the film would have ended a good 30 minutes earlier if kevin had acted like a normal kid and dont the smart thing instead of being a defensive snotchris columbus has always had a fascination with kiddie comedies and this is not his best effort  thankfully he is not so much in the pursuit of money as with harry potter as he is with the pursuit of political correctness its not surprising that the script it hughes work there are so many of his little touches throughoutif i can say one good thing about this movie its the music  john williams knows how to write music and this movie is a perfect example  the film certainly has a nice christmas ring that contrasts with the ever cloudy skiesoverall there are good movies for the holidays and good movies for kids this one might fit their bill but everyone else will find it to be a watchchecker after a while  2 out of 5 stars,comedy
8yearold kevin mccallister is accidentally left at home when his family leaves for paris france where they will spend their christmas vacation now what is kevin to do he decides to make his holidays a blast by renting gangster movies ordering pepperoni pizzasand etc but the fun wont last a series of mysterious robberies and breakins take place in kevins chicago neighborhood who else could be behind it but the wet burglars harry and marv its up to kevin to defend his house from the slow dimwitted burglarss attempts to break in the meaning of a mans house is his castle takes up an ironic meaning as kevin beats back the idiotic onslaughts of harry and marv with ingenious boobytraps and sardonic wit its a hilarious game of wits between kevin and the burglars as they wage war in the chicago suburbs,comedy
this movies a classic gave macaulay culkinthe most famous child star his name best moments when marv daniel stern and harry joe pesci come the third time to try and rob the house and kevin makes mannicans and a michael jordan cardboard look like theyre dancing really peculiar dancing next when kevin orders pizza and i crack up sometimes thinking about it when kevin turns on the movie and the gangsteron the tv says leave it on the door step and get the hell outta here just how rude it is when someones kind enough to make you a pizza and he keeps going until the pizza guy hilariously freaks out and runs and drives awy when the gangster shoots his gun on the movie this is a sentimental family comedy like most of all the engagement between kevin and his neighbor who was rumored to be a psycho and freaked him out until the serious sentimental moment in the church which also has a couple jokes like kevin saying that in the 2nd grade you can get beat up for wearing a sweater with a bird kevins brother is stupid the only evidence is when he says a 2 and d rather than 1 2 and 3 the battery being set up n the house has great music where our incompetent dumpedon kevin becomes an intellectual hero the movies more violent than the second marv is the dimwit and like always harry the short one is wise and always on the job and doesnt put up with slowwit this movies sweet topnotch christmas movie,comedy
is an enjoyable film for all the family and its fun to look back on the film which made the worlds richest child star macaulay culkin famoushe plays kevin mcallister in this filmcontains spoilerskevins family are taking a trip to paris he has a huge family with his parents brothers and sisters cousins and his aunt and uncle the night before they go away kevin has a row with his family and wishes them to disapear to his luck the next morning he sleeps in late and finds that his wish came true kevins enjoying being he goes shopping cooks his own meals and even protects the house from some sneaky robbers as kevin lives in the nicest house on the street the two robbers want to steal from their they coincedentially find out hes and still plan to attack the house but little do they know what tricks kevin has up his sleeve with comic conciqunces the robbers are finally whishked away in the police car and kevin wakes up to find his family returned home is a hillarious comedy for all the family ill give it a big 1010 i first saw it when i was 7 or 8 and now at 13 still love it,comedy
i loved this film when i first saw it over 10 years ago and i still love it today this is one of the best christmas films of all time and i never tire of watching it the sheer splendour of the mcallister house is something to be marvelled at and one of my favourite scenes is when kevin thinks he made his family disappear and runs wild through the house in celebration katherine ohara is the perfect mix of stern diciplinarian and worried parent as kevins mother and the late john candy is great as gus polinski i admit that the rest of the family are just there to make up the numbers but together they covincingly portray the nightmare family that kevin cant wait to get away from joe pesci and daniel stern provide many a laugh as the bungling wet bandits  although i dont find them as funny now as i did back in the day considering this is a kids film i think it has stood the test of time reasonably well and this is mostly due to the production team as the film hardly looks dated at all on top of that there is the excellent sound track which just makes the film even betteri thoroughly enjoyed this film and i look forward to watching it yet again this christmas,comedy
this movie was funny and very enjoyablea true family hit  macauley culkin is cute as a button as kevin and joe pesci and daniel stern are funny as the the clumsy robbers who want to break in kevins house without knowing hes because his family went on vacation and forgot that he was in the attic being punished and has the whole house full of dangerous booby traps awaiting them  i saw it in the theaters when i was about 7 years old and loved itand i still do  i wish movies were like this now a days 5 stars all the way,comedy
this is an excellent film for children i first saw this film in about 1992 and have seen it about 5 times since this film deserves the highest praise from critics i really believe that it should be put back into theatres because all the new films we are getting are not half as good a,comedy
as a five year old i watched this film about 3 times a week to get all the comedy out of it but if i was a eight year old who woke up to find my family had disappeared of the face of the earth i would naturally panic and so would others around that age anyway this film was still a classic so if you like this i would recommend 2 lost in new york which is better,comedy
this is a great film full of slapstick comedy and funny jokes a little immature but great for young and oldbest quote fuller go easy on the pepsi fuller smiles at kevin,comedy
its phenomenala masterpieceand i love this moviethis is a wonderfull and beautiful christmas that ive ever feltgreatfulljoyfull and peacefull were beside this comedy movie made by chris columbus a brilliant director who directed harry pottermacaulay culkin gave his best performance along his careereverything were pictured succesfully and obviously about christmas and snow its most wonderfull time of the year,comedy

i rent vcd and watched in my renting alone one time id hoped i could be alone because i disliked my family was small and i must share a same room with my two younger sisters and now my sisters got married and have their children i couldnt help to remind the past because loneliness is hurting so even naughty kevin he couldnt fight the feeling of missing his family for the time will show,comedy
i remember i saw him on in 1990 my favorite part was macaulay was screaming loud when he was doing something from his home bathroom when he was left alone by his family but it was funny i loved it because that make me laugh when i was 8 when i saw the movie before,comedy
a great movie composed by john williams i love the main title music in the beginning of the film this was the one of johns best music  i love et jaws2  jurassic park its one of my favorite movie in ages  the first could be better than the 2nd  he played the two bad guys was so clever  macaulay culkin wake up and he found his family was totally disappeared was this magic   the important thing appeared in the movie was having family is happiness dont you agree with that  get this movie at homesgo ahead ,comedy
i saw this film yesterday and thought it was a good film everyones getting all packed to go spend christmas in france kevin gets upset when his uncle frank wont let him watch a movie with the older kids so he interrupts his mother kate while shes on the phone then kevin asks buzz if he can sleep with him and buzz says i wouldnt let you sleep with me if you were growing on my butt then buzz kevin there older brother watch a man who has to shovel snow every winter for killing his family back in 1958 kevin makes a wish that his family would just disappeaer and thats what happens he gets left at home by himself in france the mccalisters watch its a wonderful life in chiago kevin watches angels with filthy souls when kevin decides to make trouble at the dinner table kate tells kevin that he has to sleep on the 3rd floor kevins all excited when he has to himself at first but he isnt alone for long soon 2 burglars harry and marv plan to rob his house one evening kevin ordered a pizza for dinner went grocery shopping and watched the tonight show starring johnny carson,comedy
if youve never seen this then you must its a living cartoon the bit where daniel stern gets the spider on his face is pure cinema magicfor all of you whove never grown up i urge you to appreciate this film,comedy
is a very entertaining film about a boy who gets left behind for a vacation and must fend off robbers  machauley caulkin is great as kevin and very enjoyable  joe pesci and daniel stern are perfect as the robbersoverall the movie is a great entertaining film and i recommend it  rating 9 out of 10,comedy
as i write this im wondering if were released today would it be so good then again maybe we havent changed so much im not sure it doesnt take to much imagination to figure out why this is such a great film its just plain hilarious at most points its story is totally unreal but then again arent most hits like that absolutely im a big fan of joe and with all seriousness his role here is unforgettable he is the perfect crook im real surprised that him and daniel stern didnt get some kind of award for this film they shouldve got something in return for letting a little 9year throw paint cans and irons down onto them surely i cant imagine why after having my hand fried and my head lite up by a flamethrower i think why didnt they just leave definitely their actions went abovr and beyond the call of acting all the while mac keeps a big smile on his face as he screams hey check this out i really think he enjoyed trashing those guys up and who wouldnt sadly my house was broken into and if i coulda done half the stuff to those creeps i would have been happy about it too but thats not the theme of the film is it so ill give it four outa five stars,comedy
ok someone named raveculk said this was the best comedy movie ever made and culkin was a geniuswell no way this movie was good when i was little but is not the best comedy ever culkin is not a genius he was a kid playing a kid so dont try and make this  movie look like the citizen kane of comedys because its not the best comedy ever made is doctor strangelove,comedy
after a falling out with his parents cathrine o hara  john heard kevin mccalister macualy culkin makes a wish that his family would just go away but the day they leave for their christmas vacation to paris they leave in such a hurry that they forget one thing kevin so now kevin is all alone is his big empty house he actually ends up having the time of his life but all of that changes when kevin discovers that 2 burglars named harry joe pesci and marv daniel stern are on a scheme to burglarize the neighborhood so now kevin prepares for them and actually encounters them a couple of timesi must say that the last 20 minutes of this movie are absolutley the most fun anyone is going to have in their life watching moviesproduced by john hughes uncle buck the breakfast club and directed by chris columbus harry potter  the sorcerers stonestarring macualy culkin the good son richie rich joe pesci my cousin vinny goodfellas and daniel stern the wonder years bushwhackedis a fun family movie that people will want to see again and again and again,comedy
this is a great comic story that launched a new child star into the hollywood stratosphere and understandably sothis film does show off macaulay culkins brilliant comic execution apparently it was partly the result of john hughes being impressed with macaulays performance in uncle buck and was devised as a vehicle for him what makes this film superior to its imitators and successors is that kevin is allowed to show comic skills and still come across as a genuine kid  for example he wants to watch adults only movies but he freaks out when he actually sees them  he wants to shave like his dad but howls when he applies aftershave lotion and so on  the christmas scene in the church is a nice humanitarian touch that later hollywood kids movies lacked  the character isnt just a minature adult in a childs body  this gives the story a lot more personality and depth than the other films of its kindin fact i think macaulay demonstrated with this film the interview scene in uncle buck the nutcracker and other performances that he was and possibly still is the best comic actor of his generation  well a tie between him and joseph gordonlevitt at least,comedy
this movie is really funny especially when kevin fights with his family he thinks they are a bunch of idiots especially his brother buzz when he is left at home he gets in buzzs room and messes it up he lets the spider out by accidenti always look fwd to watching 1  2 the third movie is a joke  during christmas or whenever it comes on tv it never gets old its still funny  i recommend that you buy it or at least rent it,comedy
is a family movie i played the game on nes and it was discusting but lets not go into that this movie was entertaining right from the start and although i wouldnt laugh at it it would bring a smile to my face eightyear old kevin mccallister macaulay culkin is good in his roll and brings a brightness to the movie but maybe its a bit far fetched66,comedy
this movie was a good comedydrama macauly culkin did a good showing of work for 9 years of age in this movie its basically about the title kevin maccallister macauly culkin is left one day when his huge family is on vacation and 2 thiefs marv and harry joe pesci and daniel stern decide to rob all the houses on the block in which the familys are on vacation so they meet up with kevin maccallister for a hell of a timeout of 10 65,comedy
a young boy is left at during the christmas holidays when his parents leave for their vacation in a hurry  burglars threaten his house which he must defend  totally unbelievable but has all the usual amount of fun that youd expect to see in one of john hughs movies  it also has a good music score and is fun to watch at any time of year and not just during the christmas period,comedy
i loved this movie when i was little me and my cousin used to watch it all the time and we always laughed and laughed kevin macalister macauly culkin was accidently left at home by himself while the family went away to paris when the 2 robbers harry joe pesci and marve danial stern try to rob his house he taught them a lesson that they will never forget if you have never seen rent it from blockbuster and i also recommend that you rent 2 lost in newyork and 3 you will laugh and laugh,comedy
this is a great movie this is easily culkins best joe pesci and daniel stern are brilliant and hilarious in my opinion this is next to ferris buellers day off what is great about this film is that it has great acting a reasonable plot although unrealistic some people have said that this movie was too violent hello people it wouldnt be a damn movie if culkin didnt use the traps get a clue  here is the plot the mccallisters are going to paris for their christmas vacation at the time their having dinner which is pizza kevin mccallister culkin is angry because his brother ate his cheese pizza kevin starts throwing a temper tantrum and tackles his brother and makes a huge mess in the kitchen soon he gets into an argument with his mother he tells her that he never wants to see her again the next morning his wish miraculously comes true after a while his family is on the plane to paris unfortunately for them they find out when theyre on the plane at the time being there are crooks that want to rob the neighborhood these two people are played by joe pesci and daniel stern it turns out that they want to rob kevins house for the silver doughnut but kevin is there which the bandits dont know kevin will do all he can to stop the bandits and get arrested is a great movie 2 is a worthy sequel but doesnt live up to this one 3 is okay but could of been a lot better they didnt have to name it part of the series though i own the first two movie and there both great to watch during the holidays gets a 1010,comedy
i got tired of this movie because of two things1 every christmas night they aired this one on tv2 in my junior highs library there always kids watching this movie every afternoonthis united with the fact that i also saw this one several times as a kid made me reach a level of saturation which makes me almost puke but thats just me because this is a really good christmas movie with all those lights candles santas and the inevitable reference to its a wonderful world the music is of course topnotch showing that john williams has a sensibility far beyond the normal standards i think i will see this one in a couple of years and will like very much right now im still tired,comedy
out of all the family comedys that i have seen i would have to say that is my personal favoritei would place 2 at second place i mean there is nothing that i can think of about this movie that i dont like the pace is fast the story is well written the acting is good and the music score really works i couldnt ask for a more fun filled moviepossible spoilerskevin mccallister is accidentilly left alone at home while his parents go to france for christmas he thinks its a good thing at first but as soon as he learns the plans of two burglars he must be brave if he wants to have a happy christmasexciting great story acting and soundtrack  out of ,comedy
the first and the 3rd really didnt do it for me i gave the 1st one a 7 and the 3rd one a 3 but the 2nd one a 10 maculay culkin did great in both the first and the second and he is a great actor but i liked to 2nd better then the first i think it was more original then the first,comedy
this is one of the funniest movies of all time  macaulay culkins facial expressions are priceless as well as timeless  it seems that no matter how many times they are seen they can always bring a smile to the face and laughter throughout a room  not to mention that hes just so dang cute what else can one say  this movie brings me joy when i am down  with its impssible antics and the 50s superhero moments with jimmy the shop boy who couldnt love this movie  my only questions with the movie are how in the heck did he get the sled out the front door and why does he always run up the stairs and in front of the camera and then turn around and go to the bedroom when he is screaming  that bothers me and others greatly but alas it still does not distract from the movie  the comedic genious that this represents is amazing and the acting ability of culkin rates among the childhood greats  well that is enough for now  if you have not seen the movie i encourage you too and if you have watch it again for you will always find something new  and always remember the wise words of kevinwhen i grow up and get marriedim livin alone,comedy
child star macaulay culkin the good son richie rich plays kevin macallistar who in all the hype of christmas is left at home unattended as his extended family go away for a yuletide vacationa heartwarming tale it may seem but on christmas eve 2 bumbling robbers known as the wet bandits joe pesci and daniel stern try to rob the macallistars house  and its up to kevin to stop emcatherine ohara beetlejuice plays kevins mom and culkins uncle buck costar john candy is also featured here but didnt appear in any scenes with macaulaya funny movie filled with action drama and a sappy sidestory plus plenty of christmas spirit  no wonder this movie grossed millions and turned macaulay into a multimilliondollar superstar,comedy
is probably by far the best holiday comedy movie since peter billingsly in a christmas story another holiday classicthe story of is about a kid named kevin mccallistermacauly culkin who with his entire family are going to france for the holidays kevin who is the youngest out of everyone in the house is often called by his brothers and sisters a disease  anyway one night after his mom orders some pizza he asks did anyone order a plain cheese  his older brother buz replies yeah but if you want any somebodys going to have barf it all up now its gone  kevin his angry after discovering that buz had purposely ate all the cheese pizza and gets into a fight with him  when its all over everyone is mad at kevin and sent to his room on the top floor for the night  later that night before going to sleep he says i wish they would all just disappearpredictably he wakes up the next morning to find everybody gone not knowing that they had just left for the trip to france  so this means party time for kevin  however theyre have been a string of burglaries by two partners in crime harryjoe pesci and marvdaniel stern by the way are the best comic pair on screen have set their sights on kevins house  so this ultimately leads to their final showdown with kevin setting his house full of traps so they cant get in  as i said before is a must see holiday classic  im 15 now  i first saw it when i was 5 in the theater  i must have laughed myself silly at kevins pranks  was followed by a less successful but just as entertaining sequel 2 lost in new york and a horrible third entry 3  1010,comedy
it will go down in history and will become a classic christmas film mianly because its a christmas film and a huge success that it will be remembered for years to come macauly culkin is the spoiled and annoying and irritating little brat who is accidently left at home and has to look after himself but there is more in store while 2 stupid robbers are breaking into all the shouses around as everyone is away for the festive seasonthe film is a typical chris columbas film  useless it is fun and i do have it in my collection from when i was a child and it does bring back memories bt for a proper film its not close its the star wars of the year 1990 just a silly kids film that is completely useless has no meaning no message no heart no feeling and not a single bit touching in story or by the actors themselvesfun and much better fun than star wars a film for all the family and not for just kids or adults who have not grown up,comedy
well what can i say about this movie after seeing it when it first came out over ten years ago this movie is simply a knockout for the whole family to enjoy mccaulay culkin is quite simlply a genius in this movie in how he protects his home from the two idiots marv and harry who also play the characters of two clumsy burglars ever so well which also added to the many laughters this movie has a very simplistic plot but all along never loses that christmas theme of family and love which seemed to be the whole essence of this great movie ive seen this movie alot and i still find it a perfect 10 to this day,comedy
is certainly not the best comedy ever made however it has to be one of the best holiday films to watch culkin gives a funny cute personality to his character the mirror scene is a classic by now and its great fun to watch at christmas with young kids only thing about this movie which holds it back is that theres really no other time other than christmas where youll want to watch the sequels should not have been made though one time is enough of watching a young kid practically decapitate 2 adult robbers 7510,comedy
this is  no doubt  one of the best movies john hughes ever made  ferris buellers day off rules in macauly culkin outsmarts a couple of dumb thieves really dumb thieves boy i bet that if you would count their iq the sum would be 18 this will bring laughter and some scary moments too the traps set up in the house are not just little booby traps kevin made it so dangerous that he could even prevent a whole army from invading his house in the meanwhilehis family is in paris panicking and wondering if he is all right just when you think the little smart kid is in serious trouble luck saves the day a wonderful comedy you should have seen if you liked it i also recommend 2 lost in new york even a big city like the apple cant stop little kevin,comedy
i still remember seeing this movie in a packed theater in 1990 right around christmas i was 11 and was with my mom my sister and her best friend everyone in the theater had a great time weve owned the video for many years and watch it several times a year especially around christmas the gags are clever silly and even painful to watch i have yet to meet someone who can look directly into the tv when daniel stern steps into the nail barefoot and i still cry with laughter when macauley culkin puts the tarantula on sterns face and we hear his bloodcurdling feminine shriek i really liked the neighbor mr marley and i found the family bickering very realistic a must see especially around the holidays,comedy
is a very funny comedy that has become a timeless classic this is the perfect family movie it offers something to both adults and children macauly culkin is perfect in his role as a kid who has been accidently left behind by his family this is a very funny movie i recommend it,comedy
i first saw this movie when i took three of my friends to it for my 10th birthday  i thought it was really funny when the burglars marv and harry fell into every booby trap that kevin had set up  kevin was the youngest kid in his family not including cousins aunts uncles or grandparents his older brother buzz would always pick on him and his uncle frank was just a jerk  that night kevin wished for his family to disappear  by a strange coincidenceor was it just the fact that the family was in a rush and just plain forgot him it came true  then two burglars come over to rob the place when kevin sets up his booby traps  many of these scenes looked quite painful such as the scene where kevin shoots harry in the genitals with a bb gun and when marv steps on a nail lets hope he got his tetanus shot  so for this holiday season forget about old movies like bing crosbys white christmas and its a wonderful life and pop this video into your vcr you and your whole family will love this film,comedy
my entire family loves this movie its not only a holiday favorite but a yearround pleaser my children 8 and 4 think kevin is a national hero of sorts  has it all  comedy drama action and suspense and for a special treat make it a double feature with ii  lost in new york both movies are well acted and amazingly well directed  just make sure to remind the kids do not try this at home,comedy
is one of those great films that adults and children can enjoy i am 17 and still find it amazingly funny and unique mainly because it isnt as corny as you might think  full of great actors and actresses which bring the film to life and some memorable quotes too  all this set against that great time of year known as christmas help to make this one of my all time favourite films,comedy
this a fun movie recommended for older children 712  i remember enjoying this movie and its sequel the first one when i was nine ten eleven years old i really still enjoy the energy and the pace of this film which has to be the the films greatest strengthas far as macaulay culkin is concerned i think hes one of the most underrated actors of this decade  check out my girl and his pre work if you dont see what i mean  however as far as him being a genius goeswell i liked punky brewster as a kid but i didnt consider soleil moon frye to be a genius  raveculk please do yourself a favor and rent a monty python moviethere were many films that tried to cop this formula getting even with dad also starring culkin blank check a cop and a half but this movie takes the cake,comedy
a heavily dysfunctional family are going away for the christmas holidays they accidentally leave 8 year old kevin the annoying macauley culkin alone at home other than doing what a normal kid would do go to a neighbor or call the police he decides to stay at home all alone two burglars joe pesci and daniel sternboth who deserve better try to break in culkin manages to singlehandedly set up elaborate bobby traps to stop themwhat a violent sick piece of garbage i caught this is a theatre back in 1990 i saw it after a long week at work and expected a mindless fun pg movie i was horrified by what i got for starters the story was impossible leaving behind an 8 year old kid by mistake come on also the whole family is heavily dysfunctional and not at all funny culkin manages to set up elaborate traps and stuff that no 8 year old could ever do when pesci and stern show up the movie goes from stupid and unbelievable to extremely violent these poor guys repeatedly get burnt and hit repeatedly on the head and face again and againand its all played for laughs i was sickened by the level of violence in this film how did this get a pg rating also violence against people is not funny it got to the point that i was rooting for the burglars aside from all this it just simply isnt funny sick stupid and unbelievable yesbut not funnythe acting is as bad as youd expect culkin is annoying from the start not cute at allyou want the little brat to get it badly stern and pesci do what they can with nothing roles still i realize im not the audience for this in the theatre i saw it with was full of families with their kids during the violence all the adults sat there horrified while all the little kids were screaming literally with laughter a few parents dragged their kids out of therei wish i had joined them this was inexplicably a huge hit and led to the thankfully brief career of culkin avoid this like the plague and definitely do not let small kids see it a 1,comedy
okay i can understand the basic setting here a kid is left alone in a big home and gets to do what he wants and beats up some bad guys though theyre twice his size i admit theres good potential for fantasy and storytelling herebut instead of being clever or funny the movie is just plain obnoxious and idiotic the kid is not cute but simply totally irritating whats worse most of the supposedly funny scenes in the film are based on him screaming and the burglars getting injured in all possible ways i have no problem with cartoon violence existing but this film stretched the limits in a sick and disgusting way the problem is that arrogantly combines cartoon violence with a high level of cinema realism showing how emotionally detached movies in general have become people who have no trouble enjoying this are the kind of people who used to get their kicks out of torturing animals or beating up their classmates when they were kids more disturbingly the same mentality shows through when footage of actual combat violence in faraway countries is shown in live tv theyre not my race or faith theyre not on my side so its not for real see or theyre just criminals so breaking their balls must be funny right ill rather show my own kids some actual action movies with realistic violence than this kind of twisted family movie comedy cruelty,comedy
summary a large family group book a holiday to paris for christmas but by accident forget their son who is left prey to 2 bungling robbers he defends his house with traps until his mum returns to himok ill start with the good points funny well thought out traps interesting story certainly watchable however i hate his family they are selfish and cold i can understand that it symbolises the prechristmas stress but they call him names not just the kids either and dont seem to care whether he is fed or not the parents fail to see that the other kids are bullying him they stupidly dont even notice hes not with them for a while theyre a shame to the name of parenting it leaves you feeling like hed be better off alone he certainly can handle himselfalso perhaps its just me but the robbers are too dimwitted for my taste although maybe it adds to the comedyi recommend you see 3 if your not keen on this one,comedy
this movie sucks whats so funny about two burglars getting hurt by wire booby traps that a little kid set up nothing at all the jokes on this movie were not funny at all maybe a person with a iq of two or lower will find this movie somewhat funny the other sequels are the same thing people getting hurt by booby traps its the same thing over and over again avoidi give this movie 3 out of 10,comedy
set aside the preposterous setup and were left with a movie that portrays violence without consequence and what makes it especially irritating is that the violence is played for laughs how funny it is to see a man hit with a can of paint joe pesci deserves betterthe movie of course made a mint for john hughes and made a huge star out of culkin albeit briefly alas marks the beginning of a decadelong descent for hughes that he is yet to pull out of,comedy
awesome movie classic family movie you have to see it,comedy
is a great family film that is pretty funney in the movie kevin mccallistermacauly culkin hates being the youngest member of his big family on the night before his family plans to take holiday trip to paris kevin gets in trouble and is sent to the third floor while there kevin wishes for his family to disappear and in the morning gets his wish as his family leaves in a hurry to get to the airport and leaves kevin kevin enjoys being but soon feels bad for the way he acted towards them and misses them he also learns that two burglars named harry joe pesci and marv daniel stern are planning to break into his home and that he must defend his house with traps for the burglars my favorite scene in the movie is where harry and marv finally meet each other in the house after walking through several of kevins traps and harry asks marv why the hell ya take your shoes off and marv asks harry why the hell ya dressed like a chicken i just died laughing at that scene filled with wonderful laughter and humor is a true family movie that the whole family can enjoy i laugh every time i see it 10 out of 10,comedy
i absolutely love the first two movies the third one is adequate but the fourth movie is just dreadful and makes me vomit because of what it did to two underrated gems and a little belowaverage follow up macaulay culkin is wonderful as kevin in this and 2 which is my personal favourite he is cute and selfassured alex d linz gives a spirited performance in 3 but michael weinburg just doesnt do anything with the scriptwhich was terrible other than whine in the fourth film anyway back to joe pesci and daniel stern steal the film with their goofiness and charm that was evidently missed in the last two instalments matching them is the late great john candy and here he is wonderful candy has starred in movies like uncle buck and planes trains and automobiles both of which are hilarious just broadens the comedic talent that candy certainly had the film looks beautiful with very good direction and best of all great visual jokes and traps as well as a fun and sometimes touching script my problem is why is the rating for both and home 2 so low when almost everyone i know consider them as holiday classics all in all a funny touching and underrated film that could have been a little shorteronly by one or two minutes 910 bethany cox,comedy
this is a really good family film so long as you can get through the slapstickis pretty much as it says a family decides to go to paris for the holidays unfortunately in their rush they left one small thing behindtheir youngest son now he not only must take on the task of managing the house but he also needs to outwit some burglars before they take over will he get through the holidays alive this movie is kind of looked at as a simple slapstick movie but in truth all of the slapstick is pretty much in the last 10 minutes of the movie the rest of the movie is a pretty nice and touching christmas tale that covers the areas of family and togetherness the acting is fairly decent in this film and the characters are pretty likable the music is very well done and the setting really gives you the feel of a true christmas classic if you havent watched this film yet then definitely check it out,comedy
this megahit that made macaulay culkin a household nameand still causes me to wince when im in the presence of gallon paint cansis a tightly plotted and very funny tribute to upper middle class child abuse chris columbus helms this ruthlessly crafty comedy and from the moment the house lights go down its pedal to the metalwhat makes this movie ultimately work is the roomtemperatureiq criminals joe pesci and daniel stern theyre so good you stop listening to the little voice in your head that keeps saying that culkins character kevin is the victim of child abuse and neglectif you dont stop listening to that voice youll probably leave the movie with a damp face from laughing so hard and a sour taste in your mouthis a giant cruel joke but it is funny id suggest some mouth wash as the end credits are rolling,comedy
best movie ever made  this movie will bring out the child of christmas that is hiding in us all,comedy
1990 is a mediocre movie with an uneasy amount of cartoonish violence  the problem with the film is the characters do things that most people would not normally do  joe pesci is wasted in this movie as he gives the only interesting performance of the entire movie  one sad thing about this movie is that this may be the only film that macaulay culkin will be known mainly for  its a fine film for the holidays but not as an overall viewing experience,comedy
this has got to be one of the most mean spirited movies ever made to categorize this as slapstick  is an insult to all the actors from the distant past that really perfected this genre i put most of the blame on john hughes jr aka chris columbus his movies except for mrs doubtfire are just lame he has taken thescreamingkidwiththehandsontheface to a science even in harry potter he wheeled it out one more time for old times sake oh christopher you cracked me up again the main problem with this movie is that every movie studio in townfrom this movie forward had to make ten movies like this one because of its success there has been just a barrage of men getting kicked in the nads on screen since walt disney studios leading the way mean spirited comedies have been the norm going on 16 years now it sells tickets a lot of them,comedy
this movie reminds me of war of the roses which many people thought was too violent and nasty  i was bothered by the cartoonish violence and certainly would think twice before letting a young child see it,comedy
a classic feel good moviethe kid held the house down,comedy
not sure why it took me so long to review my favorite christmas film of all time but here it goes i was 10 when this came out and back then i remember watching it at least 10 times at the movies i loved it then and loved it now yes it is a little far fetched and would not happen in real life but it is a movie and not to be taken seriously i stopped watching after 2 because macaulay culkin made the film what it was and no one could replace him i was not interested in seeing parts 3 and 4 because he was not it them lots of funny one liners in this movie since i watch it every year i can recite every line word for word the actors and characters were spot on the christmas sountrack here is my favorite of all time this will forever be a classic and will always be my favorite christmas movie,comedy
1990 out of 4blockbuster dealing with eightyearold kevin mccallister macaulay culkin who after a fight with his family wishes that he never has to see them again the next day kevin wakes up with his family no where to be found he believes that his hopes have been answered but soon hes having to deal with a couple burglars joe pesci daniel stern who have their eyes on his houseif you were around in 1990 then you will remember the tremendous success that had with critics fans and at the box office to say the film was a landmark would be an understatement because the film was a huge hit and has gained plenty of fans over the years after twentysix years i think its safe to say that the film is a new classic while the film isnt perfect its certainly a lot of fun and perfectly captures the manic spirit of christmas timewhat makes the film work so well is that its a perfect child fantasy im sure many kids have wished that they were the boss the keeper of the house and that the adults would just go away this film works perfectly fulfilling that fantasy but of course theres the more touching moments thrown in for good measure what makes the film a classic are the battles between the kid and the burglars culkin pesci and stern would all become household names after this film and its easy to see whyculkin is absolutely adorable as the brat kid who finds himself and doing battle against his fears as well as the two bad guys the violence in the film is in the same field as the three stooges and it works perfectly well not only does the violence work but its perfectly sold by pesci and stern who are terrific and easily steal the film as harry and marv the two of them have perfect chemistry together and they really make for a great comic teamthe supporting cast is very good with the likes of john heard roberts blossom catherine ohara and john candy all doing fine work another major plus is the score from john williams as well as an allaround great charm the film contains some great laughs throughout and i think after all these years its fair to call it a classic,comedy
this terrible piece of garbage deserves a zero actually i would vote negative numbers if i could as an adult this is a big reason i am beginning to hate christmas what a terrible cruel movie there are literally no redeeming characters in this film except mabey the next door neighbor i hate mccaulley culkin i dont see how you can get any enjoyment out of this thing unless you are totally sadistic and have no conscience plus the fact it is the stupidest piece of garbage ive ever seen its not funny and there is nothing about this that says family entertainment its hard for me to believe that i seem to be the only one who feels this way the characters in this thing my god it just makes me want to vomit and then cry bitterly how people can be so cruel kids and adults alike pieces of garbage every one of them,comedy
i never saw this film as a child but now when i finally came to see this from television i couldnt have been more shocked of what i saw it was only good that nobody got me to watch this for this is a sick movie you would never guess how much violence this film contains in innocent framesperhaps times have changed in the almost past twenty years but if burglars who shout out lines like i gonna kill you and maybe he committed suicide dont sound pretty disgusting for a childrens movie then something has gone totally wrong the burglars also threaten to burn the boys head and bite his fingers off one by one  is it normal in some places of the earth to threaten kids with bad things like that i really hope that people arent that meanfurthermore the injuries made to the burglars are quite lethal too that they are evil doesnt justify to show stunts where man lands on his head with surely breaking his neck  not even jackass the series or the movie featured anything that dumb in one scene the other burglar makes such a scream that it makes many horror films paleand no i am not some superior moral guardian who hates comical violence  i would just rather recommend jackass the movie for children rather than this the only audience i truly recommend this are college students who really need to turn their brains off after some really hard work,comedy
while watching it became so plainly obvious to me to see just why macaulay culkin would never ever survive his transition from being a child star into anything that even resembled that of a successful actor as an adult never and its true he wouldnt cause believe me he didntthe writing was so clearly written on the wall for culkin and it was quite plainly evident even here in i mean just like child star shirley temple all of macaulays appeal and charm rested solely on the prepackaged concept of herhim being perceived as that little tyke who was just the sweetest of all the cutiepies imaginablelike lets face it it takes real talent as well as a certain amount of cuteness of course to make it as an adult actor it does and talent is something that culkin seemed to possess so veryvery little of and it showed once he had grown out of that darling little baby phase of hisso unless youre a child yourself or an adult whos easily amused by implausible nonsense then s story is just gonna leave you mighty high and dry  cause hey other than being completely childish there sure aint much joy merriment or laughter going on in this one no way,comedy
ive always been rather fond of the little guy finally showing the big guy that its not safe to assume that you can get away with anything you want  although the first half or more of this movie is of the sort of humor that really turns me off the revenge of the little guy is beautifully done and the bad guys who are delightfully inept get exactly whats coming to themif you enjoy the coyoteroadrunner cartoons youll certainly enjoy the latter portions of this movie  if you dont enjoy those cartoons dont bother with this film,comedy
first off wouldnt the family have realized they still hadnt given out an airplane ticket to someone wouldnt that mean something to them right there in the beginning this movie is centered all around the pathetic christmas miracle theoryi have to ask when they realize that the kid has been left by himself why dont the parents just call the house a friend neighbor or even the police to go pick him up they could even give the cops instructions to use a doorram on an outside door to get in to the house and secure the kid when the kid realizes that he has been left he could go straight to a friend neighbor call local police or even call 911i also love the scenarios the kid supposedly comes up with by himself first with the gangster movie scene to scare off the pizza delivery i would hope if the delivery person had actually believed the scenario that it would be immediately reported to the copsthen the whole scenario when he realizes the two criminals are going to be trying to rob the house he comes up with a plan to take them out in a couple hours the plan nearly kills the criminals and almost burns down the house after all of this is finished the kid finally calls the police if he knew this from the beginning he would have never logically done anything but first call a reliable emergency numberonce the criminals are taken out hes still and quickly cleans up the stuff that took the criminals out then his mom arrives along with his whole family arriving shortly after the family is suddenly all together again was this a christmas miraclei will admit the movie is fun before youre even a teenager but when you look at it later on youll realize its nothing but a pathetic joke logically it nearly tells kids to do things dangerously while teaching them not to use things that are truly secure like the emergency system,comedy
mediocre attempt at a comedy will probably appeal to kids but not to anyone elsefairly basic slapsticky plot some of the methods the kid uses to protect his home are quite clever but thats about the only positive aspect of this moviewhat an irritating kid the backchatty replies to his parents the general cockiness can see why kids would like this and why adults shouldntunfortunately it spawned several sequels and launched the career of macaulay culkin,comedy
i have absolutely no idea why anyone would give a positive comment on this worthless piece of trash desecrating all the family movies ever made corny stupid typical unbelievable one of my favorite movies is spy hard where this kid get the crap kicked out of him i was rooting for those burglar dudes all the way i was positively sickened when i saw the kid shooting a blank at the guys groin 75 percent of this movie involves someone getting damaged in the groin area ha ha ha and this is a kids movie giving this movie a 1 is just being gracious i honestly wish there was a 10 billion,comedy
this movie made me extremely uneasy the two idiots have no brain and do not understand the concept of thinking their idiocy made me scared to further interact with others resulting in me isolating myself from the outside world i am indeed now ,comedy
an 18 year old white gary coleman makes lots jim carey faces and the jokes are people getting hit in the head with bricks this movie sucks beyond belief there are so many actually funny christmas movies eg a christmas story that no adult should ever watch it and i advise against ever showing your kids a movie senseless violence is a lame excuse for comedy,comedy
even when i was 8 years old when i see this miserable movie for a first time i did not like it the reasons that they forget the child to the home are very stupid on the first movie and the other sequels of this movie why i give 210 to this moronic movie and not 1 is because it has an originality this originality does not make me to laugh but anyway many people most of them children and unfortunately some of them mature find them funny only the idea of scenario that 2 professional robbers can not avoid a little kid makes me to avoid this moviesomeone could ask me why you are writing the worst things for this movie is just movie for kids the answer is i dint like this movie even when i was 8,comedy
silly acting but a great classic that i love watching during the christmas break,comedy
a great actor with top roles in films like goodfellas and he ends up in this awful movie the premise is so ridiculously bad and the things these robbers have done to them they would have died 10 times over,comedy
like a liveaction episode of tom  jerry this yuletide classic has the type of pitchperfect holiday atmosphere that managed to spellbind an entire generation of children during the yuletide season the christmas music is so wellselected and the score so warm and distinctive that revisiting this movie every year feels like having conversations with your own inner child there isnt much to say about that hasnt been said before but for the record my favorite performance here is catherine ohara as kevins mom her distress and manic energy are palpable and oharas long career in improvisational comedy helps her dig her claws into a role that could easily have been forgettable in the hands of a lesser actress,comedy
i enjoyed this movie when i was a kid it was an original exciting premise kid struggling to do everything himself but also enjoying such freedom and him getting the better over 2 bumbling burglarsthere was some amusing humor including the way the neighbor kid who had a funny scene with the annoyed van driver got counted as one of the crew so the family got the family count correct that was the rooting cause of kevins family forgetting him that combined with kevin remaining asleep on the third floor where he got sent to the previous night due to him pushing his older brother buzz for eating his cheese pizza the other kids kevins sister and his cousins did not respect him and his uncle frank had an intense dislike for him that was never fully explained other than him thinking how hes just a little brat but the other kids were bratty too so im guessing that uncle frank was just another bratty kid in a grownups body who only wanted to go with popular opinion and dislike him just because the other kids also didthe scenes of the family rushing through the airport and just barely making the plane were good and i found it amusing with the kids running down the jetway and one of them calling i got the window seat the scenes with kevin discovering he was alone and smiling i made my family disappear was where reality really sorta flew out the window a real 8 year old wouldve been scared right then whether he had a fight with his family the previous night or notthere were still some amusing scenes along the way with kevins antics around the house him thinking the furnace in the basement is a monster him going through his brothers stash eating a big bowl of ice cream while watching the grinch and then him pretending to be the man of the house and putting on aftershave thus leading to his famous hands on his cheeks scream alot of those are things an 8 year old would enjoy doing while that is if his family didnt mysteriously disappear without explanation and remain gone for days on end that like i said before wouldve gotten a real 8 year old frightened however you could also view all of this as just the fantasy of an 8 year old which is why the movie was quite popular at the time and why i enjoyed it when i was youngalso amusing was kevin going grocery shopping with his conversation with the suspicious cashier also amusing was the scene of him asking a pharmacist if the toothbrush on sale was approved by the american dental association and not her or her boss knowing that scene also has one of kevins runins with the rumored murderer neighbor marley this leads to another one of the movies goofs when buzz said at the beginning of the movie that marley was a murderer who just didnt have enough concrete evidence to put him away yet later on when buzz is talking to his and kevins sister in paris about why hes not worried about kevin being he says how they live on a street where absolutely nothing dangerous or criminal ever happens i guess buzz had forgotten then about marleyother implausibilities include when kevins family in paris discovering kevin being left home they cannot find one person they know back home in chicago who could check on him and the police provide being useless too after one of them is told on the phone by kevins mother that her 8 year old son has been abandoned the officer repeats her request you want me to check on him to see if hes ok as if it was a weird thing for a mother to ask when her 8 year old has been left alone and defenselesskevin turns out not to be so defenseless though with burglars harry and marv when he rigs a bunch of traps for them and defends his home thats the most famous part of the movie and also the most implausible and unrealistic it never occurred to kevin to just call the police i guess that may also be due to the police in their town being useless such as their reaction to kevins mother asking to check up on him the police in kevins town being useless may explain why kevin never heard from them when he got the pizza guy to think that there was a shooter in the house threatening him and causing him to run to his car all crazy freaked out and due to the pizza guys freaked out reaction he believed that there was a real shooter in the house he wasnt smart enough to realize that kevin was only playing a movie with a shooting going on normally after something like that the pizza guy would go to the police and they would then immediately come to the housegood movie in parts but those gosh darn implausibilities,comedy
ive seen it with my niece neither she nor i have laughed starting from the unreality of the plot which you do not consider because it is what it isthe actors are not well this movie went up to macaulay culkin but i do not think its good eitherthere are family movies that make you laugh and entertain you but it is that this was is and will be boringdo not make your children have a boring time,comedy
i dont know why i avoided this film its a john hughes classic film in his style of american suburbia macaulay culkin has the startling role as kevin mcallister in suburban chicago town in a beautiful home he plays the child precociously and with vulnerability at eight years old after he is banished to the attic he is forgotten the next day after his parents fly to paris france for a family holiday there were fifteen in all the scene where they are racing to the plane would be unrealistic today kevin believes his family left him alone with two burglars played by daniel stern and joe pesci kevin learns of their plot to burglarize his home as the silver tuna kevins mother realized that she forgot him at home worried and desperate she would do anything to reunite with them there are noticeable chicago actors like ann whitney and alan wilder in minor roles of course there is john candy in a small role as well the cast did an excellent job with their roles the film wasnt expected to be such a hit at the box office you can watch this film repeatedly and still enjoy it like other john hughes films,comedy

1990 dir chris columbus  cast maccauley culkin joe pesci daniel stern catherine ohara john candy surprisingly entertaining and engaging family holiday comedy that preaches to every kids rebellion and that is freedom from parents plot regards eight year old kevin accidentally left at home while his family went on a holiday vacation the house is large allowing lots of room for kevin to be innovative especially when a couple of criminals sight the house for theft they are the wet bandits and they meet their match when kevin booby traps the house resulting in slapstick mishaps that is a tad brutal the booby traps look effective enough for a kid kevins age but the slapstick violence should result in discernment from parents maccauley culkin is a find as the mischievous kevin whose behavior has him wishing that his family was gone he gets his wish when overlooked for the trip culkin is entertaining and full of energy as kevin celebrates his freedom joe pesci and daniel stern play the two idiotic thieves who are assaulted with everything but the kitchen sink as they are outwitted by this kid catherine ohara plays kevins frantic mother who desperately tries to get back home to her son john candy provides a chuckle as the leader of a polka band that offers ohara a ride while it toys with the idea of freedom it also celebrates the reality of family unity score 9  10,comedy
i saw and loved as a kid particularly enjoying all the home invasion traps that kevin mccallister set up for the bad guys watching it nowadays im surprised to see that this sequence only takes up the last quarter of the movie before then theres a surprisingly complex storyline with some good subplots to keep it moving nicely alongthat this also turns out to be a classic film which has lost none of its warmth and magic is the biggest surprise yes macaulay culkin is more than a little annoying when you watch him as an adult  in fact i remember him being annoying when i watched him as a kid  but you can forgive him because hes endearing nonetheless of the supporting cast the ones who particularly shine are joe pesci channelling some of that goodfellas energy daniel stern and roberts blossom derangedthe film was written by john hughes so the expected sentimentality is here but somehow it never becomes too cloying  you can live with it because theres plenty of good stuff elsewhere that home invasion stuff is still superbly directed surprisingly violent and very funny and theres so much ingenuity packed into the running time that this is a film impossible to dislike in fact i still love it,comedy
is one of those christmas films that pop up every year its many peoples favourite modern christmas film too i just didnt like itit couldnt cope with the overly sentimental subplot about the neighbour the cartoon humour was too dark for my liking and as ever i found macaulay culkin annoyingit has its moments dont get me wrong but would i rate this as the best christmas film of all time as others have no so good luck to you if youre dusting off the dvd and enjoying it with nostalgia ill instead watch the santa clause a real modern classic,comedy
is a christmas family comedy about a young boy named kevin who is accidentally left behind when his family takes off for a vacation in france over the holiday seasonit stars macaulay culkin together with daniel stern and joe pesci it was written and produced by john hughes and directed by chris columbus kevin mccallister is mistakenly left behind when his family flies to paris for their christmas vacation he initially relishes being but soon has to contend with two wouldbe burglars who are planning to rob every house in kevins suburban chicago neighborhood eventuallykevin tries to contend with the burglars on his own in this slapstick comedythe film was the highest grossing comedy when it was theatrically releasedit definitely provided a lot of joyhumor and entertainmentthere was also no dull and boring momentthe cast did a marvelous job in their respective roleswhile the movie at present as this review is being written may find this film somewhat overstretched as a comedy by todays standardsit will always be a good family entertainment,comedy
my response to this movie is strictly prejudiced for all it violence and lack of verisimilitude i get a kick out it ever time i see it if one cant get past the fact that the wile e coyote element is in here where no one ever seems to get hurt no matter what you arent going to have much fun with that caveat the movie is a bit of a hoot mccauley culkin came to stardom in this its too bad his life became unsettled after this watching joe pesci and daniel stern the ever optimistic though doomed villains continue to fight a losing cause against an eight year old is the stuff cartoons are made of their mugging as they try one thing after another only to be thwarted is great fun the subplot of the mother hooking up with a polka band led by the inimitable john candy adds an element of joy there is also the relationship that grows with a frightening man next door who has been tabbed a murderer by the insensitivity of the neighborhood kids this man is estranged from his son and has lapsed into a sad existence this raises this up from just a kid movie to one with a bit more substance anyway dont take it to seriously and one may have a bit of fun at the holidays,comedy
this movie is a classic and is really funny and kids love this moviethis movie is about a boy named kevin and his familykevins family left him but kevin did not know they left kevin found out the family left when he woke up the next morningthat morning kevin found out his family left and was sad and scaredafter a while of being sad kevin found a van in his drive way the van that was in his drive way was burgalers the burglars were trying to get into the house but kevin kept them out by setting up traps each time the burglars tried to break in they got hurt by trapseach time the traps got more and more painfulkevin set up a lot of traps but that did not stop them but the last time they tried they got badly hurt and they got caught by the policeafter kevin went to his room to take a nap and his mom came in yelling kevins nameafter a few minutes kevin came down and saw his mom standing there and gave her a big hug later that morning the whole family came home and kevin was really happy to see everyonethis movie makes you wonder if you were ever scared when you were while you were a kid,comedy
is a very cute lighthearted comedy kevin mccallister definitely has a way of detouring the criminals in a very comical way this movie is a good family type of a film  so i do recommend watching it for those that have not seen it and love funny filmson the downside is not the christmas classic i was expecting it to be after watching the movie a couple of times i realized that this movie would not be among my favorite christmas films to enjoy each year maybe i got the burnout watching it you would think i would love each year because i still enjoy the comedy film christmas vacation during the holidays and im not burned out on it but i am610,comedy
this movie served merely as the platform for 3 not only was macaulay culkin not nearly as good as alex d linz but the fact that it took this franchise two entire movies to build the scene for number three was rather disappointing the gags were simply too unrealistic and the fact that these criminals could not outwit a small child is unbelievable not only was alex d linz far cuter than macaulay culkin but he was far better in the role of the abandoned child the rare highlight in this movie is the break out appearance of john candyto fully grasp the quality distance between 1 and 3 all one must do is observe the fame to which each main actor went on to after their respective movies alex d linz was the star of the classic max keebles big move on the other hand macaulay culkin was linked to the late michael jackson,comedy
i didnt think george romeros 1985 film day of the dead was the piece i was going to come away from thinking about the most certainly in terms of structure there is that overriding sense of the first two thirds of the film acting as gentle filler to the bigger picture pleasant foundations easing into a final act arriving with such an explosion that when we watch it all unfold we observe just how much craft and panache has been put towards it when placed up against mostly everything that preceded it the respective sequences are of course when the undead run amok in what was up to that point a safe haven for the few remaining human beings left in the united states and that moment those two burglars in chris columbus 1990 comedy make it to the leads house so as to ransack itup to these respective points we could be forgiven for misplacing that said films were necessarily either respective horror or comedy movies at all in the case of the romero movie that was ok we enjoyed the clash between those indebted to science and those not between those with trying to learn and understanding beings initially alien to them and those wanting to round them all up and get rid of them as soon as possible in comparison the build up to columbus explosion of style craft and third act circumstance into which you genuinely feel the most energy has been pumped contains a scene in which one of those typically overweight american police officers goofily slips on a stretch of ice as he chases after an infant accused of stealing a toothbrush ho humin spite of this is a fairly resounding effort on the whole without really ever creeping above a certain threshold of meagerness it is a childs film for sure and one theyll no doubt enjoy watching as the kid protagonist thwarts an array of grownups in both a physical and authoritarian sense theyll sympathise with the lead and his marginalisation at the hands of uncles and brothers and theyll respond to his predicament of actually being away from family members and parents whilst having to get by on ones own as the first and foremost source of adventure remarkably the film works as well as it does from an adult perspective child orientated goals aside it is made with the best of intentions and competently enough in spite of the fact one can only hold a certain amount of sympathy for a young child wanting all the attention without getting it whilst disparagingly privy to a three storey house in a part of the world which always sees snow at christmas time and with a family capable of affording expensive holidays to far off localesit is macaulay culkin playing kevin mccallister an infant boy stuck at home at christmas time with his extended family on the eve of their big holiday away to paris kevin is an outcast and both frustrates and is frustrated by them one line as he stamps up and down on the landing as he shouts when i grow up and get married ill finally be able to live alone captures his forthright but ignorant stance after wishing them gone and he alone the following morning sees a mad dash and a miscount resulting in the mccallisters halfway over the atlantic and kevin still in an attic convert cue a lot of shenanigans a rush to get home to him and a passable framework to do with the leads realising family are actually something to cherish proper antagonism arrives in the form of two burglars marv stern and harry pesci a couple of crooks whose trademark is to fill the sinks of their victims and leave the taps on to induce flooding  rather humorously they scope out neighbourhoods in a van kitted out to look like a plumbing company and as they toast crowbars whilst spying the mccallister residence an amusing cut to inside kevins house sees a tv cartoon broadcast depicting the grinch they are indeed out to wreck christmasthe various strands and subplots just about hang together kevins mothers subplanes trains  automobiles trek back home complete with an eccentric john candy figure is kicked around for laughs but just feels like john hughes paying homage to himself while kevins integration with a road sweep whose psychosis ends up being a lot more balanced than was initially established allows kevin to see things through more grounded eyes the roadsweep and our lead share a scene in a church which quite literally sees the conclusion of kevins framework all but verbally confirmed whilst revealing what it is hes come to learn during this experience  the following fifteen minutes a part of the final twenty seeing the film make that aforementioned step up into a final act of second unit genre onslaught when marv and harry finally try to rob the mccallister house where the narrative is weak with the whole exercise sporadically feeling spineless its lead carries the film in a surprisingly diligent manner whereas composer williams finds a delicate place in between unnerving on account of some theremin riffs during the opening as a small home is dwarfed by the films ominous title card to reassuring and quite pleasant with a thoroughly competent score columbus keeps the thing cracking along at a brisk old rate and while the wheels threaten to come off it is actually somewhat of a relief overall that they do not,comedy
from what i could gather from watching this movie is that it was about an abused child whos whole family hated and bullied him mercilessanyway the family hate the poor kid that much that they left him at home while they went on holiday abroad now the kid is left to defend for himself as a couple of hungry paedophiles try to break their way into his house and abduct himthe kid has only one friend about and that is his old neighbour the snow shoveller who is said to of done time in pelican bay for multiple feloniesin the end the film had a great twist where in fact the two suspected peados were really just trying to help the boy as the real peado was the snow shoveller the morale of the story i guess was be careful who you trust and dont have kids if you cant look after them anyway i found it one of the better suspense thrillers about,comedy
i was not alive when this came out age 14 but this is by far my favorite movie to watch at the holidays its just so funny i jump in my chair and laugh and i mean the paint cans the tools the fake cardboard people the ornaments to make their feet hurt and most of all the m he burned on pescis hand i just cant stop laughing unrealistic it may be but that doesnt matterkevin mccallister maculay kulkin is so cute and joe pesci brings such a pesci like presence to the screen funniest bumbling idiot ever i also love the performance by the other children downlow it is just a great movie i mean come on my grandmother loves itps check out 2 also very funny takes place at trump tower,comedy
is a simple concept but one of genius a small boy kevin played by macaulay culkin accidentally left behind by his family as they depart on christmas vacation finds himself in the family home which is about to be burgled by a pair of crooks however the little lad is full of innovative ideas for fighting off their depredations and the crooks themselves are woefully ineptthis idea comes out in practice as a chunk of setup and a slushily sentimental coda which bracket the centrepiece  the assault and defence on the mcallister house which is played as a live action tom and jerry cartoonsentimentality is appropriate for a christmas movie and in any event it is good to see catherine ohara often in overstated comedic roles playing with a softer edge besides a dose of saccharine is a small price to pay for the wildly funny slapstick violence inflicted by kevin on the hopelessly outclassed harry joe pesci and marv daniel stern both actors play with a broadness which is not only just right but also absolutely necessary and young macaulay culkins kevin is an engaging combination of resourcefulness malice and vulnerabilitya hugely enjoyable family movie,comedy
8yearold kevin mcallister is accidentally left behind when his family takes off for a vacation in france over the holiday season once he realises theyve left him home by himself kevin learns to fend for himself he eventually has to protect his house against bumbling burglars harry and marv who are planning to rob every house in kevins suburban chicago neighbourhood kevins mother kate is frantic when she realises that she and the family have unintentionally left kevin behind in chicago and she tries to make it back to chicago as fast as she can getting help from a polka band leader named gus polinskiafter twenty years since its release this still is as original and fresh as the first time i saw itits a simple premise given that fantastic hughes magic and the running time is deceptively slim as you feel you are watching a much shorter film the first hour is keving enjoying his freedom final third the torture of harry and marvand this is where the film really is magical because no matter how many times you see stern scream or fall down the stairs you cannot help but laugh in fact stern is the best thing in the filmas with most christmas movies there is a moral to the film and the token cheesy ending and cheesy scenes but the lines in the film and the chemistry of all the cast make up for thatwith cameos from john candy and allegedly elvis presley this is just about the most perfect christmas film for the whole familyand who wouldnt want to put firecrackers in a pot and out angels with filthy souls on full blast,comedy
this movie is one of the interesting movie for me it is in san francisco key character is kevinhe is young boyhe is troublemaker in his family he was hated by his familyone day he was left alone in homehis family forget to kevin and they go on a trip in christmas and theirs house was aimed to robberskevin noticed thishe decided to fight to robbersand he fight to robbers by myself he is so bravely but it was very very interesting thingsfinally he won to robbersand his family go home he and his family are very happythis story is very very interesting you worth to watch this movie i love ,comedy
is a movie that is considered a classic i dont really think of it as a classic if it werent for a few things i think it would be forgettable but those things make it work those things are joe pesci and daniel stern those two made the first film and i guess the sequel fun for mefrom director chris columbus who is super cheesy directed this film back in 1990 everyone of his films is cheesy for example is cheesy i love you beth cooper the worst film of the year is very cheesy the first two harry potter films are kind of corny i mean this guy is the king of cheese he cant help it for some reasonhas some very funny moments that is another reason why i liked it macculy kulkin who i have never really liked plays a brat named kevin mccalister and he lives in a house with a hundred other people one day as they are going to france the accidentally leave kevin at home so while kevin is and the mom travels back to try and get him these two burgalers try to break into kevins house but kevin isnt going to take itthe problem that i have with this one and its sequel is that they are just too cheesy the acting jobs arent done too well but if it wasnt for pesci and stern this movie would be a mess see it though its got some painfully cheesy moments and some painfully funny moments,comedy
i was a preschooler when this movie came into theatres and turned out to be a massive box office success but i never saw it in my childhood i saw a bit of what i guess was the 1992 sequel 2 lost in new york when i was a kid and was familiar with the screaming kevin doll a toy which i was never was a big fan of based on the main character in the first two films played by macaulay culkin from a very early age however believe it or not it took me a little over eighteen years after the theatrical release of the original for me to get around to seeing it yes this movie is up there on the highest grossing movies of all time lists but now that ive seen it i dont know exactly what that was all aboutkevin mccallister is an eight year old boy in chicago whose family is preparing for their christmas vacation in france on the night before the trip he is picked on by his siblings and after a dispute with one of them he is sent to sleep on the third floor wishing his family would disappear the next day the family leaves in a hurry and kevin is accidentally left behind he wakes up to find that his family actually has disappeared and his parents dont realize theyve forgotten their son back at home until one point during their flight at first kevin is happy that the family is gone but eventually finds that being isnt all that easy while his mother kate tries desperately to get back home as quickly as possible which doesnt turn out to be easy kevin becomes aware of two burglars who intend to rob the mccallister house for a while early in the film i didnt find it very funny at all before the trip theres a joke about armpit shaving jokes like this along with some language are the obvious reasons for the pg rating and one of the mccallister siblings throws up i did not care for these and some of the sibling rivalry and insults i found to be a bit much for a while after kevin first finds himself i found the film rather dull but fortunately funnier parts come there are some humorous moments involving kevin without his family such as the character at the store with the question he asks about a certain toothbrush and i laughed hard during the scenes where he uses the movie to communicate with people at the door convincing them there are adults inside theyre probably the funniest parts the mccallister mother can also be somewhat amusing during her attempts to quickly get back home casting comedienne catherine ohara in this role definitely helped the climax can be funny but gets a little tiresomeive definitely seen much worse comedies than this hit holiday film from 1990 and this one is funnier than 1994s the santa clause another pg rated family christmas movie from the 90s which i seemed to enjoy as a kid but not during my last viewing many years later despite the absurd plot does have some good humour as well as a rather poignant moment in the church which eventually comes but still the film is not all its cracked up to be it may be slightly above average family fare and it has appeal but its still a little strange the fact its among the tops in box office history im sure there are so many movies which have been much more deserving of the success that had at the box office but unfortunately didnt even come close,comedy
i had expected this to be quite a decent film however it only turned out to be alright this is because i found kevin to be a huge weirdo he screams louder than anyone in any movie or in real life that ive ever seen scream he also appears to be very strange like when he asks if the toothbrush he purchases is approved by the american dental asscosiation or when he runs in fear extremely loudly away from old man marley however the pranks he pulls on the idiodic burglars are what made this movie okay as well as when he scares away the pizza man by playing the voice of the man in the r rated movie who knows you might love it watch it if ya want i cant do nothing to stop ya,comedy
i decided to give another look this used to be one of my favorite movieswhen i was about 7 years old i remember receiving the tape of this movie for christmas and watching it about 100 times when youre a kid a film of this sort is a barrel of laughs as an adultits pretty dull not to mention the film hasnt stood the test of time macaulay culkin was an adorable kid but thats just the point he was one of those cutesie onlyinthemoviestype kids that got famous for smiling into the camera and belting out semiwitty oneliners it bothers me every time i watch culkins character speak his thoughts out loud when hes all alone having shot a couple student films that has always been one of my pet peeves most nonactors assume that acting is all about talking and they feel the need to verbalize everything theyre feeling rather than expressing them in facial expressions and body languagelike everyday people do luckily culkin has matured since then and is now a much better actor the climax of the movie involving the bumbling burglars still makes me laugh though for the most part its just weirder now to see the foulmouthed joe pesci in a family film i still find the interactions between pesci and daniel stern mildly amusing but all in all unlike a film like a christmas story is not a film the adults can enjoy just as much as the kids im sure the kids wont mind culkins hammy acting and the constant use of lowbrow humor,comedy
this is a movie you have to watch with your brain in neutral if you think about it youll just go nuts true they threw plot logic out the window with this movie a parent who would leave a child whether accidentally or not would probably be visited by social services be thrown in jail and have their children taken away from them especially if they do this two years in a row but thats another movie the pranks kevin pulls on these two stupid criminals should not be tried at home setting hair on fire things of that nature would kill someone in real life they should put up a disclaimer in this movie warning of the dangers of some of these pranks otherwise its a laugh a minute fun little romp especially when it comes time for kevin to defend his home love the way he played a scene from angels with filthy souls when he scared off the pizza man and when he scared off the burglars early in the story that business with old mr marley have to see the movie again to be sure i got that name right was very touching at the end it showed kevin wasnt just another dumb bratty little kid that he had a heart of gold very entertaining just sit back relax enjoy the ride and dont think too much,comedy
holidays are all about cheer and joy they are times to laugh and spend with your family achieves cheer joy laughter except for familywritten by john hughes who also did the funny breakfast club is about an 8year old boy named kevin who is accidentally left at home when his parents leave for christmas vacation unfortunately for kevin he lives in a rich house which is targeted by two burglars marv and harry they plan to rob kevins house at 900 pm so kevin has to protect himself using selfinvented trapsis simply full of slapstick humor with some hidden jokes in between one of the funniest parts is the one with the pizza man but john hughes made one mistake he forgot to make it realistic how could kevin stay asleep while his whole family is screaming and trying to pack how could he make so many traps but not pack a suitcase how could marv spend so much time on the floor after tripping when harry has grabbed kevin how well despite the main flaw makes a fun heartwarming holiday movie i would definitely recommend it of course it isnt perfect but its fun and fun is what holiday movies should be 710 good fun funny and heartwarming and has nothing to do with santa like most christmas movies dobad unrealistic and it could be funnierfeel free to send me a private message regarding this comment,comedy
saw this movie yesterday and i can say that still after many years that this movie is still very entertaining even though the plot is waaaaaaaaay out there with young kevin culkin being forgotten by his large family in the frenzy to catch the plane to paris after their alarm clocks didnt work because of an electric blackoutyou might be thinking that the only part worth watching is when kevin finally defends his home from the two thieves pesci and stern but the parts when kevin runs rampant in the giant home is just as entertaining wouldnt we all like to do that the film is worth seeing thanks to culkin and pescistern and to the playfullness and ingenuity that you can feel from ita childrens classic610,comedy
this movie stretches credibility to its limits sure its a comedy so it can get away with some stuff a kid is more competent than everyone else in an uppermiddleclass family and he gets stuck at home because the family doesnt count its kids right two dimwitted crooks set out to burglarize a house believing that the family is away for the holiday the kid is there and he is a menace the kid has an engineering talent freakishly developed for a tenyearold kid and the sadistic cleverness that that he exposes in creating rube goldberglike devices for tormenting a pair of burglars who fail to get the message that there really is someone there i know that the garden variety of crooks are usually on the low side on intellectual development but one time would be enough  right how many times do those crooks have to take falls burns and sharp objects into them before they learnits somewhat fun  if you can pass up the stupidity the gaps in the plot and the meanspiritedness beneath a saccharine veneer,comedy
this film is full of crude violence that is meant to be funny as the acts are made by child makes it even more disturbing why they make pictures like this for children is beyond my understanding anything for money i suppose,comedy
this movie is part of our staple of movies to watch at christmas time it is a ok movie with enough holiday themes and scenery to keep me satisfied it is a holiday movie mccauley culkin does a good job playing off two bumbling and really dumb burglars it helps to have a mansion as the backdrop to foiling joe pesci and daniel stern  some of the scenes where the 2 bumbling burglars try to eneter the house are charmingly funny it is annoying that the script could not come up more clever ways for pesci and stern to react other than ow or frismfrasm and the kid delivers enough hits that would kill a normal person but todays movies must add violence as one of the ingredients to a successful movie audiences have developed a taste for it even if this was made to be a holiday movie to be seen by millions of kids but i did enjoy the christmas touches and the various personality conflicts from the large family 2 is the companion movie of part 1 and follows the same pattern,comedy
1st watched 782000  5 out of 10 dirchris columbus somewhat funny adventure about a young child1 of 11 left at home accidentally during a family vacation some funny scenes but otherwise muddled story,comedy
the only fact which should make this feature a holiday season movie is a christmas miracle that must have happened to the two burglars in real life the treatment which they received from the little boy would have resulted in multiple injuries and they would have been simply not capable to walk awaytv shows are known to have been banned for showing violence much milder than in this movie however this movie continues to be shown at holiday seasons as a classic piece of family entertainment something must be wrong here,comedy
a pickedon 8 year old kid a surprisingly competent performance from macaulay culkin before he grew up to be a bigger kid is left by a family taking a christmas vacation to paris expecting a quiet few days on his own he has to contend with a couple of inept burglars with his own inventive traps  bouts of violencea very simple film with a sugary  predictable message at the end but inspite of the threadbare plot it is a very enjoyable romp perhaps because of the rather inventive but uncomplicated writing from john hughesthe film only really comes alive during the battle of wits between culkin  the two robbers well supported by pesci  stern while the rest of the film just trundles along at a rather predictable pacei saw this film back in 91 and found it quite funny still do in fact but at that time i hadnt really had much chance to see other pesci movies of the timebut now some 10 years on everytime i see pesci screaming in agony as he suffers more comic violence from the inventive little brat i keep thinking hes going to go into goodfellas or casino mode and pull out a gun along with a hail of abusive language and shoot the kid full of bullets or put his head in a vicebut anyway is a good family movie that doesnt stretch the mind and never really offends anyone although perhaps the tom  jerry style violence is perhaps a little too strong in places its a nicely packaged movie and i have to admit culkin is very very good here best not mention the two limp sequels,comedy
too bad for john hughes my favorite writer of the 80s  his first offering of the 90s was this blockbuster not a bad film but one that started him on an unfortunate trend  the storyline is ingenuis if youre trying to lure kids to see it and releasing it during the holiday season made it an easy option for parents who wanted something pg rated for the little ones  it concerns culkin being left behind by his family during a mad dash to the airport  when he awakens to an empty house he stays unrealisticly calm most kids would probably be scared on their own but hes unphased and makes the best of it eating junk jumping on his folks bed and staying up late watching r rated films  his family finally notices him missing halfway to paris and mom ohara takes the rest of the films running time to get back to him  in the middle of living it up culkin discovers that a pair of hairbrained burglars plan on robbing his house  hes ready for them arming the entire home with an array of painful traps and devices  up until this point the film was slightly amusing as culkin though not a great kid actor was cute to watch go thru his little adventures  but hughes writing genius that he is waited till the end to hatch his goldmine idea that he knew kids would eat up  youngsters  most of which who dont understand prolonged pain and find it funny lapped up the cartoonish injuries heaped upon pesci and stern  watching as an adult though it just makes you uncomfortable watching men scream in pain scene after scene hughes tries to cancel out the violence with a sappy happy ending but it does nothing to erase the damage done by the unpleasantness  and as said earlier because of the 800 million dollar success of the film hughes would mire himself in a clone mode for the entire decade of the nineties constantly remaking this formula with even worse results each time  it all went to show that even your best success cannot be the best thing for you and all we can hope is that real john hughes who we loved in the 80s will come home again,comedy

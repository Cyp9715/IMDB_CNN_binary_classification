i just want to state off hand that this is my first movie review well other than just telling someone what i thought so if you are looking for a well written witty review then you might want to stop reading now but since this movie is still in production this will probably be your best bet for the time beingi just went to a free screening of at the greenback theater in sacramento ca and i just have to say off the bat i loved it a movie hasnt made me laugh that hard in a long time now im not going to give you any more information than the description because with the movie not even being released yet i think that would be a spoiler of some sort but i will tell you that was so much better than what i imagined it would be granthat was before i knew it was direcand voiced over by seth macfarlane so if youre a fan of his youre definitely in for a treat and even if youre not i still think you would enjoy the innovative comedy that comes from a snarky and crude teddy bear companion the acting was very solid from main characters to jerk bosses and crazy well crazy people the acting was very convincing and enjoyable the story was great while it might sound stupid to some myself included its very well execudefinitely not one of the movies that left me thinking the idea was good but they could have done so much more with it it was actually quite the opposite and this is certainly not a low budget film the cgi animation reflects this the furry bear voiced by macfarlane is very realistic and believable the only drawback i could possibly see that would cause someone displeasure would be like a lot of new comedies this film pushes the envelope in raunchy vulgar humor plus the different amount of drugs used this movie will receive most likely and be very deserving of a r rating it doesnt rely solely on shock humor though there is plenty of good old fashioned clean comedy but if your like me and that type of subject matter doesnt bother you then i highly recommend this film and if youre a seth macfarlane fan then thats just a perfectly gift wrapped little bonus for you,comedy
i really should start this with a warning this film is not for everyone if you are easily offended by swearing sexual references casual racism and various stereotypes then you should read no further and give this one a miss however if you are a fan of seth macfarlanes other projects family guy american dad and maybe you call yourself an 80s child so many pop culture references to this time you are going to love thissure some parts are a little disjointhe story seems vaguely familiar and the moral of it kind of gets lost but quite frankly its just so darn funny none of that matters the script is hilarious the cameos are fantastic and the soundtrack is perfecthimself is well animaand seth apart from sounding a little like peter griffin voices him with the usual competence mark wahlberg delivers exactly what we have come to expect from him and the rest of the cast seem to have had fun filming which comes across in the various performances no matter how big or small the acceptance and interaction of everyone with a living teddybear adds to the simple joy of this film and you find yourself happy to watch and not question why nobody is fazed by this is a laugh a minute party of a film and i for one cant wait to see it again,comedy
i like family guy so much that ive always said that if i were stuck on a desert island seth macfarlane is one of the people id want to be stuck there with me i found this movie horrible loathsome and lazy so much so that it actually made me question family guy thats how bad i thought it was it made me rethink my entire conception of humor i did not find this movie funny at all the style of comedy it uses is similar to that of adam sandler whom i loathe theres a lot of yelling a lot of cursing and overall a lot stuff thats supposed to be funny there are no clever jokes no sense of setup and reward instead its oh look the man is dancing thats hilarious not or haha that guy just said the fword isnt that funny kill me i did find exactly one scene funny the one in which and mark whalberg have a fist fight in a hotel room that reminded me of family guy and i found the idea so absurd that it made me chuckle but this moment of hilarity is quickly diffused by a getting hit in the groin joke now i realize that family guy uses exactly this type of humor but somehow i always found it funnier maybe thats the problem here live action is a different medium and the same things that work in the campy universe of cartoons dont work with real people i realize that this is a comedy but i do believe that even low brow comedy movies should have a basic story or plot this was supposed to be a character driven movie the idea is simple mark whalberg is a manchild who must learn to take responsibility and grow up the script screws up this idea completely and instead mark whalberg makes absolutely no change as a person neither does i realize its supposed to be adorable that a teddy bear smokes weed but the novelty wore off in 2 minutes that and i found the accent horribly annoying i was excito see the supporting cast list on wikipedia whalberg is great but like i said his character was very poorly written mila kunis does nothing in the whole movie but play a horribly clichd romantic comedy girlfriend who also has no character arc in the movie joel mchale is another clich in the movie and the fact that hes in the movie is a waste of a talencomedic actor laura vandervoort literally does nothing i mean i at least expecher to be the seductress who tries to veer mark whalberg off the path of righteousness but even that doesnt happen so why even have this supporting cast in the movie if no ones going to do anything the plot of this movie was equally weak macfarlane uses all of these clichd romcom scenes and does nothing with them heres a small example this movie has 2 or 3 restaurant scenes now ask yourself why exactly were these scenes in the movie usually restaurants are used in comedy movies to employ some kind of restaurant relahumor maybe theres a maladjusperson in an uncomfortable environment or maybe someone has an allergy and they cause a scene at least someone falling or something but the first restaurant scene of this movie simply has mark whalberg and mila kunis sitting and talking that could have just as easily happened in a living room so why was the restaurant scene necessary why even do that its completely pointless the ending to this movie accomplishes nothing mark whalberg is supposed to change as a person the death of should have signified something and having him come back to life sts on the character arc completely and nullifies it we have no reason to believe that mark whalberg will grow up or make any kind of difference in life this movie had way too much product placement horribly obvious product placement heres what i think i think seth macfarlane is a perfectly competent individual who chose to be lazy he wrote a horrible script packed it with tv stars we might recognize and collecthe money its not just that this movie had no redeemable qualities i actually feel like my intelligence was insuland that i was fooled out of my money please dont let movies like this turn off your brain think about what youre watching and why youre laughing and dont settle for crap like this,comedy
i came into this movie expecting to be laughing almost the whole time but i sat through the movie almost bored out of my mind i was on the verge of getting up and leaving but that would of been rude so instead i sat through the almost unbearable part of the movie where and john mark wahlberghave a big fight surprise surprise and johns girlfriend dumps him another surprise  its just a barrage of clichs to be honest the humour of the film was well below mediocre i didnt understand some the jokes because they were referencing a celebrity that i have never heard about the other jokes are about drugs swearing and getting drunk the only time i managed a laugh was when was pretending to be a retard  all in all if youre american youd probably understand and enjoy this movie more than i did if not stay away,comedy
i just do not get it this movie is just plain awful and yet it is breaking box office records for rracomedies with a running time of 98 mins i could only manage to sit through the first 40 minutes before turning off this unfunny quite boring and quite disappointing filmthe premise of this film is quite simple at the age of eight 8 years old and with no real friends of his own little john bennett mark wahlberg makes a christmas wish for his teddy bear to come to life and john become life long friends thunder buddies however after twentyseven 27 years of friendship john must decide on either staying with his girlfriend of four 4 years lori mila kunis or tedis the brainchild of seth macfarlane family guy  american dad and he voices as well has no redeeming qualities and is combination of the two characters quagmire and brian from the family guy tv series hes a potsmoking hooker dating grocery clerk humping foul mouth neanderthal who lori kunis feels is preventing her and john from having the adult relationship that she so desires to havein the 40 minutes that i managed to sit through i never laughed smirked grinned or even hinto a gesture of happiness to any of the socalled comedy being presenon screen because there wasnt any there unless you consider a foulmouth pot smoking teddy bear as being funny which i did not however the scene in which i could take no more is when while working as a clerk out clerk in a local grocery store gets caught bopping another check out clerk in the store room and explains to his boss that last week he screwed her with a parsnip and sold the parsnip to a family of four  so his boss promohim is that funny really god i feel like my dad now i must be getting old anyways the film is making money hand over fist and has already crossed the 100 million and expecto cross the 200 million mark by summers end i just do not get it i cannot recommend this film i cannot even finish watching this film its being markeas this years the hangover and i can assure you it is nowhere as funny as the the hangover i would say avoid at all costs but who am i see more of my reviews on fb  the faris reel,comedy
i got into a screening of this movie thanks to my daughter after waiting what felt like forever i saw the unratrailer on youtube and couldnt wait to see it as another reviewer said if you like family guy youll like this in some ways it is family guy wahlberg basically plays a peter griffin type charactera likable but somewhat dimwitguy is essentially brian smart witty and selfcentered and mila is sort of a lois type hot and the grown up in the story be warned this is not a childrens movie nudity drug and alcohol use plus heavy on the profanity in other words go see it just leave your little kids at home,comedy
whilst i did not dislike i cannot say i was overly impressed by it the hype and popularity that built up towards the films release had me expecting something fresh something that would keep me laughing days after to my disappointment to me turned out to just another romcom its only real unique twist being himself having said that did provide some good laughs whilst they werent exactly sidesplitting the film was entertaining and i did watch the entire feature without getting bored or uninteresthe animations for were of a good quality doing a good job in making it seem like was actually there with the actors rather than just a computergenera3d image what i felt let down was its predictability and lack of memorable or unique laughs being raas a 15 teds plot didnt seem to suit its targeaudience i have seen similar story lines in films rapg or even u but the explicit content of was clearly intended for more mature audiences therefore i felt it deserved a more mature plot overall id recommend to those who are looking for a relatively lighthearstory with a few giggles added in and a cursing yet somehow still lovable teddy bear its good but nothing overly special,comedy
i have a perversense of humor and do not mind family guy so im not sure what i was expecting but this nasty pointless unfunny drivel was a complete waste of my time and money about the only thing achieved here is an effort to showcase mila kunis as completely gorgeous on all other counts it is a fail  unless you like gratuitous eff words and references to bowel movementsflatulenceanal sex oooohhh how shocking and how boringspoiler alert see this and tell me if you can believe mila kunis wasting a perfectly good wish on having the worlds most repulsive little furball come back to life only for sophomoric morons with no schools to vandalize or cars to torch,comedy
first there was gollum then caesar the ape and now  if you thought motioncapture animation was beyond the range of foulmouthed rracomedy heres your evidence to the contrary family guy creator seth macfarlane has taken his love of characters who shouldnt behave like humans behaving like humans to the next level and the big screen  with a story of growing up  at the age of 35fans of macfarlane and family guy will be the first to tell you that the comedy pioneer has been more cold than hot lately i guess those manatees in the tank of idea balls have been worked too hard its not easy to keep scoring laughs using the same nonsequitur formula over and over again but fortunately is a more comically cohesive effort than youd ever expect from the king of unexpecrandom jabs references and political incorrectnessif you havent been curious enough to find out what the film is about already tells the story of how young john bennett who grows up to be mark wahlberg who had trouble fitting in as a kid made a wish on christmas day for his teddy bear to come to life his wish comes true and becomes world famous even appearing on the johnny carson show but as patrick stewart lovingly and frankly reminds us in his role as narrator like corey feldman and frankie muniz eventually people stop giving a despite a serious relationship of four years with lori mila kunis nearly middleaged john is still ripping bongs and watching 80s flash gordon with his equally irresponsible teddy bear best friend eventually john must start to make sacrifices if he wants to become the adult that lori wants him to be and is arguably the chief reason for his inability to shape upthere arent exactly any curveballs in this story but thats when you realize youre watching a film in which a man is trying to stop hanging out with his profane teddy bear despite the obvious outcomes has to be considered an original comedyits also consistently funny sure the nature of many of the jokes is that they exist in a vacuum and arent necessarily relato whats going on or what matters but much of the references actually tie into the plot later on such as flash gordon  itll make sense when you see it and its far less random than skeptics will come in expecting that said some of its best jokes and references will resonate on a personal level ie if you watch this with a group of people youre bound to laugh really hard at times when they dont and viceversathe only thing that feels a little out of place is a subplot involving giovanni ribisi as a creepy single father who has been a longtime admirer of teds and inquires about purchasing him for his overweight son youve never seen ribisi like this and that alone is amusing but the focus of the film is on how john and teds mischief impacts his ability to grow up and get more serious with lori and this sort of butts into thingsyet for all its shenanigans the amount of heart and sincerity in some of the relationship drama between john and lori is surprising wahlberg and kunis are generally pretty convincing even if its a bit weird that john is mature enough to have a relationship last four years but not enough to not screw things up at his job or avoid giving in to teds peer pressure bear pressurethe secret weapon is that really is kind of adorable and the mocap gives him an extra lifelike quality the film hits some emotional notes early who cant identify with loving a stuffed animal and this helps it to reconnect later on despite all the rrachaos in between that ability alone assures will be seen as better than a majority of foul mouthed dirtyminded comediesridiculous comes to mind as the best descriptor for which one has to imagine macfarlane aimed for in the first place his performance as the titular bear is certainly reminiscent of peter griffin theres a wink to the audience about that by the way but more importantly is treaas more than just an opportunity for a neverending string of jokes that are simply funnier because its a teddy bearmaybe having to create a complete package in the form of a movie has helped macfarlane learn how to tone down his shtick audiences will write you off if you deliver them something inconsistent and scatterbrained that goes beyond 30 inconsequential minutes of their lives and macfarlane and cowriters alec sulkin and wellesley wild make the majority of adjustments needed to honor that notion is as engaging as it is clever funny and ridiculous steven c,comedy
first of all let me tell you that i rate movies on a scale from 10 to 10 with 5 being the average and negative numbers for differentiating the awfulness of certain movies that are terriblethat said i give this movie a 0 even though i like seth macfarlanes work this was an absolute disaster we got a movie with 1 dimensional leading characters of and john that didnt provide you with a single emotional reaction while mila kunis character was at least somewhat comparable to a person although not at all complex supporting cast is the only part worth mentioning since flash gordon absolutely stole the show with the 4 minutes of air time he had his lines were consistent and witty unlike anything main characters didstory in itself falls apart since it is not built on anything real the movie is completely clownish for the first 1 hour without any character build up and then randomly inserts emotional parts which left me completely indifferent it was awkward and out of placei could have said something nice about the atmosphere if the movie was consistent as it was for the first half but it starto take itself seriously which ruined the composurei wouldnt recommend any movie enthusiast to watch this terrible movie and reading movie reviews on imdb in general im sure at least 90 of them as well as votes are sponsored by companies too bad for this once great site,comedy
i am stunned by the number of negative reviews on here we went to see last night the uk release date and it was fantastic in fact it was the funniest film i have seen for years the humour throughout is both obvious and subtle with masses of trademark seth macfarlane jokes as well as some expansion to his comedy repertoire made possible by having a live action film instead of an animationsome people have commenon all the 80s references  thats the joke in itself  seth always overfocuses on the 80s and hes poking fun at himself by doing it even more he liked star wars indian jones flash gordon top gun etc so did i  which is partly what makes it all so cool fans of seths humour will love these little and not so little references as they have all been used extensively in family guy you dont have to be over 35 to get the references you just have to get that seth is a big fan of the 80s and has great fun referencing stuff he likes some might call it selfindulgent but i thought it was very funny perhaps you have top be on a particular wavelength i dont knowto suggest that hes being racist is also to misunderstand seth macfarlane  hes actually ridiculing people with stereotypical ignorant racist attitudes once again he has done this in family guy and been similarly misunderstood its ok to make fun of racism or even the publics lack of knowledge on subjects such as 911  neither of these mean that youre racist or proterrorist in reference to the acting mark wahlberg and mila kunis were very good especially mila was also superbly played by seth macfarlane and it was interesting to note how after a while you didnt even really think of him as a bear he was just another character in the film lovely to hear patrick stewarts voice used again too in addition there was a generous use of family guy people who were all great fun especially the guy who does the voice of joe swanson and looked like they were clearly enjoying the opportunity to be in seths film debutin summary if you dont like seth macfarlanes humour theres a good chance you will not enjoy this film however if you like family guy and you have the ability to look beyond the obvious then you might well love as much as i did i thought it was brilliant and cant remember the last time i laughed so much at a cinema,comedy
this movie was such a piece of crap seth mcfarlane should stick to what he knows best  cartoons and leave the real movies to the big people it was the same rehash of his series family guy with a horrible plot about this teddy bear growing up with his owner from childhood and gets kidnapped kidnapped really and do we need yet another fat joke or handicapped joke if you answered yes then you deserve to watch this film and lower your iq another 20 points honestly the only real treat was watching mila kunis and thats some damn fine acting by the way they must have paid her a fortune to act in this crap that goes for mark wahlberg too if you were expecting some magical detailed plot where the jokes are actually funny and not recycled from a familiar series then sorry to say look elsewhere,comedy
ive been excito see since i saw the first preview i read some of the initial reviews and it sounded great i have to admit it wasnt that funny first the voice of its freaking peter griffin its like the creators of spongebob making a movie and they use the voice of spongebob its really distracting and when is making fun of someone he uses stewies voice why dont you have another voice you can use the beginning of the film is a cute and innocent bear i felt the movie was funnier then the vulgar smoking sexually active felt forced to mesome of the jokes fell flatter than a kansas interstate seriously the movie theater was completely packed and there were jokes that didnt garner one single laugh sometimes i couldnt tell if they were trying to make a joke or not some jokes were supposed to be kinda mean but were just kinda dumb there were times it seemed like the audience laughed because they thought they were supposed to this is its supposed to be hilarious there were some funny parts but honestly i left disappointed,comedy
this movie was the worst movie ive ever seen is a foul mouthed nasty rendition of what used to be a symbol of a sweet toy you would think that hollywood get a clue about why all of their movies flop either movies are redos or trash like it amazes me that movies like this can even be shown at a regular theater my teenage daughter asked to leave and this was the first movie she has ever done that to i think what is worse is that mark walberg the star of the show has young children who will someday grow up and want to see movies their dad has been in he should be ashamed of himself and i wont be seeing any of his movies in the future since he is going to stoop to this level of worse than b movies,comedy
i dont know how and why this movie was made its awful plain awful and most of all its filled with stupid vulgar jokes and references ive seen bad movies before but this one beats them by far to make things worse a grown up beats a boy and they make it look ok a teddy bear is fu a girl and they make it look ok the guy who has made this movie seth something is really deranged to make up a story like this stay away from this movie its a complete waste of time they talk about the superman movie at the end and they say its not good let me tell you something how about your movie aholesrepeat to fill more line  i dont know how and why this movie was made its awful plain awful and most of all its filled with stupid vulgar jokes and references ive seen bad movies before but this one beats them by far to make things worse a grown up beats a boy and they make it look ok a teddy bear is fu a girl and they make it look ok the guy who has made this movie seth something is really deranged to make up a story like this stay away from this movie its a complete waste of time they talk about the superman movie at the end and they say its not good let me tell you something how about your movie aholes,comedy
folks if you cant think of anything else but destroying a teddy bear as a result of a scriptless 2h nonsense in which 2 idiots argue nonstop for unknown reasons just quit making movies and go back working for mcdonalds the worst crock of manure i have ever seen in my whole life material for a 2 min short with a funny teddy oh crap we dont have a long enough story for a film lets say mark and mila keep fighting over nothing for 1 h that covers up pretty much 80 of the time still not long enough ok the cute teddy bear dies a sick maniac rips him in two  how about that just perfect for children almost there with time ok teddy bear is revived  what a great idea wow the ultimate concept i would like to catch the idiotic teen who wrote this moronic story and torture him for a couple of hours just as he did to me stay away from this junk folks and overall dont let your kids watch it its stinky puke put together without ideas no script no nothing only a pinch of sadistic stupidity hate is everything that this smelly swill can produce,comedy
saw this and had the constant feeling of awkwardness on behalf of the people producing it the timing for jokes is sometimes way off the storyline doesnt make sense in itself i know speaking toys dont exist  i mean they are inconsistent with the makebelieve stuff they tell youi expecclever jokes from mcfarlane politicalsocial satire great time for it isnt it unfortunately he managed a script that only pointlessly rumbles on from here to there trying to develop something with love story and talking bear something something i laughed a handful of times but that isnt enough for 100 minutesyou are just constantly pushed out of it by inept moviecraftsmanship the casting is ridiculous a former superhero and another former man in black have a small side role as a funny gay couple  problem is a 12 year old makes better gay jokes the stuff feels really outdafor me maybe in the early 1990s such a thing as a man who is gay but cant figure it out was funny plus one can see no one gave them useful direction to portray the characters as they are so visible as the actors who did that other movie all the time if you do this and these kindlevel of jokes now you look like a filmschool freshman who couldnt afford a professional scriptreviewer,comedy
one of the most sexist and problematic movies i have ever seen in my life it wasnt funny it was purely idioticfirst of all john is a total loser who is completely irresponsible and his girlfriend lori ends up being trealike shes some sort of award to be won or lost loris also completely shallow and only seems to like him because of his looks which frankly is all that he really has going for him i suppose teds completely sexist homophobic fatshaming and immaturethen theres rex who treats lori like a fetish theres seriously not a single good role model or decent person in the entire movie its simply one stereotype built upon another i am deeply ashamed in society for allowing such a movie to gain so much popularity when its the abyss of everything thats wrong in the world it reeks of privilege,comedy
after seeing the good user reviews for my expectations were actually raised a little the trailers didnt seem too funny to me but im a big fan of family guy and seth macfarlane and thought that it would be at least as funny as the average fg episodewell after seeing the movie i have to say that seth macfarlane mila kunis and mark whalberg have all sunk to new alltime lows i cant believe a movie like this would get backed by a studio the jokes are even more low brow than south park a show i cant stand and the plot relies on fart jokes constant weed smoking and clich characters that try way too hard to get a laugh and overact in almost every scenei cant imagine that anyone would find this funny other than maybe somebody so high or so drunk that they find poop on the floor and farting hilariousthe theater was pretty full for an afternoon show and other than the seriously stoned dudes behind me there were very few people in the theater that laughed at most of the jokes i had a few chuckles and a half laugh but no lol momentsi honestly starfeeling bad for the actors and began wondering if they actually read the script before they agreed to do this movie or if they just trusthat anything by seth macfarlane had to be funnyi wouldnt recommend this movie to anyone it really is bad beyond belief but if you dont believe me then check it out and be prepared to see somewhat respectable actors sink to the lowest of lows,comedy
absolutely nihilistic piece of stupidity seth macfarlanes story is beyond the limits of human foolishness let him hear it a mixture of morbid imagination and conscious attack on the minds of degenerageneration hidden lie and abominable attempt to profane everything what inadmissible frivolity it was to show this concoction to the public i may only suspect of the reasons of those wretched and illnatured producers to contribute money for nothing but spoiling the mindsinfantile person is a hero befriended by a badmouthing swearing religiously toy no talents but both are extremely funny even norah jones what a shame gives him a chance and a shopgirl who couldnt invent anything better as having intercourse with teddybear what kind of love is in the story i ask sham and shame and propaganda you dont know yet whether you are gay or not and carefree violence drinks drugs parties dollgirls and shtconclusion never watch you will never miss,comedy
this is the biggest insult ever made to a movie it is like you are trying to insult peoples intelligence you can call it anything except a watchable movie it hurts from start to end it actually upsets you there is no proper description that i could give to this piece of crap there is no age or stereotype that could link it to it shrinks you patience and it hurts your mind as for kids i would advice their parents to keep them away from this movie as they might think that the presence of a teddy bear would make kids be attracto it believe me it would literally destroy them no offense but mark w should demand a huge compensation from the makers of this movie for the destruction of his reputation as a descent actor other than that if you want to prove me wrong i beg you see this movie and come and hit me hard in return,comedy
had the potential to be a classic movie like big or like elf both of which were magical tales about childhood dreams set in the adult world unfortunately cops out and goes for the cheap shots with jokes about prostitutes pooping on the floor or a teddy bear squirting hand cream all over its face to suggest to a woman what he wants to do to her she goes out with him anyway what made big and elf so funny was how innocent the main characters were in the adult world but is a perversociopath and why that part is never explained the plot jumps straight from the bear announcing its presence to the child to the bear smoking pot from a bong on a couch are we suppose to love him how can we when hes a raging racist homophobe something else that made big and elf funny is how the rest of the world responded to the main characters here we are to believe the world just accepts the idea of a talking teddy bear and nobody acts surprised we are to believe everyone in the world saw the tonight show thirty years ago and that makes it all acceptable why the writers of this dud chose to do it this way is a mystery it would have been so much funnier if people actually reacthe way people would actually react to a talking teddy bear unlike big or elf films that live on and can be watched again and again will have its flash in the pan and then it will just fade away because it makes no sense at least in bad santa we understood why this particular santa was so perverhere we are to believe that sitting around smoking pot and watching flash gordon turns you into a lunatic rapist not funny,comedy
the advertisements of this looked like it could be funny but then you watch the entire film the first part actually had some funny stuff in it but the movie turned into what it is a human story between two human characters i dont give a damn about that couldnt act out of a paper bagif it had more in it it could have been a so so movie but it had too much exposure of mark wahlberg i should have known if marks in it its gonna be bad how does mark wahlberg keep getting work he isnt funny or talenat acting the writing for this movie sucked  i suspect everyone was high while making thisseth macfarlane just stop making live action films  stick with what you do best with your adult themed cartoons one of the worst films i ever seen still 2012 doomsday was a gazillion times worse than this though both movies result in doomsday for your brain cells literally,comedy
this is a story that tries to be funny by putting a dirty mouth vulgar and sickening frat boy persona in a teddy bear with all the skills of animating such a bear it could have done something uplifting but the happy ending is a sham i felt tricked to watch this movie it made me so upset that i actually wasmy time on this i kept wishing there was some redeeming value to this movie but there wasnt this movie puts the worst of human nature out there and makes it appear good who could come up with such a story line that is so nasty the story line is so pathetic and uncreative telling a story thats been told many times over definitely not for your kids or teens and people wonder why we have an attitude problem with young people in the us this is a case in point,comedy
simple i would just like folks to tell me exactly what was funny about this film where were the funny bits to me it was just complete and utter tripe so unoriginal desperate and full of the same old profanity and vulgarity there wasnt a single subtle or creative piece of comedy in it many gagjokes were current affairs politics etc that were just dead useless and the voice of was crap just could not endear to it at all many of the scenes were just weird not funny at all the scene in the supermarket where hes acting all vulgar to the cashier mad the fight scene with and john pointless and ott crap all in all this movie gets a rating of 1 only because 0 is not available,comedy
i feel like the kid in the emperors new clothes but i just saw and its one of the worst films i have seen in many years i was so disappoinit has been getting many great reviews while also garnering a few poor ones i really wanto like it before i saw it i was thinking that at the worst i would think it was a stupidly dumb but pretty funny or even mildly funny raunchy comedy unfortunately it wasnt even that yes it was raunchy but it really wasnt all that funny so many jokes landed with a thud on top of that the film was so poorly paced i got maybe 5 or 10 laughs out of it a reknown local reviewer mentioned that one of the local actors got off perhaps the best line in the film i waifor that line and after it happened i thought to myself that is the best line in the film it starout promising actually a bit of a tongueincheek poke at christmas movies but that smartness wasnt sustained to me a great highlow brow movie comedy like theres something about mary is a model for other movies being smart and lowbrow at the same time even animal house has writing which is so much better than again the pace at times was slow which is pretty deadly for a movie like this where the jokes should keep coming fast and furiousand then it turned into maudlin with typical boy loses girl gets girl back type plot points i wont give it away but it was not goodtoo bad see it at your own risk hey i might be in the minority,comedy
this movie made me ashamed to be american our standards for comedy have completely deterioraafter seeing the dictator and now im completely convinced that hollywood will never release another intelligent funny comedy ever again the sad thing is that i was both a fan of sacha baren cohen and seth macfarlane but i have lost respect for both of them this was a movie made for complete morons how many times can you say dk and have someone take a sht before its not funny any more has every great comedic writer completely run out of ideas its absolutely pathetic i could not believe that everyone in the theater was laughing at the worst writing and acting ive ever seen the biggest problem was that the movie was boring if youre gonna make a movie about a teddy bear could you at least not bore me to tears when that chase scene starand they starsewing up the bear enough was enough im not prude or lacking in the humor department at all but i just think its really sad what comedy has turned into i miss comedies that had the ability to make me laugh without saying sk my dk 800 times there used to be real humor with real thought behind it it wasnt so cheap and void of any class or wit now all you need is someone to take a dump a famous actor to say sk my dk and a few offensive unoriginal jokes about homosexualsjewsmexicansasians and youve got yourself a golden ticket people come on we deserve more is there anyone out there please tell me im not the only one who felt this way,comedy
after all the tv hype about the upcoming release of i was eagerly looking forward to seeing it what a huge letdowni cant blame this on cultural differences and simply say that american humour is different because i frequently laugh my socks off at twoand ahalf men and the big bang theory on tv considering the inordinately high overall rating that this film has on imdb i can only assume that its me because i dont think i even smiled let alone laughed once during it the whole concept was ridiculous is that funny like would the whole adult world happily accept a talking walking dope smoking stuffed teddy bear is this an indication of the worlds mentality in 2012 i sure hope noti honestly think that in years to come mark wahlberg mila kunis and perhaps most of all patrick stewart will deeply regret ever having anything to do with this load of utter crap they are both excellent actors and i find it hard to believe that they were so hard up financially that they needed the work i note with particular interest that mark has no less than five postmovies  and mila has six  in various stages of production so i wonder what on earth made them demean themselves with this its almost like prostitution of their art and talentsi believe there is a difference between realistic expletive language like when the story centres around working men or underworld criminal gangs but the gratuitous profanity in this film has no usefulness whatsoever unless of course it makes those of limiintelligence laugh  but do our filmmakers need to pander to this sort of audience i guess it all comes down to who spends the most at the boxoffice more prostitution basically the storyline is absolute rubbish and an insult to the intelligence the plot and dialogue are not the least bit funny and the romantic aspect defies belief mila should have run a mile the day she first learned about and never come backas usual i stuck it out to the bitter end because i am the eternal optimist and live in hope that something enjoyable will develop as often happens in movies that start out a bit slowly or stupidly but in the case of i wish i had ejecit after the first five minutes thats over an hourandahalf of my life ill never get back sorry i cannot recommend this movie for any reason  there isnt even any nice scenery in it,comedy
the trailer for this movie is misleading and deceitful  thats the only reason there were any people in the theater although many walked out during the poor excuse for a movie i was all prepared for a good comedy but this has to be the worst movie of all time  i mean all time the vulgarity and cursing is over the top drugs and alcohol in the bankrupt minds of the producerdirector must be fillers and stop gap for creativity i felt embarrassed for the cast of actors  actresses that subjecthemselves to a grade b movie not a lot better than a cheap porno flick i will watch for this cast of pathetic entertainers in the future so i can avoid them like a plague money better spent bad hamburger,comedy
this is the first movie review ive ever done and after watching it inspired me to write a review how this movie has close to an 8 star rais just sad this movie is downright awful im not really giving any spoilers because theres nothing to give away its pretty much an entire drawn out recent family guy episode mark walberg gets picked on as a child makes a wish and gets a magical talking teddy bear how cute fast forward to when hes a 35 year old loser and is still his best friend only now turns out to be a raunchy lil teddy bear who smokes weed drink all that it doesnt match up mark walberg doesnt seem like the couch sitting loser hes portraito be mila kunis is his gf of 4 years and she has her life together but somehow they are a couple blah blah she wants more from him and their relationship but is bringing him down with his constant drinking smoking all that stupid stuff her boss joel mchale is constantly hitting on her but shes happy with her boyfriend they eventually break up she goes on a date with her boss so he can stop bothering her and then she still doesnt want him walberg ruins their date by performing a stupid song goes to have a serious chat with her trying to get them back together she meets him at a restaurant then their makeup gets interrupby giovani ribisi and his son who kidnap gets ripped apart at fenway park and dies in a sense kunis wishes upon a star and hes magically back to lifethe end i cant forget the mention all the jokes throughout the movie there was a scene where kunis comes home to find with hookers and theres a dump on the floor that was kind of funny i did laugh at that scene and the other kind of funny scene was when is working at a grocery store trying to flirt with a blonde girl so he takes a bottle of lotion and pretends to ejaculate now other than that all of the jokes revolved around family guy yeah we get it already you made family guy aside from the first 45 seasons isnt funny at all but was it really necessary to make your film the same exact thing as family guy the concept could have gone so much better the cast in the movie is great mark walberg mila kunis and joel mchale are extremely funny people and even giovanni ribisi but this movie does not in any way portray just how funny they are it was just an awful movie completely overraseth mcfarlene is just not funny he was at one point when family guy first came out it was hilarious just such a funny show but after season 5 its completely redundant and overused jokes dont do it im not one to be easily offended i even love toilet humorall that crap but this movies sucks you cant force offensive jokes down peoples throats like he does being that im not a huge mcfarlene fan i wasnt expecting to be blown away but after how many good reviews it got i was expecting something more not to sit there wondering what other movies i could leave and go seethis doesnt appeal to a certain age group because on one end you have twitterfacebook references kim karshain jokes and other celebrities from the past 5 years or so yet the movie focuses so much around flash gordon theres even a god awful airplane reference two completely different time periods not worth seeing whatsoever even if its free i found the other guys to be 10000000x better or no scratch that the happening which also stars mark walberg is funnier than this movie i hope in my lifetime seth mcfarlene never makes another movie again ever,comedy
i have actually signed up to this site purely to review this filmwhat the hell i am a huge fan of family guy and mark wahlberg but this was a huge mistake of a film all of the remotely funny parts are in the trailer so if you have seen the trailer dont bother watching the film i cannot believe they actually watched this at the end and thought hey this is great  i dont get who it was aimed at  it is not funny at all i never laughed once i have been looking forward to seeing this ever since i seen the trailer so i am hugely disappoinon a plus side i seen batman a few days ago go watch batman its frigging awesome ,comedy
i was surprised at how utterly awful was it was truly and absolutely terrible there was essentially no plot it was one gimmick about an animastuffed animal who curses a lot and spews a lot of raunchy sexually explicit comments itd be okay for a fiveminute sketch  even a recurring sketch on snl would have been okay  but there simply isnt enough to make a fulllength movie i am surprised that the consensus seems to be positive as this movie hovers at about a thirdgrade levelmoreover i was surprised at mark wahlberg and mila kunis  not to mention giovanni ribisi  all of whom have made quality substantive moviesshows in the past opto be in this crapfest farts jokes and a stuffed teddy bear having sex with a woman only go so far and at least insofar as this reviewer is concerned they dont go very far at allone of the worst movies ive seen in years,comedy
a pottymouthed bear is the pinnacle of funnythis is a pretty lousy bromance film the only difference is that one of the friends has been substituby a talking teddy bear this could have some interesting and funny consequence but the bear just behaves like a regular idiotic person i guess people nowadays consider funny a teddy bear talking dirty humping humans smoking pot and get wastedi could not smile once during this whole tragedy and the worst thing is that the film wants to be more than it should be and teach most of us men that we should not be immature and should face the responsibilities of life such as getting married and having a family because this is what makes us happy blahpirate it it is not worth the price of a ticket or rental,comedy
this is my first review so bear with me here no pun intendedi usually seem to have quite some overlap with roger ebert in terms of movie taste but what he saw in this i really dont understand for me it had a lot going for it i like mila kunis and mark wahlberg and the trailer looked promising but man was i disappoini found the dialogue incredibly crude and uninspired the plot moronic and predictable but worst of all it is a comedy or at least tries to be its not funny at all and i mean not at all i do enjoy silliness and brainless comedy and am not objecto explicit language whatsoever but again it should serve the intended purpose which is to entertain laughed until i cried in pineapple express for example i did not feel entertained by but rather bored and annoyed so in my opinion  epic fail,comedy
wow i really wanto like this and thought it had great potential but in the end it was a good idea very poorly execuit staroff poorly and id hoped it would improve but sadly it didnt there is the odd laugh but they can be counon the fingers of one handby far the worst aspect of this film is that it is racist sexist homophobic and more not only is it unfunny its also sickeningly offensive and quite possibly the worst film ive ever seen which is not a phrase id use lightly i like american dad and family guy but this was justwrong its effectively a feature length braindead fart joke  really not worth seeing,comedy
this is my first review on imdb and what made me write is that so far i could rely on users rating to help me choose which movie to watch until now i truly cant believe that this movie has 77 rating it is complete garbage its dumb its not funny what it is its lame vulgar notoriginal time wasting piece of snot a single line is funny and it looks like it was inspired by the worst parts of eddie murphys disastrous comedies from a new millenniumi would not talk much about the movie because theres nothing to say just avoid it and save your brain cells,comedy
simply the worst movie i have ever seen this will only appeal to the teen masses who think cuss words are the funniest things on earth or to iqs under 60 stupid plot i love mark walberg but he looks like milas father rather than her boyfriend and terrible acting make for the bomb of the century sorry to the idiot masses that have taken over the world hollywoods great directorsscreenwritersactors are turning over in their graves i cant believe a great actors like mark wahlberg and giovanni ribisi stooped to this crap after all the good work they have done the only bright point to the whole movie is that mila looks fantastic,comedy
im confused i thought a 73 rating on imdb meant a film might not be everyones bag but it would definitely not be a stinker this film is not funny its not clever its not interesting and the acting is poor i love american dad and i like family guy but every so often there will be a joke that isnt a joke i can only conclude that these must be seth macfarlanes contributions to the scripts because is full of them as ive already said i like family guy but it does seem like when the writers cant think of anything funny to say they just come up with something crude hateful or derogatoryoften about young women this film does exactly the same dont waste your time or money on this,comedy
this has got to be the worst movie ive ever seen it is extremely offensive and disgusting undoubtedly the product of a very sick mind ive never before seen so many people leave the movie theater in the middle of the show if you hear laughing during this movie people are probably just laughing in disbelief at why theyre still torturing themselves when i left the movie theater i was too shocked to demand my money back but im still thinking about going back and demanding a refund i cannot comprehend how any reputable movie theater could allow this to be played dont watch it boycott movie theaters that play this dont watch any other movies by the same director or producer or with actors that have participain this filth,comedy
the whole movie only have 2 good jokes and makes you laugh like 30 secondevery body clever enough to eat and poop can write thisit was a waste of timeand 1 of the funny part of movie wasnt even relato movieeverybody with money making movie these dayswhy the  i cant write a short reviewim gonna make it bend and break it sent you to me without wings say a prayer but let the good times roll in case god doesnt show let the good times roll let the good times roll,comedy
not sure what funny farm some of the reviewers come from but to say the movie is a laugh a minute is really stretching the imagination one minute of laughs during the whole movie would also not be an accurate summary yes i may have smiled a couple times when the bear delivers some rude and crude lines but i think that was more the fact that it was a bear saying it mark wahlberg was ok but i personally think he should stick to action movies and do what he does best the novelty of the walking talking bear wore off after 5 minutes i am so glad i didnt pay money to watch this movie cos i would have been undergoing treatment for severe depression otherwise if you really must see this movie i suggest watching a trailer on youtube or somewhere online and that will no doubt show all the best parts of the movie and save you having to sit through the whole thing,comedy
first of all i absolutely despise family guy and its cheap humour and i might be a little biased but i did give this movie a fair chance i didnt laugh once douche macfarlane is both a terrible writer and voice actor the story could be told in 15 minutes but is stretched out to 106 boring dreadful minutes even in this one douche macfarlane cant resist to hit people in the face with his annoying antireligious propaganda hes such a liberal selfabsorbed arrogant douche he doesnt realise hes not funny at all pot smoking might be funny for 15year old teenager and people who have never smoked pot but when you are past that phase its just annoying other jokes are a prostitute craps on the floor how funny the bear has sex with a trailer trash chick and when he does something wrong at his job he always gets promowell isnt that just hilarious dear douche macfarlane please retire from the entertainment business when i see your stuff on tv or in the theater it always reminds me of that billy madison speech everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it i award you no points and may god have mercy on your soul,comedy
 200 farts  a car chase utterly woeful 110 meant to watch it last night but got too late ended up flicking through to find the confessions of plumbers mate  driving insructor on movies 24 dreadful films as bad as you can get and the imdb ratings of 25 10 is generous but was keeping an eye out for robert lindsay elaine paige and bigginsthe single one thing you take for granwhen you watch a film  a british 70s tawdry sex comedy was the previous flick youve seen 24 hours earlier is that its some sort of improvement this had the unique achievement of being even worseits just truly woeful i cannot overemphasise just how dreadful this film is  i grew up through the 80s and loved them the supposed jokes and i use the term extremely loosely are futile just farts fcks  wank1ng characters completely uninteresting and who you never give a toss about  little if any plottwo or three scenes are so cringingly bad you wonder how they ever were even suggesthe restaurant scene where he brushes away a fart and the three businessman create a fuss must have been penned by a five year old the flash gordon scenes were dreadful the entire kidnapping plot line and the dad  child should have been removed completelywahlberg said he wished he got teddy ruxpin for christmas instead so do i id happily have watched that  spared me the 100 minutes lost watching this cringingly amateurish painful driveleasily in the worst 10 of my 800 ranked films and beneath robin askwith  his chums and doesnt deserve the 110,comedy
there are no spoilers here because there is nothing contained within the confines of this motion picture really worth typing out i find it increasingly disappointing as a human being that people fall for such worthless low life gimmicky humour oh wow look a teddy is smoking weed being radically racistotherthingssimilartoracism and ignorant haha oh what a guy that is funny there is nothing remotely adult it is basically a movie for young teens who are too blind to see that swearing and insensitivity are not the cake for humour only the icing and creative about this movie sure there is a valid love story about needing to grow up but thats a thin cover that leaks smell on a pot of st humour in general may be immature but there is a step between intelligent immature humour and frankly lame childlike immature humour where if you insert enough insensitive and inappropriate material into a film the creators assume people are dumb enough to clap their hands together and giggle like a baby which we obviously are because this movie got a decent rating i think ill stick to comidians who have real wit and something worthwhile to get laughs about not impressed goodbye standards welcome worthless rubbish here take my money,comedy
i lasabout 30 minutes until i hard to turn this garbage off i love shows like family guy tim and eric aqua teen its always sunny this humor is for retarded people or something ahhahahahah look a talking bear that smokes weed and buys hookers hahahah so funny no mila kunis is the worst actress ive ever seen in my life with her scratchy annoying voice and fakeness i dont know if the movie got any better but i could not stand to watch any more i am so glad i downloaded it off icefilms and didnt spend a dime on it what a piece of garbage anyone that finds this garbage entertaining is either on a massive amount of a hallucinagenic drug or has had a lobotomy at one point of their life and maybe if you are under 10 years old you might have liked it also people must be retarded or something,comedy
is director seth mcfarlanes first feature film now i think mcfarlane is a funny guy his massively popular tv show family guy was at one time the single funniest show on television i am a true fan of mcfarlanes brand of irreverent humor but somehow his first film is almost 100 devoid of laughs is about a lazy stoner played by mark wahlberg and his talking sentient teddy bear voiced by mcfarlane in his peter griffin accent the majority of the movie sees the two of them engaging in all sorts of devious behavior they smoke pot they pick up hookers and they party hard that description seems to warrant at the very least a handful of good laughs especially with mcfarlane running the show however mcfarlane completely botches the humor in this movie for example an early gag shows the two friends using a bong you would assume thats just the setup to the joke nope that is the joke they smoke pot isnt that funny there are so many of these instances where were asked to laugh at the premise alone the idea of a vulgar teddy bear is only so funny and to hang the entire movie on that premise alone is foolish i dont think a foulmouthed teddy bear is funny if you dont either then offers nothing to youwhen the jokes dont simply fail they fall into the raunchy shock humor trap himself is incredibly crude and yet his vulgarity is not complemenby any type of actual comedy hes raunchy for the sake of raunchiness a popular segment the thunderbuddies song is not clever or funny in any way it just has a ton of indecent language so people will laugh at it right judging by its popularity i guess thats the case but come on are people that easily tickled maybe im just a square but i need more than swear words to make me laugh i need wit all of these comedic failures would sink this movie on their own but the movie has another glaring issuethe second half or so of is when mcfarlane just gives up on the idea of making a comedy the story of a crazed fanatic who attempts to steal takes center stage and the movie becomes a straightforward chase picture the jokes stop falling flat but only because they stop showing up at all the conflict itself is not at all interesting and it is totally pointless i dont go to comedies for action or drama i go to laugh on that front is a failurei had one or two laughs during i can do better than that with any single episode of family guy and id save myself a precious hour of life is unfunny throughout and the second half is totally misguided the movie is a nasty extremely unpleasant misfire i like seth mcfarlane but i hate ted16100,comedy
i barely laughed at this movie  on my first attempt to watch it  i stopped at 15 minutes  at second attempt i managed to watch this but i realized i spend 2 hours for no reason at all there is a bunch of good comedies out there and this one is not one of them the jokes are plain awfulthe acting is flat and this sums up to a movie that is not making up for the time spent in it  i wonder why this movie has so high ratings  if you are reading this  then spend some time to browse the reviews and pay attention to the ones that rathe movie low  you are rewarded for not watching this one  this is not a comedydefinitely not worth it ,comedy
i came into this movie with high expectations i have been a big fan of family guy for years now and i couldnt wait to see this when it came out on dvd i ended up paying about 14 for it when it came out you can actually get it for about 5 now and watched it straight after my purchaseso basically its about some teddy bear seth macfarlane that comes to life smokes a lot of marijuana as he ages has a best friend called john mark wahlberg and john has a girlfriend called lori mila kunis some st happens with john and loris relationship she wants to get married etc and fat teddy gets in the waythen the reincarnation of jimmy savile comes stalks gets ripped in half and diesdu du duuuuuuuuuujohn then wishes for back and he comes back to lifenow my friends had seen this film and told me repeatedly that it was to quote them teh funniezt film evar1 sorry to the fans of the movie but it really really wasnt funny however if you would enjoy a whole hour and a half of jokes about drugs sex and farts then i would highly recommend iti am only giving it a four due to the fact that despite the constant unfunniness and fart jokes it was actually quite sweet,comedy
hey just to tell you my opinion about first i would like seth macfarlane to stick his fingers up his and his homosexual dog with his stinky fingers sorry guy just a joke what a big laugh what an amazing i got inspired by this peace of funny movie a nice story to tell and well done what a shame that 50 percent of the dialogs in this movie are about all the funny words i wanto use are prohibiby imdb sorry poor american humor what a waste of time i cant understand why good actors play in a movie like that and how this movie got selecfor awards good advice if you want to see this movie switch of the sound is all about excrement,comedy
i dont get it whats funny about a teddy bear misbehaving or am i not the target group being 36 certain teenagers may find this kind of pointless movie funny with sexist jokes sexy women and well thats it i thought wed seen enough of these kind of movies with 30 plus men not willing to grow up and having to make a choice between friendsa friend and a woman perhaps its an american thing but i find it totally impossible to relate to these kind of choices in real life being a woman between a partner and friends most people i know including myself have both friends and partners and nor can i relate to 35 plus men behaving like the main character unless they are totally losers there seems to be no point with having a teddy bear as a friend a part from its ok to cuddle each other in a boyish way obviously there just had to be a fart sound to make it ok to stay close when thunder comes along its sad and i found it painful to watch as i kind waifor the real plot and some more action to come along which just didnt happen i am glad i renjust it on dvd,comedy
this infamy begins with the presentation of john bennett a child who has trouble integrating into a group of friends or at school things are not so good being a mockery to all he receives by christmas from his parents a teddy bear one night he puts a desire that his toy to become alive his dream is fulfilled he wakes up next morning with a bear very much alive years went by and john is now 35 years old has a beautiful girlfriend by four years and of course his friend who made a pact with how they will be friends for life john uses to smoke the bong with him be lazy on the couch watching tv shows swear and drink beer after beer seeing that his friend has not matured and not behave as an adult man she gives him an ultimatum to get rid of for them to see their life and threatens to leave him if not then she will be the one to go and will end their relation just because some obsessed fans of and happenings that they will pass he will make lori to change its mind about himhonestly when i saw the scenes from the beginning when john was a child i was ready to give this movie a high note but when john was on the couch and talked with in the first 5 minutes made me change my mind and give it the lowest grade and nothing of what would have happened in the rest of the film would make me change my mind again i can not believe this bs has a note so high what happens to you people what if this film will be watched by a child what will learn from it rather remain a cloth with cotton inside i believe it was best for everyonerather than look at this better get out to the park for a walk look around and the result will be much better health and freshair instead of this dirt,comedy
not sure may be my first review easily one of the worst movies ive seen in the past few years crude lewd butt zero humor get the butt hilarious i know just like the movie potty humor at its zenith or nadir take your pick stinks like day old whatever now to finish up the ten lines oh yeah i have done this before and had the same problem just hoping it was a more positive reviewbetter movie so ill be more positive catch the intouchables or a late quartet or the perks of being a wallflower or django or go for a bike ride hold your breath write a letter to someone anyone strike up a conversation with a stranger or not a stranger its all good and so much better than the  called ted,comedy
i dont normally write reviews here and this is actually the first review i have written and ive only written it so i could vent on how absolutely horrendous this garbage is i wont go into the why this movie sucks just trust me on this it sucks please save your time and dont watch this garbage it is absolutely not funny i have no idea how it made so much money everything is wrong with this movie just thinking about it and i feel like making the directors producers etc sit through a 24 hour marathon of watching this film they would either realize how crappy this is or would end up slitting their throats preferably the ladder since they knew well enough the garbage they had creabefore it was released into theaters,comedy
i watched this movie after i saw the rating on imdb  i must say i am thoroughly disappoinwith the movie it makes no sense and even if the fantasy could be imagined the plot and story was more or less same to many other romantic movies only mila kunis was worth watching in this the teddy bear speaking looks hilarious and miles away from making some sense i was really bored watching itthe genre is lisas comedy which is more hilarious than the actual scenes in this movie it is not a comedy folks so watch this at your own periloverall i should say  please dont waste your time watching this movie,comedy
i am sorry imdb i hope i will not be considered to have spoiled the movie with my title but i admit i may have because the whole thing is laced with stupid jokes about jews blacks women etc no i did not like it for this reason and for many others the writing is awful the plot is ridiculous and it is a perfect waste of talent on the screen you see when a movie wants to make a completely unbelievable plot credible it has to make the audience play along this one fails and i cannot believe that this movie has as im preparing this review a score of 71 on imdb it cant be true meanwhile admission with tina fay gets a 55 i do not say admission should be a 7 but at least a 65 anyway i really want to underline the fact that even if a jewish person makes a joke about jewish people i will not find it funny i have too much respect for humanity to play along with this unacceptable way of trying to make a buck,comedy
dont walk away run bad just does not begin to describe i am only sorry i could not rate this with a negative number i must have 10 lines to post how many ways to you say bad very disappointhat the advertising for this was great if they had invesas much time into the writing as they did in the marketing it might have helped just be know you could loose iq points watching this bad bad bad            ,comedy
why is it that when great actors such as seth wahlberg kunis etc do well they have to turn around a put together a totally trash movie they cant be hard up for good roles i expecwith this cast and the subject of the bear this could be one of those really great funny comedies believe me anyone that spends a dime to see this will be totally disappoinsure it is rar for crude humor and sexual content but that aside it is totally stupidthere is no other way to put the concept of this joke my wife and i just continued watching figuring surely this has to take a turn and actually turn into something worthwhile the further we got into it we found ourselves doing other things but yet keeping the movie on just in case it turned into something worthwhile there worth several worthwhile funny parts but the bottom line is this movie has moved into my top 5 of all time worst movies ever made,comedy
this movie promotes drug use and alcohol the viewer is supposed to laugh on every profanity phrase when you use profanity it must be good it must be cheerful it must be rare and smart but this movie is depressing like any movie about drug abuse i can not say anything bad about the actors the idea itself and the context is very depressing it would be impossible for me to watch this movie second timei can not understand why this movie received 73 points here it is very hard now to find a good movie the 80s were golden age for american movies now you have to dig through at least 10 movies to find a good one,comedy
i am a huge fan of seth mcfarlane and his brilliant shows family guy and american dad i couldnt be more excifor this film to come out every time the commercial came on i glued my eyes to the tv unfortunately that may have hyped it up too much for me it was a funny film with good jokes and a simple story line but i think my head got the best of me making me think it was going to be one of the funniest movies id ever seen the commercials stole all the really good jokes as it always seems to do however i do hope seth mcfarlane decides to make another film hes a true comic talent who isnt afraid to take some risks think about it mark wahlberg staring in a comedy about a man whos best friends with a drugged out foul mouthed teddy bear easily couldve been a disaster but it wasnt it was enjoyable and i wouldnt mind seeing it again,comedy
absolutely fantastic one of the best comedy movies ever yes it was vulgar very dirty humor and features drug use but what do you expect you should expect this if youve ever seen family guy obviously this isnt for the tea party crowdthis movie was so funny i nearly cried from laughing so hard if you go to see this movie take your sense of humor and prepare yourself for politically incorrect jokes there are some pretty funny cameo appearances as well i saw this movie overseas and its funny to see people from another language and culture laugh so hard at american humor,comedy
no matter how big a splash you make in this world whether youre corey feldman frankie muniz justin bieber or a talking teddy bear eventually nobody caressince 1999 seth macfarlane has made a name for himself in television thanks to the success of family guy hes also the man responsible for other successful animaseries such as american dad and the cleveland show hes not only the creator of these shows he also voices many of the characters as well in his first venture into live action film he also voices the star of the movie a teddy bear that magically comes to life after a lonely boy makes a wish is an rracomedy due to the fact that he happens to be very vulgar and getting stoned all the time the film has had huge box office success in the unistaand i was expecting to be hilarious but i guess my expectations were a little too high because i wasnt blown away by this movie there were some funny scenes but for the most part the film felt like an average comedy and it wasnt what i was hoping for 2012 has failed to deliver a successful comedy and for now 21 jump street reigns as the best one in my opinion is full of irreverent humor but its repetitive and you have the usual sexual drug and poop jokes i couldnt find much originality to it but i do have to say some of the scenes did work thanks to and his best friend played by mark wahlberg whom ive always said is great in comedies this is a pretty formulaic buddy comedy where you have the typical two slacker best friends and a girl who gets in the way of their friendship and wants them to mature the only difference is that this time around one of them is a talking teddy bear the film begins with a narration voiced by patrick stewart about the story of lonely boy who gets his wish one christmas morning when he asks for his teddy bear to become his best friend when the teddy comes to life john bennett played by mark wahlberg and the younger version played by bretton manley discovers that he has found his best friend who he names voiced by seth macfarlane becomes an instant celebrity as he is all over the news and is invito all kind of talk shows changes young johns life for the better the film then jumps to the present day where both have grown into adults john is now 35 and has a healthy relationship with lori mila kunis theyve been dating for four years now is still living with john and has also grown up in the same way that his human buddy did john and like to spend time getting high together and talking about girls drugs and flash gordon everything seems to be going well for the trio until lori gives john an ultimatum its or her lori realizes that is keeping john from realizing his full potential since theyre always getting stoned and john is always late to work john realizes that he has to make an important decision if he wants to save his relationship with lori and the movie moves along from here one of the things the film explores well is the transition from child to adulthood we dont only see john grow up but his teddy bear as well now being an adult doesnt mean youre mature and john and are proof of that they are irresponsible and practically only care about getting high all the time they both are very nice people but really immature thats what drives lori crazy but the good thing about is that these characters arent stereotypical lori isnt a mean person who wants to separate the two best friends but rather wants them to take responsibilities as adults also has character development and despite the fact that hes very inappropriate he also has a big heart and wished the best fro john and lori this isnt your typical face off between best friend and girlfriend i was pleased with that aspect of the film another thing that worked really well for me in this movie was all the references to different films especially flash gordon and top gun and jokes about them as a film lover you always enjoy those small references and gags some of the cameos were also pretty funny and highlights of the film what i didnt like as much was the fact that some of the sexual and drug humor got a little bit repetitive and old there were also several poop and fart jokes which are always a little repetitive in these buddy comedies is still a funny film but just not the hilarious movie i was hoping forhttpestebueno10blogspotcom,comedy
honestly this is such utter trash that i had to bang my fist against my head when i stopped watching it about 30 minutes in and ask myself why i thought it was a good idea to carry on past the first 10 seth macfarlane does nothing here but throw in a bunch of unfunny clichs and a cast that will bring in an audience i have nothing against the man family guy is genius and this is a quick and easy way to make money that is all the acting is terrible each scene is forced and the jokes make me want to peel my eyes outwatch the first 2 minutes  they are gold  and please just turn it off,comedy
if fart jokes and seeing a teddy bear getting stoned keep you entertained for an hour and a half youll love this film i went with my son who loves family guy and he didnt find it funny either  never hear a cinema so quiet for a comedy the basic premise is that a bear acts like a dysfunctional adult compensating for his shortcomings by drinking smoking dope being promiscuous and swearing a lot it didnt really provide a strong enough idea for a whole movie there are also a lot of in jokes about american tv people films and flash gordon mostly lost on us i think the writers probably locked themselves in a room got off their heads found each other really entertaining and wrote it up as a script,comedy
not as funny as i thought it would be the humor isnt consistent with that of what seth macfarlane has been doing on family guy for years yet i get this sense that this movie was trying hard to be like family guy this is where i got turned off there wasnt anything original there may be a few good and funny moments here and there but at the end it just didnt all fit well i was a little disappoinby the ending because it left me feeling that there might be a sequel god i hope not mila kunis played her role very well and i do have to say that this is a rather ok performance for wahlberg overall its not worth the allottime its disappointing you could be watching something else there are plenty of funnier movies released recently thatd be more worth your time,comedy
is trash i could only stand to watch the first 15 minutes and even that felt like grey matter was being sucked out of my head there are some genuinely funny raunchy comedies from time to time these daysbut the writing in this movie went beyond silly and inane and then tried to make up for it by trying to conceal itself behind a mountain of prurient crude stands as conspicuous embarrassment to its screenplay creators and the universe needs to be balanced by at least 10 quality counter comedies or at least a public apology to moviegoers in all places past present and future yes this show was that bad test it talk to someone that has seen it but make sure they are not surrounded by others lest the pubescent peer pressure forces an insincere response i love movies all types this movie threatens not only the genre but probably the credibility of those aspiring to its originality heaven help us if this is the future of edgy comedy,comedy
funnyat first i heard many good things i watched it and initially agreed then a what happened moment came over me and ruined the entire absurd plot i think the real disappointment was that as in so many other movies the idea seemed original but then the formula kicks in admittedly not heavily but enough it seems to be part of the steady downhill slide of sms work but hey at least seth rogan wasnt the star when i approached those friends that told me how great this film was and conveyed my disappointment they agreed once again this seems to be a film that you feel obligato like i didnt but i still recommend it because it is funny at times as far as the high ratings on imdb i have to ask really,comedy
i kept hearing how awesome this movie is from my bffs and then i saw it in a shop and i said ok im gonna buy it that was one of the biggest mistakes i have ever made i dont even know where to begin high teddy bears racism  on the floor its basically about a total loner who hangs out with his talking teddy bear at 35 and they get high and drunk all the time then his girlfriend makes him choose between the teddy bear and her and then the teddy bear gets kidnapped it sounds is so ridiculous if you like things like this i suppose you will like it but if you have sense and a brain you will be scarred in a bad way seriously i dont recommend this it is not funny,comedy
i wont spend more than three minutes writing about this awful piece of immature vulgar and childish trash i couldnt watch it to the end i stopped about 45 minutes in i found this even slightly insulting and humiliating  am i supposed to find this funny and entertaining does mr mcfarlane think im that moronic and stupid is that what we have become finding this idiotic pile of garbage remotely interesting entertaining or funny makes me feel very sad about the times we live in sad to the point where i dont want to have kids to spare them the shame of living in a world this mediocre and vile what ever happened to entertainment industry how low can we sink needless to say this film bombed in europe and that only proves one point  american standards are now entangled in the sludgy depths of stupidity and vulgarity absolutely awful enjoying this if you are over 12 years of age should set off all kind of alarms grow up mcfarlane your dick and fart jokes amuse no one except yourself and the thousands of brain damaged idiots that gave this absurdity more than two points,comedy
i couldnt get myself to like i just didnt find the affable fuzzball endearing the thick east coast accent with dirty language and antics could only do so much until it grew thin for me too bad the movie had to end in hopeless predictability because i thought the movie would have engendered more meaning with his passing the couple could have startheir new lives without having to be obstrucby this mans childhood protgbuddy films can be fun but all this relationship offers is crass fun partying and raunchy escapades the cameo of sam j jones flash gordon was novel and helped carry this threadbare plot along but you know a movie is in trouble when they have to rely on trashing other actors,comedy
i dont normally like this sort of film being a middleaged middleclass englishman but being stuck in a distant city with an evening to kill i thought why not i found myself pleasantly surprised on a scale where anything with will ferrell being 1 and big bang theory being 10 this easily ranks 9 the humour is universal enough to travel across the atlantic and in between the gags there are real questions about what makes a man more than just a big kid and how much does love overrule loyaltythe cgi and the actors eyelines are faultless the use of stuffed toys and graphics not always being obvious i loved many of the gags and being of a certain age i so identified with the flash gordon motif running through the filmand it is such an original idea what if a teddy bear really did come alive the contradiction of teds childish appearance with a thirtysomething jaded crude personality gave an added punch to the humour and himself was not just a cartoon but showed real pathos and feeling even though he was a womanising dopeheadi loved it and may even try to persuade er indoors to come see it with me a second time when i get home,comedy
its not a big deal but is there anybody still believes the muslims do the eleventh september thing i think it was a nice film till teddy screw up the whole film with his sayings to the semi muslim girl the girl dont say anything to him for some reason id love to give ten stars but it doesnt deserve itapparently this film shows us that it is 2012 but still there are people who dont know anything about muslims except those the film is quite fiction but it is more realist than other fiction films i hope you all will understand what speculations made upi write this review because to tell you that we are not enemies in my opinion,comedy
i didnt expect much from this movie seeing as it was made by seth macfarlene who makes one of my least favorite tv shows but coming out of this movie i was actually disappoinnot only is the comedy stupid and depends on the concept of lol its a teddy bear that swears and says wacky things but the story is terrible as well it seems reminiscent of family guy in where its just some guys getting in silly situations for the lolz the only connection in the whole thing is the the main character needs to make sure that he doesnt make his girlfriend mad oh also hes a wimp haha the whole thing of wishing on a star is the most disgusting thing i have seen in a movie in a long time this movie is in my bottom ten of movies i would rather watch joe dirt 100 times in a row than see this movie one more time do not watch,comedy
the story has a good theme when we become adults we cant always hang on to the things we cherish as we move forward in lifethat being said the movie was ruined by the foul language this would have been a wonderful film for younger children but the profanity ruined all thatbeating up jewish kids in massachusetts on christmas where is the humor in this isnt this holiday advocating good will to all peoplemila kunis who was so good in black swan and was robbed of a supporting oscar nomination deserves better material than thismark wahlberg is effective especially with that great boston accent of hisas for he might represent the modern day person but he isnt exactly a renaissance man,comedy
this is proof positive that what works in cartoons doesnt translate well to live action in cartoons we dont have the real world so the stupid humor and simple bodilyfunction jokes work to a large extent translate that same humor to a live action movie and it really hits you how dumb and puerile it isfor a start is inherently unlikeable as a character to make matters worse wahlbergs character is equally hard to empathise with he spends his days smoking pot with and watching old movies both are horribly selfishas an example of the sort of humor that you are supposed to find funny i give you this upon returning home  to her apartment no less  kunis character finds doing drugs with four prostitutes that isnt the funny part the supposed humor comes from the fact that for a dare one of the hookers has taken a dump on the floor cue lots of laughter right no oh well then you must not find it funny eitherthis is the kind of humor throughout fart and knob jokes drugrelamirth and other terribly unfunny lines i guess when you write star and direct a film you can start to believe your own press but this is ridiculousmcfarlane should stick to cartoons at the very least he could have tried to make not sound exactly like peter griffin they even crack a joke about it at one point ha ha the basic plot is excruciatingly obvious from the start and means you can leave within twenty minutes and know exactly what will happen in the movie i chuckled a few times but is far far far from funny most of the time any attempts at humor fall flat and sometimes the humor is just plain offensiveis a movie aimed a teens and pretty juvenile and immature teens at that it falls neatly into line behind such other recent comedy classics as your highness and really makes you wonder how films like this can get greenlit by studios is there nothing more worthy to make into a film summary dont believe the hype its overlong tedious unfunny and a waste of two hours is charmless and boring ive had more fun sat staring at a dead fly in a dentists waiting room for thirty minutes seriously give it a miss,comedy
i couldnt even watch this travesty of a film the jokes were stupid and nowhere near clever nothing about this was witty this film reminds me of the movie idiocracy in that it is made for people who live in that future completely stupid and happy with it i turned this movie off because i didnt laugh not even once i dont think seth mcfarlane is funny at all i dont know how people reviewed this movie with any positivism the acting was bad the plot was dumb it was just a completely nonnecessary film and i cringe whenever someone references it and expects me to laugh along with jokes a 10 year old boy would make unless you are a preteenteen boy or have the mentality of one you wont enjoy this movie even my boyfriend who loves bad movies for whatever reason agreed in turning this movie off so very bad,comedy
doesnt every child want their stuffed animals to come to life and talk in fact wasnt that the same idea which made toy story wildly successful for a premise with endless potential directorwriteractor seth mcfarlane does not deliver a story worth watching once let alone twice has received more hype than perhaps any other comedy in the last ten years but has let me down the mostthe humor is crude offensive and leaves me depressed and hopeless in many ways the film is trying harder than it should have to to get a laugh i would have liked to be in the room when the writers decided i have a good idea lets make a tv fall on a guys crotch and stab a knife into another guys hand thatll be funny though in many ways this kind of so called humor is to be expecof the creator of family guy which in itself is tasteless i expecmore of marc wahlburg and mila kunis both actors have previously been very creditable in dramas wahburg in the fighter and kunis in black swan and both had supporting roles which were actually funny in tina fey and steve carells date night i kept watching with the hope of the end holding a redeeming quality but it only got worse lets just say the best part of the movie was when the credits rolled and i could finally turn it off i must thank mcfarlane for one thing i now have a sure fire way of telling if a man is worth dating by asking a single question did you enjoy if the answer is yes he is likely not worth my timethe idea of a sequel makes me weep for the movie industry americas intelligence and the fact the future generation will one day be leading this country i mean what are we really teaching our kids by portraying their beloved stuffed animals as unsympathetic sex obsessed and downright rude characters nothing worthwhile i can tell you that avoid this movie at all costs and for goodness sakes leave the kids at home watching something innocent and actually enjoyable,comedy
in short the charming first five minutes are charming it then quickly turns into a predictable bromanceromance movie by the end its a clichd unfunny below than average hollywood film lazy jokes boring visuals and a crude but badly execusense of humorbtw the ambiance mixing for teds voice is sometimes way off too echoed  too flatif you wanna mix satirical and flatulent comedy right take pointers from south parkbecause its a bad movie they are naturally doing a sequel what a waste of time and money,comedy
i can not tell you how much i loathed this movie it wasnt funny it was vile the plot was obvious to be fair the acting was good and the lines delivered as they should there was nothing wrong with the cinematography the editing the sound it was simply not my movie it was boorish vulgar toilet attemphumor i had the displeasure of watching this in japan where they do not speak english well enough to understand the jokes have no hope of understanding the references and imagine america is a land of hookers and stoners i just cant tell you too many times that i hathis movie,comedy
story and plot had a lot of potential and although i am not a big family guy fan i have found seth mcfarlane to have some bright spots that are really funny in his writing not sure what his obsession is with oldtyme showtunes but i digressthis film shows everything that is wrong with the hollywood hype machine  the poison of writersdirectors thinking something is funny just because of the premise or their brand of shtick thats become popular this movie is not that funny its just the same old jokes that try too hard to push the envelope with material we have simply just seen way too much especially from mcfarlane  his barrage of cartoons etchad some funny moments but instead of taking any chances with making a unique story it ends up doing the same adam sandler nonsense of copying every other trashy romcom formula clich in the bookthe special effects were good some of the jokes were clever but if they wasa great opportunity to make something different here not sure why this movie is as overraas avengers but i guess this is what we settle for these days only acting worth mentioning was the female leadother than that it is the typical  expeccookiecutter performances by nonfunny male leadsblah hollywood blah,comedy
my friends told me that was an incredibly funny movie so i bought it yesterday  and now i just feel like i flushed those money into the toilet this is like one of the worst movies i have ever watched its just horrible its not at all funny i didnt laugh a single time its just disgusting vulgar and horribleim lacking words but i can simply say that i agree 100 with the negative reviews on this site wow its a horrible movie dont watch it and dont even think about buying it i considered giving my teddvd to a thrift store  but then i thought again noi will not be the one who makes someone else watch such a lousy pervert movie so its going directly into the trash can now my goodness,comedy
i wanto like this movie a whole lot more than i did sure im partly killing time before beasts of the southern wild reaches the suburbs but i used to be a family guy fan and i dont mind some crude cinematic humor when its broiling out trust me on this front more than delivers fart jokes check fat kid jokes check serious question did seth macfarlane get beat up a lot when he was young by a fat kid breaking the fourth wall check random cruel observations about washed up media stars check another question does seth macfarlane get the irony of casting not one but two former child stars in this movie probably plot a friendless youngster in a boston suburb gets a teddy bear for christmas and makes a wish that the bear will become real because there is no magic stronger than the love between a kid and his stuffed pal this actually happens the kid grows up to be john mark wahlberg and the bear grows up to be a potsmoking call girl courting potty mouthed guy whos still best friends forever and roomies with his pal john is a slacker but hes got a good heart and has been dating lori mila kunis for four years lori who wants to get married gives john an ultimatum its either her or meanwhile is in danger of a sort from a stalker giovanni ribisi who wants to purchase for his spoiled sonhas some hysterical moments but the humor is uneven when is funny its very very funny when its not it falls flat its the kind of movie that turns sentimental and mushy at the end which doesnt really go with the rest of the overthetop crude scenes i did enjoy seeing the boston landmarks though joel mchale also did a superb job as kunis slimy boss rex,comedy
not what i expec most of the best parts were  go fiqure the previews felt myself and others around us trying to laugh  just wasnt happening  whether it was chemistry  confusion of blending a romantic comedy with fg material  the forcing of gay jokes  and im straight  not sure  this humor better in smaller segments  i lost interest not to say i didnt like the characters  have seen most of wahlbergs films and enjoy his dry sense of humor  this film just seemed awkward and how far can you ride the talking bear  that cusses  smokes dope  wrecks cars  gets supermodels  aka hookers drinks buds fights reasons  argues and does it throughout the movie  just got stale  go see it yourself  you be the judge,comedy
i couldnt agree more about this film being overraim a huge fan of seth macfarlane but i get more chuckles in 20 minutes of family guy than i did from this entire movie if it werent for the teddy bear with the foul language and sick sense of humor which i love it would be another boring guy in love pisses off girl and wins her back story seths humor is usually more thought provoking and no doubt stifled into mainstream slapstick here by the film studio andor other powers that be i wasnt expecting too much from mark wahlberg since in my opinion he is a very onedimensional actor who happens to be cast in excellent roles i did however expect more from teddy who could have benefifrom more creative use of the cg technology and a little more tongueincheek humor as opposed to the gratuitous and crude slapstick doled out here the novelty of a foul mouthed teddy bear wore off for me within 20 minutes leaving nothing but an after school special caliber plot the fight scene between the teddy bear and wahlberg was pretty fing funny though,comedy
i thought id note so that you guysgals dont think im some sort of religious fanatic or someone whos easily offended  im neitherthis movie is awfulthe jokes arent funny i connecwith some of the 80s nostalgia early in the film and laughed at an early saturday night fever bit but for the most part awfulone of the worst movies ive seen in a whilei gave waiting a 72100 and office space showed that one of these novice directors from tv fame could deliver a comedic masterpiecegave that 95100  right there with swingers and anchorman as some of my favorite comedies of the last two decadeshas little to no comedic value there are two jokes in the film one is overregurgitause of the fbomb and the other is any poke at religion in either case the jokes arent funny its almost as if seth is making up for his censorship on television and sorry seth it comes of as you dont have anything betterfunnier to saythe film is quick to tell the audience about the heartfelt connection between its lead and his teddy bear but their love for one another isnt developed at all their only connection seems to be the desire to smoke pot something else i dont have a problem with or did at one time if you catch my drift either way those jokes arent funny eitheri spent the last two weeks stopping at nearly every rental machine in se tennessee to find this thing because it looked to be right up my alley i guess you could say i did have high expectations but anyone that thinks this film is anywhere close to its current rating must also be high which is fine but a lot of party animals think halfbaked is a masterpiece too actually halfbaked  52100 might be considered a masterpiece next to this piece of junki like the family guy but seth mcfarland has a real stinker here with seriously an average middleoftheroad adam sandler piece is exponentially betteri could have been at the bottom of a 12 pack of brewsky or at the end of a spliff and it wouldnt have made one bit of difference  other than the fact that i might not have to remember just how bad this movie wassave your money save your time41100if you want a good crude comedy go with waiting clerks or if youre looking for something out of the mainstream try the nobudget bindlestiffs because this movie is terrible,comedy
so was it worth my while investing 106 minutes of my life on this one i have to say on balance not really yes there are some wonderfully comic moments and smart oneliners in there but i did find it driffar too much from the sublime to the ridiculous also one minute is brian for family guy and the next he turns into peter griffin from the same show despite his denials i thought both mark wahlberg and mila kunis did a good job both of their characters were quite believable ultimately though i did find it lacked the one thing it so desperately needed heart still im sure the many devotees of family guy will love this one but for me sadly its a bit of a dudsteelmonsters verdict not recommended unless youre a really big fan of family guy in which case why havent you seen it yetmy score 5310you can find an expanded version of this review on my blog thoughts of a steelmonster,comedy
one of my friends got tickets for the movie so i had absolutely no idea what was going to be about then i saw seth macfarlanes name in the credits and i instantly knew what to expect even the opening scene had the audience laughingthe carefree weedsmoking teddy bear has been mark wahlbergs one and only friend from the age of 8 at 35 he is having trouble with his girlfriend mila kunis because of his immature behavior mostly because of his teddy bear as the movie progresses we realize that he must decide between his true love and his beloved teddythe jokes include the typical family guy sort of humor  ranging from crude and crass to seths favorite 80s cultural references family guy fans should enjoy a movie version of their favorite family the story line is almost too predictable but we almost forget about the story in the middle of all the humori recommend watching the movie with a few friends and have a nice laugh just like an episode of family guy oh and mila kunis is absolutely gorgeous and extremely lovable there you have one more reason to watch 7 on 10 for the constant humor and the ridiculously funny teddy but the extremely ordinary storyline,comedy
i went for the advanced screening and didnt expect that much from the movie i knew it would be a good comedy with r rajokes and didnt know that it would be emotional toomy wife almost starcrying in one scene and suddenly laughed like anything  story line is predictable but the main strength lies in dialog acting and screenplayi think people will enjoy this movie and i am already seeing after reading the others reviewi can only say that your money will not be waste and you will enjoy the movie,comedy
in boston the eightyear old lonely boy john bennett has no friends on the christmas day he wishes that his bear comes to life and a miracle happens and becomes his only friend twentyseven years later john bennett mark wahlberg is a pothead that works at a car rental and spends his idle time smoking pot and watching movies with he also has a girlfriend for four years lori collins mila kunis who has a great job loris boss rex joel mchale tries unsuccessfully to get into her pants one day john meets the weird donny giovanni ribisi that worships and wants to buy him for his son robert aedin mincks but john refuses the offer when lori puts john against the wall to stay with her john has to make a tough decisionis an unfunny and moronic comedy overrain imdb the stupid jokes may be suitable for young teenagers and john bannett and are not charismatic characters the plot is full of clichs and questionable humor and despite the good cast and cameos watching is a waste of time my vote is threetitle brazil o ursinho the little bear,comedy
im just forced to make this review because i want to warn people  if you like terance and philip humor  farts jokes  then go ahead if not then you are not going to like it writing the scenario took probably 30 minutes at best sure its  funny to see a bear talking like an old guy for 5 minutes more than that its boring you know what is going to happen and sure it does happen so called jokes are  well i didnt laugh a single timethe last 45 minutes are awfulwondering how long its gonna take to get to the happy end really a movie for children except you cant let a 8 years old child watch it because of so much insults and uses of drugs etc so its too childish and simple for adults and teens and not correct for children to watch avoid,comedy
have you ever wondered what peter griffin would sound like with a boston accent well the talking teddy bear is the answer in family guy creator seth macfarlanes directorial debut macfarlane provides the voice of in this raunchy comedy about a young boy who makes a christmas wish that brings his stuffed teddy bear to life but as the boy grows up so does jump forward twenty years to the story of a grown man balancing work a girlfriend and his best friend the teddy bearis raunchy vulgar crass and culturally relevant its a comedic styling much in the vein of family guy or any of macfarlanes other shows just pumped up with rrasteroids from the start with this films wacky premise we know that it doesnt take itself too seriously and is really only here to deliver the laughs its a fairly predictable film and its plot is very hollywoodized at times but its also pretty damn hilarious macfarlanes off brand humor is where this film is successful as one would expect however in about five or six years half the jokes in will no longer be relevant as there are a lot of pop culture references littered throughout this film that will mean nothing in only a few short yearsbut for now practically all of is absolutely hysterical its lots of foul language plenty of potty humor and a plethora of dirty sight gags that make tick also a fine helping of cameos keeps the humor fresh and increasingly hilarious whether or not it makes any sense at all sometimes its really just seth macfarlane showing off how far his hollywood star power tentacles can reach but none of it falls flat in fact very little of the humor in falls flat i really enjoyed this film its nothing more than another raunchy comedy but it certainly entertained me and what more need i ask for,comedy
i am sorry that i have to give a one but this movie is such a underachiever most boring and predictable plot and despite the rough language  which i am not offended by the plot plays out like a happy ever after fairy tale that was not even necessary this movie isnt for kids anyway i did not laugh a single time there are no funny situations or jokes i have expeca lot more from the creative maker of family guy is a cool individual but the makers failed to create an innovative personathe acting wasnt too bad but the cast was a bit off is mark wahlberg your typical loser guy who gets picked on they should have picked someone less muscular i can eventually understand if someone is giving 5 points but best movie 2012 seriously those remarks are faked by the production companies,comedy
i admit that the premise of is actually quite clever but the execution of it is horrible sure there are a handful of quite funny jokes in the film but when you weigh them up against the unfunny ones its quite hard to forget themthe large amount of popculture references in do not work and are not funny sure there are a lot more in family guy but they work because it is a cartoon which is not real any person who experiences real life can look at this film and think who says stuff like this it just distracme from the film whenever a character would say something pointless which happens a lotthe story is predictable and i dont understand who the films audience is it makes references to twitter and katy perry then makes flash gordon jokes throughout these things are from different generations so that prevents your audience from understanding half the jokes in the filmoverall a good premise is let down by poor writing avoid the hype,comedy
so its school holidays and i decide to go and see a preview screening of at 7pm the cinema is full and i am entirely surrounded by teenagers sucking furiously on their frozen cokes and jittering around in their seats as if they were under the influence of some extremely high uppers the movie begins yet the kids dont settle down at all now normally this would completely annoy the hell out of me and to some extent it did hence me still thinking about it now but it didnt take anything away from this farcical comedy written and direcby the very talenseth macfarlane voiced by macfarlane is absurdly hilarious with his crazy antics insane innuendos and the occasional racial slur it is hard not to laugh out loud this is all creaby the wonderful sound of seths voice i really dont think it would have worked half as well if they have of got someone else the rest of the cast bounce off him wonderfully mark wahlberg as teds best friend for life fits the bill perfectly and mila kunis is great as the girlfriend for me though giovanni ribisi when he arrives on screen plays creepy camp and evil all too well he is a joy to watch maybe joy is the wrong word herethis is an intelligent and very cleverly thought out comedy dont get me wrong i know the image of a little teddy using the f word and smoking dope continuously is going to be funny no matter what yet doesnt sound like it would have to be too clever the script is 10 out of 10 and this coupled with the perfect pace of the film means never a dull moment my problem with most comedies is they cant keep the laughs going for the full running time here the jokes are very witty insightful and out of the ordinary and stays that way for the full 106 minutes the fact that this movie is about a teddy bear whom magically comes to life and then seamlessly blends into day to day life for me has failure written all over it yet macfarlane creates a world where all this doesnt matter and the viewer takes the magic for granand goes along for the ride and the ride is most certainly worth the tripand lets not forget the animation never looks out of place the special effects are seamless even in high action fight scenes they dont miss a beatis one hilarious movie this for me is right up there with the best comedies of the past few years crude intelligent and totally entertaining httpwwwfilmnotioncomtedmoviereview,comedy
possibly the worst film of 2012 has to be that new mark walmart berg film where he has a mate thats a teddy bearwatched it last night and honestly its dreadful its as if its been made just for 13 year old boys eg its disgusting just for the sake of it almost as is common these days in a lot of yank films they feel they got to be as rude as they can be cause they cananother thing with film like this is the word that starts with a c and rhymes with hunt  ever since curb your enthusiasm spoofed it  its as if its now cool to slip it into there hey dude gross out drunk party filmsanyway getting off subject walberg cant do comedyhe is great in action gangster type film but comedy err no so folks save your money and dont bother with this crap,comedy
when i first saw this film and wrote up my original review of it on this site i only viewed it as a dumb unfunny comedy creaby seth macfarlane that i had an extreme hate for after so time passed i came to realize that my problems with came from more than just the fact that i did not find it to be all that funny to be fair i will say is one of seth macfarlanes better works easily surpassing his animatv shows family guy and the cleveland show but not reaching the level that american dad is atafter thinking about it a little i realized that my main problem with the film was not the humor as the first twenty minutes and the last thirty minutes had sufficient enough humor from me to warrant at least a positive view of the film the middle of the film is bogged down in so much of the humor style that macfarlane has become known for that i lost interest in the humor and moved my full attention on the plot which i had even less interest inthe plot of the film is not too original for a comedy film it is a typical romance versus bromance where johns mark wahlberg girlfriend lori mila kunis wants macfarlane to move out of the apartment in hopes that their relationship will become more mature does move out but john finds himself blowing off lori and other parts of his life to hang out with when john ditches a party thrown by loris boss joel mchale its loris last straw and she breaks up with john john with occasional help from tries to make up with lori and rekindle their relationshipthere were several problems i noticed with the middle chunk of the film when the comedy died down to almost nothing with a few chuckleworthy moments every now and then the biggest problem was that john and lori had no chemistry together i did not buy the fact that they were a couple and i could not muster an iota of investment to their story if the film had focused on john and trying to remain friends because of johns relationship with lori the film would have worked because the two had good chemistry i never felt like john and lori were emotionally connecon any level so i did not care if they got back together or notnext the film felt like an elongaepisode of family guy but with a beginning and an end that was at the very least a little funny the film was filled with pop cultural references and other comedy that macfarlane has become known for a really stupid plot line with bad attempts at drama and scenes that try to be emotional but are either ruined by trying to insert comedy or played for laughs the beginning of the film is not like this and the ending tones it down a little but for the most part the entire film is like thiswhile my opinion of has increased to a level where i can see what people find funny about it and why some do like it my opinion has not changed to the point where i actually like this movie it is still dumb and boring with nothing to care about complete with the usual junk that gets worked into macfarlanes work it had some fun moments and it shows that macfarlane can be funny but that is about it,comedy
oh seth seth seth poor seth macfarlane how conflicyou areyou can be an insanely hilarious guy your stars mark and mila can be as well they both funny and very personable and mila is seriously smokin ive worked with both and cant say a bad word about either ever it was my pleasure to work wthem to say the least and id be happy to do so again anytimefamily guy and your work on roasts etc is pricelesshowever wow you really shot yourself in the foot on this oneit does have some good laughs but overall it is as if you were trying to make two movies at once one a kidified pile of disneyish crap and the other an adult comedy sadly due to that conflict it ultimately fails miserably many of us had such high hopes for this movie and i cannot fault the cast but the screenplay creators  director dropped the ball on this one it could have been a true classic but instead is destined to be a dust collector in the bargain bini hate to say it but for seth macfarlane fans as well as fans of mark and mila skip it far too many will be bitterly disappointedoh and a fyi my wife and my brother in law also big fans of seth feel very much the same on this film,comedy
okay heres my reviewshahahahahahahahhai love youyes this movie is beyond funnyi have never wanto see a movie again so badlywhen was the last time you saw a movie that you could watch again not often is one badd boy teddy bear but his heart is pure the storyline is fun and exciting intelligent humour and great comebacks very different to the dumbhumor that ruled most jim carey moviesthis one had a lot of reallife issues in it mark w acts well as usual but is by far the real star here hope theres a part 2 to this anyways dont want to give away anything just go watch it and have fun,comedy
this movie could have been something i mean who hasnt had the wish talking to a teddy bear good work on the visual effectsunfortunately 1 this movie could have been direcby uwe boll without affecting the qualityunfortunately 2 the whole movie is killed by the pointless and excessive use of bad language strong language can make or break a really good sarcasm but in this movie everything breaks everything the first fifteen minutes i smiled all the way then the profanities entered and the smile turned into sighing same goes for family guyso face it seth mcfarlane is not funny at all,comedy
the blatant forks in the road are one thing i guess they had to give the main character some sort of internal conflict for the choices he makes however about halfway through the movie theres a party sequence and they do shots and then its hinthey do cocaine after all the dumb crap seth macfarlane hinat about what would happen to you if you tried mushrooms on family guy he has the nerve to show people using cocaine right after using alcohol one of the things they tried stressing in our minds in high school was to not mix the two because it is cardiotoxic as if people werent stupid enough other then that mark walberg gets kind of annoying when he openly decrys the cword all the tasteless things that go on and american people still think that is the worst word in the english language like if you shouit in a movie theatre people would gasp in horror and run out because there is absolutely no misandry men have to deal with that other people would find horrifying and traumatic,comedy
i wanto eat my own intestines of how bored i was i felt like i was gonna die during first half of the movie and then it begun to be worse hobbit is more interesting i guess never ever ever watch this movie its horriblei wanto eat my own intestines of how bored i was i felt like i was gonna die during first half of the movie and then it begun to be worse hobbit is more interesting i guess never ever ever watch this movie its horrible i wanto eat my own intestines of how bored i was i felt like i was gonna die during first half of the movie and then it begun to be worse hobbit is more interesting i guess never ever ever watch this movie its horriblei wanto eat my own intestines of how bored i was i felt like i was gonna die during first half of the movie and then it begun to be worse hobbit is more interesting i guess never ever ever watch this movie its horrible,comedy
just saw this on an insomniac sunday morning last day of a three day free hbo weekend watched over half of it before mercifully falling asleep this movie sucked bit blew inhaled and nineteen other oral sex metaphors i am too tired to reach for amazingly stupid poorly written not funny incoherent i did like the idea that briefly teds incredible story was big news and he became a minor celebrity but they really went nowhere with that teds being a living toy ceased being relevant to the plot we could have been watching damon and afleck running around southey even the prologue and patrick stewarts narration falls completely flat it sounded as if it was written by an 8th grader and then they grew upheh hehand things became shittyheh heh it makes me feel sad for the future of humanity that people who are able to operate motor vehicles and vote think this film is funny,comedy
is foul and offensive but that is expecfrom anything from seth macfarlane has its moments but there are not many that are funny the funny moments are found in the first couple of minutes of the movie though and then the movie slides down the garbage chute into a murky pile of dung there are so many wascharacters and terrible unnecessary moments that have no bearing on the characters that take away from the moments that could be funny and are there for shock value but do not make it patrick warburten is wasin this movie warburten is one of the funniest men on television and is just a waste of his comedic abilities warburtens homosexual relationship with ryan reynolds has no bearing on the story and wastes screen time that could be used for something else patrick stewarts narration is wasand unnecessary and again has no bearing on the story or the outcome joel mchales character chasing mila kunis again has no bearing on the story and is dull and lifeless the worse part of the movie is giovanni ribisi and his obsession with stealing for his son this obsession provides the absolute worse part of the movie and destroys any chance of this film from being tolerable this movie is a complete mess and it was not worth the effort to film it,comedy
this is my first movie review ever and not even a real one because i watched only 20 minutes from the beginningmaybe im wrong but i have a feeling that this movie is going to be a one of those stories about a guy and a friend where guy has to grow up and leave all his boyish bs behind in order to enjoy normal life in other words marry a girl and take mortgageis a symbol of that boyish bs is probably going to get drunk use bad language talk dirty to the girls and at the end or at least in some point stand in the way of a marriagehumor in this movie is probably going to evolve around the holy triangle of bad comedies  sex drugs and bad languageif you find those themes endlessly hilarious this is probably movie for youfor me the humor was too forced and not funny at all,comedy
i had a fear it would be a bit repetitive with the whole family guy theme but it really wasnt it surprised me how funny it actually was i think its partly due to the fact that its not a cartoon so even any overly family guyish jokes were even funnier to see the actors playing it out the trailers dont give away any of the proper funny jokes as well which is something i detest you knew every funny joke in the hangover 2 because of the trailers and to top it off the bear is probably the cutest thing i have ever seen mark whalberg is  as always  so good loved it and i know its one of those films that the more you watch it the funnier it gets,comedy
four stars out of five seth macfarlane the creator of family guy makes his featurelength liveaction directorial debut with some computer animation the film stars mark wahlberg and mila kunis with macfarlane voicing the computer animatitle character macfarlane direcand cowrote the screenplay along with two other family guy writers alec sulkin and wellesley wild the film is a fantasy comedy film about a teddy bear that comes to life to grant a childs wish and becomes a burden on his romantic relationship when hes a grown man the movie is surprisingly well made for macfarlanes first feature effort and more hit than miss with laughs its mostly a crowd pleaser id say if you know what youre getting in towahlberg stars as john bennett as a child john was an outcast and had no friends so when his parents get him a stuffed teddy bear for christmas he makes it his imaginary best friend one day he wishes that the stuffed bear could talk back to him and a falling star grants him that wish the two grow up together and the teddy bear known as macfarlane helps john overcome his insecurities their friendship is finally put to the test though when johns girlfriend of four years lori kunis wants john to stop spending so much time with so they can further their relationship togetherthe movie is crude and vulgar but nothing more than one should expect from the creator of family guy macfarlanes direction is surprisingly impressive and the jokes for the most part work which is more than id say for family guy wahlberg is good and likable in the lead and the movie actually has a lot more heart than youd expect from it its actually a positive story of friendship that could have played out the same way even if one of the characters wasnt a magical stuffed bear its about how much love and time you give to those who are most important in your life its also of course extremely raunchy and hilarious at times but theres definitely heart to it and its a good well intentioned buddy filmwatch our movie review show movie talk at httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvzaxzq69tess,comedy
i cant stand seth macfarlane so i guess i am to blame for not really liking this movie as with other macfarlane entities this one has the same non sequitur completely random head scratching references in jokes that just fall flat its not that i dont get them its just that they dont fit the context at one point the bear sets up his own joke just to use a pink floyd lyric reference in which he actually has to say its from pf so that the 90 of the people in the audience who didnt memorize the wall are somewhat informed the entire movie is circled around the flash gordon movie from 1980 which is real topical and im sure most of the lines go right over anyones head under age 35there is so much cursing in this its becomes awkward i could see people squirming at the disgusting jokes which i have no problem with as long as they are funny these werent many homophobic and anti semitic references for some reason more nervous laughter from the audiencei actually felt like leaving i was so bored about 3 funny jokes in the whole thing and one of those was a fart there was a fat couple sitting near me who laughed out loud all through the last 15 min of the movie at what i dont know maybe they dropped acid before the show these are the same people who keep family guy on the airnot for kids under 15,comedy
this is the story of a 35year old guy named john bennett played by mark walhberg whos victim of such a common syndrome in people of our generation hes an adulescent basically an adult who refuses to grow up and keeps on enjoying a hedonistic life made of sex drugs and house parties i dont know if the word is used in english but anyway think of judd appatows comedies male protagonist and youll get the point and this john bennet leads his hedonistic life with his 27year old best friend but john has a job and a beautiful girlfriend named lori collins and played by mila kunis who wants to make plans with him but he must show that hes capable of being an adult and convincing to let him live his life thats in a nutshelloh yes and is a teddy bear one of the most memorable cgi creatures of recent years who provided mark walhberg one of his greatest roles in the same vein of touching weirdness and comical performance than the late bob hoskins in who framed roger rabbiti can imagine seth macfarlane pitching the film to the producer a few sentences and you can hear a cashmachine sound in the background just when you get the story a man whose best friend is a talking teddy bear you understand it is a comedy of opposition think about it a big smiling cute and fluffy teddy bear symbol of childhood and innocence acting like a horny foulmouthed animal party this is an offer a producer cant resist to but from our experienced viewers perspective as promising as the synopsis sounds we wonder how long such a gimmick can be maintained before losing its appeal macfarlane is a terrific writer when it comes to animasitcom episodes such as family guy or american dad but theres no fundamental difference between the premise of and howard the duck couldve been a disasteror could have been just a good film but guess what its slightly better than that because of how surprisingly good it is actually what could have been the basis of a sketch or a family guy manages to drive a storyline of a hundred minutes in an exciting and entertaining way and this is owes a lot to the fact that is handled like a full and threedimensional character from the very start the film opens in 1980 when a friendless boy so alone hes even mocked by the poor jewish kid whos getting his annual christmas beating and when he gets a teddy bear he makes a predictable wish which predictably becomes real speaks much to his buddys delight and his parents horror but then the magic of christmas operates what happens next within the films fantastic universe is handled with very smart realismno the parents dont hide why should they becomes a local oddity then an instant celebrity invito the johnny carsons show and so forth and then like many 80s wonders and other 90s stars such as corey feldman or frankie muniz he sadly sunk into oblivion and after that this is where the film won me i thought john would get rid of and then the teddybear would come back to his life but would have that made sense why would you even lose your best friend one that understands you perfectly one that grows an intense complicity with you and one who was raised on the same cultprograms than you no remained his friend and very much his friend for 27 years and when we meet them they act together like true bros might be a gimmick for us to discover but hes a fully developed character nonethelessthe film takes a departure from films like howard the duck or paul where the strangeness relies on scifi elements the fantasy here allows the film to get away with all the whys and hows and spare us some distracting special effects here the plot centers on relationships and the way love can undermine friendships and vice versa and when you suspect it will be impossible for to leave johns life because hes got nowhere to go the film takes you by surprise by making his independent life absolutely possible the screenplay written by macfarlane is the best asset of the film because it creates unpredictable situations out on predictable material theres no scene that hasnt been seen before but in it works because it doesnt try to be original it just sticks to teds irresistible personality and the contrast with his appearanceof course theres a lot of things happening in the film a mysterious buyer obsessed with the bear and played by a creepylooking giovani ribisi theres loris boss and occasional stalker whose efforts to conquer her hearts always meet with answers you never really see coming there are also one of the most memorable cinematic parties with a mysterious guest star and of course there are some delicious interactions between and characters of female persuasion even a nice cameo as one of his exs one you never see coming this is a film that is really caring about making us laugh and manages to take a concept  la american dad one of the best written animashows and make a story out of it one full of crazy oneliners raunchy but never vulgar dialogues or never vulgar at the expenses of humor and one of the funniest concluding voiceover monologueand beyond the laughter is humanized in such a way you cant look at him as a teddy bear but hes so cute and adorable you cant ignore that what a fascinating paradox,comedy
it seems utterly useless to complain about the current modern infatuation with flatulence and poop last week there was an entire bobs burgers animafox tv episode about the mad pooper macfarlanes the family guy animafox tv has been a mainstay on sunday night for over a decade and frequently uses such toilet stuff ad nauseam so there must be a market for this boring and repetitious yuk but one just has to ask how many times can hearing a fart or seeing a pile of poop get a laughso it is there not for a laugh but for shock a cringe a way to embarrass those who think this kind of stuff is disgusting to separate you from them like a kids club anyway back to if every fart and poop joke and scene were removed from this movie would it still be as funny absolutely what if anything did the scene with the hooker taking a dump in the living room accomplish absolutely nothingit is a kind of charming clever interesting infantile comedy or maybe sophomoric would be more appropriate there is enough here to entertain and as always the creators sharp pop culture wit is amazing the movie is so good when its good but when its bad it stinksbut here it is obsessed with the anus so it is infantile for that it is quite a disappointment not just here but in a all of its modern marketing so if you are up for it hold your nose and take a chance,comedy
starting as any ordinary christmas story when john bennett mark wahlberg an isolafriendless kid wishes for his teddy bear to become real a simultaneously falling star transforms the cuddly toy into a living being thus becoming best buds ever however life goes on after childhood as time goes by age catches on and the child becomes a man seth macfarlane was something of a celebrity back in the days as a walkingtalkingthinking teddy with no place in our scientificbased reality now foulmouthed and wisecracking his body has remained unchanged but inside has grown up still living with john they form an inseparable duo much to the chagrin of the latters girlfriend lori collins mila kunis perpetually attached to his childhood teddy bear john fails to grow up and take on responsibility instead working at a deadend job and lacking any sensibility or push to alternate his existenceadmitedly a fan of seth macfarlane seemed like a match in heaven  an intriguing premise a stellar cast and the great comedic artistry of macfarlane alas the sense of humour is a drop below his high standards somewhat more crude and less whimsically wellplaced than normal typically nonpolitically correct the overall concept works well but lacks the substance and content for the long run making the screen time enjoyment peter out most of the humour focuses on the cute teddy being lewd heavy on drug use and apt to sexual endeavours with prostitutes or various pop stars inasmuch as it works for the character it doesnt make up enough backdrop for creating the holistic script wahlberg and kunis do add some presence but there just isnt enough meat on this comedic bone to make it work throughout  the silliness starts off as being charming but just ends up tiresome,comedy
this is for the unraversion on the dvdit is supposed to be a romantic comedy right but right off the bat its shocking how much foul language and obscenity is used throughout the movie even those coming out of the bearthe obscenity did not enhance the humor the plot or the romance if they removed the obscenity it could be a perfectly good family movie or at least pg i almost quite watching the movie because of the obscenitythe plot is more or less predictable but there are two major plot holes the first one is change of personality which often happens in movies and which i hate the girlfriend of the bears owner used to hate the bear but in the middle of the movie she suddenly became very concern for the bears well being what gives also at some point in the movie the bear was able to beat up his owner who is pretty well built but later on when his life is at stake he turned into a wimpits an ok movie if youre ok with the obscenity or perhaps try the movie version both are on the dvd it may have less obscenity,comedy
i wanso bad to like this movie im a fan of family guy and i like seth mcfarlane but i am not a fan of this moviei dont care that its rude and crude its simply not that funny the references are pretty bizarre i suppose they might be funny in an episode of the family guy but for me they fell flat i guess if youre a fan of the old flash gordon television series you might get at kick of this plus i didnt find the teddy bear that likable mcfarlane might have been better handing off teds vocal duties to someone with a less aggressive voice i wish i had not have was106 minutes of my life watching this dud,comedy
first let me start this review with a little story when i walked into the movie it was packed so packed the only seats left were in the dead front row now a couple seats over from me there was this couple with their childwho looked no older than 6sitting on their lap i just looked and gave a quick facepalm because i know that kid had no business watching this movie 30 minutes into it the mother gets up and leaves assuming shes going to the bathroom however 15 minutes later the father gets up and takes the kid with him they never came back now those parents are stupid because this should have known this movie was rar i mean from looking at the movie poster you should assume three things that it is not a film for kids the fact that it is from the creator of family guy is holding a beer bottle looking at the ratingnow to the movie there have been movies that are raunchy with no sense whatsoever there are comedies that have a good story but not that hilarious let me say that this movie is raunchy hilarious and has a very wellput together story from it i have have laughed really hard at movies but very rarely will there be a movie in which i laugh so hard that i almost bust a gut the last movie to do that was 4 years ago in 2008s tropic thunder i did that in the avengers as well when hulk smashed the crap out of loki but that was one little scene so it doesnt countthis movie is like family guy on steroids however it is very hilarious very wellput together and the amount of heart in it is shocking youll be very surprised mark whalberg does a great job and it looks like he brought out the kid in him as well mila kunis is wonderful as well and seth outdid himself using cast members from family guy and there was something that seemed like a homage to the peter griffinchicken fights when starbrawling with johnoverall i recommend this movie just dont bring kids,comedy
most people know or have heard what to expect from this movie before buying the ticket so if youre not a family guy fan or dont appreciate comedic genius of seth macfarlane then this movie is not for youi personally found it very funny and very entertaining definitely a movie to see more than once and one of those to add to you personal collection cant wait for macfarlanes next project whether it be on the big screen or whatnotand since this amazon website requires that i write a minimum of 10 lines ill finish by taking up the last two or three lines and write absolutely nothing but just words to take up extra space or i could conclude by saying go see you will get your moneys worth,comedy

im a huge fan of seth macfarlanes work but this movie was absolutely terrible on all aspects of film making even judging this movie only by the characteristics of comedy movie it was still a terrible movieseth macfarlane likes using a lot of american pop culture references uses a lot in his tv shows family guy etc which people will get the jokes and make connections with how macfarlane views the world the problem with making a lot of pop culture references its basically a hit or miss with the audience they will either get it or they will not get it and most of his funny references were mostly misses with the audience probably because i wasnt born in 80s time period but for the most part all the jokes were bad basically seth macfarlanes signature or style of comedy is trough pop culture references and also he uses a lot of frank sinatra dean martin bing crosby type of classy music for his scoresoundtrack thats macfarlanes signature in every episode or moviemovie was mostly a drama then a comedy,comedy
i have to confess that i have seen many bad movies in my life this socalled comedy really makes the highest ranking so far the directorscreenwriternarrator of demonstrates a very restrictive and particular sense of humour that insists on highlighting sexual extravaganza over and over again believe it or not there is actually a love story by confusing being funny with being vulgar that story however gets lost pretty quickly i saw no point in watching this movie till the end to what end anyway since religious language is also abused all the time in pointless dialogues maybe a prayer will serve as an appropriate conclusion o lord have mercy,comedy
seeing over 100 movies in the theaters each year i speak with some knowledge of the quality of the films offered there are excellent films like the hurt locker midnight in paris and a separation there are some very good films like the first hangover bridesmaids xmen first class the fighter warrior and the first iron man movie there are even many good films rafrom 5 to 7 on the imdb scale but there are also many tankers like jack and jill or the current film i am reviewing tedi went to see it friday afternoon because i thought i would like it its hard to gross me out and i really like mark wahlberg when the gross out and the use of the fword are totally gratuitous and not funny and the story stinks there is absolutely nothing to recommendi see the movie did well at the box office i hope word of mouth will keep you from wasting your time the movie is a total looser and you who read this review have been forwarned,comedy
seth macfarlane who is the creator of family guy wrote and directhe movie this is his directorial debut and i may not be watching his second work i am not a huge fan of family guy the whole idea baffles me but no matter i see mark wahlberg and mila kunis i just expect to have a good time which i didnt havewahlberg and kunis combination was great on screen they gelled together and there were the best thing to see on the screen the movie dragged with profanity and too much sexual reference i just kept waiting for the next thing to happen as each scene dragged and i wish i could just skip aheadthe computer animation was handled by visual effects facilities tippett studio who were responsible for the way back when robocop series and the more recently the smurfs macfarlane wrote the screenplay with his family guy colleagues alec sulkin and wellesley wild and they must have thought there were writing for a cartoon because some events that happened were totally ridiculous a teddy bear and sex that is both loony perverand ridiculous in so many waysthe plot is simple as the result of a childhood wish john bennetts mark wahlberg teddy bear came to life as john grew so did the bear in attitude voice and reason but things starto change when lori mila kunis comes into the picture john has to grow up but keeps him groundedacting by the leads is an a from me i was actually impressed by mark whalberg not saying he is bad at what he does just saying i was impressed directing and screenplay d some scenes were just too dull for mewhalberg was in contraband and the fighter with christian bale before this movie i was not too much of a fan of contraband but the fighter was just a legendary movie to watch mila kunis was also in the movie max payne with whalberg mila jumped at me from the movie the book of eli and later on black swan i see her growing to be a regular on the silver screenwell is a movie all we want to see some loved it a few didnt i am of the few may be you go see it yourself and let me know what you think,comedy
is the type of movie thats bound to attract a lot of teenagers or young adults and its not solely based on swear words drugsalcohol use and politically incorrect jokes though that is an attraction it has a lot to do with the type of humour the film employees as well as seth macfarlanes family guy randomits the idea that as soon as something funny comes to mind you might as well just say it or in this case put it in a movie the same goes for intertextual references and celebrity guest appearances where the joke lives or dies based on whether or not the audience recognizes the reference andor the starhistorical figure whether the logic of the situation allows for said reference to be made is another storybut in short this is what the humour of is a bunch of ideas and references strung together a lot of the connections dont make much sense and the jokes can drag on a bit longer than they should again like in family guyspeaking of family guy if youre a fan of that show then odds are youre likely to enjoy this film as its really just a liveaction version of that show with new characters and setting similarly if youve never encountered this humour before then you could very well be taken pleasantly by surprise at what you see and hearpersonally im not much of a fan i used to like this humour and i admit i even engage in it with my own friends sometimes but thats the difference this humour i feel works best in isolasituations as opposed to being forced into a some kind of story unless of course its a spoof and yes there is a story the bare bones of one but a story nonethelessif i had to estimate how many of the jokes figure into the situations presenin the story id probably say somewhere between 1520 the remainder are just ideas thrown at the screen by macfarlane seeing what sticksdoes this make it a bad film well that largely depends on your sense of humour when it comes to a lot of comedies no one really cares about the story or characters being super great though having those cant hurt they just want a film that can make them laugh so if you find this humour funny then odds are you will laugh  youll likely enjoy this film as for my rating the reason its not lower for me is because some of the jokes i did think were rather funny im disappointhe entire movie wasnt as funny as those jokes but what can you do in short if sounds like its for you then check it out unfortunately it wasnt for me,comedy
this film tells the story of john bennett and his teddy bear on a beautiful christmas and thanks to a desire he asked this teddy bear came to life however as its not very common to see a grown man with his absolutely delinquent teddy bear this friendship is destined to pass by severe difficultiesthis film was an idea of seth macfarlane who signs family guy an american series of humor for adults and in fact only a head as damaged and distorlike his could think of ruining the teddy bears a symbol of our childhood and innocence putting one of them to do a huge amount of obscenities in a twohour movie the film puts to behave like an idiot to swear and say profanities as if he were reciting shakespeare instead and to use drugs and drinking as the world were to end tomorrow and the best thing to do was to turning back in human evolution in addition to this authentic apology to animality imbecility and consumption of drugs and alcohol the film also puts practically defending the theory that being a pervert is simply great and a great proof of manhoodi dont consider myself an ultraconservative nor a moralist but the truth is our society didnt need this kind of movies there are more interesting ways of doing comedy to making people laugh isnt need to attack the moral and social values in which we create our children and stand our nation we live in days of great confusion it seems that what is evil has become good and movies like this only serve to prove it,comedy
i decided that i would sit down with my twentyfive yearold yes i know brother today and maybe even try to bond with him instead he decided to put on and i died a little bit on the insidefollows the misadventures of a loudmouthed misogynistic homophobic and malicious stuffed bear who just so happens to talk and still live with his original owner that guy that guy is generic and never really does anything interesting miraculously he managed a relationship with the lovely mila kunis for four years but even that one is still a mystery of convenienceand as i watched this i couldnt help but notice how awful the writing was too its like the movie was made for a twelve yearold child with no sense of right and wrong or compassion to enjoy something like this you would have to be majorly baked otherwise theres no hope for you as a human being sorry you can roll your eyes at me as much as you want and say that i dont have a sense of humor but you probably know that there is some truth in what im sayingis a repulsive brainless comedyquite possibly one of the worst movies ever made the fact that its so overradisgusts me more than the millions of women who call the antifeminist drivel twilight a must see selfhate much,comedy
while i enjoyed some of the jokes and laughed a couple of times it felt like mcfarlane was trying to be politically incorrect for the heck of it especially since the incorrectness is actually rather clichd and will not be hurting many peoples feelings at least here in europeto make doubly sure that no feelings get hurt mcfarlane wraps the jokes in a tidy package of harmless romantic comedy with cardboardcutout actors predictable plot and corny happy ending that will soothe and reassure the viewer with the palette of emotions that he is accustomed to find in most hollywood blockbustersdo yourself a favor  skip this movie and watch monty python and the holy grail for the 100th time instead,comedy
it boils down to a question of taste this film takes a well worn but clever idea a childs teddy bear is given the gift of cognition and speech in response to a wish and instead of going in the predictable maudlin direction of the child inevitably outgrowing the toy as in iq it goes in a different direction the child mark wahlberg never out grows the toy and the toy never outgrows the child but both age into foul mouthed everyman working class jerks with inexplicably the toy having better luck but worse taste with ladies and drug suppliers than the boy  one wonders where the boy got passably adult standards and mila kunis even to this extent  possibly by watching episodes of macfarlanes family guy which is much more consistent and disciplined in its humor possibly because its on network tvthe problem isnt the language when the shock value plays satirically against expectations as in the definitive answer to its a wonderful life as a christmas movie the ref it can be bracing and fresh here though it is not only all pervasive but as inconsistent as the story telling adults and swear right up to the point where a swearing father says you shouldnt swear in front of children the toy is treaas a real person by everyone but the possibility of selling him to a psychotic father  giovanni ribisi in a change of pace role  of a horrible child who wants him is treaas reasonable the stuffed bear is shown taking a bubble bath with no realistic issues of absorption or drying out effective fantasy must be grounded in some reality or at least consistency the only consistent thing here is the overly broad boston accents southey might consider defamation suits if grossout comedies where prostitutes dedicating on your girlfriends floor on a dare and your girlfriends reaction thereto is considered ripe material for comedy in your world add another couple stars to my rating  if not deduct two starsyou will still want to go along for this particular ride so badly because the acting whalberg and various unbilled supporting character actors  one nice cameo with patrick warburton and ryan reynolds offsets a lot of implied homophobia  and even seth macfarlanes voice for the well cgid is so good and the idea has such potential but if you make it as far as the cameo of sam jones from the campy flash gordon remake without being as high as the lead characters or switching to the essentially more innocent and funnier harold  kumar films you may want to consider counselingyoure definitely not going to feel comfortable watching with preteens around one of the reasons it tanked in the theatres and i have to wonder who else the film makers had in mind when they green lighit who else would laugh at the idea of lance armstrongs testicle lost to cancer being bronzed and displayed by a collector  not to mention followed by the obvious line from period moundsalmond joy commercialsthe traditional fight scene between the best buddies and the whipping of whalbergs half naked ass by said best buddy is a moment or three i will long remember but all in all i cannot honestly recommend the film as a whole whalberg in song not too long after the fight scene will probably recall cameron diazs challenged vocalizing in my best friends wedding for many but without the warm romantic payoff nothing in has that kind of payoff and thats the real problem,comedy
while there are many funny moments tends to run into the same problems that one would expect out of an almost two hour episode of family guy a simplistic story with some extremely clever jokes and hilarious one liners mixed equally with niche 80s references and jokes that bomb miserably with the assistance of many of the actors from seth macfarlanes own animacreations family guy american dad and mark wahlberg boogie nights the fighter the ubertalenmacfarlane writesdirects and does the voice of the talking teddy bear himself in his first feature film tedusing his own satirical take on new england culture macfarlane crafts the story of an inanimate teddy bear named who because of a wish from a child named john becomes a vulgar talking teddy bear who smokes pot and loves the ladies but years later as 35 year old john and teds juvenile relationship continues johns girlfriend lori wonders if there is any hope for her relationship with john to become serious as long as is constantly hanging around while this super simplistic buddy comedy storyline is accentuaby various comic detours or bits that are good for some out loud laughs the demo audience depending on how young they are may not get a substantial amount of the heavy 1980s references such as a constant but well crafcameo from flash gordon himself sam jonesproblems arise in the second half of this film when the comic momentum is all but lost due to a combination of necessary story arch sentimentality an overuse of 80s reference and a bad guy element that not even an immensely talenactor like giovanni ribisi boiler room could salvage there is also the visually distracting fact that walberg is so much older than mila kunis who plays his long time girlfriend but i digressfinal thought i will say it again macfarlane is undoubtedly one of the most talenpeople on television in the 30 minute format and while showcases why his fanbase is so large his feature film directorial attempt isnt as strong as other animation geniuses turned filmmakers such as mike judge king of the hill office space go see if you are a fan of seth macfarlane otherwise seeing a movie like this may turn out to be only an above average and far too hit and miss of a movie going experience,comedy
i am a mcfarlane fan but the movie seemed to me too hung to family guys cast and regular jokes so i was disappointo see that the teddy bear was made funny out of being a total jerk based on a combination of quagmirepeter griffin from family guy the idea of a teddy bear partier foulmouthed could be funny if the character wasnt so mean and utterly despicable as a seths follower i appreciate his 80s references and some of the comedy situations come from cameos from actors from seths favorite 80s movies top gun and flash gordon those were classical mcfarlane so i didnt dislike them but the movie doesnt get out of the jokes and you never get a reason to like either or to cheer for john bennet he never gets how disgusting his friend is to his girlfriend of four years the movie includes a grotesque scene that imdb doesnt like in bennets apartment which the girlfriend has to clean  and the teddy bear having sex with a coworker over food in a grocery store and getting promofor it as a joke on corporate america i suppose is not that the humor is too brown is that is not that funny in my opinion there is a competitor for the love of mila kunis character but the guy is a total jerk all the time so we never see her falling for him unless she is a total idiot too as she would be better alone the denouement of the movie is not too bad but you have to be a hardcore family guy fan to like the movie as it seems a long episode of the series in the future i would like mcfarlane to try some humor without trying to make an offensive joke every sentence or at least not fall for the easy ones we have family guy for that rrastuff that imdb does not allow me to write sometimes when you break taboos i consider them fine but famguy has a tendency to try to be over the top and so we have enough of this in that cartoon series so it looks bad in a movie that otherwise has a good premise and a good cast,comedy
dont waste your time or money watching this trash i have never been a big fan of mark wahlberg and this movie only makes me not want to watch any of his upcoming films i did like the flash gordon references but other than that it seems like every joke is just stupid  disgusting i cant believe that a sequel has been made i remember watching this and all i could think waswhen is this awful movie going to end i actually hit the fast forward button just so i could end the misery that this movie put me in i felt like i was watching a bad adam sandberg movie im jus glad that i didnt waste 15 dollars on this movie at the theatre i may have walked out if i had gone to the theatre to see ted,comedy
enjoyable diversion once you get over the bong hitting teddy bear joke not much left over but a few chuckles from some one liners it is basically a live action version of family guy with being a combo of peter and stewie i was expecting sides hurt funny but it is not even close to that not sure why it was so successful i guess seth m knows his audience everything he does somehow excretes gold i wonder if he laughs about it late at night the story is basically rehashed knockedup will immature manchild over outgrow his friends for his woman the flash gordon parts are stellar though loved all of that joel m and mila k are washere basically play lesser versions of every part they have ever done and are barely funny,comedy
i saw the movie in texas and i was in shock at the dictionary of cursing words that horrible talking bear usedplus a stuffed animal trying to have intimacy with a person i found that really disgusting and the conflict between toy stuffed animaland his girlfriend did not add anything to the plot i was surprised that a good actor like mark wahlberg did such a terrible moviei do not recommend this movie to children nor anyone the jokes were real bad the one about the mexican food was not funny nor the part that the toy threw a holy bible to mwahlbergalso the issue of the main actor and the bear doing drugs is not acceptablethat is not entertaining to the public the bear does not come close to alf,comedy
i normally dont write reviews but in this case i took exception this film is really crp and i really dont understand the high rating its getting one of my greater disappointments is that norah jones is actually in it and i am a huge fan oh well no ones perfect its amazing how such a totally unrealistic story can have such a following yeah watch it and enjoy to your hearts content but please dont give it confusing ratings for the benefit of the minority of sane individuals wishing to spend their time on a good film seriously unless youve sucked up some weed like theyve been doing youre not gonna find this funny at all,comedy
i had high hopes for this movie but after seeing it i can say its pure garbage besides the beautiful mila kunis its just random jokes and scenes from seth macfarlanes animashows i didnt laugh as much as i use to do watching macfarlanes animatv shows in my opinion this movie lacks a lot of creativitywhat i did like was the cg was nicely animathe voice acting wasnt that bad but also lacked in creativityi think this film proves seth isnt ready for the big screen and should keep it to tv cartoonsi wont say its not worth seeing this movie but i wont recommend it,comedy
i was a fan of family guy but emphasize the use of past tense i thought its first three seasons were pretty consistently hilarious after that it was uneven but pretty funny when it was good yet then it took a turn for the worst and just became unbearable so i stopped watching before going to i tried to watch a new episode but i couldnt sit through it however the good reviews that this film was garnering told me that maybe just maybe it might be better than i had previously hoped alasit was pretty awful from the start i knew what i was in for but i had hoped that over the course of its relatively brief runtime it may pick up and i would find myself in a state of hysterical laughter yet i could only dream of it weve seen this kind of clichd plot before usually without a bear yet that didnt bother me going in but some of the romantic and heartfelt were so generic and unoriginal i was bored to tears i like mark wahlberg  brilliant in boogie nights and the depar but here all he could do was work with what he was given and that wasnt much ill admit he made me guffaw only once the acting overall was nothing special and at times unengaging there were a few nice cameos hello norah jones hello sam jones but they were unfortunately wastedand as for the comedy it was nasty obnoxious crass etc now dont get the wrong idea that im prude or anything i love everything from wonder showzen to trey parker and matt stones work to bill hicks but ive seen the jokes here countless times in the past and didnt find em funny the first time round i adore risqu humour when its trying to make a point or convey a message not when its there for a cheap laugh a teddy bear humping a cash register is not funny a teddy bear on weed is not funny obnoxiously insulting brandon routh is not funny especially six years on if youre gonna make a joke about a celebrity try and do it when current and relevant i wouldnt recommend this at all if for some godforsaken reason you still think family guy is great then youll probably lap this up but if you thankfully dont well then steer clear of this turd while watching this in the cinema the audience were in uncontrollable bouts of laughter while i had a bad taste in my mouth with his liveaction debut seth macfarlane had an opportunity to prove himself a great comedic talent hes wasit and opto the lowest common denominator of unfunny unoriginal and eyerolling cheap laughs if you want the comedy of the year so far go watch 21 jump street,comedy
horrible moviethe teddy is a vulgar drug addicti really wish he wouldnt have been sewn back the guy was an addict toovery very unsure about himself mark w is a good actor i am surprised he chose such such a bad movie not at all appropriate for children it has a dumb plot with a real bad sense of humor on a rating of 1 to 10 i give it a 1 it is a real bad film i thought there was more creativity in hollywood it probably is a low budget film it could have been a nice movie if many changes would have taken effect who plays the bear anyway and what is it trying to tell the public in my opinionit didnt say anything productive,comedy
if you havent laughed recently is just because you havent seen yet i saw it today according to the trailers i was expecting to see one of the freshest movies of 2012 but instead truly laughed my a off cannot remember the last time i laughed so much on biodome 1996 maybei used to die laughing at every trailer which is very uncommon but the movie has to offer much more very predictable overall story line with happy ending but indeed the true power of lies in the way the story is developed especially the dialogues there is a very powerful situation comedy sitcom screenplay experience hidden behind the movie in the best meaning of a sitcom i mean the people behind the movie really put their bestspeaking of the overall qualities nice soundtrack great computer animations of the character and great play of mark wahlberg must say mila kunis appearance was great too not really a strong play but a really sexy angelina jolieesh appeal dialogues kick athis is my first review where i will not reveal any spoilers and will keep it very short because i really would recommend you to go and see the moviea 2012 must see,comedy
make for a lousy movie the problem with this comedy was that it just wasnt funny especially the first half hour most of it is a narrator and it was just boring basically an outcast named john wishes his teddy bear were real and be his friend well it happens skip ahead to a 35 year old john with a girlfriend lori of 4 years the 2 live together with the bear likes to smoke pot and be vulgar hes a bad influence on john and loris had enough so you know whats coming next the ultimatum and you know wont leave john alone for long and theres this really gross side plot of getting it on with a fellow cashier and of course has to help john win lori back and there is the side plot of teds crazy stalkers but the jokes werent funnyfinal verdict a waste of time skip it,comedy
the concept is stupid the jokes seem forced and vulgar the acting is weak at best the characters are predictable and never connect with the viewers so why watch this movie you ask thats a tough question to answer but the truth is there were some quite humorous moments some really funny scenes some very funny one liners and joke sequences and therefore id say the movie was worth viewing just for those few selecmoments overall this one was just a soso effort i think it also could of been somewhat shorter in length as the funny lost its way and at times really dragged im a big mark wahlberg fan and while this isnt an example of his best work it is still funny enough and clever enough to earn a 5 out of 10 rating,comedy
the thing that bothered me the most about this film was that i could never shake the idea of the weakness of the idea that a teddy bear could suddenly talk and do all these physical things just because somebody wished for it and that everybody in the film just accepthat i know it was a fantasy but even in a fantasy i need a thread leading me to believe the situation funny more vulgar than funny a change of pace for mark wahlberg i still love him but look forward to more dramas from him nice shots of i assume the boston area all the actors were fine nice people like bostonians length of the film was good at 110 minutes,comedy
not sure what i was expecting when i went to this movie and i had been warned to not waste my money but my son wanto see it so i agreed to go with him about 10 minutes into the movie i was regretting that decision why you may ask wellbasically this movie did little more than bring the family guy animashow to a live action movie many of the actors from the tv show were in the film and the entire cache of jokes seemed to center around smoking pot partying with loose women and being immature and irresponsible there wasnt even the distraction of the homicidal baby to take your mind off the ridiculous clinging to college daysi can only assume that mila kunis agreed to do this film as a favor to seth macfarland as she has become much to good of an actress to lower herself to this level mark wahlberg on the other hand has had a string of disappointing films so this is right up his alleythroughout the film i was forced to suspend disbelief as to why the entire world believes in a walking talking teddy bear and whyhow he can do some of the things he can do much like im often left wondering why nobody finds it odd that the dog talks and drinks martinis on the tv showdont get me wrong there were a few moments that made me chuckle but nothing to make me feel i got my moneys worth its basically 12 and 2 hours of my life that ill never get back and have nothing to show for it,comedy
as a huge family guy fan i was excito see seth macfarlane directing a live action feature the humor is exactly what you would expect however family guy is a 22 minute show and stretched a single gag for way too long family guy is quick and hits you with joke after joke but the timing for became painful i felt macfarlane hung himself with the r rating free of network censorship it felt like he tried too hard to try and shock an audience thats already been around the block a few times my add checked out halfway through the movie and i drifinto boredom people will argue and say what about that scene or i loved the part when they did this but wouldnt you think a feature movie would have more than 2 or 3 funny parts would you watch robot chicken if it were only funny for 15 seconds and the remaining 10 minutes were boring wait for home video and put it on in the background and get a time machine and watch it when you were 14 years old that might help too,comedy
hey everybody just watched and believe me it is crude lewd and rude  it is also screamingly funny and actually touching in places its been said that all the jokes seth couldnt get away with on family guy show up here while that may or may not be true its a great script well acand again gut busting funny anyone who has spent time on the east coast particularly nyc and boston will recognize the cadences and attitudes the plot is simple and straightforward guy loves girl guy loses girl guy moves heaven and earth to get girl back all with the help of a talking blue collar bear but the script is terrific  just like family guy nothing is sacred here and that really appeals to me in our politically correct world you cant even tell a helen keller joke anymore on second thought if you have to ask who hellen keller is then is isnt the movie for you im sure lion king is playing somewhere but if you like your comedy fresh raw and nasty run skip or wheel yourself to the theater at once,comedy
although ive watched south park and family guy some of the vulgar content in this movie made me uncomfortable this movie just had too much profanity and obscenity for my taste some jokes were overused and funny at first got old very fast as a result the movie dragged became boring and a waste of time i didnt find likable at all plus seth macfarlane didnt attempt to give him a voice different from peter in family guy so every time spoke i imagined peter from family guy thats just lazy on seth macfarlanes part and i find peter one of the least likable characters on family guy which may have played a huge part in my disliking of this movie the plot is not good in fact it feels quite juvenile compared to the writing on family guy there is still much was left to be desired in the story glad i didnt waste hard earned money on this one,comedy
ive given this film 1 star out of ten because its the lowest possible if i could i would give it a minus number i thought this film was horribly unfunny and after seeing that it holds a score of 7 on this site i felt a bit sad for the state of mankind i wonder how so many people can enjoy this total rubbish the idea of a talking bear is fine but wouldnt that be more suito a movie for children is for myself at least a totally unlikable neanderthal much like his owner they are lazy stupid and nasty and some of the jokes leave a really sour taste 10 minutes into the film i knew what it was going to be and i could easily have turned it off i am not a fan of the directors other work but i actually didnt know he was involved until halfway through the film ill be sure to avoid anything else which he turns out in the future after seeing this work it seems to me that he is quite an ignorant spiteful and cruel person who will say or do anything to get a laugh i strongly recommend that you avoid this one,comedy
everyone watched it and everyone liked it and deemed it to one of the best comedies ever im personally pretty shocked by that because ive rarely seen such a stupid movie now i really have to wonder if its me or society that somethings wrong withbut lets begin with the good things about the film at first the concept is pretty good a teddy bear who was sweet once but now is an alcoholic who trips out sometimes secondly the cast is very promising too mark wahlberg mila kunis and seth macfarlane are all household names in hollywood and third some jokes are funny  every now and then even exceptionally hilariousand with that i immediately build a bridge to the bad side of the film some jokes are perhaps good but most of them are just dumb i really dont get whats so funny about watching people who are saying the fword in every other sentence a scene in a supermarket with a blonde woman a sausage and himself i dont want to give you too many details is just disgusting and especially at that point i wondered how this film was rafor eleven or twelve year old children in some countries ok to make it clear to you i have to tell you the ending of this little scene its at the beginning of the film and no important part so not really a spoiler fs the woman my goodness now i even use this word   i mean come on how for goodness sake is this amusingnow that i have complained about the weak jokes enough i want to mention the other two big blunders of the movie the completely bogstandard plot could have been told in about ten minutes and you know from nearly the first minute on how the story more or less will develop two of the three main characters arent really likable either and i felt really sorry for mila kunis one though i dont understand why she lives with two drug addicts one being a teddy bear by choice this is all i can tell you about this movie at the moment for me its one the biggest movie disappointments ever so overall four out of ten points because at least the idea was good and i laughed sometimes,comedy
for every genuinely funny joke you have to sit through ten minutes of pointlessness then youve got the generic over the top fight scenes which they seem obsessed with and piles of pop culture references which are just pop culture references without any attempt to turn them into proper jokes same with all the bizarre celebrity namedropping the film even ends on one as if that is the lasting memory it wishes to instil in its audiencethe opening five minutes is probably the best part of the film and the narration works very well but after that it is mostly a downward spiral of drivel the initial premise is fantastic but it was fairly predictable where it would go from there and a lot of the scenes just feel like fillerthere are a few genuinely hilarious lines the exchanges with the grocery shop owner and the flash gordon bits are great its just a shame it gets buried under a mountain of mediocrity and a stock plot also they totally failed to play queens wedding march from flash gordon at the endthe writers need to realise that just because one of the characters is a talking teddy bear everything it says does not turn to gold the dialogue that works especially well is when it is actually in relation to him being a teddy bear writing angry letters to hasbro about having no penis for instance is something which can only work in this film and indeed works well so much of the rest however is just very generic stonerbuddy film lines which have nothing to do with him being a bear they would not be funny when delivered by a human and just because he happens to be stuffed and furry they do not suddenly become sothere is a certain amount of humour to be mined from portraying a childrens character in an adult theme and parodying the endless well of lonely child befriends an alientoytalking animal films from the 90s i really need a better name for that but it quickly gets old i feel you could edit out a good thirty minutes of content from this film without actually losing anything that is never a good signpaul is a film with a similar premise and target audience which ultimately delivers far more effectively and does not disappoint,comedy
john makes a christmas miracle happen by bringing his one and only friend to life his teddy bear the two grow up together but at the age of 35 things start to changejohn must then choose to stay with his girlfriend or keep his friendship with his crude and extremely inappropriate teddy bear tedfirst if you are not a fan of family guy please dont watch the movie this is basically the same thing genius jokes witty references to films and film stars and of course central characters you can relate to and not some caricatures who all have high powered jobswahlberg proves again that comedy is his forte and he looks like hes having a ball playing second fiddle to a cgi creationthis movie is all about the titular character and while he is potty mouthed its the other jokes that are laugh out loud funnythe tom skerritt sub plotsam j jones the whole thing involving him is just brilliant and bonkers and just when you thought it couldnt get any more sillier we meet a duck called james francoand of course ryan reynolds popping up out of nowhere to play a very surprising cameo my summary did warn you it contained spoilersit can verge on becoming silly at times but there is too much going on for it to become boring the sub plot involving ribisi is wonderful and he adds a very if funny sinister side to the moviemcfarlane knows he sounds like his most famous character so he includes this into the filmso finally we have an r racomedy that doesnt have to push the boundaries and become crude just to get laughs hello hangover but something with endearing characters and a well written scriptthe funniest film of the year so far,comedy
this is my first review so please forgive me if it gets a bit all over the place i liked this movie but imo it could have been bettera movie about a crass pot smoking dirty minded teddy bear was always going to be funny and it delivers in that aspectthere were some brilliant one liners and some fantastic dialoguesi laughed out loud a lot but i also lol a lot at the avengers too butit was only funny because of the filthiness and crassness of and the people around himunfortunately i found the story a bit blah imo it seemed like it was planned as a bunch of things a teddy bear could say that no one would expect and at the last minute they though shit better put a storyline in and then they just creaa basic done before plot which didnt fit together all that well reallyi loved the interaction between mila and mark i thought they mde a fab coupleif you want to see a movie that everyone will laugh at providing they arent easily offended and enjoy then definitely fits the bill if you want something with a decent story to go alongside the comedy then you will be disappoinnot for young kids my 12 year old daughter wanto see it and after i saw it she is not allowed to watch it some very rude bits funny for me too rude for 12 year old eyes overall i did enjoy it and i laughed at it a lot and i would recommend seeing it but it wasnt all that,comedy
to get things straight i am not the biggest seth macfarlene fan  the only reason i went to see this was because a friend of mine wanto see it and i couldnt think of anything better to watchif you want my analysis on the jokes then here it is  some jokes were amusing eg the parents reaction to finding out teds alive for the first time some fell flat eg the narration at the beginning and end was more i dont want to hear this than funny when trying to crack jokes and some were sick twisand disgusting eg having sex  yes you read that rightfor a fair opinion if sick twisand disgusting jokes are what you laugh at im assuming most people who are going to see it and know what to expect from seth mcfarlene will laugh at it then i think you will thoroughly enjoy this movie and in some cases might probably think movie of the yearone complaint that i will say about the film is that it is too long for what is basically a combination of dumb comedy and sick comedy when both are used very regularly and very clearly all throughout no matter what nearly 2 hours is too long for a movie like thisi also have to say this it helps if youve seen the 1980 flash gordon unfortunately i already have seen it and i felt i was the only one in the whole cinema who actually understood the jokes i didnt say i liked themoverall is this seth macfarlanes best work yes why yes it is is it worth watching for someone other than a family guy nut nooooooooooooo,comedy
i like a good comedy sometimes but its because of films like this i never watch them in the theatres i didnt find this one all that funny at all as stupid of an idea as a man attached to a living teddy bear may seem thats the point of the comedy  i get it i just thought it was dumb and didnt workwhat i expect is not only laughs but a good story to support those laughs and more emotion for the characters ie stakes to make it that much funnier and enjoyable mark and milas characters had absolutely no basis in their relationship there was nothing concrete actually keeping them together nor was their union so when compromised that and everything went to hell i didnt care one way or another nor did i care about and what happened to him near the end eitherthe story was weak the characters were weak and that made a weak comedy  no matter how funny the jokes,comedy
possibly the least funny comedy ive ever had to sit through which was a shock for me since the creators of family guy a show i love were involvedi think this entire movie falls on its own rump if the novelty of a swearing weedsmoking teddy bear wears off at any point for me it took about five minutesafter that it was just a slew of simple crude jokes that never hit their mark due to their reliance on the teddybear vehiclethe bear itself was an irritating character completely unlikable in every regard and what was up with mark wahlbergs accent are there really americans with dialects as ridiculous as that it sounded like he was chewing words rather than saying themall in all juvenile and not even funny with it,comedy
everyone said this was the funniest movie ever but i found no part of this funny i quite watching it after one long hour of forcing myself to watch it im glad i only paid the dollar from redbox i have to do 10 lines of review but this movie doesnt deserve 10 lines it sucks it staroff stupid it ended stupid the previews were much better but it is a horrible excuse for a movie i compare this to twilight and that movie was horrible my friend suggesthis movie to me i am ashamed that america even creaa movie like this i have never watched a movie with such nasty language drugs and sex if i was a parent i would never let my kid watch this,comedy
yep this movie was a pure disappointment just got this movie on dvd last night and watched it sure enough i didnt laugh as much as i thought i would in fact i barely laughed at all to be quite honest everyone probably knows what this movie is about so im not going to jump into that all i know is that the dialog was bad i barely found any of the jokes funny the story and plot didnt seem to go anywhere it was just another poorly thought through comedy that tried to be funny like just because there is a dirty mouthtalking teddy bear in the movie we are supposed to laugh at everything he says i really didnt find that amusing at all the love relationship thing between mark wahlbergs character and mila kuniss character was just the same old mushy crap the couple have their struggles because interferes too much with their lives they break up but because they save at the end of the movie that finally makes them realize that they were meant for each other just the same old love story you knew they were going to get back together didnt you jew jokes homo jokes sex jokesboringor how about at the end of the movie during the climax when mark wahlberg punches the fat kid in the damn face oh yeahhaha theres not really much i can say that hasnt already been said by all these other reviews mark wahlberg wasnt that great in this movie either the acting just wasnt good im not just talking about him i mean the whole cast i dont even get the villain in this movie either he was just some lameass psychopath with a fat son who wanto kidnap and we barely get any background information on that character in conclusion its sad to admit that the trailer for this was funnier than the movie itself my favorite parts in the film were probably the party scene and the motel fight scene between mark wahlberg and that was it dont hold youre breath people because this movie is not what you think it is 310,comedy
warning possible spoilers aheadfirst off let me preface my review by saying the following i do not mind crudeness in a film i believe if done in an appropriate manner a moderate amount of crudeness can be quite funny now having said that i need to say the following this may have possibly been the worst movie i have ever seen in my life and ive seen some pretty terrible movies my husband wouldnt even finish it where do i even begin one total lack of a thought out story yes the teddy bear was wished to life and they grew up together maybe if it were an indie flick i could buy it as a social piece but no it was far from that secondly the acting was pretty unbelievable as in literally unbelievable i have seen quite a few flicks with both whalberg and kunis and they are wonderful actors i couldnt buy it in this film third somewhere along the way seth macfarlane decided that the only avenue to humor is through disgusting crudeness there are reasons you can do thing was in an animation that you cant do in real life he should have kept that in mind here i mean really who wants to see a grown woman have sex with a teddy bear i imagine the same sickminded person who would find this movie at all good it was filthy and completely tasteless as i said crudeness can be funny or it can be icky and this went head on for the latter i almost have to question the intelligence of anyone who could find this movie entertaining unless of course they are a teenage boy then maybe i could see it i immediately returned this to redbox i wasnt spending another dime on it,comedy
this is 2 hours of my lift that i will never get back whats the point to this movie very disappointing who would ever read this script and think it was something worth making how can these actors think  wow  this is a movie i would love to be in by 12 way through the movie i was trying to look for a spot that i actually thought was funny i was working at trying to laugh and could still not find anything to laugh at this ranks up there with little nicky and zoolander as one of the worst movies i ever watched  and paid for viewing it to add insult to injury my advise  dont bother i truly tried and could not find a spot that i thought was truly funny,comedy
after having heard my friends talk so much about this movie and how funny it was i decided to give it a try i have to say this is one of the most overrafilms i have ever seen the target audience are 14 year old kids or just simple minded retards this movie is terrible there were a very few funny scenes and the plot was horrible it was way too simple and predictable if your more for the comedy in the film then i recommend you to just watch the trailer it basically shows all the funny scenes this is basically like watching family guy just worse this film was way to predictable and i highly recommend you not to watch it,comedy
if you take the humor from family guy the simple plot of any romantic comedy and the drama from toy story put it in a blender and mix it you get tedit is a good movie and you will laugh quite a lot when reading it it is definitely a sunday movie however my expectations were higher i was hoping so see some kind of masterpiece from seth mcfarlane yet for me the story was way too simple for that to be reached a romantic comedy is definitely not what i was expectingif you take away the humor taken from family guy and the kidnapping drama taken from toy story you get just another romantic comedy where there is a couple that is in love then the guy makes its mistakes they get mad and after a bit of drama they go back together to live happily forever after that exactly is where mcfarlane might have sold its soul to the money romantic comedies are generally a silver mine its not gold but you can still sell it and it was way to risky to do something else where his humor could fitaside of that the fx music and acting is quite good,comedy
i just got back from seeing this movie it was only ok theres nothing mindblowing about much of the movie other than the cg effects used to create the talking everpartying bear the story is basically a mixture of the plots to toy story 3 you me  dupree and i love you man but with a talking bear as the best friend why dont ask me it doesnt really make sense but its touas being a fantasy movie as much as its a comedy as welli didnt like the idea that was an aging being who slowly progresses into being a bad boy type as his human ownerfriend ages alongside him he just comes across as weak and a bad friend overall in that regard the whole being and backstory of is ridiculous though so you cant read too much into the character other than he sounds like peter griffin and has the personality of quagmirei felt that seth macfarlane is the real person in this production who was looking for a friend though his neverending compulsion to keep bringing up past pop culture references sounded like a cry for someone to understand what he thinks is funny i get ittiffany on the tv multiple obsessions with flash gordonsam jones a knight riderstar wars ringtone indiana jones music and on and on and on he really is south parks idea of what the family guy writers room is like random thought bubbles mixed together and fed to the audience as humor its debatable that this is the truth because after a while i was like ok i get it move on in my head and there are tons of celebrities and cameos to digest throughout the film as well i dont know if its seths idea of a power trip to include famous people he knows or whatjoel mchale was probably the funniest part of the movie which isnt saying a lot because they write the same fart jokes for him that they did for mark wahlberg i just like his delivery a lot better than everyone elsesif youre not picky about jokewriting or tropes that youve seen in movies 1000x over feels like a surreal romantic comedy if pot jokes multiple penis and fart jokes or jokes involving animacreatures humping humans doesnt bore you you just might like it i thought it was all stuff ive seen before though,comedy
seth macfarlanes irreverent humor may not be for everybody but those who love the family guy will adore whose running time equals about five family guy segmentsyet amazingly maintains a more consistent level of humor than even one average episode even trumps family guy by also being a romantic comedy superior to most a pretty amazing accomplishmentif you ask me and i hope the motion picture academy recognizes this by nominating as one of the years best filmsi have always considered mark wahlberg a middling actor with great taste in scripts as he has made some really fine movies mila kunis is not only beautiful but a great straight man as the antics in would have rattled any lessor actress giovanni ribisi is terrific in a small role saving what is easily the weakest part of the movie which is still better than your average movie however who wouldve thought sam jones would steal every scene in which he appears note to hollywood give this guy another chanceteds animation is so astounding you actually come to accept him as a living breathing creature and the fantasy sequence recreation of flash gordon is spot on an more amazing accomplishment considering the films relatively small budget likewise kudos to whoever effecthe appearance with johnny carsonas a bonus nora jones one of my favorite singers also appears and she proves she is not only a great singer she is sexybeautiful and funnystands along with duck soup young frankenstein and the whole nine yards as my all time favorite comediesi give a 10,comedy
this movie is everything that is wrong with movies today not one part of this movie made me even break a smile it wasnt funny it was stupid mark wahlburg still breathes every line he speaksmila kunis can act at least but is the only redeeming quality about this piece of sht movie seth macfarlane is not funny by anyones standard they only people who should find this movie funny are teenage boys who think that fart jokes and jokes about actual sht are funny any adult that finds the movie enjoyable must have something wrong with them because this is the stupidest movie i have even seen please dont watch this movieits two hours of your life you will never get back i would give it a zero out of 10 if possible,comedy
when he was 8years old john bennett mark walhberg had no friends and got a teddy bear for christmas then he made a wish that the teddy bear could talk and when he woke up the next morning the teddy bear did indeed talk and john bennett and became lifelong friends if parents are thinking this is a cute teddy bear story they are in for the biggest surprise of their lives this teddy bear story is laced with most foul language sexual innuendos and much was outright blatant drinking and drug use and most of this came from the mouth of nothing in here is remotely funny and really its just embarrassing to watch this could have been funny and a real treat but the language and other stuff mentioned above killed it there is nothing more to say 010violence yes sex simulain places nudity yes briefly language yes fbomb heaven,comedy
there is nothing i repeat nothing even remotely good funny entertaining or likable about this film i found it to be boring tedious dreadful and a chore to watch as i forced myself to see it to the end after having paid to watch it i wasnt going to waste my money by deleting it from the hard drive on my p v r part way through the film im going to do you readers a massive favour and tell you all what happens at the end so that you dont end up wasting your time and money watching this drivel i cannot find any redeeming feature in this film no i tell a lie there is one and only one and that is the clever way has been made to look realits a tale about an eight years old boy who had no friends that was thrilled to get a stuffed cuddly bear as a christmas present once received he then wished for it to come to life and so it did now as far as i can tell in a prosperous country such as american and in a middleclass neighbourhood such as john barratt was in the last thing an eight years old boy would be thrilled to receive is a stuffed teddy bear any way he got it he made the wish it came to life and became famous but didnt earn anything from being famous that all happened pre credits during the credits there is a montage of them growing up to adulthood and him in a job which even though he is always late for it and is hardly ever there he is still in line for a promotion i wish i could find a job like that time and time again the bear ruins johns relationship with his girlfriend causing them to eventually split up the two get drawn back together when they go chasing after who has been kidnapped by a creepy man that is obsessed with him the man wanhim for his son and after hearing make a phone call to john takes on a car trip john and his now ex girlfriend lori are in the car together on their final time together when the call is received work out where is and head over to the house as they get closer they see in the mans car and give chase to a football stadium the creepy man chases up a stadium light stand and as he grabs hold of teds foot on pulling down is torn in two and his stuffing comes out at this point i was so hoping the film would end but no there was still more rubbish to come john and lori grabbed all of the bits rushed home with him and stitched him back together guess who wished him back to life yes thats right lori the person whose life he had effectively ruined for the last four years by her boyfriend always putting the bear before her the one that on coming back from their four year anniversary dinner to find a turd on the floor claimed it was there courtesy of one of the three very attractive ladies he was sitting on the sofa with the film is too awful and how it managed to do so well at the box office is beyond my comprehension there are lots of appalling films that do do well at the box office leaving me struggling to work out why as far as this film goes and the internet movie data base reviewers and rater go there are only 27 percent of people that have taste and know what decent funny comedy is,comedy
this film is basically wilfred but instead of a dog its a talking bear and instead of being funny its not it doesnt get one star because mila kunis is so ridiculously good looking that she would warrant a star for standing still and silent for two hours this is not massively surprising since the director  writer  whatever thinks that humour can be achieved by repeating lines  entire scenes from various cult artifacts of popular culture verbatim i think flash gordon is cool i didnt need to watch half of it again though in the guise of another film i think my personal final straw was when they actually reference family guy presumably there will now be an episode of family guy which will feature a scene from maybe 2 will reference that scene unlimimaterial for the genius macfarlane,comedy
to be fair i watched the trailer when it came out on imdb i rolled out of my chair laughing not knowing that it would be the last time i would laugh about this movie i was really thrilled to go see this movie and the disappointment was huge when leaving the theater if i knew the all the fun bits of the movie were in the trailer i wouldnt have gone to the movie for anyone who hasnt seen the trailer i can understand the 7 rating but if you have then dont bother going cause u will be disappoini hope this review will save you all some money the acting wasnt that bad but we have seen way better from mila kunis so once again if you have seen the trailer then if you still plan on going to the theater bralove story,comedy
i checked spoiler alert but i really dont think my critique is actually spoiling anything because you have seen this movie a thousand times already so i am going to be brief about thisthis movie is a combination of family guy and a rehash of movies that have already been made boy meets girl boy has obnoxious friend that holds him back from his marrying potential girl lays down ultimatum to ditch the loser friend boy repeatedly keeps going back to the friend tells girl to give him one more chance which she does guy screws up one more time girl breaks up with him guy realizes she is the love of his life and then decides it is time to ditch the loser friend only one last crisis with friend makes both guy and girl realize that the loser friend is a necessary part of both their lives blah blah blah there you have the movie in a nutshell no need for a spoiler alert in this movie critique because you have already seen this movie in watching other movies also most the funny parts are in the trailer so the scant few that arent in the trailer arent worth the cost of a ticket to see it if you are a brain dead stoner you might enjoy this movie if not dont waste your time on it,comedy
it almost feels necessary to reciprocate the vulgarity of this so called comedy in order to express my distaste for its unoriginality offensiveness and ability to absorb incessant laughter from a mass audience excluding myself i will however restrain and refrain from reducing myself down to that level in comedic terms that level being beneath the basement of laughterthe fact seth macfarlanes directorial debut is categorised as a comedy is quite tragic if 0ffcolour humour and flatulence are primary appeals for modern audiences then we can unfortunately or not if you enjoy it prepare for a future comedy genre flooded with idiotic and stale humour every laugh in the theatre possessed a sense of shock prior to genuine laughter because of the crude nature of the every ever predictable and tired joke which were exhauseven before the opening creditstake the attemphumour away from and what are you left with other than a slightly more bearable two hours the remains would be shorter than the amount of time it took me to want to leave the screening which was not long at all with all three of our main characters motives established early their actions only become increasingly obvious so obvious that one could probably predict the events if they were to have held a glass to the door of the screen with one ear at the other end and just listened rather than watched they would have most likely had more fun than i toowhile having a strong dislike for macfarlanes three hugely popular animaseries i find my reasoning behind this similar to that of my loathing for these in my opinion pathetic excuses for the moving image embark on what i can only describe feels to me like being trapped on a one way train filled with loud obnoxious passengers who are engaging in ignorant disputes throwing useless insults at one another the little steam it had prior to boarding is quickly diminished because of the engineer macfarlanes lack of skill to sustain a working locomotivedespite the above perhaps harsh criticisms there were few positive elements to the worst film i have seen this year maybe any year the combination of live action and animation looks superb to a point where you do not even question the reality of the character teds existence it would have complementhe film more had we seen more emotion displayed by the character in terms of facial expression and body language as it is solely dialogue which makes him feel like any more than a childs teddy bear overall though the tippet studio visual effects team did a terrific job back to reality or well a real person in mila kunis playing a fictional character the most convincing of all characters due to the genuine emotion she appears to conveythe only way in which the eyes that are looking over the hands typing this review would once again witness the film that is would be if universal studios decided to pay me those who are fans of macfarlanes work on family guy and subsequent almost identical series will be prone to enjoying another very similar tale of pointless storytelling i personally would not recommend this immaturity to anyone who does not appreciate the directors other works,comedy
i am getting increasingly anxious about the type of films adults call comedy for pubescent boys i can see the appeal of the film but an awful lot of adults and reviewers seem to be stuck in puberty as wellin fact to find a fascination with scatological references you can even include 3 to 5 year olds is a grungy version of peter pan and he belongs in never never land with the other lost boys i would dearly love to see more popularity of cinematic portrayals of grownups dealing with the serious problems america is confronwith today that world also has its joys and benefits we all need to listen to our inner child on occasion but it shouldnt rule our lives,comedy
this is seth mcfarlane the creator of family guy and american dads first full lenght movie after years of watching family guy and american dad i couldnt help but check out the trailer for this movie and what i saw was really satisfying i bought my cinema ticket and went straight to the cinema to watch this thing and it turned out great it is one of the funniest movies ive seen this year and for seths first full lenght film it was really great and the jokes were not forced at all i simply loved it and didnt regret the money spent on this in fact i think i might even go see it again while this movie has a great plot it is also a good dramatic film too but the humor used in this movie will often only apply to those who like the satiric family guy tvshow and those who does not like vulgar and satiric humor should stay away from this one as i am a big fan of seth mcfarlanes work i loved this movie i give it a 8 out of a 10,comedy
hello and welcome to matthew praises where i praise the heck out of movies and tv shows so hard in order to make it up to the people who gave me flack at my matthew rants reviews so lets begin with if you enjoyed the works of seth mcfarlene like family guy american dad and the cleveland show then youll love this one especially if you didnt see any of this guys work it is downright funny and it feels like a cartoon of his its got fantasy sequences and jokes that revolve around pop culture it has a ton of language drug usage and sexual references which is why it is given an rrating so check it out i highly recommend this movie being shot in boston it has some great locations that the typical bostonian is familiar with,comedy
i didnt even watch whole movie because it is horriblepeople who like this must have iq 20this movie is proof that human stand is getting dumper and dumper every day movie should present friendship and love but it is shown on really stupid and not funny waythis rating is too good for this piece of s i always say to myself before i go to cinemaeven if movie is boring and stupid watch it till end cause you paid for it but i really couldnt watch this till end and mila kunis is overrashe isnt really good actress she is cute but not good actress movie is good for kids who dont understand it and for teenagers who dont know anything about good movie or good comedy,comedy
i have been watching this film for about 30 minutes i have yet to smile  let alone laugh it just proves to me that hollywood will and does do anything to make money mark wahlberg is not my favourite actor but he has made some good movies why oh why did he make this piece of crud the special effects are pretty good but it is the only special thing about this movie what is all the fuss about mila kunis she is average looking and no better or worse an actress than any other it is symptomatic of modern socalled comedies that noone can say anything without foul language this thing is just so crude it is untrue i am not a prude and have no problem with bad language i just object to it when people think crudity is funny in itself there is nothing witty or clever about this script  how it got commissioned is beyond me,comedy
i love teddy bears and other stuffed animals i really dig that kind of wacky inappropriate humour that makes family guy so outrageously funny mark wahlberg won me over in boogie nights and i have been watching mila kuniss career with great interest since that 70s show romantic comedies with a touch of magic are my thing too naturally i had high expectations for seth macfarlanes feature film debutthe first couple of minutes are just about perfect i am a lifelong star wars fan so seeing dressed as yoda queueing for the premiere of the phantom menace was a real treat for me and i happen to be a huge kiss fan as well so another box was ticked when i spota kiss poster on the wall unfortunately thats about it the novelty quickly wears off the pacing is very uneven the script is all over the place and most of the jokes are shallow overly gross andor unoriginalthere are some memorable moments though the stoned party with flash gordon or the fistfight between and john are hilarious the latter undoubtedly being sort of a cinematic milestone but the movie as a whole is not nearly as funny as it could have been,comedy
this is an absolutely awful film and it is not even remotely funny i have no idea why it was so well received personally i gave it a 1 i like both of the actors wahlberg and kunis and i thought the premise had potential but i couldnt even watch the entire thing and i very seldom stop a film before it is done this one was simply more than i could stand i have no problem with raunchy humor so long as it is amusing and i am seldom offended but this movie is simply not funny unless you happen to be delighby farts poop and vomit it is stupid obvious contrived and offensive it relies on grade school humor something i find utterly boring one reviewer compared it to paul but paul was actually funny and the characters were likable unlike any of those in including the bear it has to be truly difficult to make a teddy bear so completely distasteful but this movie certainly succeeded i disliked this film so much that i decided to read almost all of the reviews on imdb there were an extraordinary amount of 1s given pages and pages of them in fact and i find it hard to understand this films ratingsadly i guess i was expecting something like harvey well harvey this certainly isnt do not waste your time or your money this is the worst film i have seen in a very very long time,comedy
john bennet mark wahlberg an antisocial 8 year old wishes on christmas that his bear could actually talk with him a miracle happens and his wish comes true at this point you might expect an etesque movie like nobody else knows anything but little john and the bear but it becomes a legend with appearing in late night show and being the talk of the nation when john is an agent at a car rental company in his 30s as his sidekick with the voice of seth macfarlane grows up into a full functioning adult living in boston smoking pot messing up with girls and cheering for bruins patriots and probably celtics they all live in johns girlfriend loris mila kunis apartment in a posh downtown neighborhood john is cool with his low profile job and irresponsible lifestyle with his best buddy but a problem is likely to occur when lori wants him to be more serious with his life and proceed to a next level in their four year relationshipwith all the absurdity it suggests this is how the movie develops into something spectacular is not your ordinary comedy movie we know seth macfarlane and what a great job he does in family guy with spontaneous jokes unexpecflashbacks awkward moments and profanity at the right places this movie is like family guy in live motion yet you dont get a hint of peter griffin or brian although the voice is the same as tedsthis shows how well the character development of in this movie is thanks to macfarlane as the writer and the director not only a humanoid with bad habits even has some political views given away by his racial comments about jews mexicans and muslims like a random dude somewhere in the us would do you dont see as a toy anymore nor is the plot surreal the film somewhat owes this to the computer graphics team the animation is so good that it feels like there is an actual toy robot doing all the acting also the chemistry between john and is a big contributing factor for this surprisingly he has a better chemistry with than he has with lori actually that is what is supposed to be in the movie wahlberg is more sincere with his partner in this movie than he has been in his previous ones including fighter one thing i dont like about the movie is the lack of consistency the movie has touches of comedy drama action and thriller but all served separately first hour is a near perfect silly comedy maybe the funniest of the year but then the drama kicks in and the pace of fun drops quite a bit finally the film turns to be a thriller at the end the last part contributes to the absurdity and adds up to the movie but there could have been a better mingling between these partshaving said that macfarlane does the thriller part brilliantly it feels like good and evil from a typical disney cartoon incarnain the heroes and villains of this movie in a sense the director is transplanting the movie to a cartoon in the viewers perception and memory in his debut motion picture seth macfarlane shows a great skill and a big potential to spice up the genreone last note with all the profanity drug use and sexual content you probably dont want to see the movie with the kids for more of these see the unraversion if you have any chance,comedy

im a really picky person when it comes to movies because i work at a movie theater because one it is the last place i want to be on my days off and two i think one you have seen one you have seen them allwell hats off to i got into a free screening and i thought that it was completely laughing my ass off funny i could not believe that i have finally seen something that was truly wontstoplaughinguntilitisover funny all the actors did an amazing job if you love family guyyou gonna love something i hope doesnt happen is that parents do not let kids under 17 see this without them a lot of drug use and nudity i will make sure that me and some of the other managers enforce the policy so people can enjoy the movie in peace when it comes out june 29 or you have the chance to see it before go seriously it is awesome and totally worth it,comedy
if you are not a family guy fan then stop reading and leave immediatelyif you are easily offended by crude offensive racial jokes stop reading and leave immediatelyif you are going to attempt to figure out why there is a talking teddy bear and nobody seems to care then stop reading and leave immediatelyis basically a liveaction spin of the family guy school of humorfull of obscure and blatant references full of absurd and ridiculous humor subtle satire and finally even a little bit of heart although only the first two seasons of family guy contained such a thing just like the show the plot and premise is very simplethe draw is all that happens within the timeframe thats what keeps you entertained and fits this billing toobasically is about a man whose inability to grow up stems from his continued relationship with a teddy bear turned to life during his childhood all in all its an adult fairy tale with all the crass jokes dialogue and insanity that you usually get from your rrafrat pack comedies except this time the humor gets flung at you in massive clusters at a rapid add pace that may prevent you from breathing at timeswhile at other times you are just begging for them to throw a new funny sequencethis movie feels so much like family guy and not just because its from the same writerdirector and contains the same types of jokes as the cult hita good portion of the staff can be seenheard here mila kunis patrick warburton seth macfarlane himself voicing the bear with a peter griffin accent and even the musical score comes from the same composer as the show walter murphyto sum this up nicely if you enjoy and can tolerate the family guy brand and the times they do miss their jokes then theres no reason why you couldnt enjoy this while the third act really bogged down the entire picture with a boring subplot that actually bares minimal continuity to the first half i cant deny its a fun ride and a great debut from seth macfarlanelets be serious any movie with a dozen flash gordon references has to be entertaining,comedy

i am not an american so i will probably not notice all the remarks as funny etc say flash gordon  i barely know what character he is and i dont really care you see  so i probably lose lot of funny stuff i dont know anyway not being american does not disqualify me from reviewing this title ok so i starto watch this movie after few decent trailers and as its with trailers all were lies the movie is not funny not at all it has few decent moments when you could laugh but its hardly anything more than 5 scenes all the rest is pathetic childish and vulgar display of what immaturity stupidity obscenity i dont get it  why every movie in last few months i have seen must contain massive load of scenes with 1 smoking pot 2 doing coke and doing hookers 3 swearing in pretty much extreme way oh i have forgotten in a hooker takes a dump on the floor so its always something new and refreshing sigh to be honest for the first 45 minutes the movie is terrible simply terrible i caught myself staring at this movie with my face muscles so tense that it looked as if i watched some ii world war atrocities it was embarrassing to watch those funny jokes gross language smoking pot for like every 5 scenes back and forth watching this movie is exhausting it will make you just tired not relaxed there is no good humour there is rotten foul language it will make you feel bad did you maybe see bad santa with bbthornton few years ago that movie was vulgar with characters swearing treating women in a bad manner but in the end the outcome is that under the skin of the meanest son of a b there is a good spirit and warm heart here  well here last 20 minutes leave some hope but it wont save the movie its too late first hour ruins this movie completely ok i might be old i am in my late 30s already and maybe i dont understand western world but i miss the days when a good comedy was warm relaxing experience when you could think a little and smile hug your girlfriend sitting next seat and not to be ashamed with watching some disgusting jokes about eating puy cm on someones face made out of dish washing liquid dont waste your time for this move as i said its nice animation and not much more all the rest is simply disgustingmy rate is 310 and its mostly due to animation not much more,comedy
seth macfarlane normally has a quick witand clever sense of humour and any episode of family guy has a point to iti think he sold out to make extra cashthe acting was poorusing the same actors that play the voices of the characters in family guy may of seemed like a great idea but it didnt workfilm was generally boring and had no point or no real story line worth anythingthis movie belittles women and makes them out to be as objects for menthe main actress is made out to be some sort of prize for the men to wincompletely stereotypical and trashyvery immature it was a disappointment,comedy
here are the bear facts the comedy is quite a treat and its one of the best laughoutloud comedies of 2012 director seth macfarlanes concept of a raunchy talking bear is something that might sound silly on paper but its quite amusing on screen stars mark wahlberg as john bennett a bostonian who as a result of a childhood wish caused his toy bear to come to life too bad he did not have a bikini barbie consequently the talking bear becomes an instant celebrity as a result that he is a talking bear john and become best buddies throughout johns childhood adolescence and adulthood john and do all those things that guys do with their toy bears like smoke pot rent hookers get drunk and talk smack lori johns girlfriend of four years gets impatient when she continuously observes that john is not willing to mature into a matrimony state mainly because of his manchild behavior with so therefore john and teds friendship is put to the test i will not divulge more on the narrative because it is something you have to see for yourself if you have not already but let me tell you this in in a flash the 70s sci fi remake of flash gordon and its star sam j jones play an important part in again you just have to see for yourself if you can bear controlling the laughter of this uproarious inclusion is macfarlanes baby and he excels in his hilarious scribe of the picture and his pinpoint direction and i should also voice to you that he voices riotously wahlberg proves again that he can depart from drama to comedy with ease in his performance as john mila kunis was efficient in her work as lori and by the way mila could bear hug me any time like thats going to happen but it was mr jones mr jones mr jones yes sam j jones who came out of nowhere to deliver the top far out performance of the picture delivers the bear necessities for a comedy to shine so give it a bear chance  excellent,comedy
the idea of a foul mouthed teddy bear is a great one and has a long tradition in comic booksbut i think the idea should have stayed in the bar where it was discussed  the script is weak and the execution is overlong the whole thing would have worked as a 40 minute extended sketch but as a film pantsif i had to level a main criticism  it wasnt rude enough it had obviously been watered down for the american audience if youre going to do this kind of thing  go all the way maybe should have had a penis and spent some time in a doll store kind of thing,comedy
it astounds me that anyone could like this movie by 10 minutes in i knew that the plot would be predictable by 20 minutes in i knew that it would not be funny half an hour in i was bored enough to stop watching it was that bad the jokes are completely lame the characters paperthin caricatures there is nothing in this movie that is even remotely entertaining everything is a clich from the regurgitaplot to the annoying flashbacks really really a waste of time and of marky marks talent its hard to believe that this movie was even made its such an atrocious waste of space i really dont think i can ever look at anything seth macfarlane makes again in the same way after knowing that he was responsible for such a hideous joke of a movie,comedy
i strongly suspeci was making a mistake by deciding watch this film based solely on the fact that i enjoy family guyi wish id had the strength of my convictions my only emotion on seeing this pathetic effort at humour through to its utterly predictable end was well thats 90 minutes of my life i wont get back the films three jokes are1 a cute little teddy bear swears smokes pot and likes sex this is the main premise and is clearly such a masterpiece of original creative screen writing that its strong enough to carry the entire film for minute after minute after minute after minute after minute after it just never gets old2 a prostitute defecates on a carpet which has to be cleaned up by some people who surprisingly think cleaning up other peoples fecal matter is disgusting watching them gurn and scream was nearly as funny as the fiftieth time the teddy bear swore but only nearly 3 a slightly odd guy dances in a camp way to tiffanys i think were alone now were privileged to be onlookers we get to look at the funny man dance isnt that funny of course it is so lets look some moreseriously seth dont give up the day job and dont get rid of family guys creative team either because i now know what that show would look like stripped of originality wit satire and surrealism,comedy
i have no problem with movies that are considered vulgar or crude and i have always been a fan of seth macfarlane and family guy but this movie really just wasnt good at times i had trouble paying attention because it was so boring and predictableother than one of the main characters being a teddy bear rather than a person there was nothing original it wasnt very funny and the ending was awful now i know the plot usually isnt the strong point of most comedies but the movie starand ended in exactly the same place the main conflict was never resolved so really everything in the middle of the movie turned out to be pointlessthis movie wanto be a live action family guy type but part of the reason family guy works so well is because it is a cartoon in a regular movie the jokes dont hold up very well and the plot isnt strong enough to get into itim not saying this movie isnt worth seeing there were a couple funny parts but its nothing i would call hilarious or rate as almost an 8 generally it wasnt very interesting,comedy
theres often a fine line between funny and stupid family guy is mostly funny but occasionally stupid this movie was occasionally funny but mostly stupid the plot was thin the writing and acting were weak and the whole thing was so tedious that i couldnt wait for it to end a crude teddy bear is funny for about 5 minutes but i was surprised to hear people laughing at the same repetitive shtick after 90 minutes it makes me a little scared for our society and not because of the crudity but because of the stupidness ive lost some respect for mark wahlberg with this one though mila kunis did a decent job with the role she was given she had the only character with any legitimacy family guy is funny is stupid,comedy
this movie is made for easy viewing it is very funny is introduced as a good character then bad then good but as the audience you always see as the good guy he is wittyfunny and doesnt give a sit about anything except his good friend it is easy to tell that the writers of family guy have been involved the writing has parts of family guy in it and is the best example of peter griffin in the world very much like peter which i think is good as we all love abit of peter griffin would i recommend this movie only to people who are not easily offended as there is a lot of language and action people could easily find offencive but everyone else should watch it easy viewing and incredibly funny the only movie i can compare this to is paul but for me the writing and the acting of mark wahlberg and the great funniness of makes this movie a top movie that i do recommend,comedy
i had a similar feeling leaving this movie that i did leaving bruno which i ramuch lower what in the world is all the hype about this movie should have been beneath mark wahlberg truly the plot was weak the dialogue maybe even weaker i dont remember any laughoutloud funny moments besides the realization you get every now and then while watching that you are watching an rraflick about a teddy bear but im sure there were a fewlike bruno i think there are industry forces highrating this movie it belongs nowhere near the 8 rating in time i suspect the rating system will correct itself else the integrity of the whole rating system on this site will be in question,comedy
a sweet little kid makes a wish that his teddy bear come to life and he does skip twenty years later and neither are very innocent hanging around smoking pot and watching tv and is no secret he made big news back in the day so humanitys used to a walkingtalking toy the special effects are amazing he loves to speak his mind and makes life difficult for mark wahlbergs john bennett an easygoing yet putupon fellow with a lousy job and beautiful girlfriend played by mila kunis who wishes her man and living situation was a lot more normalso teds forced to get his own pad and the real problems begin john prefers spending more time with his stuffed crony than his girlfriend and who wouldnt has endless pot and a raging party with johns favorite cult celebrity after which the duo calls it quits john loses his girl and his master and the humor takes backseat to a creepy kidnapping much too convolufor this kinda movienot like isnt fun when it tries to be  but the good times could have rolled a lot longer and not all teds politicallyincorrect rants are as funny as the fact hes saying them and since were quickly dealing with the consequences of living the simple life this often feels more like a sequel whose predecessor had a much breezier ride because the scenes where wahlberg and voiced by writerdirector seth mcfarlane sit around doing nothing are what makes this truly worthwhile its too bad they had to grow up and actually care about somethingfor more reviews wwwcultfilmfreakscom,comedy
pathetic attempt at comedy this is unbelievably unfunny and childish,comedy
it is unclear at what age group is targetoo stupid for an adult too vulgar for a kidwhat makes us mark wahlberg too serious to make a film that should be comical economic crisis middleage crisis i do not knowseth macfarlane proves unfit to make a film has good ideas but for a cartoondespite there are a talking teddy bear the jokes are lacking the humor of the film falls on gags from b movies american comedy 80sthis film can intrigue for the teddy bear but after 15 minutes becomes commonplace,comedy
you know i knew this wouldnt really be my type of humour but when i saw how hilarious the first 20 minutes were i knew it might be my type of humour the rest of the movie became less funny and more boring as it went on how could humour understandable enough for teenagers and meant for adults get worse it became less funny and less frequentthe concept was rather intriguing but its not going to matter when it gets stale and boring after a whileprosfunny first 20 minutesunusual conceptconsjust uninteresting after thatrating 4 i know i havent really watched family guy but i found almost all clips boring,comedy
i did not want to watch when it came out because of the commercials that were harassing us every 10 minutes with the trailer i felt like the whole movie was shown in it plus the prepubescent humor did not make me smile peer pressure finally overcame me and i played it with a bud in my hand you might as well lean into it i finally changed my mind about the movie it is hilarious for starters the whole movie isnt in the trailer is kind of a ufo gathering different genres scary scenes with a borderline psychopath check the mandatory love story check actionpacked scenes sex or comedy scenes check it is a nice blend of everything that the screenwriters could think of and of what could appeal to the largest audience its an entertaining movie for sure with adultonly humor in my opinion the best part was all those references to boston and its people because i used to live there i dont know how much it speaks to others but the locations and the accents were delightful mark wahlberg is obviously a good pick for the lead part since he is from boston i mean bahstun seth macfarlane proved he could direct one of the best american comedies in the recent years before showing us he could also be a great oscar host is this guy ever gonna stop i certainly hope not i want more boston stories if you thought your kids might enjoy it because it features a teddy bear please reconsider this xrabear smokes pot gets drunk has sex with prostitutes or coworkers in places you dont want your food to be this movie is politically incorrect crude and morally questionable in other words it is wicked cool 1 reason to watch if you are from boston you wont stop laughing if youre not youll laugh at bostonians anywayread it here httpsqueerelistblogspotcom201304ted2012html,comedy
i must start off by saying im not a seth macfarlane fan i dont think i have ever watched an entire episode of american dad or family guy but after watching the trailers and a couple of clips of i thought it looked funny and id give it a goif you dont mind sexism mild racism jokes in poor  bad taste im sure youll love this film but then i guess that could apply to all seth macfarlanes back catalogue in short if you offend easily  dont watch this filmis all over the place as a film even though there is at least one central theme running through it i still felt it was more a collection of funny sketches than a well crafstory hence my low rating but is almost certain to make you laugh if you arent easily offended i laughed out loud at least 7 or 8 times and chuckled quite a few times if you get seth macfarlanes humor  give a go im sure you wont be disappoinbut if you are expecting a film with great plot and character development you will be left wanting in short it is crude vulgar offensive and extremely funny,comedy
im not a huge fan of comedies im even less of a fan of dirty raunchy comedies and not because im offended easily you couldnt offend me if you triedthey just arent funny as an adult i am not amused by fart jokes and yelling body parts to get a laugh however that being saidi really looked forward to i know it would be raunchy and dirty but i thought seth macfarlane might bring a certain level of intelligence to the silly comedy genre like he does with family guy i was sorely disappoinspends more than half of its run time being outrageous stupid adam sandleresque humour that resorts to the most juvenile of sex jokes and drugs half way through i thought i would be scoring this a 2 if it was lucky however surprisingly so the film does turn itself around slightly in the latter half i really thought would have a good story to go with the raunchy comedy but the good story doesnt really start until more than three quarters of the way through the movie i also give the film kudos for the insane amount of 80s media nods from music to film to television because that is a lot of fun for anyone who loved the 80sthe cast is almost surprisingly good considering how bad most of the script is mark wahlberg continues to prove his diversity as pot smoking life struggling and often lazy john he has an undeniable chemistry on screen and the banter with is really amusing sometimes mila kunis plays her role well although its a simple enough role her and wahlberg have good chemistry and her character is a little basic but she does well seth macfarlane is our obviously the guy is a multitalencomedian and can do many voices i am a little confused why he chose teds voice to be one and the same with peter griffin though they do make fun of that at one point which was amusing still you cant doubt macfarlanes comedic talent as teds voice he nails it the supporting cast includes joel mchale why does he always play a sleazebag in comedies and a skeezy and perfectly villainous giovanni ribisi the cast all work well together and probably pull the awful script out of being completely losti suppose i wanto be nasty and dirty but also have some heart and in the end it tries to do that but its way too late it relies far too heavily on really juvenile jokes that dont really work it jumps from shocking jokes about racism to sex and i did laugh i even hazard to say i laughed a lot but it meant nothing because the film leaves you feeling very empty this film got really hyped up by so many people and i heard nothing but how amazing and hilarious it was so im sure my expectations were probably high going into it but the film remains a sub par effort in the dirty comedy genre 510,comedy
the prerequisite for enjoying this movie is acceptance of it premise this is not just talking about a stuffed teddy bear coming alive at a childs christmas wish it is also that after the initial excitement the entire world loses interest in this miracle in where it happened boston people walk past this walking talking teddy bear just as if he is another john doe in the street yes occasionally still gets the celebrity nod in being asked to take pictures together but that would be as far as it getsfor the audience to fully enjoy the movie it is actually best to forget for a moment that is a stuffed toy but consider him to be a real human being after all that is where the story become really familiar a guys choice between a childhood buddy and a girlfriend and that is indeed possible with the excellent animation and voice provided by director seth macfarlene both excellent that is some of the scene eg hearttoheart talk between the rivals ie girl and bear are downright poignantmark wahlberg cast entirely outoftype you only have to think of the deparand the fighter comes through remarkably well as the clueless kidult mila kunis best remembered from black swan while playing third fiddle to an animastuff bear and wahlberg in that order still manages to leave quite an impression and not just because she is so goodlooking a small but good support role sees always reliable giovanni ribisi as a creepy man with a childhood complex fixed on tedits not that the movie fails to meet expectations to deliver a few good laughs the funniest moment however may well be at the very beginning in an establishing scene at boston during christmas just before gets his magical several wasp kids follow their annual ritual of chasing down the only jewish kid in the neighbourhood pushing him on the lawn and start beating him our young meaning the kid version protagonist pushes open his front door sees it action approaches and asks can a play with you guys the bunch adjourns briefly their proceeding turns around and seeing him yell in unison john bennett get lost the jewish kid lifts his head briefly from the ground and joins the chorus john bennett get lost,comedy
when the initial news of seth macfarlanes circulait unquestionably turned peoples heads a fluffy cuddly and heart warming harmless bear became centre stage a boys christmas present becomes his lifelong wish to speak to move and enjoy human life with him as he struggles to fit within human society on that note it wouldnt be recommended to compare this with former living toy spirits such a pixars toy story far from it as team woody and buzz unless offset pose smoking weed and mouthing off like an animal the question thats poses is whether is a majestic creation would the jokes be considered droll and tolerant if a soft toy wasnt in the picture macfarlane has brought the unusual to our screens by being imaginative expanding beyond his marathon of family guy episodes and turning into a triumphant persona when considered the topic of dialogue amongst those who have become intrigued by the comic of a talking homophobic self indulgent teddy bear counteracting this is not an original act weve seen puppeteers and all spent time in reverie of waking up to a cuddly friend as would be expecif this was reality the bear would become famous but after a while the bear becomes ancient history and left to mound up with those folks forced to convert to everyday life parallel to his opposite number performed by mark wahlberg i doubt this will be one of wahlbergs most honoured and remembered lead acts in front of the camera as the teddy is primarily centre stage mila kunis is plainly staged for prettiness and zilch else indubitably she has acting talent but is purely the mechanism for a love story or acceptably becoming a symbol of lust for to gawk whilst being johns wahlberg paramount thunder buddy basically replaces the languid yet significant friend who clings to his middle aged underachieving chum who is adoringly attached to mrs attractive circumstances become unsettling and john has the thorny decision of choosing between mr fluff or the love of his lifethe film does boast a number of pure hilarity components particularly the scene of prostitute excrement and a few interventions with teds employer the enjoyment factor can be notified within this film but will incontrovertibly struggle to pose any bona fide prominence in years to come macfarlanes efforts here will become dreary after purchasing the dvd and left mounin alphabetical order sandwiched between titles such as squeamish and tedious let us hope it doesnt turn into a cult faction where exasperating cyclic family guy aficionados quote the screenplay phrase for word as they daily perform with the animatelevision series,comedy
there is nothing like a foul mouthed teddy bear to make for a great movie personally i think zach galifianakis would have made a better but then again he has played the dysfunctional buddy role before as a child john mark wahlberg wishes for and gets a talking teddy bear now that they are in their 30s neither one has grown out of their immaturity with becoming an increasing problemjohns girlfriend lori mila kunis demands that either leaves or she goes the humor is what one would expect from watching family guy with a lot of adult language it spoofs other films and is critical of many aspects of society it is politically incorrect like family guy some of the bits work and some dont if you dont find one bit funny wait a minute and a new one comes alongexcessive fbombs sex heavy drug use no nudity,comedy
seth macfarlane became very famous after his success on the animashow family guy and to keep fans occupied decided to make his own comedy and eventually it was put into production and then we got   follows the story of john bennett who grew up as a child with his one and only friend a talking teddy bear by the name of eventually when john begins to grow up their friendship then begins to grow more and more distant by making adult choices is a film i think is brilliant the film is literally an brilliant comedy for millions of reasons the film is not just a crouched up comedy it has loads of heartbreaking drama to it aswell which also makes you feel your watching a drama aswell and laughs oh jesus the laughs is hilarious no other words the film supplies you with so many jokes that work on so many levels there is literally not a joke in this film that did not work it was all so funny the acting in the film was also something to praise the acting from mark wahlberg and mila kunis is brilliant and seth macfarline is also brilliant as the talking is honestly just a brilliant comedy you should really see if you love family guy,comedy
this movie has surprised me with a good number of refreshing and unexpecmoments without overanalyzing the story scenario itself a conscious living and intelligent teddy bear coexisting in todays society i am claiming that seth macfarlane has creaa believable setting as believable as can bemila kunis and mark wahlberg are doing a very good job with the later doing an excellent performance explicitely considering the special bond to his living teddy bear its one example of mark wahlbergs diverse performance capabilities considering the long way hes come from three nippled calvin klein underwear rapper to someone who can make me relate to his history to if someone would have told me before that i would enjoy and buy an emotional relationship and laugh my butt off during an intense fighting scene between those two i would have been convinced easily this is also credito macfarlanes prior experience with writing and family guy that can make any ridiculous idea work the movie is sometimes brave sometimes silly but all in all well crafand if youre enjoying a good laugh you should definitely try it without friends and family that are too sensitive about nudity and moderate profanities,comedy
 2012direcby seth macfarlanestarring seth macfarlane mark walhberg and giovani ribisiplot overview when john bennett mark wahlberg was a little boy he made a wish that seth macfarlane his beloved teddy bear would come alive thirty years later foulmouthed is still johns constant companion much to the chagrin of lori mila kunis johns girlfriend though loris displeasure is exacerbaby the pairs constant consumption of beer and weed shes not the one whos most disappoinwith john it may take the intervention of johns boyhood toy to help him grow up at lastshould this movie work perhaps it has an alright premise but is dragged down by macfarlanes frequently criticised brand of humour i myself do enjoy the earlier seasons of family guyeven though it sucks now the balance of what its quality should have been is right in the middle and honestly i like this movie its not an oscar bait movie its not gonna change your life but i think if you sit down and watch it and can tolerate macfarlanes humour you will be pleasantly surprisedwhat worked for this movie well for starters i will compliment the cast seth macfarlane does an excellent job at voicing you can argue that its just a carbon copy of his peter griffin character and there is 100 some merit to that statement but honestly id argue that there are some noticeable differences between the two the cgi for was also pretty well done and reasonably convincingmark walhberg was also great in the movie he doesnt deserve oscars or critical acclaim but he provided a good enough performance the supporting cast which includes mila kunis giovani ribisi and jessica barth was also pretty greatperhaps the films greatest merit is its awesome premise the simple concept of a toy coming alive to be your friend is simply incredible the story surrounding this premise was pretty weak but it wasnt awful i wish it had gone through a redraft just to refine it a bit and to fix the awful ending but it isnt atrocioushumour is a subjective thing a film can neither be funny nor unfunny objectively so if i tell you this movie is hilariouswhich i personally think you may not think so all i will say is that i personally found it hilarious if you do not then that is your opinion i cannot recommend this movie for the comedy but that is purely a subjective thingmy flaws with this film as stabefore the main two are the general plot and the ending it is way too sappy and way too ridiculous comedy is also a factor but i cannot recommend it based on that if you enjoy some of macfarlanes other work then i recommend this movie the premise and acting are both solid so if you like macfarlanes humour youve got a trifecta of reasons to see this movie if you cannot stand macfarlane dont touch this with a 10ft pole ill rate this film 7 tubby mcfatks out of 10,comedy
john bennett is a lonely child who receives a teddy bear for christmas called as unusual as it sounds comes to life and becomes johns best friend all goes well but inevitable john gets old and has a girlfriend lori so his relationship with shouldnt be as it was but its actually stronger than ever unfortunately for him lori isnt happy with them so john must choose between her and tedits the sort of movie which doesnt take itself seriously so neither am i its a complete joke set to make you laugh with everything the characters do the simple fact of having a live teddy bear cursing and smoking all the time is awesome you have a bit of drama and some sober scenes to change the mood a bit but nothing complex most of the time it actually is funny but you have the impression that it tries too hard a plot with more complexity and a better end could have made it a great movie still its quite a laugh,comedy
seth macfarlane is a multitalenguy and this is totally his movie it is his story he cowrote the script he coproduced he debutdirecand he voices the titular bear the two main human characters  teds childhood friend john and johns livein girlfriend lori  are played engagingly by mark wahlberg and mila kunis but it always comes back to the furry one macfarlane turns upside down and inside out the conventional notions of the teddy bear with the most foulmouthed dialogue you can imagine it is crude rude racist irreverent and often very funny and there is a fight sequence that it the most hilarious since the one in borat but this is a film for a specific demographic the younger you are the more youre likely to love it the older you are the more youre likely to find it juvenile,comedy
the most surprising thing about is that it features an actual story rather than dragging itself from one joke to the next its a simple story but it definitely has some degree of fairytale magic and leads to some genuinely touching scenes in the third act thats something you dont really expect from seth macfarlane because storytelling isnt exactly his strongest point i was expecting this to be just as filled with nonsequiturs as family guy and i would have been fine with that but all of a sudden macfarlane understands how to write interesting characters you can side with and thats a nice plus the most important thing is the humor though and has plenty of laughs the voice acting is kinda lazy because sounds exactly like peter griffin but the screenplay is good enough to make you forget about that not bad for a debut film,comedy
if youre looking to watch by seth macfarlane just dont expect it to be filled with smart comedy notice it is the exact same type of humor you can find in family guy or in any of his other shows except this time it is done in a live action fashionthe premise is that john bennett is an outcast as a kid which is hard to believe when he grows up to be mark wahlberg and on christmas he receives a teddy bear and wishes for it to come alive which it does the next morning this isnt a moment just thrown into the beginning to set up how the profane obnoxious titular bear came to be  this sequence has some top notch macfarlane humor to it to give us a sense of the comedic tone of the moviethe rest of the plot is pretty much to give the movie a plot around all the comedic bits  john struggles in a relationship with his girlfriend lori mila kunis since still lives with them while an obsessed fan of teds wants him for his son robert thats itas i said the tone is reminiscent of family guy in that some of the gags are clearly in the same layout as the cutaways in family guy with sounding very similar to peter griffin but not exactly like him as macfarlane explains in an interview at points becomes a metafilm especially when specifically states i do not sound that much like peter griffin in a sense this movie is kind of like pinocchio except for grownups and not as smart put this movie on if you are just looking for something simple yet enjoyable,comedy
comedy fanatics can always count on seth macfarlane creator of the hit animaseries family guy to put on a good show even his raunchy humor may not be your cup of tea this movie marking his first major film debut takes his patent for vulgar humor and audacious delivery of crass innuendos and cranks up a notch with this story concerning a friendship between a man and a furry childhood friend with the mouth of a sailor that childhood friend happens to be a talking teddy bear for a movie featuring a cuddly little toy as a faithful companion you would believe if you are in for a kidfriendly treat but as this is seth macfarlane working behind the camera this raunchy comedy is anything but that it is an exercise of crude rrahumor and profane dialogue complete with innuendos that put the humor in family guy to shame ultimately it is funny and infectiously charming to the point where it is only expecto keep you laughing almost consistently this film follows john bennett played by mark wahlberg a 35year old man who shares an apartment with his foulmouthed potsmoking teddy bear named voiced by seth macfarlane who he brought to life as a result of wishing upon a star when he was a child when their infectious friendship however threatens to come between his relationship with his longtime girlfriend lori played by mila kunis he must decide how to balance his their friendship while maintaining a good relationship with the woman of his dreams there is plenty of joy to be found in mark wahlberg crashing on the couch with a talking teddy bear while smoking pot and trading profane oneliners about sex and drugs if there is anything that hinders in your ones enjoyment in these scenes it is of course seth macfarlanes tendency of pushing the envelop with his vulgarity his frequent excess of fourletter words and cracking jokes on some occasionally sensitive subject matter nonetheless this movie fully embraces the audacious comedic spirit macfarlane granin the family guy series and when it comes it the chemistry between the titular character and mark wahlberg that is where the film peaks wahlberg who has done a few comedic roles in the past such as the other guys shows off with his infectious comedic muscle that greatly pays off in nearly each scene he comes on screen he is also given a chance to show his serious side when the story dives into more dramatic territory which involves the crisis between his relationship with mila kunis this portion of the plot is perhaps the lesser element of the story as it serves the purpose of giving the cast some time to breath from the consistent comedic absurdity that fills the air nonetheless wahlberg and macfarlane succeed on delivering the laughs almost consistently sure there are a few jokes that fall flat but that is only occurs few and far in between is a wildly funny and entertaining enough keep viewers particularly those of the seth macfarlane fandom engaged from beginning to end it is also very vulgar and crude to point of taking its rrating to its peak in this case the conservative crowd will be left in an uncomfortable position but for everyone else it scores a fun laughoutloud exercise,comedy
a typical boring story thats only interesting because a teddy bear is in it its your typical seth macfarlane fashion lets put a bunch of dajokes that people of his generation get mix them in with some current jokes so the kids of today will get add it on with a typical story that nobody will notice how boring and typical it is and make one of the main character a talking animal or in this case a talking teddy bear is the film terrible no but its no where near as good as some people are making it out to be and waste of time and moneyso do yourself a favor and rent actually funny movies that put effort into their writings not this boring movie who seth has to get all his friends in to have his fans go omg shes the voice of meg and hes the voice of joe yawnnnnnnnnnnnnn,comedy
after nearly claiming ownership of the animation domination lineup sunday nights on fox seth macfarlane makes the leap to the theatrical stage with which has the marketing concept and appearance of winnie the pooh with all the innocence squeezed out of him the character is unabashedly crude and every time he speaks you feel the need to take a bath he utters some of the most foul and disgusting lines any film character has said this yearand yet i laughed again im not proud of what i laughed at but i did is the funniest raunchy comedy weve been given this year and macfarlane proves he can extend his wit for an upwards of onehundred minutes hes creathree animaprograms and while sometimes feels like it might drum up a forth one but i dont believe thats the goal here it appears that this was an idea macfarlane had floating around in his head for a while couldnt find a way to make it work on any of his three shows needed the theatrical freedom and liberation to do and say whatever he wanto and thus penned a screenplay with two others and creaa comedic exercise similar to one by judd apatow but with the additional element of pleasant fantasymacfarlane has been put down by remarks that he is too heavily reliant on pop culture references and presents us with characters we can never take seriously i dont believe he has ever been credifor being strangely sentimental in his programs and has the skill to create a setup a climax a solution and even unrelacutaway gags his shows are known for in the matter of twentytwo minutes weekly his talent deserves recognition and i believe is nothing but faithful to his namein 1985 in boston eightyearold john bennett was a lonely kid who wished for a close friend to have and trust when his parents bought him a stuffed teddy bear for christmas he wished that the bear would come alive and miraculously it did the bear named by john went on to be a celebrity yet never forgot his first and best pal the narrator then tells us that just like corey feldman frankie muniz and justin bieber eventually nobody gave a stwentyseven years later john played by mark wahlberg and voiced by macfarlane spend their days in an apartment watching movies and cartoons particularly flash gordon smoking a bong and eating junk food john is a used car salesman who has been dating the beautiful lori mila kunis for four years yet is reluctant to propose she likes but feels john has been too clingy with childish things that need to go john is indecisive about choosing the love of his life or his friend he promised hed be with for life the setup isnt too far from one possibly existing between longdating couples with a human who has become too intrusivedespite given free range as well macfarlane doesnt immediately jump on the tna bandwagon or even the grossout gags wagon either frankly the only wagon he jumps on is the appropriate one unrestricverbal wit he reconnects us with familiar faces and voices with mila kunis meg on family guy in the supporting role his peter griffin voice as teds it doesnt come off as distracting as seth rogens in paul and even the voice of the handicap character joe from family guy patrick warburton is given a minor role in the picture it keenly reminds me of how trey parker and matt stone utilize their recognizable voices in their films that are distant from their south park comfortzone between the verbal wit and the pleasant familiarities macfarlane still gives himself enough leeway to function within his newly found theatrical boundaries without resorting to childish gag jokesbut lets not forget wahlberg and kunis in the central roles if theres one actor who has efficiently restored himself from goofy kid to a capable character its wahlberg he along with many other actors this year such as channing tatum in 21 jump street have touched on the comedy genre and have proved worthy of recognition wahlberg and the foulmouthed bear have a kind bromance in the picture that manages to carry itself through the entire film never running out of steam or resorting to tireless old fluff no pun intended kunis per usual is exuberant in her role providing character where there is usually caricature and proves her determination and stunning appearance take her further than many other actresses that are on the same or even a higher levelafter seeing the film i contemplamy thoughts on if many of the references jokes or oneliners would be as funny if they came from a human character and the answer is probably not they probably wouldve triggered laughs but not the riotous ones this picture gets it is next to impossible to rewrite with a human character in the bears place and second the film resorts back to that old formula of laughing at something just because seeing a human swear drink smoke and act crass in public is typical but seeing a bear do it all is touchingly hilarious when done properly especially when it is done with a wide range and an enormous heart i believe its safe to say is the first big comedy hit of the yearstarring mark wahlberg mila kunis seth macfarlane joel mchale giovanni ribisi jessica stroup and patrick warburton direcby seth macfarlane,comedy
absolutely hilarious i gave this a 10 not because its perfect  nothing will ever be but boy does this movie deliver america  your favorite writer gets to the big screen with a bang the writing for this movie is laugh out loud i havent been on imdb for a while and writing reviews was a distant memory showed me why i used to love comedy movies my only problem with the movie was the incessant laughing from the crowds  sometimes drowning out dialogue i will probably see it again making sure the theater is empty  will take a while that being said its r leave your kids behind and overtly pc people will also have trouble with certain scenes all round macfarlane poured his soul into the movie making  its quite hard to weave tender moments into a movie as raunchy as this but he did it anyway and one will never imagine this is a first for the director my kudos and a big recommend to all movie lovers out there,comedy
i went into this movie thinking it was going to be really funny or really dumb i am a big fan of family guy so i figured it wouldnt disappoint hilarious from beginning to end everyone in this movie does a great job it was fun to see mark wahlberg take on a role of a funny guy some of the humor might be very offensive to some but i couldnt quit laughing i was amazed about how many children were in the theater i was in definitely not for the kids there are several culture references in this movie that makes it really enjoyable there were a few parts where you could kind of predict where they were going to run with it but it was still funny either way one part i found pretty funny was the parody of the dance scene in from the movie airplane although when i looked around it didnt seem that very many people understood the reference there were lots of teenagers there there were many more references that the younger crowd could understand though it had a nice balance of humor to entertain younger adults and teens and older adults like myself if you want to laugh go see this movie i was hurting by the time i left,comedy
to me a movie that instantly feels like you can watch it continuously end on end etc is automatically worthy of a 10 out of 10 even more deserves a 10 out of 10 when you feel that other people can do the same and thats exactly how i feel about some reviews ive seen give it a bad rap and then a bad rating just because theres a great amount of crude humor however theres warm heart felt moments and not just crude humor in some parts that balance it out and make this movie a fantastic comedy and one heck of a time at the movie theater and that is another reason why this movie gets a perfect score from me plus seth macfarlane might be my long lost brother cause the things they the characters say in the movie are exactly some things i would say just jokes and poking at society and thoughts on hollywood i think everyone with get a kick out of even though its so reminiscent of family guy duh who cares its a great time at the movies enough said hats off to macfarlane a great movie,comedy
not since last years the family tree has a comedy kept me laughing from beginning to end does just that i laughed loud and hard during seth macfarlanes directorial debut is far and away the funniest movie ive seen this year its nasty irreverent unexpecand laugh out loud funny macfarlane is best known for his impertinent sometimes sacrilegious animafamily guy cartoon series he utilizes the same approach in macfarlane leaves no one or no topic unskewered jews gays boston girls drug users grocer store managers car rental businesses liberals conservatives christians indians muslims especially muslims all feel seths wrath a criticism against macfarlane is his penchant for over playing the liberal and gay agenda his characterization of stewie on family guy was receiving extremely poor reactions from the fan base and an alteration though subtle was institumacfarlanes tone and attitude have mellowed slightly and more conservative mores are appearing in his scripts maybe this is because hes older and wiser and maybe its because hes been hanging around with talk radio host rush limbaugh who knows the bottom line is the comedy is an equal opportunity laugh fest the nefarious doperslacker comedians can and should learn well from macfarlane you can make a funny movie with more than three bathroom humor gags repeafor 90 minutesjohn bennett played by mark wahlberg is the kid no one likes the opening sequence sets his pathetic scenario during the annual beating of the neighborhood jewish kid at christmas time wahlberg is solid in this role after a series of yoyo like performances in action flicks he dives into this part with relish ive been rather critical of marky mark of late but hes climbed up the ladder of impressiveness with his performance in tedmila kunis is lori collins johns girlfriend she is rather nondescript in the part but with her exotic looks all she really has to do is make love to the camera with her deep swimming pool eyes of course macfarlane knows this well and doesnt waste time in mocking her appearance in the guise of sleaze ball boss rex played by joel mchale you have that smoky baltic something look in addition to an extended cameo by mchale ryan reynolds sam jones and the rest of the voice cast from family guy all appear in the only one missing is jennifer tilly its a shame she would have fit nicely into this flickmacfarlane is the voice for admittedly there are times when he sounds too much like peter griffith but most of the time the laughs compensate the effects for are top notch credit production designer stephen lineweaver and special effects supervisor adam bellao and his crew for bringing a teddy bear to life its a solid blend of puppetry and animation key scenes to look for 1 the hotel fight scene 2 meeting sam jones flash 3 nora jones dressing roomthere are numerous oneliners in like the old peter sellers comedies they are so plentiful you will miss many of them while you are laughing at the initial one this is a good thing because it will enable you to pick up something new through repeaviewingsif i have one complaint its probably the pervasive drug use its the only running gag mcfarland overplays perhaps if dopers werent causing so much havoc in schools in neighborhoods and on roadways they would be more amusing now however they are just wretchedstill the concept of a young boys wish for his teddy bear to be real presents a plethora of mirthprovoking plights and macfarlane pokes most of them as narrator patrick stewart says there is nothing on earth more powerful than a little boys wish on christmas eve except the apache helicopterthe rating for  b,comedy
a grown man lives with a talking teddy bear which makes his girlfriend unhappy the stuffed toy not only talks but he spews profanity drinks beer smokes pot and is sexcrazed isnt that hilarious this movie is for those who find this concept irresistibly funny the keyword here is concept because other than being foulmouthed the little guy doesnt say anything funny the dialog and situations are painfully lacking in humor and the film goes on much too long not only is macfarlanes script lacking in wit but he wallows in phony sentimentality and sappy romance making it unbearable wahlberg is a limiactor who is not suito dumb comedies he should stick with dumb action movies,comedy
is a smart witty sharp lined and hilariously offensive movie to which my hubby and i both busa gut laughing at we were still chuckling at parts 2 days laterif you are easily offended or unprepared to just go for a silly fun ride this movie would not be for you it pokes fun at just about everything and everyone and is the opposite of politically correctwe are not fans of family guy however do love american dad is a great example of the hilarious comedic writing  acting seth mcfarlane is capable ofcant wait for 2,comedy
to use wahlbergs expression from the movie and interviews his character john bennett and the teddy bear both have potty mouth dialogue it was with some reluctance i decided to watch a movie featuring a teddy bear come to life this sort of thing doesnt appeal to me but given the interviews i saw with wahlberg promoting it and the fact i like most all his movies i did see it and i hope you do too it was simply a fun movie to watch its not the first comedy ive seen mark wahlberg act in he was good in date night and the other guys though i did not think much of those movies not enough to recommend them however this one as ludicrous as the story may be is funny and delightful i think it is because the players took their comedy seriously and performed their parts as well as anyone could have if you can get passed the idea of a talking teddy bear and a foul mouth one at that watch it on dvd or on webtv if on the other hand you cant get past that idea you have more sense than i do but you may not be much fun,comedy
i went into with mixed expectations most of the reviews i had read criticized the film for being formulaic while most of my friends praised the film for its originality given the obvious contradiction here i really had no idea what i was about to see and in hindsight im really glad that was the case five minutes into the movie i knew this was going to be funny its almost stylistically identical to family guy and it translates really well to the big screen if youre a fan of seth macfarlanes unique brand of humour you will love this movie as far as the cast is concerned mark wahlberg and mila kunis are both fantastic as seth macfarlane is just awesome relentlessly delivering hilarious lines of dialogue in rapid succession there are also a few cameos in this film which are genuinely hilarious both for the obvious and subtle humor that they add to the film my only real concern with the movie is that it loses focus at times in the middle most of the scenes are hilarious but there are a handful that focus more on the drama of the story then they do on the comedy which bogs down the laughter a little bit too much all in all this is a really funny movie yes it does have a very formulaic plot and yes it does lose focus at times but with a brilliant cast and excellent writing this movie will keep you laughing and entertained rating 710,comedy
whoa  was a stinker this is i was so disappoinit is crude without being witty and has a plot that is so dull and crass that i suspect there will be people not seeing this through to the end there are a handful of vaguely amusing snippets but otherwise this is dull predictable twaddle and i cannot understand why anyone enjoyed this nonsenseimagine immature sexist idiots speaking crap and then replace one of them with an animateddy bear thats about it plus some ridiculous romance that is utterly out of placeavoid this film  it is awful,comedy
in his theatrical debut family guy creator seth macfarlane makes his big leap from television with always pushing the boundaries with his own style of humor the movie is truly downright hilarious as the director producer cowriter and voice artist behind the title character macfarlane makes offensive laughs on pop culture drug culture religion sex bodily functions and all things 80s yes there are extremely foul language some racism comments and some homophobic jokes but i wouldnt say it was really crude enough for the audience to hate the characters its pretty tame compare to the television shows that seth macfarlane creasuch as american dad and cleveland show some of the jokes do fall flat in my opinion example the airplane type scene why make fun of a parody that makes fun of another movie and dont add anything to it john bennett mark wahlberg is an adult who still lives with his childhood teddy bear seth macfarlane who came in life when johns childlike wish came true john still acts like a child with despite the fact that his girlfriend lori mila kunis wanting him to be more mature i thought mark wahlberg did a good job as the movies likable goof as the movie go on john must choice a successful life with lori or a life full of fun with while the same time john stands to lose it all with loris sleazy boss rex joel mchale trying to hook up with her and teds crazed fan donny giovanni ribisi wanting to kidnap him for his son all the actors did a wonderful job in their roles i have to say that joel mchale was good at being a funny scum ball role giovanni ribisi was just creepy in his role as donny the scene with him dancing to tiffanys we are alone now is disturbing about the plot i give it a b the story is your usual rambling seth mcfarlane script with lots of cultural references that makes sense or doesnt add anything to the story i love the running gag about  jon being huge fans of 1980s movie flash gordon there was even a cameo by the main actor from the movie sam jones there is a lot of cameos from macfarlanes cartoons shows playing supporting characters as well i love patrick warburton as guy i dont get what the guy is saying but its funny the animation on the film was great as the cgi bear look life like one thing is that if you do decide to watch the unraversion its doesnt give you anything new but lame jokes that deserve to be cut so dont watch the unraversion unless you have to like the title suggests this is an rrafilm this film isnt for small children i think most teenagers probably heard or saw this movie already most of young teens would have heard this kind of language and dialogue at school or college but still its shouldnt be watch with any children not mature or adult like to watch dont take the movie too serious just enjoy,comedy
i don t know what can i say for this movie because i only watch about 40 minutes of moviei m not even smile while watching moviewhywhy why they make movies with jokes that not even fun for 15 year old kidok marc can acting in comedies but tedcome onlike you listen family guy in bear shape and family guygod that s the worst cartoon ever even worst than gokui screw your wife with parsnip and sell it to the poor familywhat funny in thati don t understand because whole movie got similar stupid jokesthan flash gordon and ming moment cokehookersdrinkoh my god so boring and stupidmila kuniswhat can i say she fit for comedies even if i don t like that 70s showmovie its completely boring cgi it ok and only because of that and acting i give 4 but scriptplootfamily guy in bear skin that all its crap and boringdon t watch it,comedy
whats wrong with a teddy bear that can talk and interact with the normal world welcome to seth macfarlanes world he is the creator behind adult tv cartoons like family guy american dad and cleveland where dog can talk and an extraterrestrial alien as a family member it all starwhen 8yearold john bennett made a wish that his beloved teddy bear would come alive to be his best friend forever and it came true the very next day afterwards the scene shifts to the present day where is now a bear who smoking pot and dating many girls meanwhile john mark wahlberg has a job at the rental car agency and serious relationship with his girlfriend lori mila kunis somehow its time for john to choose between his best friend and his lover my appreciation goes to seth macfarlane who made the script directhe movie voiced and motioncaptured macfarlane brings us to a whole new level of dimension that we never go before its sometimes weird and another time is funny macfarlane would do anything to create laughter breaking all boundaries and mocking almost everyone in the industry in short his humor works pretty sick and well now lets talk about mark wahlberg all thiz time i always think that mark wahlberg is always mark wahlberg in all of his movies he seems only capable of delivering one same look acting and character but in thiz movie he gives me a different perspective eventually mark wahlberg is one of the actors who depend on his strong charisma and attractive personality in fact i also just realized that almost all his movies reach significant box office success thiz is an undeniable proof that people love him the next in spotlight is mila kunis kunis is one true example of modern girls who can say anything she wants while still looking classy shes not afraid to look silly quite the opposite she gives the impression of smart flexible and fun there are also some cameo appearances involving the old aged movie star tom skerritt the jazz singer norah jones and flash gordon himself sam j jones actually its quite refreshing to see a foulmouthed teddy bear partying with 1980s scifi cult icon everything is just spiralling out of control and it seems that they are not afraid of being laughed at thiz is crazy in a very good way in the end what if i tell you that seth macfarlane initially intended to voice hitech japanese robot cat mark wahlberg was originally meant to play nobita and the movie title should be doraemon well if you believe that then you can accept anything including thiz movie its not as absurd as it sounds maybe sometimes the only way to stay sane is to go a little crazy  visit my blog on jonnys movee  httpjonnyfendiblogspotcom,comedy
this is how you sugarcoat racism by sarcasm even if you delete all the racist comments there will be no change to the story or flow of the movie its there because somebody wants it there they just make it seem irrelevant and innocent the movie would make the same prophets with or without that b s somebody is using that millions of dollars investments to spread his own messed up concepts and plant it into the minds of the younger generationthe idea of a living teddy bear is hilarious and requires lots of talent,comedy
anyone that didnt know that this movie was going to be an adult comedy full of profanity and adult themes deserves what they got if you thought a seth macfarlane movie an r raone at that was going to be about a grown man and his affection for his childhood teddy bear good lord are you living on another planet the producers director and writers arent to blame here you are for not having a clue have you never seen one episode of family guy if so what were you expecting an r raversion to be like considering how raunchy the tv show isthis movie was far more entertaining than i expecthough i was hoping it would be mark wahlburg was just hilarious and played the role as if it was a real one lol its funny from top to bottom all the way until the end frankly after a while you forget its a movie about a foul mouthed teddy bear and it turns into more of a buddy film both buddies being utter fools its almost like dumb and dumber in that respect albeit a much raunchier foul mouther version add to that probably the hottest woman in the world mila kunis and its win win and thats what i was expectinghilarious movie all the cry babies should look in the mirror for the reason why the movie wasnt what they were expecting or hoping for everyone else will laugh from beginning to end just as they do watching family guy,comedy
mark wahlberg as an actor over the years has thrilled exciand enthralled me in almost all of his many and varied filmsso now we have tedi dare say that the younger ones will perhaps like the film its contents maybe not really concerned who is in the leading rollthen there is the rest of uscomedy for some actors comes as easily as falling off a logrobert de niro for instance can be a well hard manthen play a great comedy part in meet the fockers we love him in either rollso mark wahlberg has tried in this filmemphasis on tried to play the funnyman rollit dont work for meand yes you may disagreethats why we are all differenti will still look for his next film and just hope he gets put in a roll that suits his many many talents as a great actoris just not the one this time,comedy
this movie might be funny to the yehudies from ny but its not very funny to the civilized world the humor is not clever and not new the story is not clever and not coherent where was this movie going other than being offensive at times what did this movie really have to offernot humor oh please not a message about relationships they try far to hard to be funny by injecting out of context cussing filthy and bathroom jokes not very clever it would have been much funnier if they had tried for a less crass approach ive never seen a better idea trashed and ruined what a waste of a potentially funny concept disrespectful to most races religions anyone with an education its even insulting to prostitutes if you can believe that,comedy
seth mcfarlanes movie that was enough to interest me at first but the trailer made me go meh a wise talking grownup teddy bear could grow old real fast but then my brother reminded me that this could be like family guys brian and that got me interesagain finally i watched it and i had to go back to meh lonely boy john bennet wishes against a shooting star to let his teddy bear come to life and he does this turns his childhood into a memorable and fun one as shown by a quick movie montage but the trouble is that john grows up and holds him back from maturing upjohn and lives a semijuvenile life and teds girlfriend wants him to grow up and for that needs to move out hilarity ensues at least hilarity would have ensued had the filmmakers not tried to mix in a lot of emotional stuff into the mix not unlike poorly chosen toy stuffing not every film and theme needs to be grounded to reality  when your story premise is a talking toy bear with cotton stuffing the reality ship has sailed off the horizon the movie could have been fun as it stands it has a few moments here and there but i wouldnt recommend you sit through it,comedy
i was looking forward to watching this film the concept intrigued me and with family guy on the resume it looked winner all the wayi think i chuckled once or was that a smirk where was the humour where was the wit an opportunity missed as far as im concerned did the characters develop evolve or change in any way was there a point to this apart from repetitious toilet humour ive no idea what happened in the end i switched off after about 40 minutes it was that badthe last time i felt this disappoinwas when i found out that the tooth fairy was actually my mum,comedy
2012 dvdstarring mark wahlberg mila kunis and voice seth mcfarlane synopsis at the age of twelve john bennett mark wahlberg makes a wish that his new christmas gift a teddy bear was actually real and would be his friend forever twentysix years later after his wish was granjohn and seth mcfarlane are drug taking alcoholics that can barely been motivate each other to make it to work on time johns girlfriend of four years lori mila kunis wants to move forward with the relationship even if that means has to leave review writer director producer and actor of seth mcfarlane creator of family guy cleveland show and american dad makes his first live action movie bursting with lots of laughs or so the advertising campaign will tell you not only is the movie predictable but the best of the jokes are given away in the trailer leaving only popculture references and toilet humor remaining after years of being a family guy fan id have liked to have seen this film and loved it mark wahlberg and mila kunis are good in their roles and lori isnt being horrible when asking john to give up as he isnt actually having any positive effect on johns life seth mcfarlane comedy timing is as good as it is in his television work the jokes are played out well even the not very good jokes work however with ill effect the cgi on works well throughout the film only with one or two moments of blatantly obvious cgi the story is the main problem predictable with too many characters not either given enough to do and i couldnt relate to any of the main characters being only twodimensional there are a few laughs to be had though patrick stewart opening mono log is very funny and how mark wahlberg takes out one of the films villains towards the end of the movie made me laugh a lot i could relate to as a character asking myself a few questions throughout why does the drinking or smoking affect him not having any human organs why didnt he stay the cute bear from the beginning and how come hes able to get a job also i think as in family guy when stewie baby and brain dog characters talk mostly to the world no understands them and on reflection they are only making baby sounds or barking if was more part of johns imagination and the film being about adult acting like a child it could been more plausible and maybe the humor may have worked better watch this if you liked family guy cleveland show or american dad verdict a lot of hype made about this film at sixteen years old i would have loved it as an adult i can appreciate the work and what it was aiming to do however i didnt enjoy it,comedy
im not the biggest fan of family guy so i considered not even watching but after reading some good reviews i though why not and boy am i gladtheres only one problem i have with this movie and that is the casting of mark wahlberg there are so many actors out there that could of better filled this slot but i do feel that mila kunis did a great job and she was perfect for this rolethe plot of the movie is about a young kid with no friends who makes a wish this wish brings his teddy bear to life and very quickly does it show them in the future getting high and partying togetherthere were times were i couldnt breath from laughing so hard i would recommend this movie to anyone of the right age although i do stress that this movie should not be viewed if you offend easily the humor isnt for everyonea teddy bear that gets high and parties harder than charlie sheen why wouldnt anyone watch it,comedy
went to watch this movie with a lot of expectations im not the type of person that goes too comedy movies in cinemas but every once in a while i give it a shot to bad i gave this movie a shot im from holland so the fact that i paid 10 euros too see this movie made me stay after 30 minutes of it got so bad i almost felt ashamed that i made my girlfriend stay because i chose too watch this moviemark should stick with the actionthriller movies and shouldnt be able too make 1 more inmovie funny comment in his live its not his fault i generally like the movies he acts but his timing was way offofcorse it didnt help that he had too talk to an nonexistent imaginary teddybear but even so a truly funny actor would have made this movie a little betteri can be short on the fun part does rudeness equal funny dont get me wrong i just love family guy and rude jokes if timed correctly but not if rudeness itself is the standard for making jokes it just lacs inspiration i have to admit that the one time i really smiled the movie was playing his last 5 minutes and teds face was hanging like a retardthe fact i rate the movie bridesmaids that i watched as a makingup deal with my girlfriend about 10 times more funny should really say something about im sorry i wanthis too be funny,comedy
ok i should have known better than to go see this film it wasnt a personal choice instead i was dragged along by a female friend who thought the idea of a talking teddie was cute this really isnt my idea of cute and this teddy isnt even likable its much more of an irritant the boundary pushing comedy from seth macfarlane and his use of racial stereotypes in his comedy to get a laugh is juvenile and tedious im really not a fan of his humour and writing if your not a fan of his avoid this film like the plague on the other hand this really isnt my type of film in the first place so maybe im being a bit harsh fans of seth macfarlanes juvenile humour will love it i guess this is just the opinion of someone who would never have paid to see this film in the first place but as i had seen it i thought id give a quick review,comedy
this comedy starts off like a disney movie or somethinga lonely boy wants a bff and his teddy bear fills the breach its not as stupid as it sounds as the boy  john bennett played by bretton manley  makes a wishon christmaswith a falling star in the vicinity writerdirectorvoice of seth mcfarlane obviously knows his stuff as this plausible scenario is better than just about anythingsave johns teddy bear being hit by lightning or something in any case is now alive and johns bff we then catch up on john many years later as a 35 year old played by marky mark wahlberg with a beautiful girlfriend  lori collins played by family guy regular mila kunis  and tedas a bad influence on himworks as a comedy film with a narrative arc which sustains it that arc concerns whether john will live happily ever after with lori or whether drives them apartfor some reason mark wahlberg has a strong boston accentim not sure if that is acting oreveryone he plays has a boston accentbecause he doesor something in any case mark and mila have a nice chemistry in this movie and the presence of in their world feels believablei particularly like teds gaitas soon as i saw it i though yeah that looks right joel mchale as rex  loris boss  does a nice turn as the office sleaze as a movie its funnier than seth mcfarlanes lesser cartoon american dad and about as funny as an average episode of family guy so there were many laugh out loud moments in this movie despite the disneyesque aspects to this movie its really not suitable for childrenreally really really not suitable for children there are simulasex scenes between and a checkout chick bong smoking and some creepy people who become part of the story later on in other words its the kind of territory explored in family guyif youre familiar with that youll know the kind of humour to expect in this fortunately theres nothing that really drags in this movie as there was in family guythat whole overflogged stewie as an evil genius plot arcwhich i was glad to be rid of,comedy
sometimes i think back to that christmas morning when i was eight years oldi just wish id gotten a teddy ruxpin john bennett wahlberg is a lonely eight year old kid without many friends for christmas he gets a teddy bear and wishes he was real when he wakes up the bear is talking and he finally has a best friend 20 years later john has been dating lori kunis for almost four years and things are starting to get serious the only thing keeping john from taking the next step is his friend i am a huge family guy fan and next to the dark knight rises this is the summer movie i was looking forward to the most i had very high expectations going in and was not disappoinin the least i think it was actually funnier then i expeclike most of macfarlanes humor this movie is so over the top with off the wall references a whole plot point is devoto the flash gordon tv show from the 70s and extremely unpc jokes that you cant help but laugh at i could go on and on about how funny this movie is but this is something you just have to see for yourself i highly recommend this and this is the funniest comedy i have seen since anchorman one that i will buy and watch over and over and over overall an absolute must see movie unless you offend easythen avoid this at all costs i give it an a,comedy
saw the movie last night at the arclight in hollywood if you enjoy family guy youll more than likely enjoy the movie if not you definitely wontfrom top to bottom the humor and structure is similar to what you would expect from macfarlane lots of cultural references that figure into the plot plenty of crude toiletviolent humor much tamer than family guy though cutaway gags and a lot of heart even the music has that weird happygolucky family guy twist to itthe characters are performances are what largely keep this movie grounded wahlberg does an ok job but macfarlanes voice acting and kunis performance anchor the film and make you care for the happy ending for these characterssurprisingly the movie has a lot of emotional moments the problem is that unlike family guys sharp wit the humor is not nearly as sophisticaor fast and a lot of zingers fall flat overall its a good not great comedy with great dramatic elements but given the strength of 21 jump street the writing and pacing of the jokes could have been a lot better,comedy
i went to see at an advanced screening yesterday this movie is exactly what i expecfrom the trailer a good fun dirty movie that a group of friends can go and enjoythe story centers around mark wahlbergs character john who makes a wish upon a star for his teddy bear to come to life voiced by seth mcfarland arrives and they become friends the movie then quickly jumps to 27 years later at a time when john and sit at home smoking pot and avoiding real life responsibilities somehow and the movie never really convinces me why john has managed to date lori mila kunis for 4 years she is a hard working pr executive who tries to convince john to grow up let teddy live his own life and become more serious about their relationshipi thought all of the main actors did a decent job neither kunis or wahlberg brought anything extra to their characters but they werent bad not surprisingly seth mcfarland stole the show as sounding almost exactly like peter griffin he manages to make a foul moutheddisgustingcrude character that you end up caring about when hes in danger at the end of the movie really cares about john and the second half of the movie really shows their strong relationship unfortunately the second half of the movie is also when the movie loses steam while most of the movie is adult fun the final act becomes as equally cheesy and conventional as the opening sequence there is nothing wrong with a movie trying to tug at the audiences heart strings but after spending so much time playing off the idea that this is not a kids movie and there is no question this is not a kids movie i would have liked an ending that wasnt seemingly written for a small childother than mcfarlands voice acting the best part of this movie is the supporting characters teds girlfriend jessica barth has possibly the funniest scene in the whole movie when she freaks out on lori giovanni ribisi is great as a crazed father wanting teddy for his son he delivers an incredible amount of creepiness and some great acting skills patrick warburton although only in a few scenes delivers some good oneliners and is one half of a great couple the other half is an unexpecguest star sam jones had some of the funniest scenes in the movie and it was nice to see an actor playing themself really go all out in the role i think hes going to pick up some extra flash fans after the movie comes out the only person i was disappoinby was joel mchale who just wasnt given as much good material as everyone else he didnt do bad in the role but as a community fan i was hoping his character would have left more of an impressionultimately if you enjoy family guy you will like this movie the movie even seemed like a liveaction family guy at some points like family guy the movie will someday become very dadue to the constant recent pop culture references and oneoff jokes but that is okay seth mcfarland knows what works in family guy and he keeps the same humor throughout the movie theres some truly funny moments in and it will keep you entertained even if its not the future classic comedy people may be hoping for,comedy
this seems like one long family guy episode well it is i loved this film i wasnt expecting a complex story with many plot twists or intense action scenes all i wanwas a good laugh the movie starts strong with a good ol jew joke then the first swear comes in the construction of this film is pretty simple dick joke fart joke racist joke sex joke dick joke fart joke racist joke sex joke etc towards the end it actually becomes sad bad stuff happens to the main characters and the jokes stop coming that was actually a good decision from seth even though the only reason i paid to watch the film was for jokes the sad moment evened the movie out so now the movie wasnt just something that was creato let the writers show they are funny it also showed they had heartsgood movie good movie,comedy
i do not give 8 out of 10s often i am not trying to seem like a pompous ass even though im listening to kate bush singing wow as i write this review but 8 out of 10s are hard to come by well at least theyre hard to come by with the scale that i grade movies on and 8 out of 10 comedies are even harder to come by due to the recycled nature of all 2000s interludes postanchormandodgeball that being said deserves this honor if you can call it that wholeheartedly and without question and heres whystupid comedies with stupid humor have been a part of american culture since judd apatow first took his directing reigns and graced the silver screen with his comedic genius in 2004 and certainly falls into the category of stupid humor  at least at times but how does separate itself from everything that has been done and is already shopworn enter seth macfarlane the brains and voice acting behind the hit tv show family guy who not only directs this work of art with class and ingenuity but also adds in some family guyesque humor a brand that we are all so familiar with in all the right placeseverything you need to know from this movie you can find out from the preview therefore a summary and spoilers is not necessary mark wahlberg plays john a 35yearold rental car center employee who has a stuffed teddy bear and a girlfriend who clearly deserves better in mila kunis that being said the humor starts as soon as the beginning credits roll and doesnt die down until the conflict of the movie only a stonefaced gta mom will sit through this movie and never donate a smirk the plot is filled with hilarious oneliners and quickandquirky comedy that will have you in stitches that already divulged comedy is peppered into an actual plot stellar acting performances including teds and completely random and unexpecspouts of hilarityalthough the plot is actual it isnt strong clichd is the best word for it but i was not expecting a stephen king or martin scorsese screenplay the movie follows a basic outline of background information settingup of plot conflict rising action falling action and climax and the climax will make anybody who is a child at heart tear up  yes i had to hold back tears because of that ohsowonderful teddy bear the plot adds onto the character models nicely and the audience develops a care for the characters something that is missing from almost every recent film and is an absolute afterthought when making comedies the biggest thing that makes you care about one particular character in this movie is the fact that hes a teddy bear simple as that hes adorable funny and despite having a 38yearold connecticut mans voice cutemark wahlberg once again steps out of his cop fightah cop comfort zone and plays a comedic and sometimes awkward funnyman similar to the one he played in the other guys oops he was a cop in that one too regardless his performance deserves mention as does kuniss she plays a stunning girlfriend extremely well and the chemistry between her and wahlberg is a nice touch to the playful plot however steals the show despite being 100 cgi this shouldnt come as a surprise to anyone for the movie is titled after the fuzz ball the emotions evoked in the bears face really display a forward progress of computer generagraphics and the fact that wahlberg had to talk to essentially nothing for the length of the movie is respectablewhat else do you need to know you dont need to be a certain age to enjoy this movie all you need is an open heart and a soft spot for stuffed animals and the latter is optional although the comedy dies down within the second half of the movie the twists kick in and its a stellar ride to the end few smudges on an otherwise paramount comedic performance make an enjoyable film for anyone you will want to dig up your old teddy bear after watching this movie  i did3 for comedy gold 3 for himself 1 for wahlbergkunis 1 for inclusion of plot,comedy
i thought i loved seth macfarlane early family guy is some of the funniest tv i have ever seen i love the snarky humor and obscure cultural references sadly this movie pales in comparison to macfarlanes other workim not sure how this works for anyone preteens who get smacked by their low class parents for using vulgarity in the home would laugh riotously at this movie anyone old enough to understand the flash gordon significance however should have outgrown that by 1990 is it a boston thing do bostonians still laugh any time the word fck is used 75 times in a movie was this movie made for the inhabitants of one city okay two if you count phillythe sam jones scene was the only worthwhile moment in the entire movie its not that im too old to enjoy the movie rather its that i grew up it appears most people who rathis did not,comedy
id have loved to seen seth macfarlane take apart the rom com  god knows theyre an easy target  but instead hes just gone and made friends with benefits 2 only with an episodes worth of family guy jokes sprinkled about at random oh and one of the characters is a bear for some reasonits not that the jokes arent funny they are its that there are large stretches with zero jokes  just an apparently earnest attempt to make a rom com and once you get past the mildly amusing idea of a swearing pottoking teddy bear which gets old within about 30 seconds the character just becomes another clich  the love interests slacker buddyif you like family guy just watch family guy if you liked friends with benefits then go fck yourself you may also enjoy this film,comedy
i first watched the trailer for while waiting for a fantastic fear of everything to begin it stari wondered i smiled i laughed out loud and then i noticed the loud silence beside mealas my companion for the evening does not take kindly to profanity and is more easily offended than i either my offence threshold is substantial or im debauched and immoral ill leave you to decide however the point im making is that is very likely to offend if youre extremely christian shocked by obscenities and sexual depiction or just an innocent aunt nelly written and direcby seth macfarlane creator of family guy and american dad steps further over the line delves deeper into the realms of bad taste and would disturb the late mary whitehouse far far more than dennis potter or a clockwork orange ever did if she were six feet higher and in better shape than is currently the caseso will succeed in offending those who choose to be offended but is it any good yes but not amazingly so is it funny again yes but not as funny as it could have been there are a few moments that prompt muguffaws but it stands a long way behind the delights of last years the guard or even goon from earlier this year the funniest moments are the snap reactions a certain punch in the final act the horror of mr  mrs bennett when they discover their sons bear is alive but though there are regular moments to exercise the lungs there is never a danger of split sidesshould be very funny the core idea is funny the lonely bullied eight year old john receives a teddy bear for christmas and wishes it to life so that he can have a friend for life becomes an american celebrity then falls from grace and the two friends settle into a coach potato life of drink drugs and unrealized potential all of this occurs in the first few minutes and is explained through a narration from patrick stewart in a belowpar version of tom bakers outstanding little britain commentaries and thats pretty much how the film runs below parmuch of the comedy is vulgar and puerile but that was bound to be the case however it should also be clever and it isnt it could be subtle but its almost always overegged once we get past the initial superb setup the story is really quite simple and plods along bypassing every offshoot that offers depth and substance there is little of either here and that isnt helped by the actors mark wahlberg as the adult john wanders through on autopilot delivering his lines with almost the required amount of emotion but less like an actor and more like one of a group of friends roleplaying in college improve clubmila kunis playing his girlfriend lori similarly plods along without any real impact ten hours later i can barely remember any significant scenes involving her let alone killer lines the highpoint of her career so far black swan seems very far in the past joel mchale plays a greasier less sophisticaand more unlikeable version of his community hero jeff and even the reliable and reliable quality fallback giovanni ribisi is wasas watereddown familiar crazy although far from perfect the standout is actually the voice of macfarlanethere are some fun cameos one of which is an absolute delight one short and sweet and one dragged out strung out wrung out and washed out these three cameos say a great deal about when its sharp its bang on the money but far too often the team just doesnt know when to cut and move on there have been many examples of when having a one person star write or adapt and direct works admirably keneth branaghs in the bleak midwinter hamlet and henry v george clooneys the ides of march mel gibsons apocalypto but seth macfarlene is none of these and this is a classic argument against such control or egoif youre an easily pleased drunk student youll probably love it but for anyone else it probably isnt worth the effort and whilst much of the bad language is merely punctuation and down to lazy writing rather than for comedic effect it isnt a reason to be offended or avoid the reason to avoid if you choose to do so is that it isnt anywhere near as good as it should be or thinks it isfor more reviews from the squiss subscribe to my blog at wwwthesquisscouklike the facebook page httponfbmerpitog,comedy
i had read many spoilerfree reviews prior to seeing i typically do that as i am sure many of you have ill start my review by saying one thing it was not as funny as i had expecgiven the reviews id read i dont want to be misunderstood though this is a very funny film that being said have i watched funnier episodes of family guy yesthis film is basically an adult fairytale made for children of the 80s it is chocked full of 80s references that will make you giggle i was entertained from beginning to end i can usually let go of the real world when watching a film but even i was curious to see how they were going to pull off a teddy bear living in the city they did it wonderfully never once did i think it was beyond belief because of they way people interacwith the acting was great from all members of the cast similar to family guy its possible to be offended if your not a fan of that show the humor was crude and over the top but worked very well here i didnt laugh the entire time but thats probably just me i was entertained though and that is what i want from a film in the end there were also many great cameos that were very surprising im also glad to see joel mchale getting well deserved screen time he is a treat see this film but dont let the teddy bear fool you leave the kiddies at home,comedy
well i just got back from watching against my better judgement i might add and i find myself wondering is something has gone wrong with my sense of humor because for the most part that movie was simply not funnybut heres the thing i was among the few who werent laughing thats right the large majority of the audience laughed their heads offi starout by asking what was wrong with my sense of humor so let me say a little bit about the type of comedy to expect in most of the comedy is in the dialogue and the physical comedy plays a supporting role a witty script is usually the type of comedy i like but in this case it just wasnt witty at all the comedy in is like a magic bear doing stand up comedy only he its in a movie and not on stage to get the jokes in you have to be au fait with american pop culture american history american tv american cinema american social structure american current affairs american celebrities racism etc because for the most part the jokes take jabs at events from these topicsgroups and dont get me wrong its not that i didnt get the jokes i got most of them there were a couple references which i wasnt familiar with so i wouldnt get it they just werent that funny when and the rest of the cast werent taking cheap shots at the afore mentioned topics they were simply using the f word or making sexual references saying something about anal sex or something going up someones ass which surprisingly the jamaican audience found to be very funny i guess our culture is changing the bear was making sexual gestures or simply just an unapologetic attempt at crude humor which for the most part fell flatto me any waysthe rest of the audience seemed to be in to itso who knows maybe you might also be into it too of course the ubiquitous gay referencecouple isnt missing from this movie eitherwhat r racomedy these days is complete without it i am told that this type of humor is a staple on family guy director seth macfarlanes claim to fame you know the type of humor that simply takes an irreverent approach to everything and holds nothing sacred i have no problem this type of comedy cuz nobody gets hurt and its all in good funi do require that it is actually funny thoughmy last comment on is that the story did not seem as if it was something that was well thought out but rather something that was thrown together real time while filming like they were ad libbing it or something let the bear do this or let the bear say that there was just a natural flow that was missing,comedy
in reality this movie is terribly unfunny and plain stupid the envelope has been pushed  all the way down the sewer there is nothing smart intelligent or witty about this movie from what i can tell this movie stoops down to the intelligence level of a 5 year old to come up with this absolute trash that people are amused by the story line has heaps of potential the actors are great but this movie is littered with weak desperate attempts at humor the casual swearing is uncalled for the r rating i guess its so insulting to what it means to be mature it should be rag since i hear a lot of 12 year olds with the same sense of humoroverall the movie is an utter disaster evident by the fact that everyone seems to love it i learnt that people are amused by hookers dirty sexual gestures drugs and human excrement along with mind numbing casual swearing wake up people if you have even the slightest hint of maturity and intelligence then this movie is not for you,comedy
i laughed pretty hard throughout the entire film so that should tell you its worth watchingso yeah straight to the point i had no clue that family guys humour could actually translate so well into live action the cutaway gags pop culture references the non sequitors the new england backdrop it all works herethe character to me is a cross between peter and brian griffin hes like brian because hes this little fuzzy thing youre not supposed to take serious but you do and hes like peter because you know the voicethe film doesnt revolve around as much as it revolves around mark wahlbergs character and his relationship with mila kunis who are both very likableif you like family guy or just have a really good sense of humour this is for you,comedy
i watched this film this morning at home and i can honestly say its one of the funniest and best films ever a real pickmeupi have to declare that i am already a seth macfarlane fan and i love family guy so i wouldnt recommend it to my mother however as another reviewer suggesits quite like a live action family guy with irreverance in abundanceat the same time though it was also quite moving at times and the quality of the acting is really high when you consider its basically preposterous storylinei hear theres a sequel in the pipeline so im already looking forward to that thoroughly recommended for the over 16s and under 70s,comedy
seth macfarlanes boxoffice blockbuster is a hilarious laughoutloud comedy that hits the right notes in every department the writing is strong the jokes featuring are rofl  the performances are simply remarkable synopsis as the result of a childhood wish john bennetts teddy bear came to life and has been by johns side ever since  a friendship thats teswhen lori johns girlfriend of four years wants more from their relationshipi had blast watching its a genuinely hilarious film that never loses pace the screenplay by macfarlane alec sulkin  wellesley wild is strong  comes intact with rofl moments all through the pottymouthed teddybear is its trump card macfarlanes direction is fabulous cinematography editing  motioncapture are excellent performancewise macfarlane is simply superb as mark wahlberg is terrific as always mila kunis is flawless a very very good performance giovanni ribisi is marvelous as the menace while bill smitrovich  joel mchale are pitchperfect on the whole is a winner all the way very strongly recommended,comedy
this film is hilarious one of the funniest films i have ever seen  your missing out if you dont watch it d as soon as i heard seth macfarlane creator of family guywas working on a film i just couldnt wait to see it  i hope seth continues to entertain us with many more great films like this throughout the film there is constant laughs of course there is typical family guy humour which also adds to this films perfection i couldnt help but listen out for the many voices of the popular family guy characters such as meg joe and stewie and i did worry that wouldnt stand out from all of these characters but he is in fact distinctive in his own right and is a smart likable and hilarious character,comedy
i was a little waswhen i watched this and almost threw up a couple of times i was laughing so muchsome people might think its lazy or be a little critical because is basically a furry version of peter griffin but lets be honest its what we expecand wanis hilarious mark wahlberg is brilliant as well as the rest of the cast i loved it but will be more careful when i watch it again with regards to alcohol intakeif you like seth macfarlanes stuff family guy american dad etc then you will love it if youre a stiff or easily offended keep your distance,comedy
is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and a great comedic castif youre a fan of seth macfarlane shows such as family guy or american dadyoull definitely enjoy thisbut it has its own originality tooits not just a live action version of family guyits a very unique comedyis a very funny and very offensive characterbut he is also lovablevery similar to peter griffinthe cast is absolutely terrificmark wahlberg and mila kunis really suithe roles of john and lori and there was great chemistry between themi also enjoyed joel mchalegiovanni ribisi and patrick warburtons rolesis a very funny and unique movie that i would highly recommend to anyone looking for a great comedy a man who grew up with a real talking teddy bear by his side after a christmas wish is forced to give up his best friend in order to commit to his new life with his girlfriend best performance mark wahlberg,comedy
they made this work on so many levels too first the animation what its animation second if you like cameos you will be richly rewarded third if you like really dirty humor and less dirty humor and just plain funny dialogue and situations this is a perfect movie for you certainly it is family guy on overdrive and without the network in the way my son and i were in tears at times in an audience of twelve we all clapped at the end i clapped mila kunis is one of our best actresses see is just remarkable mark w is every bit as good and watch for giovanni ribisi one of my favorite actors i wont go on but i can assure you you will enjoy this movie some of you wont my wife wouldnt like it but thats a whole other story i wont burden you with that,comedy
watched this film earlier today enjoyed it from start to finish found it very funny acting all round was very good mila looked great as always film flew by laughed out loud a few times which i havent done in quite awhile couldnt really fault the film at all nice running time of approx 100 mins kind of hard to fill up lines here new paragraph should helpfair play to seth etc best comedy ive seen in awhile should appeal to a pretty wide audience film called killer joe out now too heard thats good well thats my ten lines of pretty much very little information adios amigos,comedy
just so everybody knows id like to point out that this is my first movie review and any constructive criticism is very much appreciaand welcomefirst of all i absolutely loved this movie the plot line was wonderful the effects with where very well done the humor was very seth mcfarlane which is good if anyone is looking for an afternoon of adult humor is definitely the movie to go and see the story about john growing up with a teddy bear that came to life is a very moving story and the friendship between and john being tesby lori was quit moving and seeing them pull through in the end was sweet the constant dirty humor and rude language and even the drug use was very typical of seth mcfarlane but it was still very funny,comedy
this film is absolutely gutbusting funny even though it has its emotional and sad moments it is always broken with the comedyseth macfarlane did a fantastic job with this film he really proved that not only can he make hilarious adult cartoons but also make very funny movies that actually have a good message to itim pretty sure that a lot of people went into this movie thinking that it would only be filled with sexual and inappropriate jokeswhich it does have a lot of but the film actually has a very good message it shows you how complicalife can be at times and how hard it can be when your in a relationship also it shows you how sometimes friends can hold you back from moving on with your life and that everyone needs to grow up and not act immature all the timeeven though it has a good message the movie is extremely funny i came out of the theatre saying finally a comedy that is actually funny im not going to give away any of the scenes because i really dont want to spoil it this film really does not disappoint but if you are easily offended i wouldnt watch this movie because there are a few jokes in this film that may offend people but if you have a great sense of humour you wont take it to heartthe film is also narraby patrick stewart and i must say he did a good job he has a great narration voice and even the narration is hilarious because patrick steward even says funny things that will have you in knots laughingi cant express enough how funny this movie is all i can say is go see this movie you will not be disappointhis film will actually make you laugh,comedy
a comedy is supposed to be funnythis is funny a teddy bear who delivers x raone liners does not seem like much fun but in it works something about mary has a cult followinga few rude men because of its gross out scenes so why not a little bear who smokes drinks and has a girl friend the hard core jokes come thick and fastand they dont ease downduring the whole movie i am not as enthusiastic about this as most other reviewers there is a touch of desperation when you need a teddy bear to deliver obscenities and to divert the audience the only real certainty is there will be a 2  and it wont be as funny as the first one they never are this humour is an acquired taste particularly when it is flung at you for 1 hour 45 minutes its like eating chocolate  fudge ice cream for 1 hour and 45 minutes you become sick this is a movie for people who enjoy crass humour what next  barbie dolls hangover at the richard pryor show ,comedy
if anything was going to kill the family guy wicked fun and laughs i just love in the work of seth mcfarlane it would have been hollywood dumbing down a sharp slapstick bad taste politically incorrect satirist by making his first feature film ugh m or even worse  pgworks on so many levels for genre mashups to work each genre has to work equally as well as the other eg a romantic comedy has to succeed as a romantic story and in the funny stuff a mystery thriller has to have a great mystery with proportional thrillsbut is a fourway mash it succeeds as a fairytale  most kids wished their favourite toy or pet could talk to themit succeeds as a love story  mark wahlberg and mila kunis the voice of meg in family guy have chemistry that plays out with a fair whack of realityit succeeds as a stoner bromance  and john are clearly best friends with a long colourful history loaded with hilarious stories to repeat as they get smashed and run every red light down memory lane thank you dire straits for that metaphorit succeeds as a coming of age story  john needs to grow up and put the bear down not with a veterinarian green dream shot l mean he has to put the bear aside  redraw the boundaries of how they spend time together now this he is a grown man and can remain and a wonderfully bad bear for the rest of his magical lifebut i would not go so far as to describe it as a homoerotic plushy love story the love that and john share is hetero at its heartit was great to see joel mchale in the film along with putty  elaines meathead boyfriend in seinfeld and boy oh boy  who know giovanni ribisi could dance like that his hips can bust porno moveswas there too much screen time given to the campy 80s film flash gordon possibly but it still workedand  i cried my other favourite part was homage to the family guys running gag of peter griffins fight with a giant angry chickenthe live action animation is seamless with only one sneaky giveaway  when mark wahlberg rattles off all the girls names to on the couch you can see his eyes reading autocue otherwise the performances of the actors with the bear are seamlessgo see hes a lot of fun to hang out with for a couple of hours  at least45 out 5,comedy
this is the first time ive ever seen a film run out of plot in the first three minutes it reminds me of watching a porno movie you keep watching in the hopes that it might get better but it never does what a sad excuse fora comedy id like to blame seth mcfarlane since he wrote it creait and direcit but there are too many unfunny references to jews which offended me too much apparently this is what a gentile thinks is funny please miss it,comedy
this movie was absolutely hilarious from beginning to the end especially when their lives were them being older singing f you thunder you can suck my d you cant hurt me thunder cause youre just gods fart that was too much i cant wait to see the second movie and hope its just as funny i feel life is really good when you get to see a teddy bear take a hit from a bong this movie was also hilarious because when got hired at the job and he cursed out the manager and insulhim and from doing that he got a promotion this movie just had me laughing terribly hard and had me holding my ribs finally this movie had me laughing with the actors that played the creepy family that stole and did some really crazy things to him,comedy
seth macfarlane writes and directs and if you dont like his brand of humorim sure he would probably tell you what to do with yourself there comes a time when some guys wish that his childhood best friend and companion could come alive well here we go john bennettmark wahlberg wishes his teddy bear could come alive low and behold a christmas wish comes true and john and best bud really become more inseparable oh yes can really talk and he is not shy with his opinions on life and how john should live his this juvenile movie is of course about the animabear with the crude foul mouth potty humor is nothing compared with more absurd and vulgar things that spew from his mouth john all but cripples his life with his devotion to to the point he has to choose between his lifelong friend or to keep the relationship with his beautiful girlfriend mila kunisalive the pervasive sexual position and poop laden humor may be more than a bit much for some viewers definitely not a kids movie and you had better like the music of queensophmorionic crude and lewd rar yes there are some funny scenes but nothing to sustain a good belly laugh is voiced by his creator mcafarlane supporting cast giovanni ribisi joel mchale jessica barth and matt walsh patrick stewart narrates and there is face time for norah jones tom skerritt and sam jones,comedy
i didnt have much expectations for this film especially after seeing the trailer not the r raone but i hoped not to be bored and it succeeded for the most part i like seth macfarlane in moderation ive pretty much seen all the family guy worth watching to death and i like american dad im pretty sure hes a guy whos said all he wants and needs to say but he still makes stuff because it makes money whatever its fine is a long family guy special and follows all his own storytelling traditions and tropesits a half 80s nostalgia movie and half modern partystoner movie which is an interesting blend though it means some of the references go right over this audiences head its typically vulgar and soaked in pop culture and most of it is enjoyable though there was a tribute to airplane which was just a remake of the scene rather than anything new it also has cutaways fantasy scenes and a little slapstick of which im glad was minimal saving it for one big fight scene it taps into ideas albeit not particularly profound ones very effectively the prologue scene was the highlight and then i slowly got back into it throughout the movieim always fond of mark wahlberg but the glaring age difference between him and mila kunis was pretty distracting though only because they had supposedly been together for 4 years already so she mustve been like 18 while he was 30 i dont know i liked mchale and ribisi though he came late to the party besides a few appearances the rest of the cast were shoehorned in during their introductions and pretty much proved inconsequential the whole film was pretty much a series of predictable sequences which couldve been a lot better if they had been piled on top of each other rather than one after the other but the climax was on the right notewhile this is not a creative decision its become clear that digital cinematography is something thats here to stay in hollywood unfortunately i just dont think people have figured out how to use it properly yet some shots are great but others are not cinematic and the production of the film becomes clear as day its not as bad as something like public enemies but its incredibly distracting and dramatically decreases a films production value and magic maybe its a post process or its a lighting issue but it just doesnt look good enough for cinema yet the social network did it right but maybe its because they used red epicsanyway yeah standard affair easy to sell thing couple handfuls of laughs pretty forgettable no big complaints certainly worthy of a 5 paragraph review i liked it 710,comedy
to me is one of the best examples of a typical hollywood comedy i think most people got to see it because its seth mcfarlane who made it so its not weird to expect something as funny as family guy well i just couldnt laugh my pants off i did enjoy the movie but thats just because its somehow entertaining same as the hangover paul and due date i think this movie is just okay just as lame and predictable as most of this kind but yet its enjoyable and actually there wasnt any moment where i expecit to be more than just enjoyable definitely not as funny as family guy most of the time is but way less awful than the unnecessary spinoff the cleveland show if youre chilling with some friends drinking a cold beer of whatever go watch it youll probably laugh a couple of times but youre wasting your time if youre expecting a strong and original comedy,comedy
is a movie that defies a couple of expectations first off its a movie about a magical thing in which that magical thing is made ordinary normally if a character starts talking to a ghost or his computer develops sentience or he adopts an alien the movie focuses a lot on how difficult this is to hide but in this movie the magical is just a fact of life that everyone acceptsthe other surprise is that even though the movie is from the guy who does family guy its not just a crazed series of sick jokes instead its a genuinely sweet though often outrageous movie about a mans reluctance to grow up with his attachment to childhood portrayed in an ingeniously literal waybut while wahlberg and kunis have terrific chemistry and the movie has some really funny scenes notably a double date gone wrong i never really got into it the humor is mild and once you understand that it will veer into sudden perverse jokes now and again just a tiny bit predictable i appreciate that the films creator wanto do something more than twisfamily guystyle comedy but i dont feel he nailed it without the sort of icantbelieveijustheardthat comedy of his series this is just a cute takeoff on a kids movie that never quite catches fire but its so likable that i feel guilty for not liking it more,comedy
 catch it b wishes coming true in hollywood movie are not a new concept we have seen plenty of movies where wishes come true and do something magical into the wishers life what brought change in these movies is defiantly is the rracomedic genre since the blockbuster success of the hangover and previously judd apatows factory movies knockedup and 40 years old virgin have given hollywood a hope that a person can make millions over rramovies these days is also one of those wishes coming true movie but with its rrating and a teddy talking nasty made is hilarious and entertaining i would not say that its the finest rracomedy but it sure is entertaining mark wahlberg is great in many people think that steals the show but if you watch carefully you will realize that mark wahlberg went out of his comfort zone and at times totally outshine seth macfarlane mila kunis is gorgeous i think thats why she was in it the supporting cast is good jessica stroup was waspoor girl needs to leave 90210 and start auditioning for movies in the end it may seem like a one man or teddy show but its not it defiantly a fun flick with a funny idea,comedy
first off  this movie is billed as an r racomedy so is evidently not for children i say this as some reviewers seem to think they need to tell people this factthey also feel the need to explain that this film features profanity drug use and choice humouragain these facts were outlined in the advertising of this moviein question to reviewers claiming that the plot makes no sense the world accepting a walking talking teddy bear and the jump from being a cute cuddly toy on the tonight show to a pot smoking washed up bearwhat the movie is satirising is the fall of child stars  lindsay lohan danny bonaduce amanda bynes macauley culkin and britney spears to name but 5as a child had it all worldwide fame wall to wall talkshow appearances etc and then the world lost interest and like so many child stars he turned to drugs etc when the fame bubble burstin review its an enjoyable enough movie  not laugh out loud  but a nice concept satirising another,comedy
the plot here centers around a bear that magically came to life due to the wish of a young boy after a brief introduction where we see this bear be a celebrity and the world be captivaby him we jump forward in time where the world has gotten used to it and life has gone on and now the boy and his bear are still friends but friends that some week work in lowlevel jobs and try to get their lives together in terms of plotting this is focused on the relationship between john and lori in regard how messes it up  it is a very simple plot that allows for lots of crude yet funny escapades along the way a subplot about another family who wants the bear seems to exist solely to provide a dramatic conclusion and doesnt really fitthis very simple plot means that the film will stand or fall based on the viewers sense of humor if you like family guy with its nonpc characters crude tone and constant reference points then the film will more than likely work for you if not then it probably wont the reason for this is because the wit and humor is very specific it is unfair to suggest it is not intelligent just because it is crude but it is worth saying that this isnt woody allen any more than it is as basic as pratfalls or fart jokes the majority of the jokes come from the creation of  specifically that he is a teddy bear who says terrible things does drugs and hangs out with hookers  it is a simple character in that regard and the humor follows that pattern the delivery is what makes it work thoughmacfarlane may be rather onenote but that note is a good one his writing and delivery of lines is generally very funny and it is telling that i never even once thought about what a good special effect was although he is because i was too busy thinking of him as a character wahlberg also deserves a lot of credit as daft as the film is or as demeaning as some of his performance is he always goes with it and his performance with his invisible costar is really good whether it is in dialogue scenes or in the more physical scenes likewise kunis goes with it really well and manages to do enough to carry the actual plot while also helping the comedyit isnt a brilliant film though and even fans of macfarlane will acknowledge there are bits that dont work or that really force the point for example as a child of the era i loved the flash gordon references and the silly extent to which it takes them but mostly it wasnt particularly smart so much as it was wonderfully silly and as a result i imagine many others will see it as tiresomely silly the plot is simplistic and messy the humor is mostly crude and the references are generally heavy but it had me laughing and the performances from the lead three are all strong as they get it and their delivery really helps the whole thing hang together,comedy
an episode of family guy might have more jokes than this entire movie sure i enjoy seth mcfarlanes brand of comedy but they are too few and too farjohn wahlberg is a lonely kid and wishes for his teddy bear to be able to talk to him and his wish is granskip 25 years and the teddy bear voiced by seth mcfarlane now a pot smoking foul mouthed excelebrity is still living with him and is coming in the way of him moving forward in his life and relationship with his long term girlfriend lori mila kunisthe comedy genre is very similar to that of family guy mixing together peter stewie and brian according to the situations the premise is quite familiar and does not go adventurous wahlberg has a good comedy timing and mila kunis sleepwalks through the role that she is quite accustomed to have to commend the cgi team for perfectly blending in to make him feel realit is nowhere near as funny as it should be,comedy
seth macfarlane creator of family guy directs an unfunny comedy which pairs actor mark wahlberg with a foul mouthed cgi teddy bear the films trying to humorously clash its wholesome christmas miracle plot with r rahumour but all of its jokes fall flat this type of juxtaposition is routinely done better in south park the family guy specials kevin smiths flicks or films like bad santa the big lebowski and even junk like harold and kumar 3our heroes are a couple of weed smoking slackers but their plot takes a slow ten minutes to get going when it does the result is mostly a string of clichs and none of our duos antics are as funny or outlandish as even the worst stoner comedies the film has one good joke in which our heroes discuss whether or not its offensive to invite jews to a party the assumption being that specifying that jews are allowed is itself antisemitic most of macfarlanes jokes however arent rude enough extreme enough weird enough or smart enough to keep up with the cutting edge of todays humourmark wahlbergs an underraactor in he essentially plays the same character he did in the other guys a funnier comedy which saw him playing a wounded doeeyed and bizarrely earnest guy mark makes bearablelike the south park crew  trey parker and matt stone  macfarlane seems to have difficulties transferring his brand of humour which is typically more hyperintensified than liveaction comedy to liveaction movies he tries to make as realistic and three dimensional as everything else in his film instead of making the film itself as flat as ie a cartoon this was the problem parker and stone struggled with in their early liveaction comedies most of which were unwatchable until they ditched actors altogether in favour of cartoonish marionettes and puppets 410  worth one viewing,comedy
is one of those films that you really want to love but it doesnt quite get you there the funniest thing about this movie is teds toilet humor which is consistent throughout the romantic plot that surrounds this humor seems only fit to please a female audience and transfer this flick from a stoner  hangover movie into something more meaningful but it really doesnt need to be to be honest if we had more of mark wahlberg and teds antics throughout id give this movie a 910 mila kunis character is slightly confused in her convictions and plays an annoying over bearing girlfriend whose only role is to smother her boyfriend and take away from what is actually funny about this movie ted,comedy
certainly it do not have a good story but the comedy was kinda good,comedy
yes i mean it after the epic the mask this one is surely one of the most funny movies i ever saw the performances are so convincing one should not miss it,comedy
i love stories though that seth macfarlane should make rupert alive to make friends,comedy
teda film by seth macfarlane  is a adult comedy that required a parental guidancethere is really only one joke in  a toy bear comes to life and turns out to have a filthy mouth and a taste for weed  but the movies attempts at humor can nonetheless be sorinto a few distinct categories there are jokes that are funny only because a stuffed bear says them jokes that are not funny even though a stuffed bear says them and jokes that may or may not be funny because of mark wahlberg mila kunis is also in the movie but she cant be funny because shes a girl and her job is to be amused tolerant and prettytolerant amusement is pretty much the best this harmless little picture direcby seth macfarlane from a script he wrote with alec sulkin and wellesley wild is able to manage even though it strives for obnoxious hilarity the cleverly animaursine title character voiced in an exaggeraboston bray by mr macfarlane himself is a fire hose of vulgarity ethnic insult homophobia and misogyny in the modern meta manner he that is mr macfarlane wants both to indulge and to deny the offensiveness of this material to wallow in ugliness and make fun of it too its a waseffort though the sin of is not that it is offensive but that it is boring lazy and wildly unoriginal if triumph the insult comic dog ever got a hold of there would be nothing left but a pile of fluff and a few scraps of furseth macfarlaneso the conclusionsis a hillarious family that required the parental guidance because a lot of adult scene inside a film and touching emotions,comedy
seth macfarlanes is without a doubt one of the weirdest movies that ive ever seen as well as one o fthe funniest r racomedies ive seen so far that has a lot of laughs and with it a lot of heart to it as well mark wahlberg stars as john bennett a seemingly ordinary guy who as a child didnt really have any friends and made a wish that his stuffed teddy bear could talk which came true and ever since that moment have done everything together and have been the best of friends which is shown in the beginning of this movie then in the present day john is now 35 years old still lives with tedvoiced by seth macfarlane acts like a child lives a hedonistic lifestyle and on top of that has been dating his girlfriend lori collins mila kunis for the last four years and lately has been in a complicarelationship because she feels like is preventing them from moving forward in their relationship and gives him an ultimatum which is that either leaves the house or she leaves him which he doesnt take very well then after that has a party at his house with a bunch of women which convinces john to tell that he should move into his own apartment and find a job somewhere then after moves into his apartment john gets so bored without him in his daily life like a child gets nightmares without sleeping with hisher favorite stuffed animal then one night john and lori are invito her bosss party when right smack in the middle of it all tells john to come over for just a few minutes just to see a childhood hero of theirs which happens to be the guy who played flash gordon in the 80s which leads to all sorts of craziness which has to be seen in order to be believed then after john comes back to the party lori knows that he went over to teds and is convinced that he loves more than he loves her which leads to their breakup john then blames for the destruction of their relationship and end up hating each other and not talking to each other for quite some time then after all of that finds himself in a creepy obsession with a little boy who wants him and his father giovanni ribisi who claims to be a  1 fan that is all im going to explain at length in terms of the story because everything that happens is too importantto mention and should be left to be seen for itself without being spoiled seth macfarlane is arguably one of the best comedy writers of the last two decades and not only demonstrates those talents here but also brings in a sympathetic lens to the characters in the story the movie of course some moments with huge laughs and some emotional moments this was macfarlanes first movie as a director and is very accomplished in terms of a modern comed its not one of the greatest films ever made but if you love shows like family guy youll love this movie,comedy
being an admirer of seth macfarlane for a long time i was hopeful that one day we would get to see him actually make a movieif you also enjoy the irreverent styling of macfarlane but want to see it embodied as one linear narrative that balances the absurd in an otherwise mostly realistic universe then you wont be disappointedbeneath the laughs we actually have quite a thoughtful story of a grown needing to choose between his new relationships tempting him to adulthood and his youthis an unbelievably likeable character and comedy vehicle that is also able to evoke great sympathy as a thing literally made for playtime yet must try and make it as humdrum adultone of the few movies that have genuinely made me tear up a beautiful narrative on the themes of friendship and ageing,comedy
is a 2012 fantasy comedy starring mark wahlberg and mila kunis and is direcby seth mcfarlaine who provides the voice of the title charcther and tells the story of a grown up man who wished that his teddy bear would come to life when he was a kid the wish comes true and a few years later the teddy would grow up to be a foulmouthed weed user while johnwahlbergis in a relationship with his girlfriend played by mila kunisoverall this was a silly film yet i enjoyed it as i never seen it before so when i spot it on netflix i decided to watch it as another film i was going to watch wouldnt work properly so i opfor this film instead glad i seen it710,comedy
is a comedy  fantasy movie in which we watch a man and his teddy bear which is alive due to a wish that he made when he was a young child trying to continue their lives and their routines when a serious choice has to be made he has to choose between staying with his girlfriend and keeping his friendship with his extremely inappropriate teddy beari liked this movie because it was based on a very clever idea and it was something that i havent seen before i enjoyed it because it had very good and humorous moments combined with some inappropriate jokes the direction which was made by seth macfarlane who is also the writer of this movie was very good and it had many good moments i also enjoyed the fact that he combined very well comedy with dramatic moments and romance with comedy as well regarding the interpretations i believe that mark wahlberg who played as john bennett was simply amazing and he did a very good job on his role some other good interpretations that have to be mentioned were mila kunis who played as lori collins john bennetts girlfriend giovanni ribisis who played as donny and seth macfarlanes voice as was simply the best choicefinally i have to say that is a nice comedy movie with many humorous scenes and even more hilarious ones i strongly recommend everyone to watch this movie because i am sure that you are going to enjoy it and i am definitely sure that you are going to laugh a lot,comedy
heavy flavor animation the plot is very compelling it is worth seeing i wish i could have such a toy,comedy
very funny if this type of humor doesnt offend you but also touching at times good cgi makes it easy to think there really is a talking teddy bear walking around but so does mark wahlbergs performance,comedy
by far one of the funniest films i ever watched with the creativity on the line with great work of visual effects and creative script seth mcfarlane the creator of family guy creates a comic masterpiece in his film debutoverall  45,comedy
is a brilliantly rude hilarious film that is delivered in a true seth macfarlane way,comedy
a lot of people gave this movie bad reviews but i am sick of political correctness i am not such a big fan of family guy find it annoying but this movie was cute there was a lot of crude humor which is to be expecin most films today however the movie had a heart a boy gets a teddy bear as a kid who talks both become obnoxious and immature as adults but when the stars girlfriend gives him an ultimatum to give up the teddy bear and grow up or lose her both the teddy bear and adult start to grow up i was laughing throughout the movie yes the movie was corny but people nowadays have become too serious and need to chill out that is what we use to say in the 80s have fun and laugh at this movie not a great film but still plenty of laughs,comedy
when i read the plot i went what on earth are they trying to say with this movie then i thought ok it must be just another comedy well i was not wrong with these thoughts but there is a bit more than those superficial expectations here but no this is far very far from being a fantastic film but it is more than a boring fool funny thing lots of the dialogues take us to some reflection and quite a few situations make us remember things like ive been through this beforemark wahlbergs performance is good and seth macfarlanes voices fit the teddy bear well sam jones participation is very funny,comedy
although i like seth macfarlanes animashows such as family guy and american dad i was concerned that this film would be a let down as i did not enjoy a million ways to die in the west 2014i am happy to say my original judgment was proven wrong and i thought this film was pretty funny reminded me of peter griffin and of course sounds like him too as you would expect he even makes an in joke about this in the movie i really do enjoy films which are self aware such as when acknowledges that some of his jokes went to far however i must admit seths outrageous and sometimes racist humour did not always make me laughyou will think that some of the jokes are pretty immature but you must remember that some of them such as the thunder buddies song were made by the protagonists when they were children so it sorta makes sense the story itself is interesting as it deals with the questions such as what would happen to once john grows up the overall answers to such questions are not only adressed but are humourous as you would imagine id say if you like family guy give it a shot as the humour in this movie is very similar,comedy
i didnt walk into expecting a masterpiece of a film i just walked into the film expecting a fun movie about a lazy bear and his friend and that is exactly what i gotdo not come into this movie expecting anything great just know that you will probably get some pretty hard laughs out of it and thats itmark wahlberg and have very good chemistry and it is very fun to see them together in all kinds of situations most of the jokes land and the cgi on the bear is pretty goodwhat i disliked about the film is the story i really didnt care about mark wahlberg and his girlfriend all i wanto see was and mark doing some crazy sht and whenever they decided to cut back to the main plot i was boredthe ending is also pretty bad it is not funny and it tries and fails to be dramatic so it just leaves you with this weird ending that feels like it belongs to a different movie,comedy
greetings movie lovers and movie makers this month we will be discussing when you are a fan of family guy andor adult humor in general you get exciwhen you see a new red band trailer for a comedy like and let me tell you i was on the edge of my seat with anticipation for this movie and watched the trailer several times showing it to my friends and laughing every minute my high expectations where my downfall jack the film lover says was funny but not hilarious i liked it but i didnt love it i expecmore and maybe even too much i wanto have fun with this one i wanto feel like the cast  crew of family guy  where going to elevate themselves to the big screen and get a standing ovation i liked the movie dont get me wrong but maybe they shouldnt have tried so hard to not be like family guy would it be so wrong to add a little more family guy even some cutaways would have been great its a fun movie and has its cute parts and is a pretty good buddy comedy especially if you are a child of the 80s and know your movies there are awesome references in there of some of the greats oh and flash gordon too mark wahlberg and mila kunis where great together and have a nice balance and chemistry on screen was funny as i expechim to be and the three of them do create a good comedic balance oh and lets not forget the amazing party scene and one of the best fight scenes ever captured on film i mean its right up there with the bath house fight scene in eastern promises what you havent seen that movie well get a bottle of vodka ready and watch it its amazing jack the filmmaker says is a tough one when making a movie to please the fans you have from a different form of media movie from tv show you either have to add more of that media or nothing at all there is no in between when trey parker and matt stone did team america they added tons of south park and got a great comedy when mike judge made office space he added nothing of beavis  butthead or king of the hill and people didnt respond well not until a new cult following that has revived one of the greatest movies of all time but in 1999 it was disappointing and now with i think we needed more family guy not just a couple of hint voices here and there and seeing the cast in live action form but a lot more or nothing at all i love seth macfarlane but it took me a while to start retraining my brain to believe i was not listening to peter griffins voice but teds voice giovanni ribisi is a great actor but oh boy did he make this movie awkward at times i wanto laugh not feel uncomfortable oh and jack the parent says take no kids to this movie well maybe if you have a cool teenager and you want to have a hang out night with them there are some raunchy jokes in there that might make the living room on family movie night get real quiet and awkward late teens will probably get more of the jokes than you do and in that case you might want to take one with you to explain things god bless the internet,comedy
is an american 105minute movie from 3 years ago and it was successful enough to make a sequel very recently the writer director and voice of title character is seth macfarlane the creative mind behind the longrunning television series family guy and i felt the humour in this film here resembled the one from macfarlanes trademark television show a lot includes an uncountable number of funny one liners from start to finish that successfully distract from the actually pretty dramatic story involving a longtime relationship possibly ending and a kidnapping plot by some psychopaths that almost result in murderthis movie brought macfarlane also an academy award nomination for a song by norah jones the very same year that macfarlane hosthe oscars but back to the story a young boy makes a wish that his teddy bear would come to life and that exactly happens in a night full of thunder not full of shooting stars the result is the expecearly on the teddy bear is harmless and lovely but 25 years later he has become a weedsmoking television addicpunk however his friendship to mark wahlbergs character john is as strong as ever sadly it gets in the way of johns ambitions in life and relationship to loriplayed by mila kunis in order for the trio to sort things out it is necessary that gets abducby a completely lunatic played by giovanni ribisi and his sadistic sonas i said earlier there is actually quite some drama in this movie but all in all its still more of a comedy quick shoutout to the hilarious norah jones cameo love her as a singer and she shows some decent comedic talent in here as well all in all there are a couple weak moments and even some plot developments that dont make too much sense like beating the crap out of the pretty buff john on one occasions but not defending himself against the fat boy and his father when they are coming for him still the positive outweighs the negative and in terms of realism we should not forget that this is a story about a talking teddy bear so its all very absurd and lack of realism shouldnt be a problem however if you imagine the teddy bear being a man in his 30s this could actually have been the very same film no surprise only sleeps with female humans he is pretty much a human himself apart from his physics good movie and i recommend it i will probably give the sequel a go as well at some point,comedy
this is worth watching movieone of my favorite moviewhen ever i am in stress this movie stress buster for meeeeee duologues of are just beggars description is a funny crude comedy from the creator of family guy its funny by default to see a foul mouthed bear drinking live action teddy bear by default there are a whole bunch of laugh out loud moments that said hits rockier ground in the final third with the emotional scenes failing to take flighttrue chemistry is hard to find and by some stroke of movie magic  or sheer skill  wahlberg and the bear make a pretty great team,comedy
2012 dir seth macfarlane  cast mark wahlberg mila kunis giovanni ribisi jessica barth voice seth macfarlane from the creator of the hit animation family guy comes a most unique buddy flick that opens with a boy wishing that his teddy bear comes to life this whole bit makes no sense but it results in some unique comedy situations the big joke regards the boy growing to become mark wahlberg who hasnt really grown up and becoming a pot smoking teddy bear whose miracle in the spotlight including a guest shot on johnny carson has faded central plot regards wahlbergs girlfriend played by mila kunis who desires that they move ahead in their relationship she wants to move out and get a job but instead wrecks havoc on their relationship to the point where all three go their separate ways this all concludes with a riveting climax where one party must correct a mental notion that benefits everyone seth macfarlane provides the crass vocabulary of who is a visually intriguing character in his movements and expressions but this is no kids movie parents could make that same assumption as done with bad santa wahlberg is appealing as teds owner who struggles with forging ahead while mila kunis moves above typical girlfriend role to someone dealing with a flirty boss and cleaning sht off the floor after invites over four hookers giovanni ribisi plays teds creepy stalker jessica barth steals moments as teds girlfriend and coworker tamilynn who has a sassy tongue theme regards the fine line of growing up and different fazes of friendship score 8  10,comedy
anyone familiar with the work of seth macfarlane will know what to expect a lot of 80s references and some very crude comedy here both aspects are ramped up to 11here we have so many 80s tributes that i wondered if i was watching hot tub time machine by mistake theres johnny carson return of the jedi knight rider and 80s pop the homage to airplane is actually a direct ripoff and flash gordon is embedded into the films dnathe comedy is crude and tasteless in the best family guy tradition although lacking the wit and inventiveness of that series better episodes generally theres a few big laughs but long mediocre patches another problem i had was macfarlanes tended to sound rather too much like peter griffin i thought that he would have more in his vocal lockeri guess mila kunis relished her bigger part being relegato virtually one line per episode in fgoverall an ok movie enjoyable if not very memorable,comedy
seth macfarlane is one of those guys who splits everyone people either love him or hate him and this tale of a wiseass teddy bear almost certainly did so is fun to watch just because it knows exactly what kind of a movie it is and lets everything out as did macfarlanes later million ways to die in the west theres potsmoking defecation and high jinx at work this must be what people mean when they say boston strong basically its an excuse to let your inner thirteenyearold youll like it if you accept low blatantly silly humor i didin conclusion it looks as though were not alone now after all,comedy
even the most sophisticaof people can have their immature days their isnt a soul out there who doesnt have a childish materialistic possession or hobby mostly shows how difficult is to part with it via a talking bear wahlbergs character john bennett is more manchild than sensible adult on one side his often lovable fuzzball best friend seth macfarlane is a bad influence on him on the other side his girlfriend of four years mila kunis wants them to move further in their relationship teds story is about friendship and how far that friendship can be pushed to the limit and push others away wahlbergs a funny frontman he proved how comical he can be in the other guys seth macfarlane has more difficulty conveying jokes through the animatoy thankfully most soar theres a lot of filler jokes to bulk up the running time and the humour can be crass rude and often bawdy being a fan of macfarlanes popular adultcartoon family guy helps but understandably his humour isnt for everyone,comedy
as a fan of the family guy series i came into this movie aware that seth macfarlane would employ the same style in his writing and he did exactly that upon reading a few of the reviews on imdb i couldnt believe that people would say that this is nothing like family guy this movie is essentially written in the same manner as family guybut we are not here to compare this movie to family guy i thought this movie was extremely well done with a well thought out plot and clever dialogue the performances by mark wahlberg and mila kunis were extremely well done considering that the majority of their acting was done by speaking to a stem with two fake eyeballs on it and seth macfarlane did exactly what everyone expecof him by nailing of his lines all of which had to be recorded in a studio and that fight scene in the hotel totally seth macfarlane style need i say moredefinitely a good movie if you are looking for a couple hard laughs and maybe a couple of dem feels this movie is for you,comedy
good comedy and first movie from seth macfarlane creator of the superb family guy very funny at times and contains many of the family guy nuances in particular the clever throwaway tangential comments the drama and action are fairly conventional though but i guess something has to fill in the nonfunny momentsdecent performances from mark wahlberg mila kunis joel mchale and giovanni ribisi and seth macfarlane as the voice of host of cameos  as themselves make the movie even more interesting nora jones sam jones danson tom skerritt ryan reynolds,comedy
a teddy bear that swears priceless is an adorable and funny movie its also perfect for anyone who likes to see characters that are typically supposed to be cute turn into raunchy little foulmouthed smart alacks mark walhburg was a good choice for the role of john he made his role as the loser immature pothead boyfriend convincing his accent for the movie made me laugh especially the way he pronounced the word teddy bear leading lady mila kunis did a great job portraying both the serious side and the sarcastic side of lori walhburg and kunis have really great chemistry in this film whether they are hugging kissing or arguing they made it believable that they were a real couple kudos to the production team they did a fantastic job with making sure that the actors looked like they were looking directly at instead of their eyes drifting off in another direction lastly seth macfarlanes talent as a voice actor was the key element in creating the accent and tone of teds voice really gave him personality if he had a softer voice or didnt have the accent i dont think he would have enough attitude or spunk and he wouldnt have gained as much popularity with audiences over all i enjoyed the movie and would recommend seeing it,comedy
the story opens up like it was meant for kids this opening kind of takes place for almost twenty minutes or so pretty long for a movie designaspecifically for adult maturity and then it strikes back at you especially if you havent been noticing the transformation montage video in which the bear turns from a boy bear to a schmuck the jokes are crazy and most are with very bad sexual intent but hey sure are very funny and enjoyable the acting overall is slightly above standards mark wahlberg shows that he can handle crazy comedies beside his usual action roles seth macfarlanes voice to his own writing is just a pure laughable crazy comedy mila kunis adds nicely to the conflict angle having sam jones is a nice touch to the target age groups nostalgic link,comedy
summary is an aboveaverage comedy with some funny moments 52100 cis a comedy film written and direcby seth macfarlane starring mark wahlberg mila kunis and seth macfarlane as teds voice i was so pumped for this movie and i had very high expectations unfortunately it wasnt as good as i thought squanders its potential with an uneven weirdly written script the simple fact of being a movie about a talking bear is interesting but this bear is a douchebag and i dont like his voice macfarlanes voice is so annoying his voice just doesnt match with the likable appearance of the bear as we go the black humor was tedious although im pretty sure that a huge part of the audience will enjoy the tone of the movie to me its just a too vulgar filmon the upside the opening scene is fantastic very enjoyable and quite touching i also liked a scene near the last act where and mark wahlbergs character are fighting each other it was hilarious theres another funny scene where mila kunis character has to lift a piece of crap and i found it wickedly funny the special effects are great the bear looks realistic and its design is so well done i laughed and had fun with but i cant say that is a good film is just a wellacromantic comedy that has its moments some of them astonishingly funny i also liked most of the characters the cinematography and the camera work also the musical score is jazzy and quite pleasanti really wanto love but its story is kinda uninteresting and some of the jokes are horrendously offensive it had potential for being a great pg rafilm but come on its direcby seth macfarlane so there will be a lot of profanity and blasphemy in it it works as a romantic comedy but it is a very vulgar one to me the script is filled with boring pop culture references and racist gags i just cant take this movie seriously also the ending is very silly and predictable it is a comedy for a very specific audience im sure that fans of macfarlanes previous work will be satisfied with this one anyway i still give it credit because at least theres chemistry between the characters and it made me laugh at times c,comedy
the reviews about this movie here are way too negative the only purpose of this movie is to make you laugh and it did just that whit me i think many of you expect too much from this this isnt a movie that makes you think or make you feel thrilled its just about a teddy bear getting in hilarious situations like getting arreswhile putting his middle finger up to the camera those scenes made me laugh so i think it succeeds in being a comedy at first i feared that it would be too melodramatic but its not there are few sad scenes and even those scenes tend to be funny to the people who havent seen this one just keep in mind that you dont have to take it all too serious this movie could be ideal for watching it whit friends while drinking beer im sure you will find it funny and have a good time whit it,comedy
2012s comedy hit and deservedly so it has all the ingredients that make it work the main one of course being our big cuddly crude and blasphemous teddy the laughs and gags are non stop making for one of the funniest film in years wahlberg fans will like this too where he plays a guy who works at a rental car place where his best friend and thunder buddy still reside with him and his girlfriend now comes a stage where threes a crowd where wahlberg must make a choice this movie is very crude and offensive to some and the manipulator of the teddy knows his stuff that lovers fight between bear and marky mark i felt in many painful spots there is one repulsive scene involving trashy hookers and faeces and the film becomes quite climactic and serious near the end as has been bear napped by a psychotic father ribisi who gives great meaning to the term character acting and his chubby son the dig concerning sam flash gordon joness acting was acutely funny where it was great to see him make a comeback at 63 while bringing some flash memories too the script is gold kunis is hot is side splittingly funny and wahlberg with not much to work with character wise does nice with a mellow performance while i liked the soups hale as a kuniss sleazy boss rex whos trying to get into every girls panties wahlbergs singing was really bad of curse does purposefully but was really bad posing the question could he be while being the hottest guy in boston be the worst singer in boston one killer comedy treat that will never have you looking the same way at a teddy bear again by the way i would really like to know what lou garretts disease actually is,comedy
made for kids no crude body fluid and sexual humor absolutely rampant alcohol and drug use yep hilarious yesseth macfarlanes teddybearcometolife with peter griffins voice and rracrude humor is a smash hit in my book all the subtleties of family guy are alive and well in this romp a few slow parts and some tender parts are mixed in but mostly its gag after gag ive also discovered that teds recommended job interview style is not recommended in real life not sure why i didnt get that job when i imitahis performanceanyway if you are offended by crude sexual humor or cursing or dont love family guy or other seth creations then this film is not for you enjoy,comedy
peoples opinions on the works of seth macfarlane tend to mainly fall within two camps those who likelove his work and those who hate it with a passion very few people seem to fall inbetweenim one of the few who fall in betweeni think seth macfarlane is a really talenperson and a very charming guy in particular i enjoy his music and interviews and some of his producing work such as the recent reboot of the classic science television show cosmos and to an extent i do think that there are a handful of episodes of family guy and american dad that are phenomenal road to rhode island as far as i am concerned is one of the best episodes of any animaseries ive seen since its premier nearly 15 years ago however despite really enjoying some episodes i dont view family guy or american dad as particularly strong comedies for me they are basically takeitorleaveit and i do have to say i really do not like the cleveland show at allso for me im a casual fan of seth macfarlane but far from a hardcore fan or a hardcore hater im in between i like some of his work while i dislike his other workso i went into fairly open i was interesin seeing how macfarlanes style would translate to a featurelength liveaction well mostly liveaction film and i am pleased to say that overall i think while flawed was a successful filmwe follow john mark whalberg a 35yearold man who has spent his life living with voiced by seth macfarlane a teddybear that was magically brought to life when john was a child while the existence of a living teddybear initially made into an overnight celebrity like many people his 15minutesoffame quickly dried up and is now just a regular old crude guy he enjoys spending his days getting high and trying to pick up women this causes issues for lori mila kunis johns longtime girlfriend who rightfully believes teds childish immature ways are holding back she and johns life together and so the story kicks off as and john try their hardest to grow mature and be able to separate themselves for the sake of johns relationship all while a creepy fan of teds giovanni ribisi tries desperately to get him even if it means he must kidnap the teddybear of his affectionsthe cast is a lot of fun whalberg and kunis are a joy onscreen and have a great chemistry teds voice by director macfarlane is a lot of fun although i think macfarlane throws in too much crude humor through which does make him start to feel unlikable at times and supporting roles by the likes of ribisi matt walsh and joel mchale are also a lot of fun in fact i found some of the secondary characters particularly mchales slimy character to be some of the most amusingi was very surprised by seth macfarlanes visual direction considering this was his first major liveaction production i found his direction to be quite slick concise and even stylish at times it was a refreshing changeup from the grittier or more realistic approach that too many movies even comedies try to utilyze these days and i will admit that storywise macfarlanes script cowritten with alec sulkin and wellesley wild does have a fairly solid structure providing a decent albeit basic storyline where all major protagonists receive a fair balance of screen time and development also the effects used to create are fantastic while he is a cg creation the effects are lifelike enough that once you get into the story you forget that isnt real and just believe hes in the scene with the other actors wonderful effects workhowever despite a strong production and a likable cast this film does have some major flaws which is where it has to lose a few points sadly and it mainly boils down to its humor and contentmacfarlane has a very specific style of sortof random comedy and his work does have a large amount of crudeness to it and that was a big problem here too much of the films humor was simply crudefor thesakeofbeingcrude and it felt like the film was struggling to prove how rudeandcrude it could be and too many of the jokes were far too hitandmiss usually as a result of the crudeness now i have no problems with crude humor but here it just felt contrived at times and unnecessary and it does take you out of the film to an extent when such crass rude humor is being shoveled into your face for no reason ill admit i laughed at a lot of it but there were several moments where i wouldnt laugh for 510 minutes and would just stare at the screen thinking wow they are trying too hard to be edgy and gross with the jokes and its just not working i really think the film would have been stronger if it pulled back during a few scenes and didnt shoehorn in so much contrived crude humorand sadly thats what took this film down from a very good 8 out of 10 for me to a slightly aboveaverage 6 out of 10 i really enjoyed this film but the fact that it is so hitandmiss from trying to force in so much crude humor is a big problem for a comedy i cant on good conscience give a comedy a higher score if there are so many deadspaces without laughs but i stress that i still do really enjoy this film and i hope the sequel has a better balance with its humor,comedy
teds an odd movie which is a good thing seth macfarlane brings his style onto the big screen and it is a welcome refreshment unfortunately it is not odd enoughit feels like the script of the movie was written by two people the one who wrote the funny stuff is good although the jokes do have a family guy feel about them so if you do not find that funny thenyoure wrong obviously but then it is like there is a second guy who wrote the emotional part of the story and that guy is not as good the really serious dialogue that is mostly in the 2nd part of the film can be terrible every now and then there was a line so clich and bland that my brain could not believe that the makers were just going to leave it like that and i kept expecting a followup statement or a punchline of some sort from the character but it never came and it does not help that it is difficult to take anything seriously that involves a talking teddy bearit was also weird to feel like a psychic as the plot was becoming increasingly predictable as a whole i would not call the plot to be stereotypical in fact the concept is quite fresh but in many parts it was easy to guess what was going to happen nextthat said the actors do their job ok giovanni ribisi especially awesome as the creepy villain the movie is funny and for most part quite smart and it has mila kunis in it,comedy
i dont usually make wrong judgements when deciding what to watch thus i dont often stop watching a movie in the middle this on the otherhand was not what i expecwith a score and reviews so good i expeca decent comedy but i stopped quite quickly  and that is really really raresmoking pot drinking junk food anal jokes bullying fart jokes it was clich after clich after clich until i just decided to watch something else its amazing what cheap crap people consider a good comedy these daysi wouldnt be so baffled if this was about a younger generation but wahlberg is older than me and from the 80s intro im guessing his character should be around my age in this movie,comedy
its got the 80s cultural references and peter griffinvoiced main character youd expect from seth macfarlane and theres a handful of pretty funny lines and thats about it im not wahlbergs biggest fan but the guy really does a pretty good job convincing us hes not acting against a cgi placeholder i was hoping for more ralph garman but the dude only had one flippin scene but youve gotta respect macfarlane for getting patrick stewart to narrate this silliness a flick about a talking stuffed bear dabbling in potty humor    patrick effing stewart that the guy even has a chummy relationship with such an unparalleled god means macfarlane has mounhis own golden chariot and is racing towards similarly lofty heights respect also the thunder song was easily worth the price of admission movies pretty forgettable but i still have that song in my head 610,comedy
in short great jokes plot is just used as a tool to get them all outobviously it is easy to say that this was a movie where seth macfarlane was able to take the voice of peter and brian griffin and just put them in a cgi live action film sure a person could just say why isnt there something new that can be worked into this movie other than the regular offensive humor and shock jokes then again with the cast crew previews it would seem that anyone with common sense would know that this flick would fall nothing short of a seth macfarlane look at me go that being said if you set aside the plot the movie is a real laugh i would recommend this movie to someone with a family guy sense of humor which most of us have and someone who is not looking for a fun night with a lot of care free laughs,comedy
the story is rather dumb and easy to summarize a lonely boy wishes for a friend and his teddy bear comes alive when hes 35 hes still hanging out with his badmouthed teddy bear friend much to the annoyance of his girlfriend who wants him to engage in an adult relationshipalthough the story is shallow filled with clichs and the forced happy ending made me cringe there are actually quite a lot of funny moments the crude vulgar titsandass kind of humor and the as ever gorgeous mila kunis are the only reasons to watch this movie if youre into this youre probably going to enjoy the movie if not youd better steer clear of this one,comedy
this film is mildly recommendedmark wahlberg and mila kunis star in seth macfarlanes raunchfest a smutty little r racomedy that became one of this years biggest hits however the films real star is a foulmouthed but lovable teddy bear named teddy hes kinda a cross between snuggles the bear and chester the molester depending on your own personal taste this comedy will either be an outrageous laugh riot or just a gross turnoff  i was somewhere inbetween  the slim story goes like this one day a little boy named john bennett wishes that his cuddly bedtime companion would come to life and sure enough his wish comes true twenty seven years later a grownup john wahlberg and his bud are still together although john begins to rue that day as the rowdy fills his life with enough debauchery and lewdness while ruining his romantic chances with lori kunis of course complications and embarrassing moments beset the characters and their bromance including drugs prostitutes and other hedonistic pursuitsthats the basic premise in this formulaic comedy which does have some funny and clever lines but more notsofunny and frankly very predictable scenes as one would expect to find in this type of film still both wahlberg and kunis provide a nice chemistry and there is solid comic support by giovanni ribisi joel mchale and the original flash gordon and ex playgirl model sam jones as himself macfarlane deftly voices and cowrote the hit andmiss screenplay  with alec sulkin and wellesley wild  this film also marks his directorial debut and macfarlane has done a commendable job in all of those departments the best moments come from the cgi which embodies with the right facial expressions and movement to give him a winning personality and make the character come alivemay be offputting and offensive to some moviegoers but if you have a high tolerance of this sort of offcolored brand of humor and sophomoric shenanigans the film just might be enough fun too often the film went for shock value and cheap laughs with a forced vulgarity as its primary goal the film never bothers to explain or delve into teds transition from the cute little teddy bear of yesteryear to the profanity spewing furry lout of today  now that exposition could have made the film far more interesting anyway anything goes in this movie everything is fair game and a comic target for macfarlane doesnt always hit the comic bullseye but it does aim to please those liberalminded moviegoers in the audience grade b,comedy
family guy creator seth macfarlane makes the jump to features with his movie telling the story of a boys teddy bear who came to life but now the boy is a man and the bear has become a dirty mouthed pot smoking slacker like all of macfarlanes work is rude crude and socially unacceptable some of what macfarlane finds funny could be seen as poor taste but occasionally there are moments that are so ridiculous they are funny such as sam jones the actor who played flash gordon in that illfa80s movie making a cameo appearance bottom line if youre a fan of macfarlanes television work then youll be at home with where macfarlane can push the envelope even further at times with an rrating personally i find macfarlanes sense of humor often offensive in particular his religious jabs and his jokes about those with mental handicaps but as i said above often is just so ridiculous it is funnyi give a 6 out of 10,comedy
its a dream of every little boy his beloved teddy bear comes to life this is no normal bear hes a pretty ahole a comedy well not for the whole family but it is comedy that sure as hllwhy dont they let you write thi some scenes are bullsht like the last minutes but at some scenes we laugh our s of the guys of family guy made a teddy bear that is perverse as hell the story is about this piece of sht and a looser called john bennett and he had no friend and he gets a living teddy bear so it start very cheese and john meets this girlbut she doesnt like so as is old an ahole he has to go and he doesnt like that and he gets pied and that typical family drama but the movie isnt that bad with the right humor we starto like it story510 humor1010effects410 laughing factor910 total2850not badwrite commits at moviemonkeyhotmailcom,comedy
i was a huge fan of seth macfarlanes family guy early on and even quite liked it for at least the first two or three years of its return but man has it ever gotten tired since then i was hoping this new project would rekindle some talent especially given its success with both audiences and critics frankly though this just feels like more of the same there are i must admit some huge laughs in the first half or twothirds of the film the gags are very family guylike and its about as ramshackle as your average episode of modern family guy but still its funny the giovanni ribisi subplot especially just doesnt work in any way whatsoever and it completely takes over the film in its final thirty minutes the relationship plot line that drives the rest of the film is better but its not great either neither mark wahlberg nor mila kunis ever feel like real people and himself gets old pretty quick i wont say there wasnt some enjoyment  in fact if youre interesat all id say its definitely not painful or anything  but its pretty weak,comedy
i was looking forward to after hearing generally positive reviews and good word of mouth im not a big fan of writerdirector seth macfarlanes other works like family guy american dad and the cleveland show but i have found them amusing at timesthis film suffers from similar issues i have with those works the comedy is often random mainly one liners packed with pop cultural references and toilet humour if you go in with this understanding there is quite a bit to enjoybut the plot is wafer thin predictable and the characters undeveloped the third act seems to be thrown in for some action sequences its all about the gags in the end but i really expecmore laugh out loud moments its a good concept that could have been execuso much better in the end you might have some fun but its ultimately a forgettable film,comedy
i have seen loads of comedies many are terrible some are decent a few are good but once in a blue moon you find a movie that is so fantastic that every person in the theater is laughing there heads off at every joke stunt and comical scene one of those movies is seth macfarlanes i have been a fan of family guy since i starwatching it a few years ago and i was excifor when i heard that macfarlane was going to be doing it but to be honest i wasnt suspecting something as great as it was i would watch a million times and still find myself laughing mindlessly at it it is a truly amazing movie in everyway,comedy
very funny i have not laughed so much for a very long time and that was even before the salute of flash gordon kicks in with a cameo from sam j jones remember drop dead fred the crazy imaginary friend of pheobe cates who caused all sorts of mischief well is real and is a party animal literally he drinks smokes dances with hookers and has never left the side of his best thunder buddy played by mark wahlberg as time goes by mark and his amazing girlfriend played by mila kunis want to live alone without havoc erupts creating some amusing scenes not soon forgotten is a comedy that the recent debacle starring adam sandler thats my boy failed to be edgy unique and most importantly funny see this now go flash go,comedy
tells the story of john bennett a grown man having to deal with his drugged up childhood friend who is a teddy bear and keeping in a stable relationship with girlfriend mila kunis i personal think that is a great film that could easily be one of the best comedy films of all time especially because of the fact the film contains such a comedy genius like seth macfarlane playing the main character himself however without mark wahlberg and mila kunis also starring alongside in the film i personally think it wouldnt have been such a huge success amazingly earned 549368315 making it universals highest grossing film in 2012 and the only one to pass the 400 million mark also in the film are many guest from great actors like ryan reynolds and sam jones flash gordon overall i would recommend to anyone that likes a adult comedy film or anyone who likes tv shows like family guy or american dad which are creaby teds seth macfarlane,comedy
aww man do not sleep on this movie my actual name is so i had to watch it and i am super glad i did if youre feeling like some people are and maybe think its a waste please let me remove all your doubts about this movie if youve had a bad week month or just havent had a laugh in a good while theres no way you can watch this movie and not laugh i rolled out of my bed to the floor laughing at that bear to the people who thought this movie up and mark wahlberg man i love you guys you guys are freaking crazy for thinking this bear up i would definitely watch a sequel of maybe he can meet a mate of his own ha ha watch it people watch it,comedy
i heard great things about this movie but was mildly disappoinwhen three of my good friends just gave it shitty review so i definitely lowered my expectations a lot before watching this movie boy was i wrong what i forgot to ask my friends about was do you like family guy ill bet they doesnt otherwise they wouldnt give this movie anything else than sparkling starsyou can say a lot about mark wahlbergs acting and as usual he should have stayed a model for calvin klein instead of going to acting classes however seth macfarlanes twissense of humor carries this movie to perfection  and of course the hottest girl on earth mila kunisthe plot it self is not something spectacular and you have a feeling through out the movie that you already know the ending it is the very classic mnage  trois triangle drama the childhood friend who hold the main character back from dealing with real and grownup life including his true love but  this is not the purpose of the movie the purpose of this movie is to make you laugh and it does there are so many awesome references to different characters from the 80s family guy etcit took me about 10 minutes to abstract from the familiar voices of family guy joe peter and to some extend meg  you know mila kunis face and voice so not so much her but as soon as you let the movie and characters suck you into this vortex of dark twishumor you have a hard time of letting goi gave it 10 out of 10 not so much for the plot but for the purpose of this comedyi have a major crush on family guy and the humor,comedy
after watching the trailer of like 5 months ago on youtube like a lot of people i was very exciand wanto see it i thought it was a good idea and the trailer looked hilarious and after wanting to see it that much i went today its first day in cinema and i have to say i was terribly disappoin the sad truth is that in this movie there are very few funny moments in fact most of the half decent funny bits are all in the trailer so when you see them you dont find them all that funny at all and the rest of the humour is forced  most of the jokes i found stupid not because im sensitive and dont like rude words or drug references etc in fact i think they can be funny when used right and how can you have a hilarious movie without some swear words  but for me i just think that the director goes overboard and its almost like he becomes lazy and thinks well throw in a few fks here and there and a few scenes with weed and drink and thats it well be sortheyre bound to laugh that however isnt true  half the script is about insulting other celebrities which is fine once or twice but it becomes repetitive and soon happens every 2nd scene which ends up boring the crap out of you its just like the director made those scenes for the trailer and said yeah well release this and it will attract people and then he just wrote the rest of the film while drunk or something  or else he got completely lazy and thought its a film about a 35 year old man and a teddy bear people wont expect a masterpiece yeah thats truei didnt expect a masterpiecei expeca movie that would be stupid and silly and just make me laugh the whole way through however i was really disappoinas it barely made me laugh twice  the ending is good and about 3 scenes in between are ok but in truth i would say that this is one of those over advertised hollywood films that for some weird reason most people love and it makes a huge sum of money  if i were you i wouldnt bother going to it truly is hard to explain how bored and disappoini was with this movie it defiantly is a massive disappointment and the biggest one in years for me as i expecso much more ,comedy
one of the few joys left in my life is watching the family guy and re runs of it i was instantly fascinaby its satirical humor and unrelareferences and cuttingofftoflashbacks and extempore breakingintosongsequences and while i was painfully watching its sheen and gloss fade away i was still hopeful of a few flashes of genius from the man at its helm so it was obvious that ever since was announced and subsequently released i was waiting eagerlythe movie let me down big time herere the reasonsmay be i had too many expectations when i was hoping to see a bit of family guy rub off on the big screen sort of stewiebrian banter and chatter their rantings experiences travels etc this had nothing of the sort was no brian and john mark was no stewie yeah there were expletivefilled rants and tangential chatter but nothing as endearing as the real thing may be just being wishful here if seth had stewie dub in for mark itd somehow had gotten everything to fall in place including the original camaraderiemila kunis is the centerpiece of this story comeon now having seen family guy for all these seasons whod like meg to be the main character every time john would go shout at for not letting him be with her i would cringe in my seat the moment i heard mila utter her first word all i could see was a girl with round specs in a purple hat all the time and mr seth you just cant let meg have that attention shes got to get trashed around and the bit that killed me its like meg and brian are being held at the same level vying for johns attention i dont care if its john or peter or whoever you just cant hold meg and a character like that of a brian on the same groundin the hall i had a jew sitting in the front an asian on my left a mexican on my right and a black man behind me so even if i wanto i couldnt laugh at lot of places if youre wondering how i found about the jew well he was laughing the hardest in the first kid sceneno impromptu songs i half expecto be a musical but too bad it wasnt the only thing that came close was marks singing on the stage and if thats the excuse you give me for a musical i would rather watch a tfg episode starring meg aloneso there you go mr macfarlane not so successful directional debut and yeah while youd be singing your way to the bank youve lost some more respect among your tfg legions,comedy
this movie was awesome i had my doubts about this movie but boy was i wrong for the people that didnt like this movie they probably had no business watching it in the first place this movie isnt for everyone if your the type of person that doesnt like movies with bad language alcohol sex and drugs then maybe you dont want to see this movie other than that this movie is great from start to finish it has good acting a good storyline and just flat out hilarious this has to be the funniest movie ive seen since horrible bosses one thing is for sure i wouldnt go taking any children to this movie dont let the cute teddy bear fool you,comedy
i am not really a fan of family guy american dad or the cleveland show so at first i was not excifor this movie after watching the first preview i automatically became interesme and a friend went to the midnight show of it thursday night with high expectations within the first 3040 minutes i thought that i was going to die from laughing seth macfarlanes brand of humor was perfect in this film and the character of is one of the funniest movie characters ever it is by no means suitable for children but i highly recommend this movie i have seen it twice already and plan to watch it a few more times in theaters,comedy
i will tell you up front that i am a huge fan of family guy and macfarlane and that i give this move a bruno wang 5 out of 5 stars this movie is without a doubt one of the funniest films released for this year the acting is superb and the entire premise music gag lines and some of the visual humor is outstanding even if you are not a seth macfarlane fan you will definitely like this film i dont know exactly what it is about this film maybe it is just the insane idea of a teddy bear that talks but the movie will have you laughing from the get go and keep you laughing for about 145 mins from a production standpoint the idea of the big screen as a canvas for one of todays top animation geniuses is intriguing enough macfarlane pulls it off with finesse style and raucous humor the film is about john bennett played by mark wahlberg who is a misfit kid who can never make any friends at the age of eight bennett gets a teddy bear voiced by macfarlane for christmas and then wishes the bear was real so that he could have a friend for life 27 years later bennett and are living the life of a bohemian 35 year old partier and his teddy bear sidekick bennetts girlfriend feels it is time for to go out on his own so that wahlberg can grow up and get a lifethere are a lot of drug references and a fair amount of potty humor but never really goes as far as even family guy does in terms of the shock value humor instead we are treato the macfarlane geniusthe rapid fire use of quips cultural references oddly placed cutaways perfectly placed musical themes and actual character development it is true that the three main characters wahlberg macfarlane and mila kunis who plays bennetts love interest lori collins hold this film to a higher standard the acting is very believable and there are actually some genuinely touching moments more macfarlane genius in addition giovanni ribisi plays an ultra freaky lifetime stalker of and in his pursuit to own for his overweight son puts on a compelling performance as the creepy whackedout stalker dude patrick stewart is the narrator and that just adds to the bizarre twist of class that macfarlane brings the main thing about is that it feels really fresh in a sea of predictable raunchycomedy that has flooded the cinema the past few years stands out as a true creative genius yes it has some raunchy humor and poopoo type jokes but it excels in layering smart and sophisticahumor with guttural bawdiness this is not a 90 minute family guy episode and its not just a set of running gag jokes this is a solid comedic milestone somehow macfarlane has us totally sucked into the reality of a world where a fuzzy teddy bear can talk smoke pot talk dirty and have a heart we are even treato a monumental fight scene between wahlberg and that is extremely lifelike even though it is a grown man in a fistfight with a stuffed animal you can easily put this film on par with films like team america from trey parker and matt stone it is the modernday lenny brucelike humor that while being dark and crass shines a light on the parts of american culture that many would rather pretend do not exist this is the true comedic genius of macfarlane he shows us what we all know but want to deny exists and does it is a way that makes us laughout loudi cannot stress enough that if you see one movie this summer make it you will laugh repeatedly for an hour and a half plus and walk out of the theater feeling much lighter for having done so bruno wang will be seeing more than once as the rapid fire humor of macfarlane requires more than one viewing to get all the short little quips and oneliners,comedy
first of all i simply cannot believe that this movie has such a high rating i suspect marketers have been at work here the alternative that many people actually like this movies is too much to contemplatethis movie insults me on so many levels i cant recall how long this flick was but it felt like an age in all that time i managed only one smile  when pretended he had a brain dysfunction and had effectively become a retardbut lets face it this movie is retarded to think that my 14yearold daughter was bugging me to take her to see this utter relief i didnt make that tripas it was i wastwo hours of my life and would gladly write this review to dissuade all from watching this rubbish,comedy
it was one of the funniest films i have ever seen i dont really laugh a lot during most of the films i have watched but when i watched this i laughed mainly during the entire film when i watched iti have watched comedies like hangover and the inbetweeners movie but this was the best film i have watched even though it is r rabecause of a lot of swearing but if you have watched family guy it is the same because it has a lot of swearing but it is still a very very funny film to watch if you like this type of genre of films my favourite scenes in the films are the fight scene between john and also i liked all the scenes when is working in the supermarket that is why i gave the film a 10 out of 10,comedy
i had read some of the early reviews of and it mostly got good write ups so i went to see it with my wife and best mate being a family guy fan for years and thus a seth mcfarlane fan i was expecting a lot and i can say i wasnt disappoin far from it it was refreshingly different funny unique and clever the cgi was fantastic you forgot as all cgi and thought he was just a character in the movie and mark wahlberg of whom i am not really a fan did a surprisingly good job of pulling off the character in the movie with some extremely memorable funny bits especially the thunderbuddies song i look forward to seeing this movie again and again and again  seth mcfarlane you are one seriously funny talendude well done,comedy
mark wahlberg makes a rare comedic movie as he stars as a 35year old man who acts like a child with a dead end job and a girlfriend he has been dating for four yearsmila kunis but cant seem to commit to marrying her and of course a teddy bear named of all names played by seth mcfarland as he also wrote direcproduced and stars in this movie with markas a young boy wahlbergs character was a lonely and bullied boy as he wana friend and got a teddy bear and wished that he could talk like a real person he gets his wishbut the bear goes from being cute and cuddly to being foulmouthed brash and extremely rude and plus has an eye for the ladies and one night at kunis place she finds him with four prostituteskunis has had it up to the highest breaking point when she gives wahlberg the ultimatum grow up and get rid of or the relationship is over wahlberg then has to tell it to whom really does not like it but has to accept it thoughgets an apartment a job at a grocery store and a relationship with a ditsy coworker still he cant get over not seeing wahlberg and tries to pry him from kunis despite trying to do it behind her back it is the focus of that movie is trying to see one another and be friends while mark is doing his best to grow up and pursue a commitment with kunisreally funny and no this movie is not for kids at all for the language mainly but still he is laugh out loud and you will laugh until you cry wahlberg and seth mcfarland really do a great job as buddies you would think that was a real person kunis is really good at what she does as the perfect foil to the twoyou will laugh until you cry,comedy
i just came back from watching the movie expecting a lot from reviews and trailers my hopes were high and i got what i paid for was both outrageously funny and had meaningjohn mark wahlberg lives with his girlfriend lori mila kunis and childhood teddy bear voiced by seth mcfarlane is about john and teds friendship as it is but to the ultimate test john must chose the love of his life or his best friendnow yes the plot was a bit silly but it made up for it with its jokes and humor everyone in my cinema was laughing from beginning till end yes the humor was very offensive racist derogatory and vulgar and this is defiantly not a kids movie but it was very very funny mcfarlane the legendary creator of family guy is know for these sorts of mind less jokes of religion race and sexuality but that is his style and in a motion picture like this it really workedi thought that joel mchale was very very funny and stole every scene he was in and patrick wahburton was absolutely hilarious as well both very well casis shockingly rude and hilarious and i sometimes wondered about the mind less use of drugs in this movie but hey it was the funniest movie ive seen in a long time but it is defiantly not for children or those who are easily offended for at least 14 or 15 onwards,comedy
its sort of awkward how i thought the crappy comedy of this year turned out pretty darn good 21 jump street and the movie that i actually had some expectations for like the one i am reviewing right nowwell didnt enjoy it as much if you like seth macfarlane humor like the style in family guy there is a high chance you will enjoy this movie if not you probably wont all that much for me i aint a big seth macfarlane fan didnt find this movie all that humorous the humor just seemed bland without anything special or all that original it didnt even seem all that over the top like i was expecting it to go cause if it was at least chaotic humor than it might have at least somewhat stood out but there is nothing witty about the humor toilet humor is fine if its funny but that just isnt the case for this flick somehow i think some viewers are just forcing themselves to like this movie cause they like family guy but some viewers that enjoys family guy came out disappoinwith this movie as well i just laughed at one part in this movie it was mad stupid but funny but that is about it everything about this flick was so darn shallow and sometimes dont make any sense in a negative way you can basically sum up the whole movie just by the trailer except with few more jokes thrown in than and there this movie does have its audience cause there was a guy in his 60s that couldnt stop cracking up but it just isnt for me might have worked if the jokes were at least more inventive and more consistent in one scene this flick actually has the nerve to insult superman returns now i dont think that was a great movie and i dont care what the critics say for this matter but its a much better movie than this one3810,comedy
there isnt much to say except if you love family guy or youre a fan of or remember the 80s you will thoroughly enjoy this it has all of what makes family guy so popular crude and childish humour with popculture references and unbelievable situations even if you dont completely understand the 80s references you wont feel lost with this film flash gordon pink floyds another brick in the wall ok that was 1979 sue me and othersits a fairly simple layout lonely boy wishes for a friend and finds it in a foulmouthed teddy bear voiced by seth macfarlane who is also the writerdirector they become friends for life complete with pot smoking swearing and broing out theres a myriad of surprise guests and cameos of varying eras including a large portion of the cast of family guy and patrick stewart as the dry and witty narratorstraying slightly from the path of the family guy formula stacks on the hollywood via rom com elements but fans of family guy need not worry as theres filthy humour pop culture references and insults of all ages gender and cultures aplenty,comedy
 which is precisely why i enjoyed it so muchfirst of all if youre going to sit down and watch a movie about a guy and his magic teddy bear i truly hope that youre not expecting a deep serious and profound cinematic experience if you are its your own fault for not getting what you want herewahlberg steps out of his action movie hero shoes long enough to do a good job as a lovable loser kunis  mchale are very good and macfarlane is macfarlane the movie is laugh out loud funny in parts and i giggled like a six year old in a tickling match at what i thought was the funniest fight scene ive ever viewedits a funny lockerroomhumor flick for folks who are not setting their standards too high relax get over yourself pop open a cold one and enjoy,comedy
the movie i will be reviewing is the director voice of was seth macfarlane it was his first time on the big screen in a movie he also has several shows like family guy american dad and a few others mark wahlberg and mila kunis were also key actors in the plot of the story mark played as john bennett and mila played as lori collinsthe film starwhen john was just a kid he didnt have many friends and not a lot of people liked him for christmas he received a teddy bear one night he wished upon a star for the bear to come alive and the next morning was alive many years down the road they are still best friends even after all the fame and troubles was involved with john and lori were in a relationship and always seemed to get inbetween them and caused several fights and even a break up had a weird guy stalking him and kidnapped him which brought john and lori back together was severally injured and they tried to save him but failed and lori wished upon a star and came back to life in the endthe scene was in boston and mark did a good job keeping the accent fresh and kept it going he seemed really enthused and made a good act out of it mila you could somewhat tell she was acting in some parts of the movie but the rest was overall good acting and seth as kept character and accent good the whole time there were some parts of the movie i felt as if the actors were talking to themselves and not but over all they acas if they were actually living and the fights anger and other parts seemed realisticthe movie expressed several scenes where music back grounds and other effects seemed to go along with the story in the beginning when they were older the movie was very bright happy back ground and so on when was kidnapped the house was dark gloomy older house with a creepy background like from a horror film when died it was a stormy night and lightning and thunder filled the sound and screen which made it a sad angry dayi would overall say it is a good movie from the review you probably think it is a kid movie but it is far from that there is drugs alcohol adult comedy and should not be viewed by a younger audience but i would highly recommend this movie to someone wanting to see a comedy,comedy
whenever youre in doubt that something is wrong with the gender roles presenin a movie do this reverse them now try figuring this out and imagine a story in which a girl cant get rid of her whining doll  and now ask yourself whether this would be fun for a guy and whether he would put up with the woman and her doll i hope the answer is notthis could have been a sweet comedy about how this 35yearold man cannot let go of both his childishness and his adultescent sense of irresponsibility instead it turns into a pathetic portrayal of a pathetic man and into a message for us girls to accept guys like this no matter whatwe of course must be mature and responsible for them and well their teddy bears no dolls,comedy
watching it took me all the way back to my long ago childhood when i had a teddy bear i certainly envied mark wahlberg for getting his christmas wish of course the story involves mark possibly outgrowing the need for a talking teddy bear and that song from my childhood me and my teddy bear kept running through my headis a charming fantasy about a young boy who grows up to be mark wahlberg wishing for and getting his teddy bear to turn into a live creature the bear named of course grows up with wahlberg and the childish pleasures they shared are now adult pleasures some very adult pleasuresall this is coming between wahlberg and the girl he loves mila kunis she gives him an understandable ultimatum me or the bear as is truly a unique creature no one in the history of planet earth was ever faced with that choice how mark resolves it is for you to see in the movieif you do see it id think long and hard about taking minor kids to it is funny but funny for adultsi have to single out giovanni ribisi and young aedin mincks who if wahlberg is ready to give up theyll have him these two will creep you out and no one i would hold near and dear would get near them also seth mcfarlane was great in his creation of both in voice and animationnice enjoyable film but not one for the kids,comedy
wouldve loved to given the film more stars due to a pretty nice story line  however as usual seth mcfarlane just cant resist showing viewers how much garbage can be showcased out of one persons mouth  mind notice i didnt say braintheres something really sick in an unhealthy way when someone messes around wa childs most wholesome toy and drag it through such pornoladen filth im more worried about mcfarlanes fantasies than kevin clashs current alleged misdeedsin my mind the academy stooping so low as to nominate any part of this film for any award at all shows how sad their standards have fallenmcfarlanes creativity is so unevolved its an insult to viewers who hoped for some redemptive power to attach itself to an otherwise nice story by turning it into a hate fest against any type of decency in any level of relationships mark wahlberg and patrick stewart  shame on you for wasting your time and talent on such a lowdown piece of cinematic filth  waste of celluloid particularly offensive after reading a recent peoples articles on how wholesome and well whatever wahlberg hopes to be as a family man for his kids uh huh yeah move over wahlbergcreating filth like this does little to make that believable,comedy
is a family guy fans dream its a feature length film filled with fun characters played by the actors of family guy what more could you ask for the feel to the film is a lot like a long episode of family guy is often a slow witbut comedic guy a lot like peter griffin i find it fitting how theyre voiced by the same guy theres a lot of swearing drinking silly humor profanity and sexual content much like an unrafamily guy episode the characters even seem to originate from family guy theres john who is like an older version of stewie with being ruebert the bear lori is like lois and her boss is like quagmire or brian constantly after her theres a creepy fat kid who is like a mix of chris and the jewish kid and his father is like mort but it is still original and seth macfarlane does a good job at directing a feature length film unfortanatley ive seen a lot of reviews for this movie that dont appreciate its crude and slap stick comedy but fans like me consider it to be one of the funniest movies ever made so i say check it out,comedy
family guy creator seth macfarlanes debut feature is crass and sexist it wallows in nostalgia flirts with racism spends too much time scampering after a plot its also the funniest film of 2012 a raucous insult to good taste and good sense that warps the template of the american boyman comedy into horrible new shapes a cuddly toy bear brought to life after a wish upon a star  is a miracle turned sour the public got bored of sentient teddy hes become a grizzled former celebrity  a tired little weedsmoking beerswilling teddy bear he spends his days on the sofa distracting his childhood buddy john mark wahlberg from committing to his girlfriend lori mila kunisits been said that macfarlane will aim his vicious wit at anyone except the white middleclass male but is as much about the frustranature of wastrels like john as it is a showcase for the world view of a gratuitously obscene teddy bear macfarlane makes it clear  after all the cruel jokes and bitchy asides  that john isnt happy hasnt been for a long time and teds the reason john starts to see for what he is a weary boston meat head made funnier and sadder for being trapped in the body of a childrens toy its in the dissolution of their longterm friendship that the film really bitesif you need to intellectualize your enjoyment of macfarlanes comedy further you could point to the tragedy of teds ageless existence or the directors skewering of a society that so quickly tires of an anthropomorphic teddy bear or you could just laugh until your stitches burst at a whackedout cuddly toy extolling the merits of a strain of weed called theyre coming theyre coming i did,comedy
what the hell happened to the sharp topical intelligent genrebashing and generally hilarious humour we have come to expect from renaissance man and parttime crooner of broadway show tunes seth macfarlane instead we get a big budget lowintelligence loud crass insulting mess of a film mark wahlberg was horribly miscast and sleptwalked through the entire thing usually wearing a tight tshirt that showed off his big biceps mila kunis was perky yet pssedoff throughout though she gets one star for her unprecedenuse of the c word but that can hardly be seen as a redeeming factor in the grand scheme of things and the main protagonist had a very short humour shelflife i would probably had a more enriching experience sitting though an episode of the adventures of teddy ruxpin which incidentally and perhaps inevitably gets quoby in this big fat wasteofbloodandorgans of a film,comedy
from family guy creator seth macfarlane comes a very solid comedy about the overdependent relationship between john mark wahlberg and his walking talking swearhappy bongsmoking teddy bear voiced by macfarlane his girlfriend mila kunis is unhappy with teds disruptive influence and john has to make the uncomfortable decision about having to grow up while merrily delivering all the coarse antipc humour the family guy fanbase have a right to expect the best thing about is also its biggest surprise  it has real heart in lesser hands this could so easily have been a throwaway onejoke movie yet actually develops into a fullbodied tale about friendship as macfarlane actually makes you care about the relationship between john and his boyhood bearthe films topshelf visual effects go a long way to making the premise work but what ultimately sells it is the quality of the direction despite the fact that hes a stuffed toy hes actually more credible than the cardboard characters that populate most romcoms beneath all the naughty jokes and signature pop culture references  just watch the sales of flash gordon dvds skyrocket  you really care for this bear as a rewatch 06 14 19 remains a highly entertaining comedy,comedy
 it has been awhile after my last watching wasnt really my ultimate choice for this weekends outing movie moment but it surely relaxed and gave such a pleasure for a full week of stress missing the eid away from my beloved parents did help me putting a little smile on my face it was miraculously funny amazingly hilarious i love the plot plus with every goodlooking awesome famous stars in it lot of amazing special appearances i might say it was well done and a bit emotional you gonna love it though it wasnt some kind of movie you will be dying to watch i still remember some part where i cant stop laughing for a quite some times and seriously although it was clich and too often to watch upon there are lot of reasons to love this movie things that gonna make your day just great and to those friends of mine out there i really want you to watch this movie because someday youll gonna be reminded about friendship a real one out of five i gonna give 3 and another half for the cameos including the last picture you gonna see in this movie ,comedy
is basically brian out of family guy not a funny character really but did get a couple 2 laughs out of this film i wouldnt recommend it maybe watch it when it eventually comes on tellyi was expecting a long and hilarious comedy which could compare to family guy but feel let downi do not rate the lead actor i find him boring at the best of times and this film did not give him much to work withmila kunis however was fantastic very good actressso 2 out of ten just because i was disappointed,comedy
very overrateda poor attempt at being a comedy if your looking for a movie that actually delivers the funny here are some good comedies risky businessswingersborat and office space summary a teddy bear comes to life and does stupid shtacting mark has a shty accent but giovanni ribisi does an excellent job as a creepy guy his scenes are worth watchingmila kunis is just reading words of a script and the bear seth macfarlaneis nearly as annoying as mark wahlbergoverall lame jokes shtty accents but their where a few funny scenesi dont get why it got 710 thats just ridiculous its worth watching just dont expect a good comedy at best a mediocre one,comedy
let me start by saying i was dreading seeing this film i was dragged along reluctantly by my boyfriend who loves seth mcfarlanes humour i had been expecting overthetop crude comedy with sickening comments from the seemingly vulgar i was actually surprised by the lack of this every review id read previous to seeing the film claimed it was the crudest comedy of the year and it was not for the fainthearnow since i am a fainthearkind of girl with no real amusement in crudeness you can imagine how i feltthe film starts well with a really funny parody of childrens fairy tales and unlike most films leads into the main storyline pretty swiftly not dwelling too long on the childhood of wahlbergs character john the crude humour referenced in all the reviews you may have read is actually mild and there are only three comments that are actually as vulgar as you were led to imagine in my opinion much to my surprise the film is less about the crudeness and more about the overtly hilarious gags now i didnt personally laugh as much as the film may have liked and neither did the audience but there were some laughoutloud moments mostly referring to some celebritywahlberg was good in a comedy role although i think hes better suito actions i may be alone in that opinion considering most reviews are praising his comedy skills but i felt some jokes were a little stiff kunis was brilliant shes always hilarious without seeming overthetop however the standout performance had to have been ribisi as the psychotic fanboy his scenes made me laugh the most in particular a brilliant dance scene it had the whole cinema in stitches while i was pleasantly surprised by how tame was after having heard so much hyped reviews about its vulgarity i would not see this film again for a long time if ever its sort of heartwarming in a really strange way although i starthe film hating mostly because i had preconceived ideas of how crude he would be throughout the film if youre fainthearand avoiding this film out of disgust i would recommend you see it because its not as bad as you think if youre a fan of mcfarlanes sitcoms family guy american dad etc you should definitely see this its a noholds barred comedy with all the usual gags featured in the show and mcfarlane is really brilliant voicing the only reason for my vote being 510 is simply because it didnt make me laugh as much as the rest of the audience it just isnt my sort of humour although i laughed more than i had expecto,comedy
the real problems i had with 1 ive practically seen half of it in the movie trailers already so there was very little in the way of surprises and 2 the damn bear sounds identical to peter griffin and even jokes about that fact now i am the biggest family guy fan and always get its humor and wonder why seth mcfarlane hasnt put the damn fam guy movie out yet dont be like the simpsons and put out the movie long after people stopped watching the show was ok but after watching family guy since 1999 it just wasnt that outrageous to me there just wasnt anything i really guffawed at only a few chuckles i would rather even have had an american dad movie than this mcfarlane did at least give many fam guy actors and writers parts in this movie but again they would be better in a freakin fam guy movie tedits worth a rental but thats about it,comedy
last night i went to watch the movie which is seth mcfarlanes first attempt at a feature film and in this case attempt is actually a more accurate term than film the humor is decent at times and i remember laughing out loud at a few scenes but the movie feels so empty and hollow it feels like its not an actual movie and more like a long episode of family guy especially considering that the only funny jokes in this movie are the flashbacks the characters have a family guy trademarkthe plot is very slow moving if there is one in the first place and the movie never picks up any pace it never excites you or surprises you the ending is one of the cheesiest endings in film history sure the character work is alright and none of the actors are bad at what they do but the film is overall a huge letdown which leaves nothing behind i had brought up my hopes for this one if you just want to watch something mindless on a saturday night is a nice option but if you want to watch an actual movie go see batman instead,comedy
liked much of the movie very much  not every plot point is revealed in the trailer for one thing for another while it was raunchy and foulmouthed it wasnt disgusting well except in one part so it didnt annoy me quite as much as bridesmaids did last year it makes many insightful comments on mid80s culture or lack thereof and on celebrities it does fall apart a little about 23rds of the way through when it generally stopped being so funny and startaking itself a little too seriously while i dont care for seth mcfarlanes tv work i enjoyed most of and think he like ben affleck has a great ear for the south boston style of speech and attitude,comedy
where to begin i loved this movie i laughed so hard i had to watch it twice mark wahlberg is a great actor and he plays the innocent dumb ass better than anyone else he is so believable in this film that i felt it made it even funnier the bear was hysterical also i love slap stick and raunchy humor i was wiping tears when and mark get in a fist fight i really didnt pay that close of attention to character development in this film because i was laughing so hard mila is always hot and can act too so she was awesome as the leading lady i also liked teds girlfriend if you want a feel good laugh until you cry movie then go see this one,comedy
im going to try and make this short and simple reasons for 10  1 this is a great movie to watch in theaters you get to burst out laughing as loud as you can because literally everyone else is doing the same thing2 the plots of comedies are hardly ever very good because the main focus is laughter but will keep you glued to your seat i had to pee so bad halfway through i could barely stand it but i didnt want to miss any of it so i waited3 bonus if youre a family guy fan youll love that it has most of the main voice actors from the show in it and it contains a couple or few references to it as wellgo see it you wont regret it,comedy
i put that my review has spoilers but will try not to spoil this movie for anyonethis movie is exactly what i expecit to be if you like what you see in the trailers you will love this movie i have not written a review in quite awhile on imdb but this movie has to be seen i have not laughed so hard in a theater since the first hangover came out i was lucky to be able to see an advanced screening of tonight and cannot wait for it to hit theaters i will definitely go see it a few more times for surethe movie centers on obviously but all of the little things make this movie so good giovanni ribisi was fantastic as a creepyteddybearstalking freak aedin mincks young alan in hangover ii was just as good playing the junior stalker the background music what toys the kids opened on christmas in 1985 everything contributo the feel of this movie even patrick stewart detailing the abilities of an apache helicopter was hilariousif you have a chance see this movie twice or three times you will not regret it,comedy
i immediately vothis a 9star but a day later ive upped my opinion to full 10stars i cannot think of a way to improve it was simply hilariousas you might suspect theres a lot of stupid humor in when i saw the dumb jokes coming i would mentally prepare myself to simply hold my breath until it was over knowing that more intelligent humor would follow but more often than i care to admit the dumb humor wore me down until i burst out laughing like i havent laughed at a movie since planes trains and automobiles or family vacation in my opinion is an instant classic like those moviessure is offensive and gross but its freakin funnyi heard the family guy connection only after seeing the movie i had no idea who seth macfarlane was nor this movies relationship to family guy full disclosure i cannot stand family guy i tried watching it long ago like three times each time i lasabout two minutes and had to turn it off just terrible but is hilarious so if you hate family guy that doesnt necessarily mean you wont laugh at tedthere are lines entire scenes and facial expressions rerunning through my head all day todayfullstars thumbs up all that if you can stand some foul language and foul jokes and you enjoy cultural references going back to 1980 then run do not walk to see ted,comedy
my summary is pretty selfexplanatory this is the first comedy i can remember in a very long time where i have laughed this much from beginning to end it is easily the must see comedy of the summary if not the year the writing from director seth mcfarland is nothing less then i expecfrom him i am not a regular viewer of family guy although i have caught a few episodes here and their but i have seen the last few comedy central roasts in which he has hosand he is among the funniest presents in that series i have seenin short i urge anyone who has not seen this yet and is questioning whether to go see it to not hesitate for a second and definitely go out and see it it is obviously not intended for children so do keep that in mind other then that prepare to lose a few calories through laughter,comedy
no doubt this has to be one of the funniest movies of 2012 if you approach comedy with an anything goes mind set you will love cant wait for the dvdbluray behind the scenes features this will be the perfect holiday stuffer i am also looking forward to a 2 they have to be crazy if they arent preparing for a sequel saw the screening wednesday and couldnt get enough of tedmania had to go for another dose of rawness its one rar movie that you can watch with your preteen my 12 year old was asking me all sorts of questions that i was happy to get into this movie definitely opened a lot of doors to do some preaching and connect with him at the same is the must see of 2012,comedy
is a slap stick comedy by seth macfarlane that asks how far can a little boys wish go it also asks how far can a comedy go in terms of crudeness after one box office success 21 jump street and one failure thats my boy lets see if can bring back crude comedy to the top of the box office this week and for weeks to comewhen john bennett mark wahlberg was a little boy he received a stuffed teddy bear for christmas and upon receiving it he wishes that his new bear could come alive and talk in real life when his wish is granhis new friend voiced by seth macfarlane comes alive and they share a bond that they will share forever john is now 35 years old and now a celebrity is still around and living with john now john has to balance his life between his job fun with and his girlfriend mila kunis and encounters tons of road blocks in making his life balancedthis being seth macfarlane first live action film i thought the camera shots he used were very good and the comedy was laugh out loud hilarious macfarlanes voice work is amazing even similar to peter griffin family guy his voice went well with teds personality and demeanor mark wahlberg was gold in this movie and did a good job acting especially in scenes with who was a cgi generabear the comedy in this movie was vulgar grotesque and racist but this being a seth macfarlane feature the audience should be expecting that the film had a good pace it never seemed slow near the last third of the movie the film did a little genre change it went from crude comedy then a little bit drama and then near the end there was a cool little action adventure sequenceeven though i prefer comedies that arent vulgar and crude this one was definitely worth price of admission it was hilarious on all counts i think there are jokes in here that can be offensive to any type of person but you knowing seth macfarlane you shouldnt be surprised this is one of the best comedies of the year up there along with 21 jump street this film had everyone rolling highly recommended4 out of 5 starsbkstareviewsblogspotcom,comedy
foul rude dirty disgusting these are the words that describes this crappy movie dont watch this movie if you value your morals and your time shame on you seth macfarlane,comedy
johnwahlberg with his usual not the brightest bulb but nice guy charm had trouble making friends as a child so at 7 he wished for his plush bearmacfarlane playing it like a nasty jerk who does have some empathy to be alive and it was grantedand this wisely has everyone know that it is so he doesnt have to be hidden and dressed up for the entirety with that lame material weve seen countless times for several decades they both age over the years and when we rejoin them hes been dating lorikunis not coming off like shes nagging and who can laugh with the other two we believe they would get together and stay together its not a what is she doing with him kind of thing so typical in recent american fictional media for 4 years and she wants them to go to the next level all three relationships are very credible as are most of the charactersexcept for the ones that are just there for us to laugh at and their logic as he tries to develop more maturity we of course indulge in plenty of juvenile fun albeit this has almost even amounts of genuinely sweet andor dramatic momentsit has serious heart and the ending may very well make you cry in spite of the unnecessary parts of the climax this is raunchy with lots of strong language mild violence and brief nudity we get jokes about various sexual religious and ethnic groups and this tries to offend absolutely everyone it is hilariousit really doesnt try too hard and yes there are one or two gags there to push the boundaries its an rracomedy its expecwith that said this is miles above the usual outing in this genre the writing and performances are where this shines with the plot being the weakestthough it is done well as it is so simplistic and obvious weve seen it so many times already and as already mentioned the third act is a tad off it doesnt fit with the clever symbol of stungrowth concept there are pop culture references parodies and excellent guest stars the fx are impeccably integraand animayou fully believe what you see is real i recommend this to any fan of the directorwho fares rather well for his debut the castmchale is great as an insufferable boss who wont accept that he cant date mila and ribisi is fantastic note that warburton is barely in it and this kind of movie 810,comedy
after reading the reviews about the movie and what people say about it  that its boring and awful i thought that the movie was gonna be stupid  but my friends told me that its hilarious so i just went to the cinema and booked a ticket  really  i wasnt disappoinat all  i almost laughed the whole time  the look of himself while hes moving is very funny  i cant stop laughing when i see him fighting or drinking alcohol  and i learned a lesson  is to never trust peoples reviews  and its not a children movie  dont let your kids watch this movie because himself is very impolite the whole movie  dont skip this movie its a great one  i really enjoyed it ,comedy
quite minor spoiler alertif youre a fan of mcfarlanes tv work im mostly referring to family guy youll love this i did theres a lot of perter griffin in the character no chicken fight but look out for the duck lots of 80s pop culture references the friend i went with totally missed the raiders of the lost ark reference including the obligatory star wars momentsif you dont know mcfarlanes work and dont like fartstoner humour you might hate ittheres quite a bit more action than i expecon the whole it was and enjoyable 106 minutes,comedy
i found this film to be absolutely fantastic its got a mixture of comedy loveand just damn right stupidness this film for me would have been a 1010 but in a couple of scenes i found some errors so that disappoinme a little biti would recommend this film for anyone that is feeling down or just needs a good laughi loved this film so much ive already preordered it and just cannot wait until i get the dvd absolutely brilliant i loved it so much the first time i went back to the cinema to see it again because it was that funny i recommend this film to anyone  but the whole film isnt comedy it has some sad parts for example when gets killed by a fat boy susan boyle l but in the end its alright cannot wait until i get my dvd going to be brilliant ,comedy
what a brilliant film got dragged to watch it  did not fancy it one bit from the trailers but was totally taken in from this crude funny  great script the thought of a talking teddy bear sounds so un funny yet is played with such subtle and timing it works perfectly a great story where a guy has to ditch his bum of a best friend for his girlfriend some of the scenes are laugh out loud the soap in the supermarket the job interview the fight scene all great and the relationship between  walhburg has so much surprising chemistry its amazing this is a great film not really for kids under 15 but for all kids over how any one can score less than a 7 for this film is unbelievable i score a 9 watch this film and enjoy,comedy
i couldnt help but feeling a certain amount of caution when going to see while the trailers had pretty funny moments and reviewers and friends alike were giving the film glowing reviews i was a tad worried id be in for another cute but naughty thing that shouldnt be talking story as seen in alf or paul or look whos talking orwell lets just say its been done before in fact theres a good amount of evidence to support that seth macfarlane would tell that story when you consider the characters of stewie and brian in family guy roger and klaus in american dad and rollo in the cleveland showbut like those characters specifically stewie and brian macfarlane navigates skillfully between obvious jokes that come from having a character be a baby or a dog or in teds case a teddy bear and jokes that are actually hilarious because of wellcrafcharacters while the cute but naughty thing that shouldnt be talking has been done before macfarlanes handling of it is fresh funny and surprisingly touchingbegins with us meeting young john bennett who will grow up to be the loveably dopey mark wahlberg poor john has no friends except for an oversized teddy bear who he never lets leave his side one night john wishes for teddy to be alive and wouldnt you know it a shooting star magically grants him his wish john is ecstatic his wish came true and that he finally has a friend and while his parents are initially scared shitless by the talking toy they quickly accept him as a miracle and part of the family soon word gets out about this living teddy bear and he becomes an overnight worldwide sensation appearing on the cover of time magazine and the tonight show with johnny carson but as the years go on the phenomenon fades and becomes another celebrity whos fifteen minutes of fame have endedbut one thing doesnt change and thats teds friendship with john the two are still the best of friends living and smoking and watching flash gordon together is not johns only friend anymore though not since he stardating lori mila kunis four years ago with lori and johns relationship beginning to enter the next level of commitment john must learn to grow up and put away childish thingsonly he doesnt want to and neither does even after moves out johns constant hanging out with him and irresponsibility begin to drive a wedge between him and lori and if this werent enough loris asshole boss rex joel mchale is continuing to make advances on her and a creepy fan from teds celebrity days named donny hilariously played by giovanni ribisi seems to be stalking the talking bearfor the rest of the review imdb form too short visit httpcustodianfilmcriticcomted,comedy
i havent reviewed a film in forever so i thought to myself why not review the last movie i have seen well last night my trip to the theatre was to see seth macfarlanes im pretty familiar with seth macfarlanes comedy and while im not always fond of it i do kind of like it however with macfarlane its usually a loveitorhateit kind of comedy as a result could have easily gone one way or the other luckily for us goes in the right direction and while undeniably very raunchy and very crude those who are not offended by such humour will be in for one very very funny ridejohn is the least popular kid in the neighbourhood one christmas eve he is given a teddy bear and while the teddy bear isnt alive per se it automatically becomes johns best friend one night little john wishes for his bear to come alive which is exactly what happens and the two are now really best friends its a really cute story at first but what happens 27 years after well john mark wahlberg and his bear tedvoice of seth macfarlane himself are stoners and john at 35 years old works in a car rental company john is in a relationship with lori mila kunis a very patient and mature girl who despite loving him too believes that is a nuisance to her relationship with john in order to get the best of both worlds john lets go helps him find a job and other things like thatim not saying more i could go on and on about the plot but i dont feel like spoiling anything what you do got to know though is that is a very very funny comedy it works on pretty much every level seth macfarlanes branch of humour is worthy of the early family guy episodes back when it was any good it is also easily recognizable in whether hes bashing jews on a christmas eve or having someone pick up a piece of sht from the floor there are many gags you could actually picture seeing on television of course there are many pop culture references as well however those dont always work as well as the other gags but still when they work well theyre very funny im thinking of an opening gag and a closing gag aimed at some today and past stars which had me up in stitches and that long after the movie was ended the movie also kind of feels like a thriller near the end with a pretty tense car chase a few other parts near the end mostly emotions were present not in a cryingyourheartout kind of way but more like a awwthatssad kind of way of course both leads are great in their roles mark wahlberg is surprisingly solid constantly replying with perfect comedic timing and sometimes a surprising amount of emotion towell a teddy bear who doesnt even exist mila kunis also has her funny moments but besides a climatic decision and being the one who wants and johns bromance to end she doesnt really bring anything useful to the movie i blame the way the character was written because kunis was perfect for the role undeniably the real star of the movie is himself not only does he look surprisingly realistic for a cgi teddy bear but hes quite the entertainer and while most of what comes out of his mouth is profane its also very funny in fact if were an actual comedian i wouldnt hesitate one minute to buy tickets for his oneman show ill give a special credit to giovanni ribisi who also starred in contraband opposing mark wahlberg earlier this year who is awesome as a stalker but i wont say much moreoverall like i said goes one way or another for me it definitely went the right way it was hilarious and entertaining enough to warrant a full price ticket at the theatre let me put it this way is up there with 21 jump street in terms of 2012 comedy macfarlane fans you do not want to miss this movie macfarlane haters enter with an open mind and you might exit pleasantly surprised average moviegoer looking to go on a date or to go see a movie why not try out before i used to give 10s out as a way to say highest recommendation but i dont give 10s out like that anymore 9 is a really great mark and that is what im giving to because thats exactly what it deserves,comedy
it was much better than i expecand i laughed the whole time with few exceptions it has a much more mature plot than i expecand has touching moments offset with raunchy humor all in all a good investment of time and money for an evenings entertainmentspoilers pro there are some inventive routines and imagery thats just soooo wrong its terrific the animation and rendering of are spot on i only stopped laughing a few times and felt disappoinin macfarlane for a few things that left a bad taste in my mouthcon the raunchy humor in this film is hysterical and i am by no means a prude i draw a line though when it comes to deeply offensive stereotypes used to bully people particularly at a time when bullying is epidemic how do you tell kids to stop bullying and not to use certain phrases when they are constantly used in macfarlans shows macfarlane cant resist the old worn out gay jokes or racist characters if he could just avoid rehashing tired old routines his shows would be much better for example i have a hard time with animashows that continue to use thats so gay giving teens the impression that its acceptable to use this phrase that one really grates my nerves and i only hear it repeacontinually in south park and macfarlanes shows these kinds of gay jokes went the way of black faced minstral shows a long time ago additionally there are a few obnoxious racial stereotypes in this film that really bugged mei saw this movie with my brothers adopkorean daughters an obnoxious and deeply offensive asian stereotyped character made them very uncomfortable and tarnished an otherwise wonderful eveningbottom line aside from these few ridiculously over done routines the show is fresh and very funny i had a great time watching it and left the theater wondering when i can see it again,comedy
has been on my list of comedies to watch since i starhearing about it the idea is great and i do enjoy seth macfarlanes style of comedy sure enough that is what is ive heard it be called a long episode of family guy and while that isnt accurate it does say a lot about the kind of humor evokes and i had a pretty good time with itmacfarlane voices the titular character best friend to walbergs jon when jon makes a wish as a kid for his teddy bear to come to life it does becomes a sensation and becomes jons best friend if you were wondering how exactly the whole teddy bear come to life thing works in the real world sense it does and the history of jon and is told early in the film in a pretty damn funny narration i will say that while may be a very interesting idea and the whole notion of a raunchy teddy bear acting like a manchild is pretty funny in and of itself could easily have been replaced by a normal person and the film would be as funny its seths writing and humor that shine heremacfarlane has always done good voice work on family guy and american dad and it translates here pretty well is obviously the voice of peter griffin and you cant shake that feeling but also comes into his own as a character the idea of a raunchy foul mouthed manchild teddy bear faded on me pretty quick which goes to show how well the film was done teds interaction with people never feels weird or out of place it comes naturally and everyone does a great job of interacting with him props to mila kunis and especially mark walberg who once again proves that he can do great at comedy this is a role uncommon for mark and where he was a funny guy in the other guys hes even funnier heremacfarlane proves fairly adept at taking to the camera for the first time and directing his actors nothing here is spectacular id even say the film is fairly predictable but the comedy is gold here it doesnt hit with a continuous rhythm but when it hits its laugh out loud funny but like i said its a lot of the usual macfarlane humor pulling out some odd popculture references here and there making lingering jokes and even some very odd wtf moments i did a few times raise my hands in a wtf gesture luckily the film also has heart is a little bit too obvious as an object for jon who has trouble putting away childish things but and jons relationship shines as honest and natural even if is a teddy bear you still accept what he and jon havecertainly isnt a perfect comedy a number of jokes fall flat if you dont get the pop references or are into some of the ongoing bits like those involving flash gordon although i did find all the flash gordon stuff pretty amusing the script also has a few issues being a bit clich and staying too long on certain jokes much like family guy some stuff here just isnt that funny or stays on too long but the majority of the film is funny i certainly laughed out loud quite a bit so if you enjoy the macfarlane brand of humor and find yourself at a loss for comedies this summer should entertain you quite a bit,comedy
it takes a lot for a comedy to truly make me laugh but this movie succeeded more than once guess this is really a movie that speaks to me not so much with just its story and concept but more with its references and other little things that can be found in this moviethe premise of this movie probably doesnt sound all that appealing to most and actually also lets this movie sound like a very typical predictable and childish gimmicky movie that relies solely on the premise of having a talking teddy bear in it but the movie is surprisingly clever and doesnt become a predictable or lame on in any way it also most definitely is not a childish movie quite the contrary its an at times rude and cruel movie filled with plenty of sex booze and drugs as wellin essence its being a very simple and straightforward movie it really doesnt have an all that complicastory to it but it still remains a well written movie that flows well and barely has any misses or other weaknesses in it its a very consistent movie you could say that doesnt ever goes overboard with anything and somehow manages to keep things fresh interesting and funny all throughoutthe movie really has some great and fun characters in it which is also being one of the main reasons why this movie remains such a likable and fun one it doesnt just center on the character but also on the human character played by mark wahlberg and this movie is finally being one in which mark wahlberg is playing a different and certainly also very likable character honestly if you are a mark wahlberg hater you still might very well end up liking this movie and even mark wahlberg in his rolethe movie of course also works out well because is being a convincing character in the movie he really is a walking and talking teddy bear that doesnt look fake in anyway the movie uses some great effects for himno matter how bad or silly this movie might sound to you just give it a shot changes really are that you will end up liking or maybe even loving it810 httpbobafett1138blogspotcom,comedy
if there is something i discovered opening day of do not underestimate family guy and american dad fans seth macfarlane has a bigger fan base than i thought not to say i didnt know that he wasnt famous just didnt realize how big he was when i saw the trailer for i knew my fianc would love this movie he always tells me about what i missed on the new episode of family guy or american dad or the cleveland show im the average watcher of family guy ill watch a couple episodes that rerun on tbs at night and of the three ill find one bad one ok and one absolutely hilarious in the jokes just keep coming at you for every one that misses the next one is a hit this was made directly for the fans of macfarlanes humor after all the poster does say from the creator of family guy and the cast is mostly a typical work day for macfarlane but over all does work as a comedy that im sure you could get a kick out ofin 1985 in boston john bennett is a lonely child who dearly wished for his new christmas gift a large teddy bear named to come to life to be his friend that wish coincided with a falling star and is brought to life after johns parents got over the shock word of the miracle spread and was briefly a celebrity twentyseven years later john and are still lazy but loving companions enjoying life even while john is pursuing a yearslong relationship with a levelheaded office worker lori as their fourth anniversary of their relationship approaches lori hopes to marry john but she feels he cant move ahead with his life with around who has become a vulgar obnoxious wastrel john is resistant to making his lifelong companion leave but he is finally persuaded that night to act when the couple discover at home with four prostitutes is fine at first on his own but still wants john to still party with him causing problems in his relationship once againlike the shows there are some jokes that seem to go too far i dont mind 911 jokes every once in a while but macfarlane just throws a few out there and some are a little too much his relationship with mark wahlberg in the film is similar to the relationship between peter and brian on family guy and sort of in the spirit of kevin smith who is an obvious fan of star wars macfarlane is a fan of the 80s and is trying to bring a bmovie back flash gordon however i cant deny that i seriously did laugh quite a few times with this movie we have a good comedic cast that works and one of the things i really appreciate on macfarlanes part as a writer is that he didnt make mila kunis character a onenote jerk girlfriend who everyone hates you understand her character and even mark wahlbergs heck he even makes a bear very believable as a friend who is still stuck in the party mode in life and takes his best friend down with him there are two villains in here one is a large child and his dad who will do anything to make him happy almost like silence of the lambs style this dad is just plain creepy the effects for were great and the story despite being predictable was still very decent i got a few good laughs from it and would say that it is very much worth the watch if youre the average viewer of the shows of macfarlane i think youll like it too if youre a die hard fan theres no question that youre going to love ted710,comedy
best movie ever period great movie for a real date because this is funny for the both of you plus it tells a story about growing up about life that there is a time you will grow out of things but you will never forget them if you also want to see a movie just as good but if better than the hangover and 21 jump street than see this the is movie even if you think family guy is dumb and dull you will still like this so the next your girlfriend wants to go see a movie make its sure not some male stripper movie i hope you all see even teens the greatest movie ever ever ever ever made by one best the greatest writers today,comedy
boring dull uninspired the jokes are old the movie is slow that should be it but the imdb staff asks for ten lines and there is not much else to say for a movie made in some small third world country that would count as good acting for an a list cast that is bad acting but seth never went any better anywaythe story is silly and pointless the dialogue is tedious and well spaced to give the pain for the slow slow storythe jokes canned laughs would work miracles to give the viewer some hintscontact me with questions comments or suggestions ryitfork  bitmailch,comedy
i laughed my head off at seth macfarlanes new comedy seth is the guy who creaa popular adult animasitcom called family guy if you have seen the show you know what youre getting into with this picture raunchy humor gags and a stoner teddy bear let me just say that this film is not for kids at all its very adult and the concept of a talking teddy bear might be appealing to younger audiences but its very much an adult filmits about a lonesome child john bennett who makes a wish at christmas time that his new teddy bear come to life and be his friend forever the wish comes true and comes to life word spreads the he is alive and he becomes a brief celebrity years go by and john mark wahlberg is 35 years old and living a hedonistic life with as his roommate with his anniversary approaching his girlfriend lori mila kunis wants to marry john but fears if is always around he will never move forward when moves out on his own a creepy dad takes a twisinterest in the bear and its up to his old friend to save him from being bearnappedseth makes his directorial debut with this film and if youve ever watched family guy then youre aware of the raunchy humor and this picture is no different peter is the boozy slacker lois is the dirty wife meg is the dork chris is the dummy and brian is the brainiac seth is able to create a family of characters that never seem to run out of steam there is always a cutaway gag a laugh or a joke that will make you howl the show has been running for years now and it doesnt seem like its going to die out anytime soon is the same as family guy its funny enough to keep you entertained and it never runs out of steam teds foul mouth is enough to make you laugh but the situations he finds himself in with john are hilariouspatrick stewart opens the film with an explicit narrative and we meet young john hes the kid that nobody likes in the neighborhood and wishes for a friend when his parents seth macfarlane and alex borstein who voices lois from family guy gives him the bear he makes the wish under his sheets with a flashlight and the bear comes to life now the question i had is how is a talking teddy bear going to be funny i got my answer most of the laughs in the film comes from the bears dialogue hes incredibly vulgar he inhales vast amounts of weed from a bong and has a childhood hero in the form of sam j jones from the 1980 film flash gordon he has a love for drugs and hookers and he offends everyone he comes in contact with he ends up getting a job as a cashier at a local grocery store and has sex somehow with one of his coworkers tamilynn jessica barth in the back of the store on the produceit takes on the issue of staunch friendship in a hearway and john call themselves the thunder buddies and it has something to do with thunder and a fart mila kunis is sweet as johns girlfriend but she is underused when is forced to move out the real challenge begins john is always running off to spend time with even though it will get him in trouble how do you say away from your troublemaking best friend there is a sequence where is at a party with john and they dare sam to punch through a wall to prove he is flash gordon sam jones has become a party animal and breaks through the wall angering an asian man with a knife in one hand and a duck in the other i actually had to hold my stomach because i laughed so hard the scene descends into chaos and you will have to watch it to see an amusing fight between and the duckmacfarlane has given us a comedy we can finally laugh at but theres a subplot in the film involving a creepy father donny giovanni ribisi who wanwhen he was a kid now he has turned his sights on trying to get for his spoiled chubby son aedin mincks after all the jokes it serves as the peril for the film i supposed something has to happen in the end but its basically a setup to give a lot of time to poke fun at the chubby kid oh i hear the fat kid even during a peril situation macfarlane manages to keep the steam going i must say he is one of the most talenminds i have seen in a very long time the film will presumably do well at the box office and you can bet there will be a 2 this is one of the funnest movie of the year but its clear to me that this film will be in the crosshairs of younger kids given that its about a talking teddy bear but its much more adult than family guy i must stress to parents that the film is very adult and a very rramovie a lot of parents will see the poster and figure a talking teddy bear in a movie could be cute no take your kids to see anything but this and enjoy it for yourself,comedy
the first few scenes of this movie give the impression of a wholesome familyfriendly christmas movie okay except for the part about beating up a kid because hes jewish but that still might have been acceptable in some family movies patrick stewarts narration like pretty much everything he does is magnificentthings change pretty quickly im so glad i had the sanitized version aired on nbc which i finally got around to watching yesterdayokay sanitized isnt quite right broadcast tv still allows a lot of filthstill i found the whole story quite entertaining and a lot of it was funnyand while this could easily be dismissed as garbage the last 30 minutes or so gave this movie some substance an exciting adventure and some touching moments and giving lori the chance to show how caring she islori is such a loving and patient girl despite being so goodlooking mila kunis did a fine job i mean for this type of material this isnt black swan actually i have yet to see thatjohn is an appealing enough character and very dedicato his best friend i know mark wahlberg is capable of better but hes good enough hereseth macfarlane gives his usual great performance with one exception he sounds like peter griffin and this is mentioned but occasionally and the first time he talks he sounds like brian griffinjoel mchale showed considerably more talent on community but he has a couple of good scenes here as loris sleazy boss and hes especially good delivering just one great linei know giovanni ribisi is considered a respecactor but im not sure what to say about him here but without donny and his son this movie would have been missing some important scenesbill smitrovich as teds boss does a good job and has a surprising attitudea cameo by norah jones shows her to be quite appealing and of course i like her musicthe music is one of the best things about the movie walter murphy does the 50s sitcomstyle music for family guy and a lot of the music in this movie sounds similar there is great music in fine restaurants and at rexs party there are exceptions 1 the two versions of how john and lori met2 when john leaves one party for another and when he arrives at the second party3 watching the tv series about flash gordon4 donny dances to tiffanyis this movie worth seeing if you seth macfarlanes sitcoms probably and i do,comedy
if youre a fan of seth macfarlane or a child of the 80s then youll enjoy this its filled with pop culture references crass comedy and fantastic cameos very funny in a family guy humour sort of way and i definitely got my share of laughshimself is well animawhich adds to the magic and despite finding his peter griffin voice initially distracting loved that they addressed this i totally fell for him and his bromance with mark wahlbergwahlberg does a good job hes perfect for the role as a bostonian who as a child successfully wishes his teddy bear to life john gets more than he bargained for when the stuffed animal follows him into adulthood complicating his relationship with mila kunis now he has to choose between his girl or his friendship with the crude and extremely inappropriate tedthe plot here is nothing special its familiar i would even say clich but it doesnt really matter because events are just so hilarious on another note i could definitely tell that seth mcfarlane is my age by the bits i found funny or ironic or nostalgic like the darth vader case for all the action figures airplane reenactment flash gordon or indiana jones notes played on the stairs 2716,comedy
i dont get how some films mainly comedy at times seem to take an old actorfranchise and completely flaunt himit like product placement in this film for some reason seth macfarlane has used sam l jones of flash gordon fame in what seems to be some kind of agreement to try and reboot his career well thats how it comes across to me anyway no other reason for him being there really im guessing its in a typical family guy style just to have random off the wall moments with cameosso seth macfarlane breaks into the movies with this family guy orientacomedy i say family guy orientabecause even though it has nothing to do with fg the main character of sounds just like brian and peter from fg yes i know thats how macfarlane sounds in reality he wrote it with fg writers plus he utilizes fg voice actress mila kunis also so its home from home in a wayi expecthis to be totally downright funny and hilariously filthy it was but not as much as i hoped for yes there are some grand bits of dialog that sound so cynical and sharp with macfarlanes well spoken tones but they are few and far betweeneven the swearing isnt as cool as you would think at first you think its gonna be awesome to finally here peter and brian griffin use bad profanity but it wains fast at first its highly effective but as time passes the novelty wheres off its like a sexy sultry woman dressed in a tight skimpy revealing outfit its amazingly hot and never fails to keep you excithen you see the same woman completely nakedstraight away she no longer becomes as hot because all the mystery is gone shes right there in the buff with nothing left to hideso in other words when we see family guy without swearing its actually more effective than if it had swearing because it makes you use your imagination and i think comes across funnier it works for this film at times im just saying hearing macfarlane swear wasnt as funny as i thought it would be can anyone beat cartman in those stakes hope you all get what im sayingas for the rest its kinda average really nothing much happens in the film until the finale which does get a whole lot better kudos to giovanni ribisi with his excellent norman bates style father character easily the best thing to watch towards the end the sequence where he is dancing in front of the tv to tiffany is creepy as fudge plus hilarious at the same timeyet im not sure why i think it was the pelvic movesthere are a few weirdly eerie moments in the film probably down to the fact its based around a living teddy bear the point where fights wahlberg is kinda creepy in a disturbing horror type way i reckon its suppose to be a take on the sequences in family guy where peter fights that large chicken character seems to use the same sound effects too was it suppose to be funny seeing having sex being with hookers and dating hot women is also rather odd why would a real woman wanna go out with a teddy bear yes its a fantasy film but reallyother than that it does satisfy to a degree its just not as good as it could of been methinks ending was sweet but totally predictable lame fluff wahlberg was miscast in my opinion the guy cant act why does no one see this and clearly macfarlane has a flash gordon fetish he stuck sam jones in there why again looks good for his age though cant deny thatsorry for comparing family guy to this so much hard not to reallyoh and for typing it a a lot too610,comedy
 when i heard seth macfarlane the babyfaced genius behind tvs most hilarious sitcom family guy was planning his featurefilm debut i was totally thrilled i was even more excito learn the plot would revolve around a foulmouthed potsmoking teddy bear magically brought to life via his owners childhood wish and when i discovered mark wahlberg and family guy regular mila kunis were signing on to star i began eagerly counting the days until it premiered and when the film finally arrived my patience is rewarded with  a grossout comedy from the guy responsible for creating historys funniest animaseries yes there are moments when macfarlanes clever side intercedes and those bits are great especially his biting digs at washedup child stars and taylor lautner but for the most part he and cowriters alec sulkin and wellesley weld go for the cheap and lazy like poopandfart jokes and walkons by the likes of tom skerritt norah jones ryan reynolds and flash gordon himself sam j jones that serve no purpose beyond providing a knowing wink and nudge to macfarlanes hippest fans,comedy
this wasnt quite the movie that i expeci was actually disappoinwith this movie and gave up watching it after an hour i didnt find it all that funny it appeared to be a ripoff of wilfred the australian tv comedy and to be honest wilfred was a lot funnierwas a pot smoking swearing bear wilfred was a pot smoking swearing dog sound familiar the storyline was very predicable and i found the whole movie crass and offensive there didnt seem much to the storyline and unlike family guy which i have always enjoyed was a movie that i was basically disappoinin the movie staroff with potential and i thought this looks promising but once we went into johns life some 30 years later and discovered he now had a pot smoking swearing teddy bear running his life it all went down hill from their on i know a lot of people with diaagree with me and that is fair enough but for seth mc farlanes was very disappointing,comedy
the movie is comedyfantasy still it is highly unrecommended for children because of lots of profane comedy phrases seth mc farlane family guy guy stole the acting for character show yet his direction falls short imo i give my stars for the music department and the songs were cool parts of the movie were boring and few jokes were offensive like beating a jewish kid and blaming indians for 911 the animation department worked well with teds animation the emotions sentiments were ultrareduced which actually spoiled the movies soul ie there wasnt even a full emotional scene between main characters that lasover a minute the movie was totally unexpecfrom mc farlane i expecless vulgar less boring and decent comedy,comedy
the multi talenseth macfarlane has creaa silly ridiculous and sometimes funny comedy about a boy whose teddy bear magically comes to life talking and acting like a human being courtesy of macfarlanes own voiceover and remains his best friend through the years macfarlanes script deftly explains that yes a teddy bear come to life would become a media sensation but like all media sensations quickly enough wears out his welcome with the public and reaches the point where nobody cares any more like we are told the cast of the tv sitcom diffrent strokes a premise which in other hands might have been turned into cute whimsy becomes in macfarlanes hands a gagridden hybrid of buddy movie and romantic comedy half adolescent toilet humor one quarter postbabyboom pop cultural references and the remainder divided between wacky preston sturgeslike eruptions of comic chaos and clever jabbing satire on human foibles from the point of view of the jaded white middleclass some of the dialogue soarsthe male lead is played by mark wahlberg who in recent years has chosen to pump his pecs and biceps to the point where he jiggles when he runs down a flight of stairs his girlfriend is the sultry beauty mila kunis who can really act many laughs are generaby a strong supporting cast including joel mchale as kuniss arrogant boss and especially giovanni ribisi in a highly inventive characterization as a creepy father who with his overweight preteen son are obsessed with the title charactermacfarlanes tv show family guy has always been good for a few laughs and this movie continues the tradition on the big screen,comedy
the movie in general is a piffle for laugh a lot so dont expect a superproduction just think of the director of this movie wasting his time doing this prank and you will laugh a lot its not the best comedy out there but is very funnybut take in mind that this is not a comedy for realistic people if you expect to see a movie about our real world this is not for you in that case i recommend you something like bridesmaids 2011is hilarious is fantastic although the whole movie is a prank its a big joke for people who doesnt has anything to do trust me but it depends on your personality if you laugh or not if you have this kind of humor sense and a piffle can entertain you for a while then you will laugh for a good whilei would give it a better rate if the movie would have had a better end i didnt like the end seriouslyim waiting for 2 and i hope that would be for a wider public although im sure that 2 would be a very anticipamovie because let a lot to talk about it,comedy
to me wasnt as good as it could have been and given seth macfarlanes irreverent sense of humor was nowhere near as funny as it should have been i really like family guy and for the most part american dad i agree with his basic premise that theres humor in just about anything i also have no problem with shock or grossout humor as long as its intrinsically funnythe trouble with is that it relies too much on strictly shock and grossout alone too much of it has nothing funny about it a cute fuzzy teddy bear with a foul mouth is only funny for a short time if theres nothing humorous about what hes saying thats the case too often herea few of the cameos were funny some were okay the rest were stupid the flash gordon thing was carried to a boring extreme especially the partywahlberg was miscast his brother donnie is ten times the better actor kunis sparkled in a few places but was mostly flat no pun intended i usually like her a lot i didnt see much chemistry between her and wahlbergi gave this 6 stars because i enjoyed it  up to a point  but i do want to underline its flaws its a long way from perfect i tend to attribute it at least in part to the cowriters who may have been aping macfarlanes style but couldnt match his humorits worth watching the teddy bear animation is excellent,comedy
is an interesting comedy  to say the least the concept is fresh and there are some very funny moments but my overview review is eh or 5 i really like the first hour or so but i thought the movie ran out of steam in the end and tried to hard to be funny when the bizarre father son duo kidnapped i was very offended at the incredibly insensitive and downright nasty comment about the virginia tech massacre  that had no place in the movie  or any moviehow could anyone try to find any humor in that  what the hell were they thinking this movie is not for anyone under 18 the movie could have been so much better  more scenes like crashing the car into the rental  very very very funny  and the banter that went along with it  would have raised this to comedy cult status,comedy
youd think that a fan of family guy and american dad would find this right up their alley youd think that someone who admires seth and thinks he is utterly talenwould enjoy his movie the answer is no in fact the only reason this is not getting below a 4 rating is due to these two factors  ie 2 extra points the movie really didnt deserve the jokes are classic seth and family guy but what works in 22 minutes and in a cartoon manner of cutaways and scenes with no consequences doesnt work for 90 minutes in a movie to try and make all of this work they had to make main characters stoners the female lead puts up with this garbage for four years and the wicked giovanni ribisi doesnt nearly get enough airtime to salvage this mess the end simply just dragged yeah stick with short bursts of comedy seth,comedy
if you like watching family guyamerican dad the cleveland show or anything else to come out of the mind of seth macfarlane or at least have an idea of the type of humour he usesthen youre going to have a good time if not you still probably will have a good time much like the hangover teds humour tends to rely on heavy innuendos alcohol drugs and swearing but does that make it a bad movie my personal opinion is noit doesnt make it that bad a movie considering the fact that its seths first attempt at a live action feature lengthit is a pretty good movie the humour can get a bit crude and the language can get a bit much but id say its at least worth a viewing,comedy
i watched this movie a few months ago i had high expectations though but i feel that its not much to tell about it nothing more than a 6 out of 10i cannot deny that the idea its interesting most of the jokes were fine it had some humour in it but something was missing no i wasnt looking for depth but maybe for better humour better than sexual and drugs jokes it was fine but nothing special compared to everyones hype there are far better comedies than this but if you dont take it seriously and dont have high expectations its perfect for a friday night with friends,comedy
i admit i went into this movie with very high expectations because i love seth macfarlane and his ability to bring nonhumans a humanlike quality has proved to be comedic genius in the past however this movie fell short of what i had hoped it would be the character of and the story of how he came to be living and accepin the normal world was intricate and enticing but its mark wahlberg that really brought the movie back a few notches with most raunchy comedies pineapple express hangover superbad even if the main character is a total screw up he is lovable to where you are rooting for him to succeed eventually this movie made me resent wahlbergs character to the point where i believed he deserved all the trouble hed gotten into and hoped he never got out his delivery of most lines were cheesy aside from the quick draw of female names from the trailer in fact if it werent for mila kunis as the saving grace i would probably want my money back granhas some laugh out loud moments and adds some shock value as only macfarlane can possess but the overall picture lacked the staying power of what a true comedy movie should embody i might watch this again down the road but it is not near the first movie i would grab when i need a laugh on a random afternoon,comedy
when i watched i went into it expecting a hilarious film i have to say i am a little disappoinwahlberg and macfarland were both outstanding and hilarious although many of the jokes fell short of expectations what surprised me though was the story a story right out of a picture book i felt a real emotional connection to the character something that is rare in hard r comedies i love the character development and the interactions between characters are outstanding like i said earlier though not near as funny as i had hoped i laughed at a few parts and there were a few clever cracks but nothing near as funny as the hangovers or wahlbergs previous comedy the other guys when you see it dont expect to be rolling on the floor but its an enjoyable film worth seeing once,comedy
is an okay movie some of the jokes are really hilarious and in a peculiarly intelligent manner seth mcfarlanes humor is really one of a kind and his easy approach towards moviemaking is something that is worth appreciating hes just consequently himself without all the bs and thats very refreshing has a few downsides though some of it only got clear to me a few hours after seeing the movie and realizing how kind of forgettable the whole thing is this might be due to the fact that the script is not particularly rich in content compressing character development into feature film length might be unfamiliar territory for mcfarlane and most of the characters are pretty slim with the female lead appearing particularly one dimensional joel mchales character and the promising antagonists of the movie fall unfairly short too and the movie really could have used a lot more work on them this is especially frustrating seeing so much empty space throughout the movie just screaming for ideas to be inserand one gets the feeling that mcfarlane just didnt really try too hard all together kind of disrespecting his devofanbase also the moral standpoint of the movie was a bit unclear to me and could have been worked out more im not saying that it couldnt have done without one but if you do have a position and you center a whole plot around it please make it at least a clear one also mcfarlane is not a professional director considering that he does an ok job but its really not spielbergall together is not a bad movie by any means and its kind of lovely with a lot of good jokes its just a bit slim especially for its premisefor the same concept simon peggnick frost vehicle paul comes to mind as a much more profound movie510,comedy
we gave this movie a try mainly because of the high rating as a comedyi laughed only for about 3 minutes in the beginning buy when i figured out this teddy bear is all about dirty jokes and rude languagesbehavior i could hardly stand it anymore walked away half way leaving my husband to watch it alone dont think he enjoyed just he could stand it a bit moreif a comedy is all about entertain people with dirtynasty jokes especially an object associawith children teddy bear i would say its fairly low class and lack of imaginationpersonal opinion no offense to those who enjoyed it,comedy
i did not finish this movie because i had approximately the same urge to see how this ended as i have to see whether the sun will get up in the mornings and i dont live that far northin this review i am going to try to predict what happens if someone considers this as a spoiler eg someone who has never seen a movie before in hisher life dont read on after thisfirst of all the beginning was kind of original and creahopes that this movie is something quite different but then it stargoing downhilli turned off the movie during the 4year anniversary dinner between john and his girlfriend so far i had seen how she pretends to be happy with her relationship but that she probably feels that he is immature and doesnt have a good career also her successful boss is always trying to get her to start a family with himnow my guess is she will probably leave john because she feels the relationship is going nowhere and john will blame his teddybear so he will leave in hope that this will bring his girlfriend back to him but he has gotten it all wrong it wasnt who was the problem in the first place but just the fact that john apparently didnt thrive for anything more in his life the girlfriend realises that john has misunderstood and at the same time she also realises that her boss is actually not a nice person at all and so the three of them get back together in the end and live happily ever afteram i right,comedy
we are starving for comedy but the powers that be just dont have the mind set to really understand comedy or how to read and approve a comedic script for production the moment a simple rar comedy is thrown at us we scramble to the theaters for a desperate attempt to receive something as simple as laughteryes is funny the premise is very funny i was wondering how they were going to pull of the talking bear and make it acceptable in terms of reality and they did a great job getting passed the one hurdle of accepting as real was the only hurdle they had to jump over the rest shouldve been all gravy but it only if they had a scriptthe movie staroff with a fantastic bang funny smart original i was sitting there loving this film they creathe ultimate tool the talking dirty bear that could say anything do anything insult everyone and be loved by all wow what an amazing character they even surrounded the ultimate device with some inane and almost boring performances to make sure was the star of the show and yes he is the star of so with all that power and control what did they do with well they made him say a few dirty jokes in the first 30 to 40 minutes and kept the audience very entertained his humor was fantastic and his quick lines punched the audience in the stomach over and over again then what did they do with this great talking bear nothing the movie begins to focus on a poorly over written bit on flash gordon and a sorry empty headed relationship between the two human leadswhy why did they move their attention away from the comedy and and focus on a mediocre love story and a ridiculous car chase that turned the entire brilliant film into something that johah hill wouldve starred in like so many films the writers run out of steam and dont follow thru with what they have starthey assume the could do anything they want because they know they gotcha with the first 40 mins so it doesnt matter what happens to the rest of the film after sitting there after an hour i wanmy money back its almost like a bait and switch where they tease you with the best jokes in the trailer you buy the ticket and then get ripped off by a film that was never finishedwhy did the ruin what couldve been a break thru in comedy 30 minutes of comedy does not make a feature comedy filmthe only reason i didnt walk out on was because i loved sitting there and looking at milas close ups her eyes pushed me thru this film believe me if mila wasnt in this film the last 45 minutes wouldve been the most boring and inane piece of crap youd ever seen in a theatershame on the writers for giving up and not finishing what they starjust because you are brilliant in the beginning doesnt mean you have the right to give up the audience isnt stupid cutting corners only damages your own productim assuming we will see a 2 and i hope that one focuses on the ultimate voice of anger comedy and reason which the cinema has not seen in years and not some dumb ass side story about an inane coupleyou are as funny as you are incredible i just hope your writers do you justice next time,comedy

seth macfarlane is famous for creating the hit animatelevision show family guy he has recently just come out with his first feature film it is a twist on the modern fairy tale about a boy who wishes his teddy bear alivethe film follows john bennet played by mark whalberg who wished his teddy bear alive when he was 8 years old now 27 years later john still hangs out with his teddy bear named voiced by seth macfarlane john is celebrating his four year anniversary with his girlfriend lori collins played by mila kunis who tells john that has to move outgets his own apartment which john often visits him john ends up ditching lori at a party to meet sam jones played by himself of their favorite film flash gordan when lori finds out she breaks off her relationship with john feels bad and tries to patch things uptheir is a subplot involving a man who wants to buy for his son but i will not get into that because it contains spoilersthis is the best comedy of 2012 the story is fantastic he dialouge is extremely well written and the joke hit 100 of the time seth macfarlane captures childhood magic and dirties it up has a very dirty mind its heart is in the right placerar for crude and sexual content pervasive language and some drug use1hr 46min106min67 uses of the fword,comedy
i dont see how people can sit there and diss this film it was hilarious  it had a lot of funny scenes from the thunder song to when and john fighting it was a movie well worth watching and i know it was funny as even my dad laughed at it and he hardly laughs at anything d the story line is easy to follow and the acting is brilliant i especially loved the way flash gordon was mixed into it which made it fun to watch  i am so glad i saw this film and everyone i know who has seen it has complimenit on how funny it is it may not be for everyone but if you like a good laugh then this is a must see for any film fan,comedy
i dont understand some of the reviews about this filmif you like family guy youll love this after all its just peter griffin in a teddy bear suit theres also mila kunis voice of meg griffin patrick warburton the voice of joe and some great cameos from people like ryan reynolds tom skerrit and sam jones the guy who plays flash gordon in the 1980s movie tells the story of how an unpopular young boy john bennett who grows up to be mark wahlberg made a wish on christmas day for his teddy bear to come to life his wish comes true and becomes a famous celebrity who even appears on tv talk shows fastforward to the present day when a still immature john bennett shares his apartment with and his girlfriend of four years lori mila kunis unsurprisingly the threecornered relationship becomes a little strained with lori eventually giving john an ultimatumits either me or the bear storywise there are no surprises in this film and i found it all pretty predictable but this can be excused because its a laugh a minute if youre easily offended then you probably dont like family guy anyway i loved this film good script good acting and great fun laughed all the way through,comedy
ok the nonspoiler part first i just got back from watching the movie and i feel very happy because what i saw throughout this story was all things i loved when i was a kid and i still love now well i guess we could settle on saying that this is a movie for anyone who suffers from a healthy peterpan syndrome underline healthy just in caseif youre planning on watching it dont think twice its great fun one thing youll notice is the lack of experience of seth in directing film its no biggie thoughnow the spoiler part there are a lot to say the least of family guy jokes throughout the movie fart jokes jews jokes racist jokes fart jokes and fart jokes and many other funny random jokes just like in fg  but theres also flash gordon queen playing flashs theme of course quite loud very funny characters with quite a few lines though seth macfarlane gives voice to the teddy bear and its a peter griffinbrian griffinish voice you wont help noting the resemblancesenjoy,comedy
i really thought i would hate this movie but i loved it a foul mouth living teddy bear is amazing seth macfarlene is a genius mark walhberg was also great because all this time he was talking to nothing because was computer generaevery time spoke i fell into laughter mila kunis was also good as the nagging girlfriend some of the things says is very crude but you just cant stop laughing definitely one of my favourite 2012 comedy movies i dont think you need to be a fan of family guy to like this movie even though does sound like peter griffin i really do recommend this movie you will forget all your problems and fall in love with ted,comedy
sometimes you know you are going to hate a movie the minute it starts when starthose were my feelings the movie starts with a fairy tale kindof narration of a boys wish which makes his teddy bear come to life by this time i was sure i was going to hate this movieteddy bears usually have an image of being cute cuddly and something that you relate to kids this movie changes that image in a humorous way in the next scene the teddy and the boy john are all grown up both have a mature adult voice they smoke pod they talk dirty and still live together there is something hilarious about a teddy bear swearing on the big screen the movie is all about how the friendship of john mark wahlberg and teddy bear comes between johns love life john and have a great bond and are awesome together and so is the pair of john and his girlfriend lori mila kunis john finds it hard to let go of either of them and ends up fighting with and kicking him out of his apartment what i liked about the movie was the imagination of bringing a bear to life and changing the role of him from just being a kids play toy is hilariously funny and his friendship with john is naturally entertaining also the chemistry between john and lori is very charming and real you will definitely enjoy these two as much you enjoy the other twomy suggestion dont miss he will make you laugh your ao but be sure to not take your kids with you this is not a kids movie,comedy
while its not exactly a perfect film will put a massive grin on your face from the start most of the gags will have you laughing until your chest hurts and the ones that wont will at least make you smile like crazyto be fair seth mcfarlanes inexperience as a director does show in places but with jokes pulled off so brilliantly its often hard to notice if youre a fan of family guy american dad or any of mcfarlanes creations you will love this of course some of the jokes may be too crude for some peoples tastes so be warned but it isnt all penis jokes and swearing theres a lot of lighthearhumour in there too and plenty of pop culture references and parodies the flash gordon scenes are hilariousbut despite it being mcfarlane and cos debut feature film the writing and characterisation are very good certainly better than any other comedy this year in fact even the emotional stuff is pretty powerful and you feel a lot for the charactershaters will hate and nitpick all they want but is handsdown the comedy of the summer the kind of feelgood comedy with unexpechilarious jokes flying from everywhere and just making you want to smile its beautifulsee if you liked family guy series american dad series paul 2011 superbad 2007,comedy
is seth macfarlenes directional debut and stars him it was also written by him is the story of john bennet who when hes young makes a wish for his teddy bear to come to life when he does they become best friends and do everything together now 24 years on their friendship is teswhen johns girlfriend lori asks more from their relationship and the only way to get more is to remove from their life i was really looking forward to this film seth macfarlane is hilarious and i love his tv shows so i was really excifor this and i wasnt disappoinit had a lot of funny parts and a few very funny parts as much as i enjoyed it it didnt meet expectation maybe i thought it was going to be a 1010 or something i dont know but i still enjoyed it and it was very funnyi am delighthis is raso highly and also the amount of money it made because basically its a defiant thing that there will be more films to come from seth and i am really looking forward to them i really liked this filmif i have one complaint its this there is a few swing and miss jokes but otherwise its a very funny film with good acting a gateway to more seth films and a lot of 80s film references also there is a few heartfelt moments and it really adds to the storyit feels like family guy but its actually a lot different but some of the jokes are in the same humor so if you like seth youll like this if you like good comedy films you cant go far wrong with this either because out of all the comedy films released in the last few years this is up there most defiantly,comedy
i loved this movie just excellent all the way through i have already heard from many people that they thought it was awful but they got no sense of humor i have to say is one of the funniest animacharacters ever mark walhberg suits the role of his character in this movie extremely well and mila kunis what else can you say other then super gorgeous the movie has continuous laughs by the audience and mind me i have watched it 3 times and the audience and myself still find every funny quote and actions funny besides those people who have no sense of humorconsidering i have already watched it 3 times and i work at the cinemas i still tend to watch as much as i can and still have a good laugh even though i can predict exactly what happensa must watch movie not recommended for peoples under the age of 15 even with parental guidancedue to high use of illicit drugs throughout the moviei give this one a 9 out of 10enjoy,comedy
let me start this review by saying if you have not seen please go asap do not wait for the dvd release this movie is hilarious the critics worst fear is that the movie will not make sense because a main character is a teddy bear well the chemistry between the bear and marks character is electrifying unlike most comedies that just have a few funny scenes is funny from first scene to the last do not pay almost ten dollars for a bad movie my biggest pet peeve is wasting ten dollars and two hours of my life for a disappointing movie is not a family movie however it will keep you laughing from beginning to end,comedy
in a word hilarious saw this courtesy of work pal at a free screening and really enjoyed it seth macfarlane was the voice of the bear and brought his own brand of irreverent close to the bone bawdy and profane humour to the shana punim of laugh out loud this is primarily a boys film whats the male version of chick flick actually dont answer that with lots of 80s and 90s references and despite the teddy bear not at all suitable for children my husband and i seemed to be the only ones in the cinema apparently to get the paraphrase of stay gold ponyboy but the rest were generally appreciaa terrifyingly genius turn by giovanni ribisi with a tiffany obsession i think were alone now gave the film a dark twist and there were loads of other cameo type appearances patrick warburton and uncrediryan reynolds playing scarily believable gay couple patrick stewart as narrator and norah jones tom skerritt and flash gordon sam j jones shockingly gross at times but also with a good deal of heart to make the fantasy superb sfx of the living toy relevant with a surprisingly welcome hollywood ending that wasnt too schloky wahlberg and kunis were cute and the acting by wahlberg opposite was brilliant especially the fight scene watch it and weep with laughter,comedy
just saw it last evening and enjoyed it as much as i though i would even the scenes similar to family guy are still funny like the scene where mark whalberg is trying to guess teds girlfriends name similar to stewie and brian scene i especially liked the ending and the beginning where there are references to some other child starsactor every family guy should go and see and if there is another movie i am sure it will also be enjoyable mila kunis is as likable as ever i also like when they reference to where she is originally from some cameo kind of appearances with reference to family guy are also superbly done and not over the top,comedy
the crude but clever mark wahlberg comedy resembles something youd expect from adam sandler cretinous heroes gross out humor wanton drug abuse and offensive profanity constitute the primary elements of this witty satire indeed this farfetched offbeat politically incorrect farce is the last thing you would expect from a mainstream actor who specializes in straightforward action thrillers while it doesnt qualify as the kind of movie wahlberg typically makes is precisely what you might expect from cheeky family guy creator sean macfarlane who penned the outrageous script with family guy coscribes alec sulkin and wellesley wild this amusing but brazen 115minute nonsense veers from bromance to romance with our hero caught between his potsmoking pottymouthed teddy bear and his dropdead gorgeous brunette girlfriend aside from its impudent title character doesnt look like a runofthemill summer movie with its 50million budget about a walking talking teddy who delivers the best lines not only do wahlberg and mila kunis hold their own against the cuddly cgi hero but also this unusual threesome generates tangible charisma wahlberg and kunis make their relationship with the eponymous character appear believable even though we know they were not interacting spontaneously with as they do in the finished film moreover macfarlane and his writers keep things breezing along in this contentious relationship that generates suspense about whether our hero and heroine will survive as a couple one thing is unmistakable has nothing comparable to compete with in the genre of supernatural characters the closest thing to might be the extraterrestrial comedy paul about an et type alien who lands on earth and befriends two british tourists in the american southwest some critics have compared to the mel gibson movie the beaver about a depressed suicidal fellow who wears the puppet of a beaver on one arm and becomes its pawnbasically wahlberg plays a physically grownup but mentally immature adult who has put his life on hold to raise hell with his partyanimal teddy bear what sets apart from other comedies is the unconditional love that a 35year old loser shares with his childhood plush toy our hero leads a sheltered life as a youth in a town just outside of boston the neighborhood kids refused to play with john bennett when eightyear old john interrupts several kids in the middle of beating up a jewish boy all of themincluding the victimized jewish childsend him packing without a qualm since he had no friends john makes a wish on christmas eve in 1985 that his teddy would be his best friend little does john know that when he made his wish that a falling star plunged from the night skies miraculously johns wish is granand the teddy bear talks to him the next morning overnight turns into a national media sensation at one point he appears as a guest on the johnny carson late night talk show enjoys his fifteen minutes of fame before he resumes living life as usual with john eventually john has reaches a turning point with his long suffering girlfriend lori collins mila kunis of the book of eli who urges john to kick out so they can have a life alone evicting proves to be virtually impossible for our hero surprisingly makes the transition from staying with john to landing a job in a supermarket as a checkout clerk and getting an apartment of his own nevertheless although he has given the boot poor john cannot resist teds invitation to visit him daily everything isnt fun and games for and company when a creepy admirer donnie giovanni ribisi of contraband and his weird son robert aedin mincks of faster show up and try to buy him for john these two characters are obnoxious and their appearance ushers in a grim and unsavory air of reality to the actionrookie writer and director seth macfarlane has forged the funniest cinematic character in a long time with the wisecracking title character looks cute but he is rude crude and lewd he curses like a sailor smokes a bong like a chimney and likes to date prostitutes qualifies as an unforgettably funny liveactioncganimacomedy happily the character is seamlessly integrainto the action and his shenanigans are consistently hilarious whether he is driving his best friend to work with extensions so his short legs can reach the brake and the gas pedals or performing tj hooker leaps from the rear of a station wagon to the hood of our heroines car looks as lifelike as a cgi character can the motel room fistfight that he has with john where he pummels him into submission and his amorous stockroom assignation with a sexy cashier emphasizes teds rowdy as well as randy anticswhile teddy bears have been fodder for childrens movies over the years is nothing like winnie the pooh when macfarlane isnt having fun with and company he appropriates a cult science fiction film and integrates it as an essential element of this whacky fantasy and john grew up watching the movie flash gordon 1980 with sam j jones and have enshrined it however macfarlane isnt content merely to insert excerpts from the film since both and john worship sam j jones the flash gordon star winds up making a cameo for two riproaring scenes macfarlane borrows a mocking scene or two from the spoof masterpiece airplane when our hero meets the heroine on the dance floor of a 2008 disco and mimics the movements of john travoltas saturday night fever romance patrick warburton of the rules of engagement television series and green lantern lead ryan reynolds have a scene where they play two gay guys who kissis never tedious and will tickle your funny bone,comedy
a comedy fantasy for an eight year old boys powerful christmas wish bring life to a large teddy bear which becomes a lifelong companion into adult hood to a thirty five year old man not all teddy bears are sweet purity cuteness as this one contains a vile mouth for excessive profanity drug use no signs of addiction and sexual contents as an avid teddy bear lover i could not resist but to see tedthe cg graphics for is not accurate as all teddy bears do not have eyebrows for a stuffed animal they do not have thumbs either for that matter which even bbcs misery bear is truly a teddy bear depicon screen i just wonder how secured his employment at a supermarket without proper identification papers no social security no identification card also when lori was sewing in a panic to revive him why did she not sew his whole body as it was not shown his back but only his front she also never sewn teds left ear intact as it was forcefully removed by robert the stalkers son the father and son stalkers originate a broken family who do not treat personal property with great care as a teddy bearthe scene where drives john to work with his feet attached to stilts to reach the brake petals which is so funny hes too short to see thus he plows the surrounding parked cars it personally broke my heart to see ripped in half and all his stuffing fallen on fenway parks lawnall in all the movie ends with a sweet ending as i did shed several tears im happy lori finally accepts as is as part of her life with john because best friends are worth it,comedy
going into this movie i really didnt know what to expect i absolutely love family guy which really veered me into watching this film however was still having second thoughts on the story i mean how funny could a movie be with a stuffed bear as a main character however in the first 5 min of the film my thoughts had completely changed from the beginning to the end of the film i couldnt hold in my laughs it was packed with extremely funny jokes and scenes imo if you like family guy and its humour you have to watch this movie it was absolutely hilariousi have a bad trend of seeing many low grade comedian movies with pathetic jokes cough cough jack and jill however once again this movie was just amazing maybe im just immature but this movie just cracked me up continuously throughout the film i will most definitely buy this movie on dvd when it comes out i recommend this movie to everyone especially if youre a fan of family guy best movie ive seen in a while definitely,comedy
dont take your kids reasons are1 your kids would want their teddy 2 not because they will get spoiled with clevernasty humor they will judge you sick for laughing 3 you will be tired of explaining that a teddy bear can get away with a lot of borderline stuffmark wahlberg does what he does best support a supporting actor he did it in fighter and now he has done it again his innocent part plays right into the heart of humor like it did in the other guys mila kunis plays her part cleverly seth absolutely brings his accent bounded griffinised self clever writing and cast loads of credit goes to narration you will know who mchale and ribisi for being sublime at what they do this is a movie where everyone shared the humor load equally makes me watch with more powers of rewindreplay to relive the spiriscreenplaywhen comedy films where spreading themselves thin a real breath of fresh air by just delivering what they wanted,comedy

going into i fully expeca raunchy comedy what i wasnt at all expecting was a very sweet very compelling coming of age story one that convincingly examines themes of friendship loyalty and love in the best possible sense this movie completely threw me for a loop it marks the directorial debut of family guy creator seth macfarlane who clearly has a sick sense of humor but also has a lot of heart and isnt afraid to show it yes you will see a teddy bear smoking from a bong drinking beer swearing like a sailor and squirting hand lotion on his face to simulate a pornographic money shot but you will also see a buddy story a romance a climactic battle to the finish on a fenway park light tower and ultimately a happy ending that macfarlane somehow balances all this is nothing short of astonishingtaking place in boston the story begins in 1985 when a lonely eight yearold boy named john bennett mitch haggins makes a wish that his christmas gift a teddy bear he named would come to life and gain the ability to talk thanks to a shooting star his wish is granand and john make a pact that they will be best friends forever word of the miracle quickly spreads and for a brief time becomes a celebrity during the opening credits we see a montage that shows and john growing up all the while staying inseparable just as they promised they would we finally arrive at the present day when a now thirtyfiveyearold john mark wahlberg is about to celebrate his fouryear anniversary with his girlfriend lori mila kunis a successful office workeralthough he has found love john and a computer generacharacter voiced by macfarlane still live together and have adopa somewhat hedonistic lifestyle getting by almost entirely on pot and a deep love of the 1980 film flash gordon is essentially a slacker and john isnt too far behind he barely makes due working at a lowend car rental office and hes frequently late and will often make excuses to get out of work early lori understands that john and have a special bond but she also knows that john will never fully mature so long as is living with them it doesnt help that has become foulmouthed obnoxious and incredibly vulgar it comes to a head when he freely invites a group of prostitutes up to their apartment and lets one defecate on the floor she wants him to move outjohn complies albeit begrudgingly and helps move into an apartment above a chinese restaurant this requires to get a job as a cashier at a grocery store strangely enough all attempts to get himself intentionally get fired result in promotions this sets up the final act during which 1 john and lori will break up over the formers lack of judgment 2 lori will be pursued by her rich handsome and conniving boss rex joel mchale a man so clueless that not even continuous rejection can faze him 3 and john will have a falling out resulting in a brutal hotel room brawl and 4 will be kidnapped by an obsessed fan giovanni ribisi who desperately wants to please his bratty overweight son sam j jones will also make an appearance as will patrick warburton ryan reynolds and tom skerrittone of the best decisions macfarlane made was to not dwell on the miraculous nature of sentience like the muppets hes assumed by the general public to be real and is not made an object of wonder or ridicule i think that accounts for why audiences can see and respond to his friendship with john not only does what they share feel completely genuine were actually made to care about them both in a lesser comedy the filmmakers would regard a friendship between a grown man and a taking teddy bear superficially there would be no heart only inane jokes in this case macfarlane understands that touching meaningful subtexts can indeed lurk beneath a sea of unremitting crudeness without that sense of drama i seriously doubt the film would work as well as it didlearning to finally grow up is another everpresent theme one that could have easily been choked out by meaningless toilet humor but is instead examined with wit and intelligence it isnt so much about a manchild weaning himself off of his childhood possession its more about finding those healthy relationship boundaries and maintaining an emotional balance of all the lessons this movie could have taught me this was the absolute last i expecis one of the best summer blockbuster surprises of recent memory  a crass comedy that can make you laugh while at the same time tug at your heartstrings i honestly didnt know such a thing was possible given the failure of most previous attempts if you need an example look no further than the wretched thats my boy which is no more a fatherson bonding story than i am a rocket scientist chris pandolfi wwwatatheaternearyounet,comedy
was absolutely breathtaking and the funniest movie ive seen in years the story was great and seth macfarlane just has a touch for comedy that few actorsdirectors have in hollywood today the jokes were funny the fight scene was the best part of the movie the full fight the trailer is great showing the fight and all but it does it no justice the movie is so much better with the fight and its just funny as hell and even flash gordon himself sam jones gets in on the fun and its just a hell of a ride throughout but what its mostly about is a 35 year old man growing up and being responsible in his life their is a tragic scene at the end of the film that kids would tear up at but the ending is funny as hell i just cant give it away but this is a film for adults i mean its just downright surprising and funny when nails one of his co workers and gets promoand mila kunis and mark walhberg have such great chemistry that cant possibly be ignored theres not much romance in the film but just enough especially a scene where mark walhberg sings in a scene but all and all this is a great film dont let haters keep you away from it sure its not for everyone kids cough it has some vulgar language in it but not a ridiculous amount i really hope they give this a sequel or let seth mcfarlane direct another film because hes great at it and deserves to have a long career in hollywood dark knight 951 out,comedy
the story710 the story was good just a little teddybear who is best buddies with his friend who brought life to him it was funny and well written not really a story that will stick in your mind though the jokes will the dialoguesone liners910 hilarious i laughed so hard at most of the jokes its so funny its like peter griffin shoved himself into a teddybear costume it had me laughing constantlythe cast910 good cast mark as the cool buddy type and mila as the beautiful girlfriendthe acting810 good enough seth acso well the scenery710 it wasnt about really about locations so its kinda stupid to bring this up mostly normal and quite logical locationsoverall the jokes made me laugh and they couldnt have picked a better cast and just is a great and entertaining movie if you love family guy you should watch it right now,comedy
this is the last film i expecto give an 8star rating i mean a movie about a talking teddy bear i know next to nothing about seth macfarlane except that he is the creator of the show family guy which i have never watched the only time ive really seen seth macfarlane do anything was in a few of the comedy central roasts he was okay not the funniest especially when hes competing with the likes of giraldo jeff ross or lisa lampenelli but hes had some good jokes in the roasts i saw one trailer for this movie and i wasnt thoroughly impressed with it and then i saw from the mind that brought you family guy and i abandoned all thought of seeing it but then the movie came out and it currently has a 78 on the imdb star rating critics liked it and roger ebert called it the funniest movie of 2012 so far so i thought about seeing it but it hasnt come to my theater only two movies at a time its stupid so lets just say theres this place on theinternet that i watched itanyways the reviewthe movie follows the manchild john bennett played by mark wahlberg who has improved his comedy skills since the other guys he actually did do a good job in this as a child he made a wish upon a shooting star that his teddy bear would come to life and voila it did the teddy bear starts off cute and adorable and then we go years into the future john bennett is now a slacker living in a crappy old apartment with his bongsmoking teddy bear who has now grown from cute and adorable to a deepvoiced vulgartalking slob as john bennett approaches the fouryear date mark with his girlfriend lori played by mila kunis him and teds relationship start to affect bennetts relationship with his girlfriend things progress throughout the movie as the relationship and the antics it involves gets out of hand and then we have the full movie this plot is different from the summaries ive seen on various movie websites and those plots made me doubt the movie before i saw it but alas i was wrongwhat makes this movie work in my personal opinion is the fact that they acknowledge the teddy bears existence let me explain in most comedies like this where something comes to life etc etc they always have different jokes and gags where its supposed to be funny how they hide whatever it is and then at the end theres a dramatic revelation and people find out this movie is different because the bear is widely known and everyone has heard of so the pair dont have to make a habit of trying to hide the bear from everyone the bear even gets a job at a grocery store at one point resulting in some funny stuff this movie is also the smartest comedy of 2012 not the funniest but definitely the smartest the script was fantastic and all the oneliners mainly said by the bear were hilarious a lot of it you really did not expect at all and thats what was funny in most comedies the oneliners are obvious but still funny this movie has some oneliners that really makes you laugh out loud and thats another key thing in the movies hilarityso overall if you are not easily offended for this movie has some strong usages of four letter words you will find this hilarious i hope i though it was hilarious at some points and chuckleworthy at others but it was consistently funny and never left you bored this is a good start for seth macfarlanes directing career and i hope he continues to make movies like this ones that are funny and clever go see this movie for a fun time at the movies which i didnt get because i watched it on the internet but whatever810,comedy
one has to wonder that it is quite hard to make a truly funny conventional comedy movie so how on earth can a nonanimamovie about a walkingtalking teddy bear succeed this stuff works fairly well for a certain kind of audience when its animaas director macfarlanes the family guy has shown but with live performances and no animation one would think the pitfalls to be insurmountable that said the fact succeeds in an even more mainstream way than macfarlanes previous productions is a pleasant surprisethe movie is rich in satire and detail the kind in which youll catch additional humorous connections with second and third viewings but has a real beating heart underneath the veneer of its unique combination of raunchy humor and political incorrectness most will likely be at least somewhat offended at some point  which is pure macfarlane the jokes are continuous and the wit is sharp enough to blot out the occasional deadspots beyond the writing though it would still likely be impossible to achieve such a level of success if it were not for the cast simply put the cast is uniformly excellent  like an ensemble with great chemistry plus outside of the outrageous theres the great device of the patrick stewart narration which treats the story as if it is a heart string pulling disney family movie  until it veers into the profane but laughableis even more overthe top than youd expect in a cometolife hard partying 30something slacker teddy bear is actually a sweetheart underneath the smartass exterior how the directors managed to make look as real as the actors is for lack of a better description amazing playing out the love story subplot mark wahlberg and mila kunis certainly have that special something commonly called onscreen chemistry they have to make it work because they are a couple that is simply meant to be and the viewer feels something for them add the fantastic characters theyre surrounded by and the sum total is movie that manages to combine ribald humor with heartwarming story telling in the most unconventional sense this movie blazes its own totally unique path if you like comedies and are not easily offended it is an easy recommendation because it is certainly the best comedy of 2012 plus nice seeing tom skerrit backhe he,comedy
when i first heard of the premise of the movie i was a bit skeptical a talking teddy bear it could be funny but i wasnt too sure was i ever in for a surprise as proves to deliver the goods the movie stars mark wahlberg as john bennett who as a child wishes for his teddy bear to become a real personjohns wish comes true but never in his wildest dreams could he have ever imagined his teddy bear to be so vulgar voiced by seth macfarlane has a potty mouth that will leave some audience members falling from their seats and others appalled some of his lines coincide with current dialogue used in todays world thats a testament to great writing thanks to seth macfarlaneto read the full review go to wwwcanyonnewscombe sure to like us on facebook to get all the latest movie reviews at wwwfacebookcomcanyonnewsla or follow us on twitter cnewspaper,comedy
when i went to see advanced show i had low expectationsi am not that big fan of family guy or crude r rajokesbut this blew me away it is smart intelligent creative and work of arti will make sure that i will be watching family guy if thats same kind of humorall in all one of the coolest comedies i have seen in agesfresh breath of airi loved the chemistry between mila kunis and especially i know mark is amazing but mila really brought it home for me do not bring children to see this my kids saw the trailer and didnt understand what was in it but because of the cute teddy they wanto see it so dont show the trailer to children i think this is seth macfarlanes first featured movie and i will be looking forward to more of his stuff genius in makinggo and see this movie must seehttpted,comedy
when a little boy wishes his teddy bear could actually talk to him he wakes up the next morning to see his wish come true best friendsthunder buddies for life they say flash forward 25 years or so and now that little boy is mark walhberg and that teddy is seth mcfarlane mila kunis is walhbergs girlfriend and when things get out of control says its either going to be her or the beari know that going into this film that it was going to be 90 minutes of family guy jokes and thats a pretty accurate description so if you love family guy style humour youll really enjoy this i think family guy use to be funny and ever since it came back from cancellation its been stale manages to be both a lot of the jokes misfire and a lot of them hit i have to give mcfarlane credit though he only used one flashback gagfamily guy is notorious for having jokes about random celebrities and you either get it or you dont thats the same with a brandon routh joke and numerous tom skeritt jokes get no laughs but plenty of others do mcfarlane a fan of the 80s plants numerous 80s jokes here flash gordon being a big one i found myself laughing more times than not but when a joke falls flat boy does it ever gives mcfarlane more room for crude humour theres plenty of cursing in this film a bear that swears is funny for a short while but when the film tries to get a laugh out of him simply standing there and saying the fword then you know its stretching sex drugs and language fill this film so its certainly not for kids even if the young ones do watch family guy this is mcfalanes first venture into the film world and it shows he has no cinematic eye and doesnt know when to leave a scene the end result is a washmany of mcfarlanes friends and coworkers show up here mila kunis if the most obvious one she has a starring role but the supporting cast is basically a whos who of mcfalanes shows patrick warburton patrick stewart alex borstein and ralph garman just to name a few friends helping out friends i guess joel mchale plays mila kunis jerk boss who always makes advances at her that subplot literally goes nowhere finally giovanni ribisi amps up the creep factor and takes the story in a totally different direction in the third actin the end is a funny film the best way for me to recommend it is based on seth mcfarlanes comedy he wrote produced direcand voices its got his mark all over it if you like his comedy and television shows will be a laugh riot if not i would probably say avoid it,comedy
everyone knows when you enter the world of seth macfarlane that its fun and his work is a joy to watch as his concepts bring out the kid in you as his fairy tales remind you of your childhood he likes to showcase that dreams do come true with this work rightfully titled it shows that a fairy tale film can be a heck of a lot of fun especially when its blended with funny brash and outspoken talk and in the meantime it tells a touching story of love and friendship is a tale about a childhood wish that came true for a young boy john bennett who after receiving a teddy bear one christmas wishes it would talk and magically it comes to life as johnmark wahlberggrows up into an adult is right by his side living the party life and worshiping flash gordon now at 35 john has a love triangle his lady friend the cute and more job successful lorimila kuniswants john to grow up and end his attachment to however friendship and your love and memories and promises from childhood never change as this is one little fur bear that a grown mans love will not run from overall this film even though it has such a fairy tale theme is one feel good watch its funny and brash while it teaches a good message about friendship and love proving accept everyone for who they are and live together happy ever after and the concept is so clever and adorable of a talking teddy bear growing up with a boy into manhood,comedy
being an avid bearophile of many years my wife and i went to watch this movie after only having seen a short promo clip on the tv sunrise show earlier the same day what a ripper its got the lot  comedy lots off romance violence bad language car chases high drama drug use prostitutes homosexuals and of course a teddy bear who needs more as long as youre not some born again who cant tolerate bad language but want to be taken back to a time when a trip to the movies meant pure escapism then this is the movie for you i lold at this one something i havent done at movies for a long time the animation of the bear is superb so good in fact that you dont sit there thinking gee these guys with computers are really clever  this bear is real  go see it,comedy
2012  12 out of 4 hilarious comedy about a friendless young boy who wishes that his teddy bear would come to life which he does but as an adult john bennett mark wahlberg finds his relationship with his girlfriend mila kunis on the rocks because he cant settle down and quit partying with the bear seth macfarlanes comedy as you could tell from the trailer and its rrating is raunchy dirty profane and at times downright insane but any film could do this what does is that it not only delivers on the laughs but it also has a tremendous heart and i think this is what really separates it from the countless rracomedies that are being released each year theres no question that not every joke works but id say the overwhelming majority of them hit the spot and deliver much more than your highest expectations could hope for there are some hilarious jokes about various dory things from star wars to flash gordon but the stuff dealing with gordon give some of the biggest laughs of any comedy in recent years the jokes with sam j jones and the party sequence are downright hilarious and the events that happen with the neighbor had tears rolling down my face i wont spoil what happens but the entire sequence is one major joke after another one of the keys for this film working is its heart but a lot of this comes from wahlberg who delivers another very good performance its rather amazing being able to see how wahlbergs career has developed over the years and i really dont think anyone could have said when he starthat he would still be acting and still delivering high performances his tough guy image is certainly put on the line here and hes such a good sport with countless childish jokes that you cant help respect him for putting that image on the line kunis is also good in her supporting role and she has some nice chemistry with the lead then theres macfarlane who really delivers with the voice of the comic timing is pitch perfect and really delivers even better is the animacharacter who always seems like something real and not just some cgi creation scores on pretty much all levels and its clearly one of the best comedies in recent years,comedy
i saw expecting a raunchy crude meanspiriblack comedy yes it can be raunchy and crude at times but this movie couldnt be further from meanspirithis movie although adultorienand not child friendly to say the least is actually bighearand uplifting it tells the story of a man whose best friend is a talking teddy bear named but since he is 35 years old now his relationship with is interfering with his relationship with his girlfriend its laughoutloud funny i cant remember the last time a movie made me laugh this much and yet still is able to tell a great story of love and friendship its too bad this couldnt have been dialed back a bit to appeal to a younger crowd but that probably would have taken something away from this gem of a movie highly recommended 1010,comedy
after creating the brilliant family guy the hit and miss american dad and then the horrendous the cleveland show creator seth macfarlane brings his off colour surreal sense of humour with the wonderful tedim just going to come out and say it this wasnt as funny as team america world police but it was funny in its own right some of the jokes worked very well and i did laugh at them some other jokes just seemed too family guy and even were actually in the show the story was very good and i followed it well it was actually a very well paced story for a comedy like this another good thing about the film is that it didnt try to be overly vulgar from what i remember there was only maybe 2 dirty jokes and situations but ill let you find them yourself when the novelty of a talking junkie foul mouthed teddy bear wears off and the crude jokes of course the film is very heart felt with a nice story about relationships and friendship and when its a good time to grow upthe performances were all done well with mark wahlberg as john bennett stealing the show even if he shares scenes with the real highlight he is funny charming and acts very dramatically for when its needed mila kunis as lori collins was probably one of the weak points of the movie but that doesnt mean that she didnt deliver a good performance giovanni ribisi was hilarious as creepy dad donny and has a very funny but small dance scene that i loved he had a lot of funny lines his son robert played by aeden mincks was equally as funny but just wasnt as funny as donny joel mchale was the king of hateful characters in this film as loris perverboss rex throughout his scenes you really despise his character and wish that mark wahlberg would punch him in the face or something and im glad that he was a hateful character because it balances the film and story arc out patrick stewart matt walsh and sam jones flash gordon are thrown in as small characters but add a lot to the film finally seth macfarlanes performance as pint sized was very funny and believable too he looked real and blended in with the scenery and i dont know what everybody else was talking about he did not sound like peter griffinoverall i loved this film and advise anybody with a sense of humour to go see it direcby seth macfarlane written by seth macfarlane alec sulking  wellesley wild starring mark wahlberg mila kunis seth macfarlane giovanni ribisi joel mchale patrick warburton matt walsh  patrick stewart,comedy
even though is a seth macfarlane movie i was hesitant to see it a thirty year old guy who lives with his foul mouthed teddy bear i was expecting another paul but macfarlane isnt british and this film was hysterical is a raunchy real life living teddy bear who combines the traits of every macfarlane character it was pretty awesome sometimes you saw him as peter other times brian and so on the real surprise of this film was mark wahlberg i cant remember ever seeing him in a comedy and i wasnt sure his rather dry personality would work with macfarlanes brand of humor but he fit in like hes been doing this for years i mean he was marky mark he must have some personality in there somewhere as for the story its not much different than a really good episode of family guy of course it a lot more raunchy and its not animabut there are certainly many parallels and defiantly some hysterical lines its not the kind of film i usually go for at points its more than a little stupid but id be lying if i didnt say i laughed my butt off throughout the film,comedy
getting patrick stewart to narrate a movie that starts off like a kids fair tale is perfect way to start this in a way this is like a grown up version of those shrek ogre movies that is the main frame of reference i can come up with but even then this movie breaks that mold too some of the elements are in place to make it like live action shrek but it is so much more adultsam j jones reprises his flash gordon role in this movie while he received a razzy for being so terrible in that one here he threatens the academy with a nomination for best supporting actor mark walberg is johnny who wishes his teddy bear to life and gets his wish he gets mila kunis as his girlfriend and love of his life along with the bear these together are the ultimate male fantasythe bear voiced by seth who wrote the script makes no effort to do a different voice from peter griffin thats ok though because hey in a way this is a different story line but has a lot of the same characters in a different situationi envy the bear cant figure out how a teddy bear would really get stoned but hey with the dream life he has of nothing but parties and work promotions i have to envy anyone who can get a raise and promotion at work in this economygetting the women he gets makes it even more of a dream your sort of the ultimate bear life as you do much better at getting women then yogi ever did at getting picnic basketsyes you need to put your brain into entertainment mode still this movie has mila kunis looking all great and not playing a real bitch which is a womens role much over done in movies today here she is the introspective beauty with the golden heart and the childs sense of humorwhat surprised me here pleasantly is that in spite of all the adult themes it doesnt show as much skin as you might expect wonder if they are saving that for the uncensored dvd with the good looking women in this that could make this the hottest selling dvd everthis movie successfully bridges the gap from fractured fairy tale to crazy while crossing a few lines seth has never crossed before years from now there will be an entire generation of adults who will be so glad those lines got crossedhappy 100th birthday to universal studios whose logo is on this film thank you for putting out pure entertainment for 100 years this film continues that tradition,comedy
let me start by saying that i hate family guy its stupid boring and just all around not funnythat being said lets get to my review my friends dragged me to see this film so i thought eh what the heck might as well106 minutes and 19 dollars later i just feltlost the movie is a spitting image of family guy and why wouldnt it be the guy who made family guy voices the main character but theres the problemlame jokes missed jokes and no jokes i wanto like this movie sooo badand i actually got distracfrom the film because i was trying to hard to like it halfway through i gave up no hopeit has a good story so thats why its getting 3 stars the comedy and all the family guy theme is what took 7 stars awayif you plan on seeing this movie i hope you like family guy,comedy

if you like jokes laced with profanity and blaspheming god and jesus christ then this obscene movie might be for you and you might need some serious attention if you were thinking as i was that maybe the kids can watch it because theres a sweet and adorable looking talking teddy bear in the movie forget it dont just leave the little ones at home as a previous reviewer commenleave all your minor children at home dont think twice about it just do it trust me on this usually movies like this are produced and direcby atheists because of the overwhelming about of blasphemy and mocking of god that is present in such movies update i just looked us the director of this movie and by the way he was also the screenplay writer and the guy is an atheist as my suspicions were logical and proved true,comedy
so why dont i find a movie about a perverteddy bear to be funny hmm let me see maybe its because i dont find crude humor funny i find crude humor to be immature and trashy maybe its because i think seth macfarlane is a loser who got rich only because other losers love him maybe is just a terrible and pathetic movie that tries to be funny but just ends up playing out like a jim henson puppet show thrown in a blender with a pornographic vhs tape the whole movie was full of swearing pervy sex jokes and toilet humor what the hell youd think that people would have more common sense and not be such morons thats what happens when somebody who makes nasty cartoons like family guy gets the chance to make a feature film i dont know maybe i sound like a prude or maybe im offending all the crude humor fans out there but i honestly dont care i think this kind of thing is incredibly dumb and i think its pathetic that this movie has such high ratings over better movies that came out this year sinister came out in 2012 and it was amazing but its rating is currently lower than teds ratings society is degrading and to make matters worse this load of crud is having a sequel made,comedy
i remember this film being promotwo years ago and in the television advertisement for this i liked the line my bad i was sending a tweet which for me is one of the funniest and most memorable lines in this film one of my housemates renout this film in the same year it was released but i only watched about the first fifteen minutes of it at that time more recently i renit myself and when i watched it the whole way through i was slightly more satisfied despite the film dragging on from the middle and it was also a little overlongfor a start was wellanimaand comically voiced by seth macfarlane who brought us family guy speaking of which the irreverent dialogue in this would appeal to fans of the said animasitcom and teds mention of peter griffin was a cracking fourthwall joke and pop culture reference rolled into one other pop culture references i noticed were to other films distribuby universal such as et and jurassic park and i figured that they could pay homage to universals centenary in 2012 back to the titular characters animation was one of the best assets of the production values as were the cinematography and some beautiful uses of scenery particularly johns snowy childhood neighbourhood plus also the lens flare effect over it and the park while the incidental music was pretty grand for the films genre the music accompanying falling down after having been torn in half was simple yet suitably chilling and dramatic i also liked the song played over the opening credits as well as the use of the flash gordon theme norah joness  come away with me that she briefly performed live and tiffanys i think were alone now both joneses sam from flash gordon and norah were surprising additions to the cast and what surprised me even more was norahs dialogue since i never saw her to speak in a tongueincheek way but sams appearance was more worthy especially when he demonstrahis flash gordon actions with regard to the leading human characters the chemistry between mark wahlberg and mila kunis may have been typical romcom clich but their bonding with has made this chemistry somewhat new the narration from patrick stewart was engaging and almost as irreverent as the film itselfoverall is a worthwhile comedy that has its cheeky moments but funny ones too albeit its sluggish pacing and long running time 7510,comedy
i cant make up my mind as to what is more entertaining the movie itself or the  almost exclusively  american complaints on this site about the lack of morality and the crudeness in it this coming from the land of double standards where you can walk into a store and buy an assault rifle but cant show a woman breast feed on film because of some twismoral majority reigning your countrywatched last night and i laugh long hard and often it starts as some kind of stupid runofthemill disney output but beautifully deteriorates into one of the funniest goodie bags of bad language and down right hilarious oneliners i have laid my hands on for as long as i can remember its as predictable as a calendar but taken for what it is a comedy classic,comedy
heres my review about a film called tedit was a nice story overall but its not as entertaining if you were a parent looking for something to recommend their kids to watch the story starts off with a boy named john who has no friends and is given a teddy bear on christmas eve by his parents the boy wishes that the stuffed bear could speak like a human and the next morning the wish comes true over twenty years later john is 35yearold and has a girlfriend lori with whom he has had a four year relationship the teddy bear is still with him and has grown into a guy who likes parties and smokes weeds as always causes trouble in john and loris relationship john asks to leave his house and starts his own lifeproblem with teds new life still drag john in a bad parent tries to steal to be his childs toy and the relationship between john and lori nearly breaks because of and so on the story gets a little serious towards the endas i said the story itself wasnt so bad but its not something i would expect because there was a lot of talk about weed and cocaine at parties swearing and discrimination yet it supports a gay couple which makes me wonder if the film is trying to gain a wider audience,comedy
ask yourself who thinks potty humor is great think of the stuff you avoid reading on bathroom walls the type of humor juveniles think is funny about abusing women sex drugs and lots of curse words if you are still wanting to see go ahead watch it or rent itnow that you watched it if you replace the magic teddy bear with a pal or even an adopbrother is this movie still funny to you i didnt find this an amusing movie at all in fact my friend renit and i was under the assumption it was made for little kids under 12 boy was i wrong i am so glad i wasnt the father who dumped his kids off to go see the magic talking bear movie while i went shopping in the mallok why i gave this movie the 3 stars it truly deserves is the on screen actors it is nothing to stand in the studio and read lines for voice overs and spout off bad jokes but there was some talent at work for all the actors who had to sit and talk to an invisible bear and make it look real i have no issues with seth macfarlane writerdirector of this crap who will continue writing turds like this on tv he is the voice of and other voices on his adult cartoon shows this man has been degrading the value of tv for the past decade since i was a child,comedy
i got this movie on amazonand its actually a pretty good movie better than i expeca few days later  after i downloaded apptrailer on my ipodi found out i could of gotten it on apptrailers for free when i entered the promo code under videoshrvat11 and got 2000 free points which is enough for one movie luckily they have a ton to choose from so i got dark knight rises for free i think its a holiday special so it wont last forever all in all it is a good movie loaded with great jokes if you like crude humor this is the movie for you plus anything with mila kunis is alright in my bookbut really look into app trailers you wont be disappointed,comedy
have you ever had a friend who held you back someone who encouraged you to blow off your responsibilities and abuse drugs what if this was a friend who was only alive because you wished him to be what would you dojohn benett was a lonely little boy with no friends living in brockton massachusetts in 1985 then on christmas morning he received a plush teddy bear he called one night lying in bed john wished would come to life that wish came true thanks to a star falling from the sky while john was making it came to life shocking john his parents and the world at large but by 2012 no one cares john now played by mark wahlberg is working at a car rental agency and has been dating lori played by mila kunis for 4 years now voiced by seth macfarlane shares an apartment with lori and john but makes no contribution to the household expenses entertains prostitutes in the living room and rushes into bed with john and lori during thunderstorms as they still terrify both him and john eventually lori cant take anymore and tells john that must find a job and a place of his ownnow i am not a fan of family guy and ive never watched any of macfarlanes other less popular series the most popular shows on fox all seem to follow the same formula one or two smart characters surrounded by idiots in family guy the smart characters would be brian and stewie in the simpsons the only smart character i can think of is lisa that aside is a hilarious film not particularly intelligent mind you but what were you expecting from a movie about a teddy bear brought to life by a wish on a falling star shakespeare i wont say its perfect it isnt i will say it was worth the price see it,comedy
it was only a matter of time before seth macfarlane creator of its like that time when we cartoon sitcom family guy and the vastly superior american dad got a shot at the movies after all family guy spends most of its time playing homage to referencing or mocking the movies while at the same time stealing most of its ideas from them clearly an avid viewer of popcorn cinema as well as the musicals macfarlane reverts back to the 1980s with when buddycop action comedies ruled for a prolific yet short period of time only rather than say a loosecannon white cop and a buttonedup black cop here we have a pothead manchild and his wisecracking teddy bear best friendyoung outcast john bennett has trouble making friends and after being bought a giant teddy bear for christmas he wishes for his new friend to be his friend forever the magic of christmas or something grants his wish and he wakes the next morning to find alive and speaking he becomes a national celebrity only twentyseven years later john mark wahlberg is stuck in a monotonous job while voice by macfarlane sounding like peter griffin has become a beer swilling bongtoking layabout they are still best of friends and john is happy in a relationship with lori mila kunis only teds behaviour goes too far one night when he brings back a party of hookers one of whom ss on the floor that leads to lori growing increasingly impatient with johns childish attitudeif theres one good thing that can be said about seth macfarlane is that he knows how to write buddy moments stewie and brians road to episodes in family guy prove some of the series headlights playing on the bizarre and unconventional aspects of their relationship bringing originality to the tired idea of a mismatched duo that care for each other deep down it also manages to show a warmer side to his generally unpleasant yet often funny sense of humour and this is one of teds strengths john and teds interactions tend to be warm and amusing as they share their love of pot beer and flash gordon 1980 that brings the best out of wahlbergs underrasubtle comedic talent something was best displayed in i heart huckabees 2004yet the familiar story of a romance getting in the way of a bromance provides no originality especially in terms of setpieces it resorts to a lazy carchase finale that wraps up a rather silly subplot involving giovanni ribisis creepy donny abducting to give to his even creepier son that lacks anything resembling imagination or inspiration another subplot includes lori being hit on by her generic richboy boss rex joel mchale a character that looks as if hes walked straight out of family guy its all just a rather disappointing lazy experience given macfarlanes obvious knowledge of his medium and really only has one memorable moment that involves john meeting flash gordon himself sam j jones the rest is a mishmash of crude humour that works less favourably on screen than it does in a cartoon spouby the frequently annoying who is nothing more than a more obnoxious peter griffin kunis is sweet and likable as ever though and wahlbergs likability plus a disappointingly minuscule appearance from patrick warburton provide some warmthwwwthewrathofblogblogspotcom,comedy
initially i had expeca bit more from in the sense that the movie didnt really cause me to have all that many laughs throughout the entire feature sure there were some great moments here and there but they were far apartnow dont get me wrong because is not a bad movie far from it it is actually a quite good movie it has a nice storyline that will appeal to both a younger and a more mature audience plus it really helps that the cgi animation of himself was really amazing all throughout the movie he was real and lifelike which was really important to make a movie like this workplus they had also cast some good people to fill out the roles for the various roles in the movie and mark wahlberg and mila kunis actually had some good onscreen chemistry and that worked out quite nicely but again the animation of and his entire personality was really the fuel that made the movie run so well and it was also nice to see ryan reynolds make a small appearance in that role as he did and it was also nice to see sam j jones in the movie i dont actually think ive seen him since flash gordon at least not that i can recallfor a comedy then really didnt fully deliver the goods the story was solid good and well execubut it just lacked that onestepbeyond comedy that would have made the movie explosive personally i had to look far for the laughters in the movie i was thoroughly entertained by the movie thoughcould have used some improvements on certain aspects but all in all it is not a bad movie,comedy
ive not seen much of family guy and the episodes i have seen remind me mostly of simpsons but of lower quality and an extreme reliance on stereotypes racial humour and slapstick not to say that isnt funny but it gets old fast when i watched the trailer for this movie and saw that seth macfarlane was directing it i expecmore family guy humour and lots of the same formula i was right but i was both delighand disappointedthe movie has lots of great crass and disgusting humour i dont turn away from raunchy jokes if done right and the first half has a ton of good jokes i was laughing all through the first half and i was entertained but it wasnt just the humour there was a great quality to the story it felt a bit more original it was shaping up to be better than the clichd story of choice between friend and lover and had much more to do with the relationship of and john than the conflict even after the breakup the scene where blames john for his poor choices rather than having to take the whole blame was nicely done and i felt this movie was going placesthen the second half happened and i was disappoinmacfarlane proved he didnt have much material apart from his rigid humour and the story fell into the dumb formula it was making fun of in the first half jokes here were bad and emotional scenes really fell flat this guy doesnt have the imagination and the variety that matt stone and trey parker have or the broad political satire of the simpsons writers he sticks to the tried and tesand that gets very old very fastdisappoinby the second half but ill recommend the first half to any fan of the wacky humour present in all of macfarlanes works or anyone who enjoys these sort of raunchy comedies,comedy
i hate family guy even more i hate american dad its just the some old life lessons over and over again that we dont need and dont want feature films on the other hand seth was made for this a clich often used in family guy and american dad comedy is the degenerate friend gets you into trouble thing which kinda gets on my nerves but this manages to be packaged very nicely also i love the film airplane so thats a plus people often compare family guy to south park but the thing is trey and matt are actually good at doing south park while seth is so terrible at dishing out new episodes he lets his staff writers handle the job seth comedy is best served in long intervals and not in 20 episodes per season as for the dirty comedy thing personally i think its 2012 the mpaa ratings system is there for a reason i dont particularly endorse rracomedy nor hate them for being rrasome scenes were funny others not so hence the 6 anyways id recommend you see this film back home with your family on blueray or with your partner or yourself because the theater is a really annoying place to watch such a film especially when youre in hong kong where half the audience doesnt know why john appears in a pilot suit dancing to the song stayin alive and they freak out over some freaky thing does,comedy
had one of the best trailers available to see from early 2012 an original idea for live action at least and a cast who can deliver from the start of the film it was obviously the work of seth macfarlane family guy humour oozed throughout the film even using a few cut scenes which seth and his crew have turned into an art formthe story line was fairly simple and linear which was one of its downfalls but it was very entertaining with lots of 80s references and crude humour bringing you as the viewer closer to mark wahlberg and seths characters and their friendshipmark wahlberg gave a great performance acting alongside a animacharacter easily letting you as the viewer forget wasnt real and getting the most from the storymila kunis was good but i feel she has given better performances in other films sometimes it seemed she was a little uncomfortable and meg gave an appearance once or twice which was hardly surprising given the seth connectionthe side story which was bought by the always fantastic and in my eyes underappreciagiovanni ribis felt a bit unnecessary until the very end the same goes for milas boss i got the impression he could act but was unable to pull off seths humouri enjoyed this film but can understand why some wouldnt if you like family guy and feel good films chances are you will enjoy it too,comedy
in this movie mark wahlbergs character has a buddy who is a living breathing teddy bear in order for this movie to be funny you have to find the idea of a crude teddy bear to be ridiculous for this to happen you need to be able to associate the voice of the voice actor with a cgi bear the voice was a little too real for me i could imagine in my head what the voice actor probably looked like i hard a hard time identifying the voice with the cgi character so instead of seeing an absurdly crude voice come out of an absurdly cute bear i just saw them separately but there was still some great acting from mark wahlberg and a few other actors and some interesting bostonrelahumor the actress who played his trophy girlfriend was forgettable though,comedy
think of as an rraversion of the latest muppets movie is a stuffed bear who magically comes to life when an eightyearold boy makes a wish while a shooting star passes by he doesnt seem to know about the star though the bear and the boy become best pals through childhood and into adulthood you can also think of as an even raunchier episode of family guy or even the shortlived series greg the bunny fast forward 27 years and john mark wahlberg is now a 35yearold slouching slacker whos happiest just sitting on his couch getting stoned with yes i mean the dude does have a job at a carrental place but hes clearly going nowhere he does have one truly awesome thing going for him though  hes dating lori mila kunis whos as down to earth raw and crass as and john so she fits right in trouble is she and john have been dating for four years  now and hes getting the impression that shes ready for more its a tug of war does john jettison in favor of lori who feels very rightly that is holding john back sort of like how in the muppet movie amy adams is a tad uncomfortable with walter the muppet coming between her and jason segal anyway lori gives john chance after chance to get his act together at one point moves out into a seedy apartment eh its okay though because there are plenty of hookers around the bear gets busy you know what i meanas with most seth macfarlane projects there is a ton of popculture humor you cant escape it some of it works some of it doesnt work at all luckily even some of the bad stuff comes off as self deprecating as if macfarlane knows the humor aint quite there theres an interesting homage to airplane at one point and it works now the reason the muppet movie could take this approach and make it work was that it was sweetly sentimental an homage to a bygone era it was cute and funny and mainly for kids or adults who cant let go of the past on the other hand takes the same approach and just amps up the adult content you want drugs yep drink yep naked women of course theres naked women and there are plenty of references to what uh huh can and will do to them its weird its creepy and its expectedthe plot itself is pedestrian everyone needs someone needs john john needs john needs lori lori needs john leaves john feels bad convinces john to party lori finds out lori leaves john gets kidnapped oh yes theres a kidnapping too with a seedy dad giovanni ribisi and his needy kid its a side plot thats really unnecessary except to give us a car chase and a race up the green monster at fenway park have i given too much away of course not the plot isnt that big of a mystery anyway its the jokes you come for okay let me put it this way if you like family guy but always felt the creators macfarlane were holding back because of tv censors then youll find plenty of laughs here scattered though they may be if youve never been a family guy fan you probably wont get into this too much anyway sometimes the pop references are funny on their own but make zero logical sense for example at one point brags about having met norah jones at a belinda carlisle party and having sex with her in a closet considering how close and john are supposed to be throughout the movie it really isnt likely that the teddy bear would be off at hollywood parties while the human is stuck in boston yes you read me right i accept a talking stuffed animal but thats itif i were to pick just one thing that i loved about the movie though it would be the etherealyethumanistic mila kunis who makes for a terrific girlfriend shes not a caricature a bit of a surprise she doesnt demand things from john hates to issue ultimata but of course does have to can joke as nastily as her male counterparts and is an allaround good person with real feelings characteristics i wouldnt expect to see in a seth macfarlane movie maybe its to make up for all of the crap kunis character meg takes on family guy never seen such a hacharacter in any event kunis is terrific better than the material by far the best part of the entire movie its nice to be beautiful im sure but its wonderful to be talentedwas never meant to be for everyone thats for sure you love raunch well then this movie is drenched in raunch dressing and off color nonpc jokes some of it is painfully unfunny who thought having mark wahlberg sing was a good idea some of the scattered references do stick a little so its not a waseffort  as long as you count yourself among the intended audience,comedy
the great thing about is that they know their target audience and they hooked us from the very beginning it starts with a fairly well written narration about how in 1984 on christmas eve all the boston kids would gather together and beat up the jewish kid and then the next morning they would open their presents one little girl got a cabbage patch kid  the identical one which i got on the exact same morning they had similar clips for the rest of the audiencejohn mark wahlberg got a teddy bear who became a real live teddy bear a christmas miracle just like baby jesus that should give you a sense of what the humour is like its blasphemous homophobic racist and culturally offensive for those who dont get offended easily its actually pretty funnyas john grows up and becomes famous he is a walking talking teddy bear after all they settle down for a life filled with childish behaviour and lots of pot one morning john is too stoned to drive to work but behind a blue haze of marijuana smoke says its okay he can and so he does i couldnt help myself but laugha lot of people seemed to be delighby the fact that there was a story to the movie somehow expecting that there wasnt going to be one as much as hollywood would prefer to not have to tell a story they always at least try but dont let the fact that there is a story confuse you into thinking its a good one its not its a simple romantic comedy about a guy who cant grow into a man because as long as he has a teddy bear he will always be a kid that is paraphrased directly from the moviethe novelty of the humour does wear off as the story builds up most of the lines remain funny but i would like to think that they could have made the plot funny too an element which makes horrible bosses 2011 a better movie than thiswahlberg essentially plays himself minus the singing ability so he was very natural but his reactions werent as funny as in i heart huckabees or some of his other comedies giovanni ribisi on the other hand does not play himself  i hope and he hasnt been funnier he plays that creepy guy from the park with the kid who could be his son or who may be his loversome scenes i was a bit too creeped out to laugh some scenes were so damn funny that i couldnt help but laugh and some scenes should have been made funnier which is probably what most people would expect to get out of a movie like ted,comedy
this is justhilarious and i mean gut bustingly hilarious it has been a while since i laughed this hard watching a comedy its seths signature slightly childish but at the same time clever comedy and i loved every second of it obviously the premise is about a boy and his bear who he wished could really talk when just coincidentally a shooting star pops along when you wish upon a star and he comes to life hes at first surprised but accepts it quickly the parents reactions by the way are quite funnyafter teds celebrity status and patrick stewarts fantastic narration and john have grown up and smoke weed laze about the house and discuss some hilarious ideas the jokes are quite often inconsistent but hilarious all the same especially when gets job i wont ruin it for you but its one of the best parts of the film although its a bit shorti know im using the word hilarious a lot but that is the keyword in this film its typical seth and thats what we want thats what we got and i loved ittheres only 2 things that i didnt really like the first was mark wahlbergs accent most of it wasnt bad its just every time he said a word with an r at the end made him sound like a total ass its only nitpicking though and doesnt affect the overall filmthe second was that the film although brilliant wasnt really that quotable theres no lines that could be repeain everyday conversation unless set up which to be honest is a once every so often opportunity and by then you may have already forgotoverall its brilliant utterly utterly brilliant i see people have panned this film for its childishness and inconsistency sorry people these are attributes of seth its what we love him for we wont expect anymore or any less,comedy
i loved this film i was worried that it was going to be family guy in real life but it wasnt  it did verge on it very occasionally but it kept to its own paththe premise of the film is simple the story easy to follow and thats why it works the jokes are hilarious the comedy unbelievably candid the idea of utilising a childrens teddy bear that has grown up but not grown up with the main character is a touch of geniusi laughed and laughed through this and it separates out true comedy lovers from the easily offended just like family guy in effect i can think of no way to improve this film except replacing marks annoying accent which sounds like a speech impediment at timesi cant wait to see an uncut or extras version be made available and this is one of the rare films i will actually bother to purchasetop score which again is rare from me well well done,comedy
for the last few years seth mcfarlane has graced television screens with family guy and american dad two animacomedy shows that leave me laughing for 23 minutes straight with its new idea of wit oneliners and hilarious cutaways which brilliantly reference other tv shows and moviesso when i saw i had seen all the trailers and was absolutely buzzing particularly with the allstar cast which includes mcfarlane after laughing so hard for the next 106 minutes it officially ranks as one of the funniest movies i have ever seen and officially makes mcfarlane a geniusfirst thing that makes it great the cast i said its an allstar lineup but the cast are just so good mark wahlberg and mila kunis have such good chemistry on set and looked a perfect match mcfarlane lent his terrific voice acting skills to the role of and despite sounding a lot like peter griffin which for the record i have no objection to he was probably the only person who could ever make the character come alive and his relationship with john wahlbergs character is absolutely brilliant even though it has absolutely no right to be the supporting actors were great as well patrick stewart was probably the only person who mcfarlane would ever have considered giving the role of the narrator to and his voice really adds something to the movie i also loved the jobs patrick warburton and giovanni ribisi did and sam jones as himself was just too funnysecond thing that makes it great its the mcfarlane formula he took what he mainly does on family guy and made it into a featurelength movie i have no idea how he makes it work it has no right to work but goddammit it works the scene where lori asks john what he thinks his dance moves were like when they first met the way he spoofs the infamous saturday night fever scene despite the fact its already been done in movies such as airplane had me in hysterics for the whole thing it was just perfect its weird because quite a few of his jokes centre around pop culture and when the god awful movies of jason friedberg and aaron seltzer are released containing these jokes theyre always slabut for good reason they are dreadful i guess mcfarlane knows how to get things right not make jokes drag out too much or make them repeating themselves and the timing is key which he always gets rightso yeah this movie flat out rocks and unless your sensitive to very vulgar language and terrorist and racist jokes drag yourself down to the nearest theatre and watch this movie ,comedy
when you first look at this movie you think it would be a kids movie because its the story of a teddy bear and a grown mans friendship then youre like amazed that its rar instead of g or pg most parents would think 1st its a movie for their children but its weird that its not its funny how grown men like me plan to watch this movie cause usually girls watch movies that involve teddy bears as for this teddy bear acts more of a man than just a teddy bear he has a job girlfriend and loves to party and relax seth macfarlane was a good choice to play the part of and peter griffin are similar in many ways they love to do stupid things to be funny and theyll do anything to just slack off many children treat their stuffed animals as if they were family to them as a young boy john thought of as his little brother they loved to be together since john couldnt make friends he chose to be his friend john said hes always there for him and he listens to his problems carefully over the years they become adults and all they wanna do is party is more of a partygoer than john john just wanto have a normal life like any other man on earth but just thinks fun is more important it sure did bite the dust when got a job he didnt want is sure enough to be a ladies man or should i say a ladies bear lol every girl knows what he does to please them he is who they want to make love milan kunis was a great actress i can picture her who gets annoyed by like when meg griffin gets annoyed by her family lol i would watch the movie repeatedly it was a great setup great dialogue characters setting and plot a regular man and a teddy bear makes a powerful friendship you mess with and the fight will be unbearable haha,comedy
awesome film love what does all the time he is my kind of beari actually got a picture who is very much like him here with my music also worth checking out was played in the olympic games last week from now the actors are also very trust worthy too wouldent mind having a bear when i reached 35 eitherp feel free to check out my channel here looks much like also wwwyoutubecombein84 my band depui sadly the movie is too much hollywood for my opinion i would love to see someone who dared to make something new out of todays comedy but still i love the fight they have looks like fun,comedy
so many comedies these days stick to the foulfactor how much can they gross everyone out while making jokes about drugs alcohol and sex without much context to it now being rraof course has these references but what i loved about it was that it still gave contextthe story line is a bit silly but a talking teddy bear is your main character so that shouldnt shock anyone but you find a connection with mark wahlbergs character and his struggles between the seriousness of his relationship and the want of having a carefree life with his best childhood friend you even find some relationship with as he learns to grow up beside his friendobscure references that few people can catch at first wonderful music scores provided by the walter murphy great narrative by the ever famous patrick stewart great acting from the cast yes even the cg bear cameos from celebrities one that caught me extremely offguard and an appropriate amount of toilet humor makes wellworth the watch,comedy
ok this movie is what it isa story about a boy and his teddy that comes to life after a magical wish i freakin loved it as a big fan of family guy and american dad i was not surprised to see the same low ball laugh your ass off cause youre to stoned to move jokes that you see in every mcfarlene episode marky mark is awesome he has great comic timing and keeps this movie moving in the right direction all the way through yes there are slow parts but you need them to let your stomach muscles rest after the funny parts as usual there are plenty of 80s referencesmaterial especially flash gordon which is one of my childhood favs so i am alittle biased fans of seth will not be disappoinits funny cause its rude racist and violent but just like a family guy ending its heart warming as well look out of the fight scene the creepy guy dancing and the kid getting punched in the facefunny fun the 60 year olds sitting in front of me didnt think the same though ,comedy
though i have been a loyal family guy fan although the series has seemed less funny over the past few years i was a bit hesitant to see seth mcfarlanes first liveaction film let me just start by saying that not only did i cry laughing in the movie theater i am still chuckling about it more than a day afterwards i thought that it was a good story at least as good as it could be with the very plausible idea of a stuffed teddybear coming to life with great cameos and a hilarious dialogue if you are looking for a really sappy movie this probably isnt the one as mark wahlberg and mila kunis are about as believable as a couple as tom cruise and katie holmes but nevertheless that isnt really what the film is all about it reminds me of a childrens movie with themes of magic and miracles and holiday cheer up until patrick stewart starts talking about the neighborhood boys beating up on a jew essentially this is a feelgood movie with all the vulgarity and pissoff world attitude that we griffinites can enjoy if you enjoy the idea of a talking teddybear one who might utilize vegetables in a sexual manner that smokes more weed than youve ever even seen maybe does cocaine with a certain 80s icon and has a mouth that only a mother from boston could love then this is the film for you if there was one thing that this movie taught me i would have to say that it is that an apache attack helicopter is indeed more powerful than a little boys wish but not by much,comedy
if you are an adult with a good sense of humour as comedy movies go its a must seei think the teddy bear is a brilliant creation how he is such a modern day slacker who doesnt give a  hes one of the funniest creations in the past few years as they say simple things can be the best and the idea of a bad ass teddy bear is to me a very funny idea to the haters its a comedy movie about a teddy bear its not trying to be a profound learning experience and to the pc freaks ya the comedy is crude and anything goes but so are all the most applauded comedians of history also a movie that pokes fun at racism and sexism does not make the movie racist and sexist learn the difference ye sensitive whinebags,comedy
i can not believe that this awful movie got a 7 that is overrating it big time it is not funny at all seth macfariane is a good actor he a an awful director he out to be ashamed for making such garbage i cant believe people think this is funny the things his people like his crappy shows and his crappy movie there for he does not know he is an awful writer the story line in this movie is awful it is not funny just stupid it has got to be one worst movies of all time comedy is just to easy i can not believe people think that this funny it is so not funny after i saw this movie i wanto put seth macfariane in a headlock he is a great actor and he wast his time on such junk never see this movie it is awful,comedy
specially the part where he is doing the dirty teddy thing toward his future bride this movie is excellent but sadly it has too much inappropriate language and jokes i really dont like the fat kid in the movies because he is very badly spoiled by his father tony i think thats his name and he kind of have this thing called mental sickness the part that could show his mental sickness is the fast transform from very violent to and suddenly turning to an innocent kid must admit that the actor is very good lastly i want to talk about the main character john bennet he was such a good friend with but their friendship was very weirdfor me since they were together from a very young age had went on the television yet bennet wasnt mad at all but when they grew up bennet starto get mad at because of jealousy,comedy
i guess if you like family guy then you will like this movie while it does not have those wonderful cut scenes that family guy is famous for it does have the crude style of humor that one would come to expect coming out of the head of seth macfarlane it is interesting that when one of the simpsons creators decided to move into the realm of film making you get some academy award winner wannabe starring jack nicholson called as good as it gets where as when seth macfarlane goes into the cinema you get more of the same hey at least it doesnt put you to sleepi would say that this is a good movie not a great movie just a good movie is basically a complete rehash of brian so if you like brian you will like he starts of as a little wimpy but that is because he is a kids teddy bear however as the kid grows up so does which means he sits on the couch smoking weed picking up hookers and throwing wild partiesthe thing i liked the most about this movie was the irregular references to flash gordon i loved and still love flash gordon so having the movie rotating around this classic from the eighties made it stand out as can be expecfrom the creator of family guy sam jones the guy who played flash gordon doesnt just make a cameo but plays a reasonable role in the film including putting his fist through a wall while on cocainei could say that this is a film about growing up and in a way it is but in another sense it also deals with that constant pull that some of us have between becoming an adult and maintaining that part of ourselves that wants to enjoy life still is sam jones as old as i think he his can still go to wild parties pick up women and snort cocaine as well as smoking weed then i guess we all can do so in a way as well however there is something that old men with sex appeal have that many of us dont and that is money and if those of us with some money wish to use that money to create some form of sex appeal then i guess the old adage of fools still holds true,comedy
i watched then went through many of the user reviews on imdb afterward it surprised me that so many people who disliked were family guy fans im the opposite ive seen very little of family guy and never particularly cared for it but loved this moviefirst and foremost it was an amazing accomplishment to make as realistic as he was the animation was flawless and the actors were very convincing in their interactions with a character that didnt actually exist when they were filming their scenes yes the humor was raunchy but apparently i was in a mood for raw humor that day the acting was very good and the evil fatherandson team were actually convincing despite or perhaps because of the fathers comicallyspastic dancinga lot of family guy fans complained that they were troubled that most of the familiar family guy cast was brought in and used in a different context for this film but since i dont watch family guy and was unencumbered by any such troubles i just thought it was a very enjoyable well made comedy  with very credible dramatic and romantic overtones,comedy
perhaps i wanto like more but regardless of my expectations i laughed out loud more times during this than most movies ive seen in two years and though the audience also laughed i think i was the loudestits doubtful they got most of the jokes seth macfarlanes humor is mostly targeting one generation  specifically mine and well hisstepping aside from the endless references this is the closest family guy movie we can count on for nowas with most little tyke i wish for movies teddy bear macfarlane comes to life for a young boy john and thanks to this gift the little boy now a large boy never grows up even during his fourth year with the stunning lori mila kunis john mark wahlberg continues to smoke a lot of weed skips on advancing his life and complies with all teds wishesnot that thats a bad thingwell maybe the age old story that wraps around the movie but i guess they felt they had to go that route to make a feature lengthnote to seth you can spend 30 seconds or less developing a plot and the remaining 95 in complete chaos much like the movie you spoofed that spoofed other movies no spoiler from me someone else spoiled it for me  shameanyways that storyline almost led to its downfall with the terrible pacing and long stretches of nothingness thankfully returns to the screen and literally saves the movie each and every time he also reminds us not to take this all too seriously for the most part and i liked thatand this movie its offensive  to some  im sure but then those closed minded individuals need not see this movie i dont want to look at naked breasts so im not buying a hustler magazine even though they do not offend me like most guys get put off by seeing naked dudesnot to cut this short  i really dont want to spoil the jokes cameos or scenarios any further i highly recommend this movie for fans of family guy and american dad and those who like real humor that doesnt hold back on the swearing or racial jokes in fear of alienating bigots and i look forward to purchasing this on bluray and having a little party to revisit all the incredibly funny scenes like the fighter fighting i was rolling with that scene priceless,comedy
i went in to this one very skeptical but gave it a chance because there was nothing else playing and as a big fan of family guy i had hopes that the comedy would be relatively the sameit was for sure i was even laughing hysterically at several spots in the movienow although if you were to judge it by the coverposter youd say it looks like a quick cash grab kids movie for a career declining mark walburg but turned out to be just the oppositeit was funny and had actually had a pretty good script i mean even though it was such a far fetched idea with a teddy bear starring in it but it was actually not to accept the idea and jump right into it910 as far as comedies go,comedy
i have to say this film was better than i expecdepending on your sense of humour you will find it like marmite fortunately i love marmite is crude rude and blatantly obnoxious but funny as fck the fight scene had me in tears and the short sharp exchanges between and his boss where hilarious all in all a riotously funny film which if youre a marmite person you will love the mark of a good film is how quickly the time goes and the time just flew by watching this no brainier movie this movie does exactly what it says on the tin hopefully a 2 to follow i just wonder if they could match the writing again,comedy
larry charles the dictator is the best comedy of the year and nothing comes close really that i wrote back in early september 2012 before watching of course and moonrise kingdom recently i had to do my top 12 of 2012 for an online magazine i began collaborating in  i didnt include seth mcfarlanes first feature film but when i recalled its fantastic and hilarious homage to the flash gordon movie from the eighties i realized it deserved a place this is the best thing mcfarlane has creabasically with this movie he lived the dream of every geeky fanboy to work with his heroes and make tons of references to his favorite movies like star wars obviously he has been doing that for many years with his series if you have seen enough family guy youll recall some of its scenes with this flick but nothing is as cool as doing it for the big screen nothing as cool as ending your romantic comedy in the pure style of an action adventure that features indiana jones some people will think is a sortof excessive proof of the power that macfarlane has in the industry having norah jones herself for the musical climax is perhaps as excessive as random yes macfarlane did everything he wanto aint a perfect film but and like i indicafew others from 2012 were as funny its story is the very same of any romantic flick the man marky mark loses his girl mila kunis but soon gains her back the key here is that the reason why marky loses his girlfriend involves surprise surprise flash gordon himself and certainly the title character the teddy bear with life voice of mcfarlane himself aka peter griffin turns to be the classic crazy irreverenthilarious bastard i would love to hear the opinion of filmmakers like edgar wright and guillermo del toro since both are huge fans of flash gordon but im pretty sure made them very happy and they werent like hey i would have done a better homage to flash watched it on 11 september 2012,comedy
in many ways this movie is a reunion of the creator of and actors in the tv series family guy which isnt bad because there is a lot of talent there as a boy john bennett had trouble finding friends for no particular reason because he seemed to be the normal boy of 8 living in a boston suburb but for christmas he made a wish that his teddy bear would come alive and the next morning his wish had come true mark wahlberg is the adult john bennett 27 years later at age 35 he is stuck in a low paying job at a car rental business but has been in a 4year relationshipand his bear has grown up too not physically but his voice changed and he developed this really dirty mind and dirty vocabulary for no particular reason it seems and unlike some similar stories teds secret is widely publicized from the start and there is an inventive scene where he is a guest on the johnny carson show when carson says i thought you would be taller replies and i thought youd be funnier the pretty girl in johns life is mila kunis as lori collins she realizes he doesnt have a great career path but she loves him and knows he has a good heart but most of the story involves john giving in to teds suggestions screwing up over and over who saved john as a boy now is messing up johns relationship seth macfarlane creator and director voices and postproduction did a great job to make look very real although a static teddy bear was used in filmingthis story has some real potential but to me and also to my wife it wasnt handled very well there are some funny scenes but there is also a strong reliance on potty humor and sexual references that only serve to make the move dirtysounding i know to many that also makes it funny but to us it did not pretty marginal movie overall we would not recommend it to any of our friends,comedy
this movie is so funny i was worried i would laugh so hard i would have a heart attack as you all know this was a movie made by seth mcfarlene the creator of the hit tv series family guy fans will love this movie and i am a fan so there is no surprise there and the cgi on was great i am looking forward to picking this movie up on blue ray i also really like the cast mark  was great and mila was still gorgeous i hope seth will continue to make more movies i also want to say that joel m playing milas boss is really funny maybe we could even have a trilogyi give this film a b,comedy
was a great funny movie that provided many laughs and comedic moments seth mc farlin did not disappoint the way i see this movie is like stewie from family guy grew up with his bear rupert and the bear came to life and now he still lives with the bear this movie will have you rolling on the floor laughing the whole movie from beginning to end with some aw how cute moments even after all the fowl language and all the bad attitude from you still love that fuzzy little rascal add this movie to your collection as soon as possible its great and epic awesomeness if you havent seen yet you are missing out on a great funny movie of 2012 see it and then buy it you wont regret the buy you will watch the movie over and over again buy it love it watch it youll enjoy it,comedy
its greatas much as i like family guy id have to say this absolutely blew it outta the waterit made me laugh like a baby who discovered elmo for the first time not that a kid laughs when he sees elmoalthough i thought it would be just laugh laugh laugh it wasnt the writing was smart and the story was greatif you like family guy the simpsons or american dad youll love this flicki recommend you go and see it,comedy
if youre a fan of family guy then you will love this movie if you like me are not then you may like me struggle with the coarse unfunny humour sorry but i just didnt find it really very funny and i thought it fell rather flat as a romantic comedy i was unsure why the c word was used in a 15rafilm and i wasnt too sure that an adult should punch a child unconscious even such a loathsome child wellacby the promising aedin mincks but i suppose this was the writer trying to be clever and push the line of acceptability the film was only funny when sam jones was on screenmark wahlberg was agreeable as the dimwitlead with good support from joel mchalemila kunis saves it410,comedy
is a film that if you didnt know it was headed by seth macfarlane you would after about five minutes if that the premise about a teddy bear growing up and living with a man is one that has been utilised very well it does not hide from the fact that it is a very silly premise and does in fact celebrate it where the film has its weakness is where the humour is almost too synonymous with macfarlane a deluge of 80s nostalgia and pop culture gags reach the forefront of the film if you do not like this sort of humour where there are references galore some of which are a little too in your face and out of place it depends on the patience you have for these pop culture gags in family guy they can be prone to becoming severely out of place and too random to be funny in though they are at least for macfarlane kept in moderation the leads in mark wahlberg and mila kunis do very well and seem completely natural in parts that would be difficult to play otherwise wahlberg especially stands out and gets just as funny as himself voiced by macfarlane is of course the stand out character his only flaw is possibly that his behaviour is too predictable at times regardless he is very funny and does actually provide many laugh out loud moments plot wise it takes very predictable turns but its just a fun comedy and i anyway at least got over the fact relatively quickly the film is funny its key weakness is just that the humour is effectively very concentrated,comedy
best movies ive seen all year fricking hilarious i advise you to see it now now dont waste your timebest movies ive seen all year fricking hilarious i advise you to see it now now dont waste your time best movies ive seen all year fricking hilarious i advise you to see it now now dont waste your time best movies ive seen all year fricking hilarious i advise you to see it now now dont waste your time best movies ive seen all year fricking hilarious i advise you to see it now now dont waste your time best movies ive seen all year fricking hilarious i advise you to see it now now dont waste your time,comedy
seth macfarlane is one unique comical voice and he brings his family guylike formula to his first feature a movie about a bear who swears smokes weed and makes frequent crude remarks has serious potential and that is why deserves to be seen it is flat out hilarious tonally uneven and overly familiar but still hilarious with hardly a dull moment the movie provides some golden antics especially between mark wahlberg and macfarlane playing through motion capture the delightful pop culture references are also tickling none the least of which was an homage to john williams legendary march from raiders of the lost ark joel mchale and giovanni ribisi provide their own laughs in supporting roles patrick stewart gives a droll narration while norah jones provides a couple of jazzy original songs with his comedic resources and a possibly stronger screenplay you can only hope that macfarlane will make something even better the second time he releases a movie12  ,comedy
what boy is not afraid of the dark and furious sounds of thunder well young john bennett mark wahlberg wishes to have a friend and by the magic of his desires his cuddly teddy bear seth macfarlene voice comes to lifefast forward twenty odd years and john now has a live in girl friend lori collins mila kunis who hates to share the limelight who is john to choose this movie is funny and is a scene stealer as his lines are on mark you just dont know what this furry friend is going to say or do i could simply not stop laughing on the really funny lines that have been placed in this film this is sure to be come a classic silly movie you cant help but love a teddy bear,comedy
i was extremely hyped for it looked great and it was just something was missing the films hilarious and has you laughing frequently its full of macfarlanes typical family guyamerican dad humour which can be too offence for some and im sure this film is also had a plot surprisingly which was unoriginal and slightly too serious considerings its premise also has some great cameos to quickly round up this review all im going to say is the films great but it has its flaws some of the jokes are a hit or miss but the films overall the second funniest film ive seen all year first being 21 jump streetso i recommend it,comedy
for my next movie review im doing a review on the movie starring mark wahlberg and mila kunisthere was a lot of fuss about this movie and whether it would be good or not im here to tell you that it was a pretty descent film you have to remember that the main character in this film is a talking bear and its a comedy so you have to open your mind a little and bare with it with that said i can also see why people wouldnt quite enjoy this filmthe movie is a solid comedic movie that is guaranteed laughs sometimes you just have to have a little fun with movies and the film definitely represents that i also have to admit that mark wahlberg was pretty funny in this film he hasnt dazzled me before with his attempts to be funny but in this film he gave me a couple of laughs tooim giving this film a 7 out of 10 this film could have been awful but they put together a descent plot and made numerous attempts to keep the comedy coming this isnt a rush to the movies and see film but if youre bored and you need a couple laughs this would be a solid matine treat hope yall enjoyed the review,comedy
if you know what to expect i expect youll be entertained i could have done without the distracting and unfunny cameos but macfarlands voicing of the title character steals the show and garners enough laughs to make it bearable is a bromance with a difference a story of arresdevelopment that brings out the kid in you the bear really does come alive thanks to macfarland and persuasive animation mark wahlberg and mila kunis are appealing and give commitperformances while giovanni ribisi gives a creepy and campy performance that would fit right into the silence of the lambs if theres going to be a sequel how about meets chucky,comedy
i have to admit i went into with some moderately high expectations everyone i spoke to said it was hilariousto be honest though i was a bit disappoinit takes the same recycled family guy style of joke and cranks it at you for an hour and a half sometimes they hit sometimes they miss but i very rarely got a huge laugh out of this movie more just chuckles here and therethe one glaring exception is the scene with a certain star of an infamous campy scifi epic that part had me rollingeverything else in the movie just felt like stale family guyi do have to admit that my admiration for mark wahlberg as an actor grows he was a real sport going along with this concept,comedy
75 out of 10 going in i wasnt confident in this movie first im not a big mila kunis fan second i havent liked many of the recent episodes of family guy so my faith in seth macfarlane has been waning in the end this movie over came all of that it felt like classic family guy and i even liked mila kunis in this filmdont get me wrong this is not a perfect movie not by a long shot having sex and the feces on the floor are examples of jokes that didnt work for me sure there were a lot of dumb jokes in this movie but jokes like these are just to over the top for me another thing that took away from this was the clich ending i realize its a comedy but that doesnt necessarily mean it has to succumb to such a boring clichi feel like im basing the movie but i did find this entertaining the jokes in this movie were funny for the most part and there was some good substance to the movie for example at times there is a distinct role reversal between mila kunis and mark wahlberg for example the scene were they meet in the diner after wahlberg finishes talking he walks out of the diner this is one of the few times that you want the girl to run after the guy another example is the chase scene kunis is driving instead of the action hero mark wahlberg in the end is one of those few movies that is just a solid film its funny sad and it has substance all of the actors give a good performance and they all fit in there roles well just a solid film 75 out of 10,comedy
i havent really watched seth macfarlanes family guy that much but i knew this movie would be just as funny going in i was thinking it would be some average version of a movie like a boyman with his dog where this time its with his teddy bear but once i heard the first opening joke in this movie i was definitely hooked after that the jokes kept coming and i almost got to the point of tears especially with one later in the movie some of them you felt ok laughing about while some made you feel so guilty that you laughed so loudly after hearing themi finally got to see how the great mila kunis acand its funny seeing markie mark talk with his new yawklike accent like he did in the movie fighter it was awesome how it was basically peter griffin if he were a teddy bear even though he had a small part ralph garman from the podcast hollywood babbleon did great as johnnys father when johnny was little it kind of felt odd seeing ryan reynolds in this but his part was just as funny as everyone elseseven though the plot kind of felt basic the jokes were the main part of it you kind of had that feeling of knowing what was going to happen next but the stuff johnny and his bear friend ba dumb tssh are just so great you have to see it ill never look at toy teddy bears the same and also these pandas that im seeing on a local news station id definitely recommend this movie if youre in for a very good laugh id rate it a 7510,comedy
get a bunch of guys go out have a few beers and then watch strongly feel this movies fan following will grow as the years go by and a decade from today we will be putting this one alongside the big lebowski old school etcthe premise of is silly why would anyone want to watch a movie about an obnoxious teddy bear well because a teddy bear doing crazy stuff and speaking like he has no filter is actually pretty funny and truly is one of the guys we all had teddy bears growing up this is what happens if they grew up with us intelligent acting seth mcfarlane takes his family guy humour and is effective in throwing it into a stuffed animal overall a fun movie if you go in with the intent of having fun if you go in with the intent of finding an oscar nomination youll be disappointed,comedy
macfarlanes trademark mix of cutting satire and slapstick comedy setup worked its charm in delivering plenty of laughs and even a little heart for anyone who can handle the films risqu on screen escapadesbut macfarlane who makes his feature directorial debut with the film successfully balances the absurd and overthetop elements of with a number of grounded albeit familiar statements on love and friendship that said despite presenting a number of genuinely sweet moments the film isnt going to be for everyone and moviegoers who arent interesin watching a stuffed teddy bear fk a cash register display which is only the tip of the iceberg should probably look elsewherethis feels pretty much the same as watching family guy peter griffin is john is stewie and lori  lois the jokes are ruder cruder and more sexual orienhard to imagine rightwithout question the core story will be especially familiar to anyone who has seen a bromance film or a similar thirtysomething coming of age tale before had the movie not featured a sexcrazed talking stuffed animal itd be easy to write off as a formulaic and predictable series of events that fails to offer anything but formulaic characters in service of one comedy setup after another however watching the surprisingly lifelike animateddy bear performing even the most basic actions such as driving a car never gets old and as a result even the formulaic elements of the plot are easily heightened by the unabashed absurdity of the setup of course there are also plenty of fresh comedy gags as well  not to mention loads of 80s throwbacks that pull double duty in providing a number of laugh out loud setups as well as humanizing the stuffed protagonist ie hes really into flash gordonthe cast includes plenty of stilinteractions especially between wahlberg and but none of these moments detract from the overall enjoyment of the experience  since everyone on screen is clearly operating with their tongue firmly planagainst the side of their cheek mila kunis once again successfully flexes her comedy muscle and despite serving in a supporting role this round has some of the more enjoyable and heartfelt scenes with the bear joel mchales rex and giovanni ribisis donny are equally entertaining albeit exceptionally onenote which describes most of the characters in the film thin but entertaining vehicles for either physical or oneliner comedywhile its not going to be for everyone moviegoers who are onboard with teds campy premise and crude antics will likely find that macfarlane has delivered an entertaining liveaction comedy debut outside of the premise the scene to scene narrative elements dont offer many surprises but considering they revolve around an rratalking teddy bear most scenes still manage to present plenty of fresh laughs and from time to time heartstuffingwarming character momentsps wahlbergs accent is horrible i think he would of sounded better just using his own accent the one he tries to pull off comes across fake as ever listen out for ittried a little too hard,comedy
you couldnt ask for anything funnier from the mind of seth mcfarland the one liners gags physical humor and im sure some stuff had to be adlibbed is fin comedy genius with stealing every scene he is in thanks to outstanding special effects and mcfarlands comedic genius a little boy wishes for his teddy bear to be real and it happens and from there the movie gets funnier and funnier with wahlberg the boy grownup who has kunismeg of family guy as his girlfriend  look for other family guy voice over actors like patrick warburton and the guy who does the blonde swedes voices best scenes are all over especially when and john are afraid of thunder as grownups this movie is rar for a reason with lots of the f bomb and p jokes this is not a kids movie and i mean it you really have to be old enough to get all the pop culture gags and references and of course the language and some violence while comedic is strong especially a scene of getting his ear ripped off ok hes a teddy bear but hes a living thing enjoy  1010,comedy
in a comedy film i only give 10s if laugh like i gotta pee from beginning to end that being saidthis in the canvas that seth macfarlane needed set aside from tv this merger of universal pictures and seth macfarlane will be known for making the best comedy film of 2012 they tried this type of comedy before with hop but universal pictures was only able to do ok even though it was a easter release this is different it looks like a teddy bear but sounds like family guy with a unramouth i mean your gonna get a bit of everything kool narration a beginning plot and a ending its a full package filmgreat acting is seeing mark wahlberg john bennettinteract with like he was a actual human instead of a stuffed bear running with cgi graphic movements you truly believe they are best buds for over 20 years mila kunis is awesome as lori collinsgirlfriend to john she too plays off the bear so nicely you have to understand that when the actors act with they are just talking to props or just air its like a saturday night live skit that calls for two characters but your the only living actoryou will laugh and you will cry from laughing so hard either way dont be without the thunder buddies in the movie tedi just wish they would sell the teddy bear  it looks like a teddy bear but talks like a rar movie moms,comedy
when i first heard the idea of i thought it was going to be the absolute worst thing ever a comedy with mark wahlberg and a teddy bear with the voice of peter griffin did not sound too appealing obviously seth macfarlane was involved and that was the only hope i saw this movie having was one of the best comedies i have ever seen macfarlane delivers with his direction writing and even bringing to life the story is 100 clich and predictable but its great and it works after the intro scenes with john and i thought this was going to be a story of becoming too big and slowly becoming less and less interesin john i dont know why i thought that but i did the story turned into a relationship between john and lori with right in the middle still clich but i was surprised how and johns friendship stayed strong through their life their friendship did drive the story and did dig up a lot of the comedy in the movie the first time we see them together as adults they are smoking weed literally nothing made me laugh harder than seeing a teddy bear smoke weedi have said i do not like mark wahlberg in comedy roles but he is great he earned my respect as a comedic actor and would like to see him do more comedic roles he has a lot of funny moments he and bounce off one another perfectly and its really funny the fight scene between the two of them is funny every single time its just like the peter vs the chicken fights in family guy when wahlberg needs to be funny he is funny when he needs to be serious he is serious when he needs to be emotional well good enough i was afraid of having the exact same voice as peter griffin i didnt want to watch this movie seeing peter instead of this movie isnt like that feels like a real character and there is very little resemblance to peter griffin at all when talks i see and hear and that is important there are moments where it is his voice over and i hear peter or stewie impersonates a fish and uses the stewie griffin voice and i hear stewie the lights are out and is in bed with john and lori and he says something i hear peter talking to lois i dont hear luckily this happens very little but when it does its inevitable this plot has been done before but its so funny i can look past the clich with the comedy the party scene with flash gordon is legendary that whole sequence is one of the funniest scenes i have ever seen in any movie macfarlane has a writing talent where he references funny moments from any decade the 90s when is singing karaoke the 80s with flash gordon and so on macfarlane sets this movie in boston and it was perfect they hit on the stereotype of boston perfectly with the accents and the way some women act im from boston so it was really easy to relate plus they hit landmarks in boston then end up at fenway park awesome this comedy is really raunchy it seems that these days comedies can only really be good if they are raunchy i miss the old days of dumb and dumber and billy madison where a pg13 movie can be funny this is obviously rar and that probably is the only reason why it was as funny as it was the laughs are constant while most comedies tend to start strong slow down to develop emotion and story then end with a bang that is hysterical that doesnt really happen it does have its emotional moments but there are a few jabs of comedy that keeps the audience interesmacfarlane is really good at that as well he can draw emotion from a crowd while making them laughoverall is a great comedy with a clich story that only makes it better it is the writing and directing of seth macfarlane that makes this movie great he is the true star of this movie wahlberg and kunis are good but macfarlane gets the most credit i laughed a lot during this movie as it should have i can watch this movie time and time again the writing was great himself looked real the relationships were real and believable and the story was narraby patrick stewart the voice of a god gets the willyt comedic crest as a comedy and the willyt seal of approval as a movie as a whole the story and little things push this movie to the seal that is a rare sight in comedies,comedy
how many times you come across a movie where you can really laugh its a rarity films like old school hangover or come after a long timehowever looking at so many negative reviews here really surprised though i would recommend watch this movie only if you generally like watching comedies and crave for them like meis surprisingly funny with some really funny and witty dialogues it is also somewhat a reflection on what a person considers what life is and whether only a certain things count rather than all of itmovie has mark wahlberg who is natural in the role and voiced by seth macfarlane brilliant in his dialogue delivery and delivering fun punches i think only vince vaughn can match him in this area mila kunis is fine with her roleoverall a freaking fun ride go for it,comedy
first of all let me state that im voting a 9 out of 10 not simply because i think its a great film but because how often can you seriously rate a comedy it deserves the 9 for how well planned and produced it is before the content steals the showseth macfarlane creator writer director and voiceover artist of such animashows as family guy the cleveland show and american dad proves in his feature movie debut that not only does his own unique and hilarious comedy sketch brand of childish comedy make a successful transfer from cartoon to reality  low and behold the man can tell a story and make it stand apart from the crowdis the perfect mix of all the things a decent comedy should contain and whereas it might occasionally rely on offensive over the top comedy and stereotyping even if youve never really been a regular to the cartoon series he produces you still appreciate it because just when you think it couldnt be any more far fetched it weighs down like an anchor and grounds itself in realityits a stoner comedy a childish fantasy of epic proportions and dare i say it its reliance on the odd sexist and racist observations make for the type of uncomfortable laughter you can actually appreciate often more suggestive than balls out offensive it relies on your sick humour rather than insists that you learn to appreciate italso boasts a great cast aside from wahlberg and kunis patrick warburton family guys joe swanson is hilarious as guy patrick stewart narrates and ryan reynolds provides some of his greatest acting ever sam j jones cameo as himself is off the wall and back to the character of himself macfarlane has me in stitches so oftenoverall ought to be a classic and i think it will stand the test of time providing it doesnt rely on a sequel,comedy
id heard from many people that was not really that good and since all my friends and i are huge seth macfarlane fans this stunned me we are also huge fans of mila kunis and mark so we thought it couldnt do any wrong i waifor it to come out on dvd i actually really loved it i dont know what exactly people disliked about it but i thought that it was great for what it was yes there are a lot of 80s references i am not an 80s lover at all so i thought this would be my point of undoing but i found that since i didnt really know most of the references very well it wasnt anything to be bothered about i love the use of weed smoking in this movie because the hard truth that americans dont want to face is that more people than they realize smoke weed and its really not that big of a deal those that think it is are just brainwashed by the government telling them that its wrong and dangerous yadda yadda im not sitting here saying i do it because i dont but i also dont condemn those who do i fully support movies that dont shy away from the subject anyhow as long as you dont expect this movie to keep you laughing from start to finish without stopping and you dont have a problem with a bit of drug use and partying and seeing mila kunis fog up your screen with her hot self then this movie is great for you is it perfect no but it wasnt bad or disappointing there are even a few heartfelt scenes for those who like that,comedy
i watched recently and went in without high hopes however i soon found myself loving this film i found the characters quite likable and the teddy bear was extremely funny this film contained some great actors and the plot was quite smooth at no point during this film did i feel like i wanto put it down and watch it later the greatest thing about this movie is the plot its very easy for me to connect to the plot the plot may seem a little childish to some especially that came to life and that john didnt want to part from him however this film is far more than that spoilersdont read on without seeing the moviei found the ending very well done with lori deciding to fix up by the end of the film i also loved how it showed what happened to the characters by a voiceover with lori and john getting married continuing his relationship with the girl and some other revelations overall a fine film the funniest ive seen from 2012 and over the past few years,comedy
im not going to dwell on this is so funny you actually have to look behind you to check if anyone else in the cinema is actually phoning the police to report you for having thoughts that are a illegal b illegal c socially unacceptable d sick e illegal f perversethe good news though is that between the bits where it is so funny that you should actually hand yourself in for treatmentcounselling its really rather dullso as the film progresses youre like this is a ten man to this is a two man ah only if you are sad as me that i think in imdb mode at every movie i ever seeso its like 10 2 10 2 2 2 9 5 10 2 2 2 10 9 2 2 all the way through and the average of that is about 6 so ill give it a 7its really funny but boring,comedy
is an awesome filmyoung john bennet wishes that his teddy bear could be his best friend forever he gets that wish a walking talking living teddy bear this is them as adults potsmoking underachievers with gorgeous girlfriends who love them for their personalitiesstory 4 out of 5the story is a bit familiar weve seen the best buddy comedy before however weve never seen it with a talking teddy bear who smokes pot and drivesthe characters are set up very well and we get to feel for these people while many movies blast through scenes trying to get to some climactic point this movie takes its time  but not too much time  and lets us feel these people and relate to themthe couple is already together so we dont have to suffer through a budding romance movie again however the romance gets in the way of the friendship between and john which is what the movie is really abouti thoroughly enjoyed it its for lovers of family guy  american dad its for lovers of stoner flicks and comedy go watch tedwarning warning this film is not for everyone do not take your kids this is an rramovie dealing with drugs hookers creepy fanatics creepy bosses and sex in public on top of that there is a lot of strong language and sexual references,comedy
mila kunis mark wahlberg and seth mcfarlane just from knowing that i knew that i had to see tedthis film is the epitome of hilarious i laughed from beginning to end and im sure you will too as long as you arent easily offended mila and mark have good chemistry and their performances were very strong seth mcfarlanes wit and sarcasm was evident in the script and the crude humor of family guy was present throughout the film i wont recommend this film for anyone under 13 however adults will thoroughly enjoy the movie the plot is basic nothing phenomenal but the humor and wit along with the cast makes this movie just plain old funi dont want to spoil anything but there are a few cameo appearances from celebrities such as norah jones and ryan reynolds as well as several cross references to pop culture for humor if youre in the mood for a great and hearty laugh is definitely the movie for you,comedy
is the story of cereal killer bundy and honestly it is the boogieman nights of cereal killer movies bundy is played by that guy from new kids of the block mark wakeboard and he underplays the roll right down to having a stuffed animal sidekick true crime filmss are always upsettling because you know the factual facts are facts its the visual depiction of true life which adds some sort of authentification to the filmss starts out as a normal everyday kid with no friends and the jewish kids scream at him all the time then he wishes for a friend in his stuffed animal he then shows his parents his alive bear after they freak out they are never seen again we are lead to believe he killed his parentsoffscreen then for the next two hours and his bear just kind of walk around boston meeting tom skerritt fans and watching cheers then they hang out with flash gordon and david putty for awhile they meet ryan reynolds too and you hope ices him after what he did to the green arrow franchise but then the movie sort of just ends all in all i would say mike walkburg wsas ok as tedd bundy but i would have preferred to see more than him just doing bong hits and giving people keys to rental cars if your looking for a good cereal killer movie look to love and other drugs or bride wars,comedy
no a good try 80 there but hangover 2 was overwhelmingly funny with lackluster filmmaking this was very funny and better filmmakingbut a much better story despite all the crass humor the characters were endearing and like family guy and american dad it was consistently colorful and original unless youre a prude or conservative i never understood not liking seth mcfarlanethe things that surprised me were the periodic dud jokes in the sea of very good laughs for those 12 seconds there were no laughs in the theater and the other were the periodic 23 seconds that nothing was going on and thats a long time when you consider screen timeand the absence of music especially in the first half but much more in the 2nd for the overuse of music in family guy and american dad it was very noticeableit did wander a bit too felt too long i thought the walberg character was too old i would have preferred the character to be in his late 20s would have made more sense and his actions more acceptable but he was very good versatileive never been on the mila kunis bandwagon shes far out of my league but nothing special in the sea of hot gals better actress than scarlett johannsen and jessica alba but still average at bestjoel mchale was wasribisi was good as always and good for you ryan reynolds even when you dont say anything youre funnybut all in all a very good time id err on the side of see it now dont wait til dvd,comedy
is not for children or is a movie you would go to with your parents is from the makers of family guy i find family guy either funny or stupid i though would be either good or awful the movie starts like a childrens movie then turns into an adult comedy i laughed at the flash gordon party scene there are a few other stupid family guy scenes in the movie a few crude scenes the movie has drugs sex etc and is not a family movie i needed the stress relief so i laughed at this film i give an eight out of ten my wife was the one who suggeswe go see this comedy as it was getting good ratings and we needed a laugh it is nice just watching a movie for entertainment value rather than some movie that has a message,comedy
in a year in which the best movies have been dead serious seth macfarlanes comes as a breath of fresh air here is a cheerful and very raunchy comedy that makes us laugh outloud by building the comedy in inventive ways the content earns the film a very hard r but the movie never feels dumb or simpleminded only very creative people could have made this moviemacfarlane of course has made his name on television juggling three animaseries  family guy the cleveland show and american dad  that are consistently among the funniest in an arena where most shows are tired dull and satisfied to repeat the same formulas over and over this is his first feature and if this is an indication of his creativeness as a director i think this is the beginning of a brilliant film careeris the story of a magical friendship between a grown man named john bennett and the teddy bear that he was given as a child for christmas the movie opens with a narrator patrick stewart telling the story of how the two came together the narrators dialogue sounds like something out of a happy christmas movie until he breaks the spell with four letter words and a reminder that christmas is the day in which good christian boys take it upon themselves to beat the snot out of the jewish kids john has no friends and is told by the neighborhood kids to get lost  even by the jewish kid who is in the middle of his annual pummelingthat christmas johns parents gave him a teddy bear that became his best friend for reasons left somewhat unclear the teddy bear came to life and became his best buddy briefly became a global celebrity even appearing on the johnny carson show until he fame ran out i feel like one of the diffrent strokes cast explains they must feel pretty bad    at least the ones who are still living as he grew up john now played by mark wahlberg and with the voice of macfarlane himself still share things like a fear of thunderstorms and a nearobsession with the 1980 movie flash gordon they also partake of ball games wild parties beers and bongs some of the best moments in the movie have the two sitting on a couch passing the illicit device between them now 35 he is stuck in a nowhere job at a rental car company even with a nowhere job he has managed to maintain a fouryear relationship with his gorgeous girlfriend lori mila kunisthe glue of the friendship begins to unravel when lori suggests that might be stunting johns maturity living with a man and his living breathing talking teddy bear cant do much for romantic development so she reasonably suggests that it might be time for to find his own place lori isnt a nag however shes understanding and actually kind of likes except for his influence on her boyfriend shes also nonetoofond of coming home to find on the couch with four hookers and her floor occupied by a disgusting leftover from a game of truth or darethe story here isnt exactly original it is your basic yourbuddyorme plot but macfarlane finds ways to punctuate it with perfect little asides and characters that come and go like loris boss who keeps hitting on her by showing her his high school diving photo most of the movie deals with johns attempts to do right by lori but falling right back into the same partying patterns he once shared with tedwhat is original here is he is computergeneracharacter brought to life by the tippet studios whose computer wizards deserve an oscar nomination for visual effects next spring is a fully realized soul whose movements dont feel jittery like most animacharacters there are details to his movements that seem almost like an afterthought he is placed into this realistic world so flawlessly that he really seems to exist in it he really seems to be in the room talking to the actors there is an extended fistfight in a hotel room between john and that is a wonder of special effects i am giving the comedy of the film three stars but the special effects bump it up an extra halfmuch of teds appeal comes from macfarlane who provides the voice with a heavy boston accent he makes into a wildhaired party animal at one point he has sex with his coworker in the backroom of a grocery store then later admits that he has written dozens of letters to hasbro complaining that he never received genitals yet even though he is foulmouthed and does unscrupulous things we like him hes a shade below obnoxious macfarlane doesnt make the mistake of trying to make into a fantasy character but makes him seem like just a normal guy who happens to be a teddy bear it was a masterstroke to establish that was once a celebrity so that everyones reaction to him is completely naturalis the movie funny you bet it is also dirty raunchy foul mouthed and definitely not for kids the movie is pitched at a level of lowbrow humor but macfarlane knows how to keep the comic momentum going if youve seen his television shows then you know kind of what youre in for in lesser hands this could have been a dim onejoke idea but macfarlane is smarter than that he hits his first theatrical effort out of the ball park with a movie that is entertaining touching and very funny,comedy
my admiration for begins with the narration of a young boy wishing his christmas gift teddy bear would become alive his real best friend and the ramifications of that wish coming true a stentorian patrick stewart narrates as john bennet meets his best friend forever and thunder buddy johns parents freak out rather wonderfully in the kitchen at the sight of a walking and talking stuffed animal and the opening pretitle sequence culminates in becoming a celebrity and appearing forrest gumplike on johnny carsons show before as stewart tells us pretty much everyone got used to him and stopped making it such a big deal roll titles with hilarious photographs in place of plot a 35year old rental car employee john bennet mark wahlberg and his pr executive girlfriend lori collins mila kunis begin the film struggling to find balance within their lives while living with drinks smokes up hires prostitutes and pretty much serves as mouthpiece for anything graphically sexual virulently racist or homophobic and a his mouth spews a fountain of eighties and nineties references his influence over john leads to conflict as john misses work is late for work still shares a bed and hilarious chanting ritual whenever thunder sounds as voiced by macfarlane himself what lacks in facial expression he more than compensates for in verbal acuity and acidity most of the joy of the first portion of this film consists of the incongruity of the visual of a kids teddy bear spouting racist homophobic and sexist comments in a matteroffact manner very little is taboo and part of the fun is trying to guess what is going to say next so in order to appease lori moves out gets a job at a local grocery store where his inappropriate behavior keeps getting rewarded and struggles living without john they both stay in touch with calling john to come over to his place to get hight instead of working his job with a doubledate that goes awry featuring teds new girlfriend as well as an eventual chaotic party at teds new pad said party forces john to choose between a work relashindig with loris predatory and slimy boss rex joel mchale or teds wild bash featuring an icon from both of their childhoods the party sequence seems to be the centerpiece of the film with eviscerating hootie and the blowfish as well as most of 90s pop rock with supporting fights cocaine and hilarious oneliners johns choice to attend the party and the consequences of that act drive the rest of the film as does a bizarre subplot involving a deranged stalker named donny a creepily effective giovanni ribisi who wants to buy for his deranged son wahlberg is winning in this film a highlight being his offering a litany of whitetrash names for teds girlfriend that brought the house down wahlberg rattles off over 25 names in one take before adding the second layer to the joke and repeating although i think wahlbergs best role ever is that other boston film the deparhis performance is great here as he does not get swallowed up by a visual effect macfarlanes fires up shot after shot many of them layups but there are occasional threepointers of hilarity and the consistent effort pays off with most shots going in ed mcmahon thought was alf a teddy ruxpin crack results in a three minute killbill style thrashing of an apartment with punching john in the face repeatedly a 911 reference still catches the breath for its audacity or rarity ribisi brings the right level of creep to his role and both lori and johns work friends seem poised for more minutes of screen time but never get it the film races to its inevitable conclusion with a norah jones concert as well as a chase scene ending up on the tower above the green monster at fenway shouldnt that park be better guarded than it is considering its role in this film and the town a final joke at the end goes over extremely well and is offensive when john recalls a memory of first meeting lori and the film flashes back to him as the whiteuniformed lead from airplane in the dance spoof scene of saturday night fever the moment works on level after hilarious level i enjoyed laughing at the reference within a reference but i realize that not everyone particularly those younger than me will get that reference and it is funny even without understanding the reference of mark wahlberg as striker as tony manero i like being able to get most of the references though ill admit to being lost with the flash gordon worshipand therein lie the strengths of this film a willingness to throw joke after joke up with many of them sticking an affinity for transgressive humor though not as bodilyfocused as a farrelly brothers film a skillful glee in referencing 80s and 90s culture at one point grabs his torn arm from behind a doorway ala indiana jones with just a line of john williams score an assembly of really good actors who look like theyre having fun an offthewall anarchic sense of play and that nearly anything goes a fully realized commitment to having be a character not a visual effect impressively focuses on the characters statements more than his actions three stars is a strong rating i had fun watching this movie and i would watch it again i think some of the surprise and shock will dissipate and some of the weaknesses of the story might become more glaring but there were enough shining moments for me to recommend this film and the few cameos another staple of the comedy are handled well,comedy
to be honest when i first saw the trailer for this movie i thought that it would be a childish kind of thing mostly because of the thunder scene but i will tell you that this movie is far from childish there is only one or two nude scenes but there is an extreme drug use and even more extreme profanity this definitely is a movie primarily for adults with that said i will tell you that this movie is pretty much funny because the main character is a teddy bear which most people think is hilarious because it is extremely out of the ordinary to see something so childish acting so absurd but if you were to make a real person the plot would be just a same old romantic comedy thing but putting in the factor that one of the main characters is a teddy bear changes the whole thing overall i would recommend anyone who is mature enough to see this,comedy
star rating  saturday night  friday night  friday morning  sunday night  monday morningas a young boy with no friends john mark whalberg wished his teddy bear would come to life and was overjoyed when he did however as hes grown up the bear has stayed alive and grown up with him turning in to a drug smoking foul mouthed lecherous creation who still serves as his best buddy however johns girlfriend lori mila kunis thinks its time he moved out forcing john to make a tough decision meanwhile the creepy donny giovanni ribisi and his even creepier son lurk in the background harboring a disturbing obsession with tednothing inspires comedy like absurdity and the wackiest most far out ideas are usually the ones that take longer to get your head around but usually produce the best results simply because of how well insane and far fetched they are so in many ways seth macfarlene whose hugely successful family guy is just something i never got in to a la futurama had a certified cat in the bag when he hit on the idea of which opens with a whimsical childhood fantasy coming true plot line in the vein of the 80s tom hanks vehicle big but which opens out in to a far more adult orienrisqu comedy vehicle that seems hell bent on pushing boundaries of taste and decency as far as they can goin the lead role whalbergs a generally intense actor better suito more dramatic tough roles but thats not to say comedy is out of his ability and hes perfectly convincing as a thirty plus slacker whos grown older and irresponsible with his er friend mafarlene serves as voice duties on the titular not so cuddly bear and gets to further inject his already filthy story with his own cutting style meanwhile ribisi is a genuinely creepy villain who could actually have made this role work in a less light hearfilmsharp cynical leaving no stone of taste or decency unturned and leaving no popular culture reference unlampooned is one of the more ridiculous unbelievable ideas for a film in recent times but one which has obviously produced the expecresults ive taken my time getting to review it but at least i know im in the agreeing team with it ,comedy
we all knew seth macfarlane would make the transition to features at some point whether or not you were exciat the prospect depends entirely on how much a fan you are of his small screen primetime cartoons ive been a fan of family guy since the beginning even if my interest has waned in later seasons as the show has fallen into routine without the continual strength of the earlier episodes and im a casual fan of the cleveland show and american dad so macfarlanes first feature film was guaranteed to sell me a movie ticket regardless of what it was though to be honest im glad he didnt just cash in on an easy family guy film macfarlanes style of comedy shines through in so people who arent a fan of his shows might not be impressed with his first film cutaway gags pop culture references and raunchy jokes made funnier with the fact that theyre being spewed from a stuffed bear speaking as a macfarlane fan and therefore biased i suppose i really loved its an ageold tale of a young boys love for his best friend a teddy bear he receives for christmas a christmas wish brings little to life and twenty years later john bennett and are still best buds but playtime and childhood has been replaced with weed and flash gordon and the friendship between these two slackers risks destroying johns relationship with his girlfriend lori unless he can learn to grow upas a fan i actually thought macfarlanes style transitioned nicely to a feature film the cut away gags are kept to a minimum and are used effectively the pop culture references are everywhere in just about every joke with a special focus on the 1980 movie version of flash gordon starring sam jones macfarlane must have a soft spot for the movie because it gets a lot of attention with jones even popping in for a hilarious cameo in the middle of the movie every time ive seen queens flash gordon theme is stuck in my head for the next two days maintaining the macfarlane vibe are a bunch of his tv buddies filling out some of the movies supporting roles alex borstien ralph garman patrick warburton ryan reynolds and of course patrick stewart as the voice of the narrator its a family guy fans perfect movie mila kunis another family guy star is johns girlfriend lori kunis is a guilty pleasure of mine shes never really proved to be a particularly strong actress or gotten the chance to experiment with much range with the exception of black swan i suppose but shes has a habit popping up in some of my favorite comedies shes got a great chemistry with mark wahlberg and their relationship feels sincere wahlbergs the best here the man can do comedy he surprised me with his comedy chops opposite will ferrell in the other guys in 2010 and solidifies the mans talent for making me laugh i was never really interesin wahlbergs work until the last few years when he took a turn towards the funnyas good as wahlberg and kunis are the obvious scenestealer here is going to be the walking talking teddy bear the cg work in the movie is absolutely seamless and i never found myself doubting teds existence in the context of the movie macfarlane voices the bear himself and despite a boston accent that cuts a little to close to peter griffin a fact that the movie acknowledges funnily enough hes a hilarious new creation that stands above a lot of macfarlanes television work no matter how many funny characters cross the screen in the spotlight is always on the bear and for good reason i would love to see the character get a tv show of his own but itd have to be on cable network tv wouldnt broadcast half the material coming out of teds mouth is one of the funniest movies of 2012 coming in just below 21 jump street for funniest of the year in my opinion my only complaint on would be that the story is weakly structured the first two thirds of the movie focus on john and loris relationship and the final act shifts gears into the realm of action with a chase sequence and kidnapping foreshadowed briefly in the beginning of the movie if the movie hadnt lost focus and stuck to its course it wouldve been even betteri imagine this will be a pretty divisive movie people who arent a fan of macfarlanes sense of humor probably wont be swayed by the movie but people like mepeople who continue to enjoy his tv shows even at their weakest im looking a you cleveland showwill laugh our heads off,comedy
this movie was sofa king classic  i ordered it on payperview last night after hearing how hilarious it was for almost a year now it seems  seen plenty of memes on the internet the best being sitting on a chair in front of kilos of cocaine with a caption that read  tony montana had a poster of me in his dorm room i love the innocent short pg intro  before the opening credits come up  then its like 27 years later  i laughed my ass off  i am thinking about suing seth macfarlane for hurting my ribs  due to excessive  hard laughter  the bear movements  lips moving with his words  voice looked authentic  real  i cant wait for the sequel,comedy
i was one off the few that thought looked awful and too be honest the trailer still makes it look that way that whole thunder buddies thing and trying too guess some girls name they were like the poorest parts off the movie dont know why they choose too have those moments in the adverts because the flick is way better than themthis is the first movie from seth macfarlane creator off family guy and it really shows now family guy is a funny show but it does get carried away with movie references and attempting too shock us with its crude humour sometimes teds also trying too do this though is succeeds family guy tends too cheat a bit by cutting off to some unrelascene just too squeeze in another joke while has more off a story and can be way ruder than the tv show with most off the laughs coming from oneliners or just from the banter between its characters plus it doesnt have too stop everything too insert a joke the gags flow throughout the thing which improves it in my eyesmost off the film is very funny but whats surprising is that is also has some heart the stuffed bear thats in the movie maybe swears a bit too much hoping itll get a laugh but theres no denying that by the end off youll care about him,comedy
this is the first time ive done a revue of a film on imdb but after watching  i felt a sudden urge to praise such a charming endearing and bark like a dog funny movie there are indeed so many times you can hear the phrase i fcked her with a parsnip without wearing a crash helmet and walk out of the cinema with anything less than a mild concussion one cant be blamed for expecting something family guyesque when the credit list reads off such names as seth mcfarland mila kunis patrick stewartit goes on and on i see no problem there its similar very much so but good god its great them at their best the bad language the drug taking the sex the jokes and popular culture references moreover you have a simple yet sweet story of growing up and moving on something that everyone can relate to is the story particularly profound or well told no but thats not the point and if you think it is then  go read the top 250 films list one more time and lecture someone else on how you saw memento and guessed the ending  you didntnobody did trust me in a 106 minute film i laughed countless times i honestly cant remember the last film that was trying to be funny that did that to me,comedy
first off i must stress if you dont like family guy you are definitely not going to enjoy this movie if you do then you will find it be quite funny throughout most of the joke material involves as the primary source of the comedy however mark whalberg and mila kunis both hold their own against macfarlanes well known style of humour i personally found this outing for whalberg was better than in the other guys and a solid portion of the films humour was as a direct result of his performance aside from looking stunningly attractive as usual mila kunis did well in her role and while she wasnt a major part of most of the jokes she portrayed her character well and did well as the primary source on conflict in the movie,comedy
seth mcfarlene is a genius sure some of his jokes on family guy miss the mark but most of them are brilliant so when i heard he was directing it just sounded right when youre watching the film you truly get the essence of the show right from the opening scene and thank goodness it uses the good jokeswhat drew me into the movie the most besides its premise was its lead actor mark wahlberg what i admire about wahlberg is that he does things that are out of his comfort zone like 2010s the other guys here he honestly gives one of his best performances as a 35 year old man child named john and even though he seems out of his comfort zone something feels right about itthe movie revolves around a john and his talking teddy bear named tedvoiced by mcfarlene himself john was a lonely kid and wished that his teddy bear was real and so overnight he became just that but years go by and now john and are grown up sitting around their apartment getting baked watching flash gordon and making johns pretty girlfriend lorithe wonderful mila kunis a little mad so she gives john an ultimatum and the movie goes on from there but i cant give too much awayis absolutely bonkers its a wild ridiculous occasionally obnoxious strangely clever and sometimes hilarious movie filled with surprisingly decent performances from all of its actors this is one the best movies of the year so far and it feels bizarre to say that but it is so true it felt like the laughs didnt stop even if some of them were better than others see ita,comedy
any great movie is a movie which has a little something else hidden under the surface seth macfarlanes family guy is a comedy which has just that extra bit more and he translates this across to with relative easefirst its extremely saddening to see so many negative reviews commenting on the profanity in this movie yes there is a great deal of it in but as a university student i can assure these people that the swearing is not what we are supposed to be laughing is a movie which offers a parody of conventional romcomsbromance films it is very sad if someone cannot laugh at a witty comment simply because they stop listening if they hear a swear word granthe swearing in this film is a little gratuitous at times but this is simply not a reason for writing off it as a film mocks the very popular culture which these negative reviewers despise so much but it does so in such a manner that is itself a parodythe plot isnt the most intricately construcplot ever but if you want to see that kind of film go and see another film borders on the risqu whilst shying away from being too offensive and is a brilliant film to go and see if youre in the mood for something that doesnt take itself serious in the slightest even the premise that of a beloved childhood toy becoming the opposite of its general perception gives away the sheer lunacy of what is ultimately a very entertaining film backed further by strong performances from wahlberg kunis and macfarlane himselfif you cant handle a bit of profanity please dont waste your time seeing this movie because there really is no point  itll go straight over your head otherwise sit back relax and let this movie take you on a memorable and entertaining ride through the inversion of every lonely childs biggest fantasy,comedy
when he is 8 john is given a teddy bear for christmas he wishes for it to come to life so that they could be friends forever and his wish comes true skip forward 27 years and after a brief brush with celebrity is now a dopesmoking foulmouthed slacker and still living with john constantly lures him into this aimless unfocused lifestyle  after all they are best buddies for ever right lori johns girlfriend of four years has other ideas howeverthis films one original idea is that one of the central trio of characters is a teddy bear and to see a teddy bear effing and blinding and smoking a bong is funny strip away that element and cast say seth rogen and you have a fairly routine romcom where a longsuffering girl is trying to extract her boyfriend from the clutches of his bad influence best friendhowever the joke is quite a good one and sustains a moderate amount of the length of the film voiced by seth macfarlane who also wrote direcand performed temotion capture for all his slackerhood remains a fairly endearing character as do mark wahlberg as the adult john and mila kunis as lori there is sufficient going on to keep the interest going  silly subplots featuring sam jones flash gordon movie and giovanni ribisi as an unhinged father and wouldbe toy kidnapper augment the central plotthe realisation of is superbi could have done without quite so much drug use and a bit less bad language conversely i loved the fight between john and  vicious in the way that fights between people who love each other very much yet who are hurting each other a great deal can be but also very funny and i also loved patrick stewarts fairy story narration bookends absolutely faithful to how such narration is delivered yet knowingly wickedly hilariously subversive,comedy
now i dont watch family guy i never have and probably never will its just not my kind of show so going into i had no clue how funny seth mcfarlane was i think i laughed 34 of the movie the other either lame jokes that just werent funny yeah im talking bout the katy perry one watch it or it was sad but that was only at the end mila kunis was her funny adorable self and mark wahlbergphew he is sexy with a capital s sorry i got off track besides the looks he was very good in the movie they couldnt have used anybody betterwas an absolute party swearing sex drugs more swearing more sex and more drugs although i must say if youre easily offended you shouldnt go this movie is knocking on raunchys door,comedy
i found this film incredibly hilarious all the way through and it was constantly joke after jokei do watch family guy and if you are thinking about watching then remember it is the writer of family guy who has written this therefore that kind of humour will be implemeninto this filmsome may be offended by the jokes in this however im someone who is not easily offended and enjoyed every single moment of this filmi think giving this film a 1 star rating as many people have is harsh and unfair especially considering it is dealing with a type of humour some may not understand my brother watched it and did not think much of it although i absolutely loved it its all about opinion and if it isnt your kind of humour give it a miss,comedy
is a very funny movie some of the humor i didnt care for but over all i had a good many laughs watching this filmthe humor springs forth from an imagination that can grasp whats not funny and what is and this movie is very funny however i thought the spanking should have involved another cast member in another scene it would have worked better but the film would be x ratedyou know there is more going on here than just a funny talking teddy bear movie rightno so what just sit back and enjoy the laughsthe writerdirector has a lot going for him and so does his cast of talenactorsplease read into this movie a little a guy and his talking teddy bear really what is this brilliant comedy writer getting at should we read anything into thisi had a teddy bear when i was a kid and it used to mysteriously get ripped during the night and people starlooking at me kinda funny like ya know all those cab trips to that nice hospital to talk to that nice man because someone tore the made in china tag off before my mom bought it merry christmas indeedoh welldont you think probation is a little laxgive up the teddy bear buddy or elseno probation for you,comedy

comes from the mind of seth macfarlane the genius behind family guy one of the few american shows to legitimately rival the simpsons its irreverent iconoclastic and inspired i laughed all the way throughbeing the school loner and an only child john forms an unbreakable bond with his christmas bear one night john rhetorically wishes that could actually speak at that moment as luck would have it a shooting star passes overhead and comes to life they grow up but never apart which threatens johns fouryear relationship with his girlfriend lori minxy mila kunishas a deliberately familiar plot and structure but its not these macfarlane wants us to focus on the bear steals the show because he is the show hes a naughty little bear who swears every other word smokes strong pot and sleeps with hookers hes what peter griffin would be like if trey parker and matt stone creahim as well as voice macfarlane also plays him with the aid of motioncapture technology taking a break from his action man persona mark wahlberg is aptly cast as the adult john playing a 35yearold is a touch improbable though his scenes with kunis are nonetheless credible scatological humour is usually a sign of desperation but macfarlane is as inventive with his butt jokes as he is with the rest he also reinvents clichd jokes superbly well which means they take you by surprise remarkably impresses on a dramatic level too is basically a nice guy however the celebrity life he leads is a lonely one so he hangs on to john his thunder buddy never lets up its gag after gag each one coming closer to making you gag than the last how does this film have room for such unlikely personages as patrick stewart flash gordon and norah jones youll have to watch it to find out wwwmoseleyb13com,comedy
is one of the funniest movies i have seen all year by far one of the best comedies 21 jump street and and one of the most creative aspects i have seen in nearly two whole yearscast seth macfarlane voices teddyperfectly mila kunis as lori is magnificent and mark whalberg as john was perfect alsoscript all the script was great but mila kunis lori character didnt have a strong script so that was a let downplot plot was hilarious and highly interesting the plot was the best thing about the movie because i thought there wasnt going to be one but it was hidden in the shadowsdirection seth macfarlane directs perfectly and thank god for that because i thought it would have been all over the placeoverall is a delight and extremely funny do yourself a favour,comedy
for a long time family guys quality has been going downwards more and more at the same time seth macfarlane was making his first feature film and his first foray in liveaction and it was clear what his macfarlane was putting his efforts intoin 1985 an 8yearold boy john bennett bretton manley is a lonely boy with no friends who gets a teddy bear for christmas john wishes for the bear to come alive and guess what he does quickly fame rises and falls and by 2012 he is a stoner loser living with john now mark walhberg and his girlfriend of four years lori mila kunis but when john has to choose between the two and the habit is very hard to crackis simply a very funny film with various type of comedy from excellent lines risky humour we know from family guy slapstick and fights and some gross outcrude jokes there are only three cutaway gags in the whole film one of them being a flashback and the other two are at least linked to the leading scene so people do not like that style of humour do not worry whilst there is a bit of swearing unlike other rrafilms the swearing is not the only use of humouras a story is similar to shaun of the dead that john has to pick his long time girlfriend that he lets down or his loyal childhood friend that is bad for him it is a choose between friendship or romance who should you be loyal to and a character trying to balance his life with two people he loves but do not get on the other simon peggnick frost that is similar to is paul because a cgi mocap character has very adult tendencies he is a character he enjoys recreational drugs women prostitutes and a crass sense of humour there are worst things to do then be similar to two peggfrost films walhberg has shown in recent years he has real comic talent and with macfarlane has great relationship together they both have get comic timing with their lines and the physical comedy kunis played the straight man role in but she has her moments and is solid with the duo macfarlane also get some of his family guy alumna in some small roles and was able to provide some fun celebrity cameos the party sequence was hilarious and was much more fun and on the same level of realism as the offensive project xmacfarlane and his writers were able tie together the romcombromance storyline with two major subplots very well and unlike what family guy can be is more focused on the story front occasionally it felt like the film did drag but for the most part it is very is what you get when macfarlane actually puts effort into his work and when he focuses on a story macfarlane can be a very good writer when he gets the balances of being risky without being offensive just for the hell of iton a final note it is good to see a jokes in a trailer actually being used in the film they are promoting,comedy
i thought that was a brilliant film because of all the publicity i did worry that people would expect too much and therefore it would not be as funny however i was pleasantly surprised it is typical seth macfarlane with hilarious gags that just toe the line there are some references to family guy for his fans but he doesnt overdo it allowing people that are not familiar with his work to enjoy what he brings to the movie of course many of the actors have worked with macfarlane before but the clever thing is that quite a lot of people even family guy and american dad fans would not recognize them because macfarlane is famous for cartoons therefore the actors are given a chance to shine on screen instead of being an animacharacter however i do think some of the gags may have gone too far particularly 911 it was fine once but i do think twice is a bit too much as it is an american film and people are still a bit sensitive about the subject i will be interesin the overall reaction of it i may be completely wrong as macfarlane has a reputation of taking taboo subjects and taking the mick mark wahlburg and mila kunis acting is superb and really makes the story of believable to the audience of course a seth macfarlane film would not be complete without him in someway or another and it seemed appropriate that he did the voice of his outstanding voice talent is well known and complethe film overall i think is a fantastic summer movie it will make you laugh until you cant breath gasp with shock at this perverteddy bear and there is a heart to the story sad parts that are really touching to watch another side of macfarlane that has yet to be explored proves that macfarlane must have more tricks up his sleeve i really hope he continues making feature length movies as he has proved he can be a success in that field but still remains faithful to the cartoons that gave him his big break,comedy
i saw this film earlier today with my friends and i thought it was absolutely hilarious maybe its because i love family guy so much but i found it thoroughly enjoyingmoreover it wasnt just me that found this funny the cinema was packed with people who were laughing out loud and it even got to the point when you couldnt hear the next line in the film which even though sometimes could be annoying really was a credit to seth mcfarlanes first feature length film i believe the storyline was good enough for a comedy film like this i mean it is about a 35 year old man who is still emotionally attached to his teddy bear so you know its not exactly going to be shawshank redemption however throughout the entire film the comic timing was perfect overall i would definitely recommend you watch this film and for all family guy fans its a must see,comedy
so i finally watched this movie with my movie theatreworking friend today i knew from the previews that the title character was a walking talking potsmoking sexually active stuffed teddy bear whos been best friends with mark wahlberg for about much of his life what i didnt know was the references to various 80s icons like that scene from airplane that spoofed saturday night fever that was reenachere or that sam jones from flash gordon mark and teds favorite movie and its one i liked enough to see twice back in the day would appear as himself here partially acting like his character but possibly knowing hes not really that character i found much of the raunchy stuff involving voiced by directorcowriter seth macfarlane funny and when things threaten to take a dark and sad turn i was a little touched too i got most of the references though i didnt find it all funny still i was entertained enough to find the whole thing quite enjoyable so on that note gets a recommendation from me oh and that scene when norah jones communicates with was also good for some laughs,comedy
im not giving away anything this movie is hilarious from minute 1 to the end you wont stop laughing see it if you dont laugh at this movie then comment or whatever on this sight i know a surgeon we can implant a funny bone or surgically remove the great big stick out of you abtw to all those who say its family guy its not i makes references and the style is somewhat similar but it is quite original and i never knew teddy bears or flash gorden can be that hilarious so bullet points funnysee it if no humor comes then surgeonwe can implant a funny bone or get that stick out of your aholesee it its hilarious,comedy
im an old guy but i also can take a joke my son encouraged me to join him for this movie i found it quite engaging there are films that are deliberately crude hitting the lowest common denominator others have deep charm sort of the et complex this film manages to take that charm which we occasionally fall for and put a bullet in its head it is full of great lines listen for the beginning apache helicopter bit and sight gags some dont work but most do and what we haves one strange film family guy knows no boundaries and so its not surprising that the film is the same is a mess he is the victim of the fate of the child actor although he is a rather nondescript teddy bear mark walberg is just vacuous enough to pull this off it may be his best role because he has to show a balance of kindness and utter stupidity when it comes to his old friend they are comrades in arms and when romance comes in the bear is going to take first place this is wonderfully creative and engaging should get a couple of golden globe nominations i mean the bear not the movie,comedy
im not sure what i was expecting walking into i found the restrictrailer to be funny and creative and i do enjoy family guy every now and than but something in the back of my mind just kept saying eh are you really sure you wanna see this well i should have followed my instincts because despite some inspired moments is just that eh it was okay the film centers on a friendless young boy who makes a wish for his teddy bear to come to life and well it does 27 yrs later the young boy has grown into mark wahlberg and has a girlfriend and well has grown as well into a pot smoking foul mouthed crude best friend that hardly ever leaves it side the whole fairy tale thing taken to a realistic place is inspired and could have been very funny instead dont be fooled this is one of those films where the main character is a big child and has to grow up before his girlfriend leaves him ugh not again surprisingly enough its in its dramatic scenes when the film is most effective sure there are a few inspired comedy bits the hotel fight was great but most of the jokes fall completely flat like the whole flash gordon reference a prostitute who defecates on the living room floors and having sex with a turnip and the checkout girl in fact although im not easily offended i couldnt help but be by some of the irresponsible humor in this film the whole gay underground beat up subplot was insulting and unhelpful to the struggling gay community and some of the jokes just go to far like this whole father and son creep acting just comes off disturbing that being said i have to give credit where its due and mark wahlberg is a hell of an actor he completely commits himself to whatever role hes playing mila kunis is likable and beautiful as his love interest and the cgi is quite impressive never once did i feel like it wasnt real when watching the film even though i was continuously rolling my eyes so all in all is just another crude forgettable comedy with a creative spin on its premise yes but the same old man child movie weve been watching for years also i hate that they insulsuperman returns i loved that film and unlike this one that was critically acclaimed,comedy
tedso i saw this movie last week and i enjoyed it i was pretty excithat seth macfarlene was behind this project so that was one reason for me to enjoy it soooo a 35 year old man faces a dilemma he must between his girlfriend or his teddy bear that he loved since his childhoodthe pluses the main pair mark wahlberg and mila kunis seth macfarlence the sequence at the party the endingthe minuses not appropriate for kids under 18 the humor is the same style as family guyoverall is a good movie it was not super hilarious but it was just regular hilarious this is not suitable for kids under 18,comedy
is the first ever motion picture to be direcby seth macfarlane more wellknown as the creator of the highlysuccessful and incredibly hilarious animatv series family guy as a fan of the show myself i was anticipating for this movie the minute i first saw the trailer you know what the wait was really worth it starts off with the story of when mark wahlberg was a little child wished that his teddy bear can talk and become his best friend his wish actually comes true and it becomes a worldwide popular story across the world now 27 years later and wahlberg have still havent left each other and still have been buddies ever since wahlberg has also been dating mila kunis for over 4 years and now wants to take the next level in their relationship now kunis asks for to move out so now and wahlberg now head off on crazy shenanigans which will affect their lives in the process now we have our movie and its flatout hilarious similar to family guy knew how to really beat the odds this movie is dirty raunchy and offensive all wrapped into one movie awesome is probably one of the funniest movies ive so far seen this year this movie is filled with plenty of popculture references movie references tv references references of flash gordon and plenty of famous celebrity cameos from giovanni ribisi joel mchale patrick warburton tom skerrit and the narration of patrick stewart thats all of what seth macfarlane has been known for i was laughing outloud from beginning to end even the moment at the end credits was hilarious most of the references got me on my seat because most of them i have been familiar to recently i will definitely go again for a repeat watch mark wahlberg had really great chemistry with either or mila kunis and the performances feel memorable and the audience grows to like these characters the writing is witty the jokes are raunchy and overall this movie just flatout impressed me this movie knew what it wanto be and it went on a very fresh and clever road is probably the funniest film ive seen so far this year and i hope seth macfarlane makes more movie projects in the future while still making me laugh on family guy in my review immensely entertaining and downright hilarious,comedy
adamthis was the funniest film i have seen this year while might not be everyones brand of humor it was nice to see a film not attempt to pander to such a broad audience that became another milquetoast comedy refreshing to see a film be bold and swing for the fences as far as raunchy comedy goesscotty  good but not great funny but not as funny as you may be led to believe certainly had several laugh out loud segments and some great dialogue but i felt like it was a bit slow at times there was certainly some memorable dialogue and the film will be referenced in normal conversation but i did not think it was in the same ilk as the hangover something about mary or even dumb and dumbergriff  much like 21 jump street from earlier this year is funnier than it has any right to be i was pleasantly surprised by how funny this movie was there were a few scenes in this movie that had me laughing out loud this is raunchy humor for sure picture the family guy if it was rar and you have an idea of what you are in forto check out our full review head over to 3guys1moviecom,comedy
maybe its just because i like family guy but i found to be this years funniest film and one of the best comedys over the past couple of yearsthe plot for is nothing original when in the cinema i felt like i had seen it before and the ending was no real surprise however its teds chemistry with the other characters as well as the consistent laughs that make this film worth whileboth mark wahlberg and mila kunis are fantastic in their respective roles especially wahlberg his interaction with the cgi is fantastic you completely believe teds existencethe laughs however were what made this film so great it seems with comedy these days their humor is either inconsistent and unoriginal teds humor has definitively be seen in macfarlanes family guy but in a major film like this it comes off as fresh sadly many of the laughs could have been better if i hadnt already seen them in the trailer however dont get me wrong theres plenty more in the film it also should be mentioned that for those uncertain about seeing this film that its humor doesnt appeal to everyone perhaps watch an episode of family guy on fox and see if you like it before buying a ticket for this filmmanages to be both funny and charming becoming a real crowed pleaser,comedy
from the creator of family guy comes one of the crudest comedies of the year but not necessarily the funniest when bullied kid john bennett wishes his teddy bear would come to life it does and subsequently becomes a celebrity in the process three decades on voiced by seth macfarlane himself is a potsmoking foulmouthed washup who keeps the now 35 year old john a very game mark whalberg from growing up much to the chagrin of extremely patient girlfriend lori mila kunis the jokes come thick and fast and when they score they really score however there are a few clunkers present too for every sidesplitting sexual innuendo gag at the local supermarket a cantbelievethatjusthappened knockout of a kid or a hilarious ryan reynolds cameo there is an unfunny thunder song a lame fight with an asian man or a misguided fart joke right around the corner having said that a magical teddy swearing like a trooper is essentially always comedy gold and macfarlane rides the wave as much as possible  even if his very recognisable voice is a slight distraction as one drunken injoke slyly acknowledges  delivering a crowdpleaser that will surely strike big at the box office,comedy
why so many bad reviews i saw this the other week with my mates and we were laughing all the way throughfair enough some of the girls may be offended by some of the content but its in the same vain as family man etc its banta between the two characters mark wahlberg was top notch great actor and not usually his type of role he was really out of his comfort zone here was also good but mark for me stole the showlets make a hollywood wish really really great idea what kid wouldnt want a talking teddygreat concept easy watching and fun get some popcorn and watch it,comedy
if i had to sum this movie up in 2 words it would be loved ithonestly as everyone could probably already guess this is a family guy movie pretty much over half of the cast had some relationship with family guy and the humor is very similar so if you like family guy humorwhich i do you will like this movie if not then you most likely wont simple as that i liked the characters and the development between them as well i love that feeling you get when you know a movie just does it right gets you to feel for the characters whether it be laughter or sadness yes the movie was predictable but sometimes that just doesnt matter i recommend this movie to anyone who has an open sense of humor and can laugh at distasteful things p,comedy
come on now lets be honest how many of you out there have a soft toy companion that once upon a time youd wish it could talk back and interact that robotic teddy ruxpin one doesnt count if it came true chances are youd have brought to life by that little bit of magic you know can never happen in real life but in reel life given to an unpopular boy by his parents as a gift for christmas he makes a wish that his new teddy bear can become more than just a plush toy and so with a little pinnochio styled miracle the toy becomes voiced by seth macfarlane who also wrote and directhis feature film marking his live action debut after his work on his creation and popular stint on the family guycue opening credits and we see how the boy john bennett now all grown up to embody the physique of mark wahlberg become the best of buddies with his teddy bear which had once upon a time become an instant celebrity and now all forgotten with all things that have come to past we see that the thunder buddies  coined because both have a fear of thunder and would huddle together singing their thunder song  have grown up and even had his voice broken and like any child its nurture that will bring out some personality and in teds case both he and john have each other to thank for being somewhat of a bummer smoking weed and rewatching their favourite flash gordon film from their couchthis of course draws the irk of johns girlfriend lori mila kunis a corporate high flier who decided to draw some ultimatum for the boy to choose  his best buddy or her this is that story since its somewhat of a perennial problem in any relationship when a girl decides that being long suffering isnt enough especially when she has to get constantly ribbed by friends and colleagues who question her choice in companions and worst having the boss hit on her at every opportunity just because nobody would believe that she would eventually decide to marry down its four years and counting for this twos a company threes a crowd and things are going ugly and down to the wirethe best buddy would of course move away and the narrative deals with adjustment how we each have to peel away from the things that we like and the people we love just because we had to make a choice for something taking higher priority we all have the same number of hours and its up to us to determine how those hours get spent in john and teds case if given a choice smoking weed and lazing around would just about be heaven on earth if not for loris objection that had the back of the camel broken when brought home four hookers one special night and add to that the threat of a creepy stalker giovanni ribisi who so desires that he wants him all for himself and his sonseth macfarlane has a winner here in creating something outside of his family guy series i couldnt have enough of the trashstraight tailing bear full of wit and life that just endears himself and makes you wish you have him as your own as that faithful companion who can hang out with and is constantly on the same wavelength brought to life by the use of cg is seamlessly delivered and better yet is able to get into a big fight should the scene calls for it mark wahlberg didnt have too much to do playing the man child with that blank expression that the story required for the most parts being oblivious to the needs of his girlfriend and almost always jumping into opportunities to hang out with his best buddy nevermind the consequences the need to pull up ones socks in life and to have a sense of responsibility is john bennetts story arc wahlbergs scene stealer though is the rattling off of thrash female names done without any visual cues or aid and completely from memory which is as funny as it is jaw dropping amazingits a true geeks film and macfarlanes geekdom comes in full swing with the appearance of flash gordon aka sam jones in full garb no less convincing the actor that he still had what it took and to have the guts to don that cheesy costume to become a huge parody of himself and that iconic character who had shot him to fame look out for other recognizable cameos with patrick stewart lending his baritone voice by being the narrator and a surprise appearance by an actor whose actions in this film also helped contribute to that m18 rating the censors here had to slap on this filmmakes you root for him throughout the entire film and i sure as hell wouldnt mind someone to verbal spar with or have a good time hanging out with definitely recommended and one of the more consistent comedies from start to finish thats been screened this year,comedy
i thought id watch as id seen all the superhero movie blockbusters already this summer and i must say i was very impressed it staroff funny but not as funny as i thought but that quickly changed and i enjoyed it you will laugh at scenes and be sad at some seth macfarlane does what he always does and entertains us whether its family guy or american dad or now he makes amazing characters who we can fall in love with and makes amazing voices for them so if you want to see a funny film that you will enjoy definitely go to see and im sure you will enjoy it if not then i dont know what to say,comedy
i saw this movie in the thetre last night and i just loved it from the creator of family guy and american dad i was very exciand he did not disappointthis movie is about a little boy named john john doesnt have any friends and one day on christmas after receiving and little stuffed bear for a gift he makes a wish to make that bear real the movie carries on through johns adulthood as he tries to juggle between his best friend the bear or who girlfriendthis movie was really good and very funny seth macfarlene is so funny with everything he does and this movie is no exception the cast is great with wahlberg and macfarlene doing the voice of the bear the acting in the beginning segment is just atrocious but i feel that was intentionaloverall go see this movie it is very funny go see it in thetres before you miss out people one of the best comedies ever for sure,comedy
greetings again from the darkness upon watching the trailer it would be easy and understandable to simply write off this movie as a ridiculous piece of junk produced merely to capitalize on the popularity of seth macfarlane family guy creator that would be a mistake while much of what has to say will burn your ears the insight that goes into his lines is often unmistakeably brilliantthe movie opens with terrific narration from patrick stewart its done in a christmas story style only with a caustic and deadpan irreverence that will jolt you before the opening credits have even rolled we learn the story of 9 year old john bennett a social outcast who receives a teddy bear for christmas first what parent buys their 9 year old a teddy bear anyway that night under the covers young john wishes that he and could be lifelong friends in the morning he awakes to find a sweet lively teddy who startles everyonethe talking bear becomes an instant celebrity and is even booked on the johnny carson show  the first of many 1980s pop culture references as in the case of corey feldman poinout by the narrator celebrity often fades flash forward 25 years and john and are living together with johns girlfriend mila kunis the boys spend most of their time smoking pot and watching tv reruns and worshiping the 1980 flash gordon cult movie its a typical manchild existence except that one of them is a vile 4 letterword spewing teddy bear and there is no logical reason that the beautiful kunis hasnt walked away from the four year relationship with the hapless loser johnmr macfarlanes true talent lies in laughing at our societal norms and encouraging us to laugh at ourselves he does this through stewie the pet dog on family guy and now here with a talking teddy bear he holds little back in ripping our obsession with celebrity or our clinical anxiety towards all things politically correct luckily the same rules dont apply for talking teddies so we hear things that we arent even allowed to think because he can macfarlane mixes in his love of the 80s with numerous references and we even get odd cameos from tom skerritt nora jones and ryan reynolds the most bizarre reference takes up a substantial part of the movie  sam jones the star of flash gordon appears as an aged party animal teaching the boys some new tricks most of this will be dead time to those unfamiliar with the 1980 movie  and evidently none of us have been impacby it like macfarlanethe movie is a mashup of john waters bad santa jackass and just about every stereotypical slackerbuddy movie from the past 25 years its all of that and none of that at the same time depending on your viewpoint is either a crass irreverent totally inappropriate waste of movie time or its a comical insightful observation on where we are as a society right now only you can decide  just please dont take your kids,comedy
is a film that may have a teddy bear in it but its definitely not for the kids within the first 10 minutes of the film you hear the worst four letter word used in a religious sense but the audience went crazy that was when i knew that this film was something different for those of you who dont know what is about it starts about this kid named john bennet  a very unpopular kid so unpopular that he envies the jewish kids that gets beat up and on christmas day he gets a teddy bear that he names teddy after a while he knights teddy with the honor of being his best friend for life or as they say in the film thunder buddies for life and on one night he wishes that teddy could really talk low and behold the next day teddy can really talk instantly he becomes famous but it wears out over time skip about 30 years or so and its the present day where john and are still thunder buddies instead of having movie nights and riding in soap box cars theyre smoking pot and watching their favorite movie flash gordon which is very important later on john played by mark wahlberg now has a girlfriend of four years lori played by mila kunis and she expects john to grow up and move on with his life just being the obstacle its like every other buddy film but the buddy is a very irresponsible teddy bear i think what makes this movie work is the fact that can do things and say things that we wish we could but never had the heart to do it also because hes a teddy bear the intriguing thing about this movie is how it never slows down there are parts that are meant to be serious but then after a second says something thatll have you on the ground laughing hard i was extremely impressed by the plot sure it sounds so overused but macfarlane doesnt overdo it he compliments the characters so to speak also the jokes are very in your face and laugh out loud funny defiantly keeps in style with the family guy humor that we all know and love the acting given by kunis and wahlberg is really good and you could really feel the tension and the love between them but the kudos goes to the bear macfarlane gives a voice that really speaks curses and does other naughty things this movie would be called all about a bear but i believe that its really about friendship over the years theres a inside all of us and we all have our own 8 out of ten,comedy
if it wasnt for the avengers i would say that so far this summer is full of duds thankfully came out and i have to say it was really good thank you jesus i can honest say a movie was good after walking out of the theater first and foremost and this was already in the trailers but i really like the setup to the story its narralike some fairy tale and this unpopular kid gets a magical teddy bear for christmas who can interact with him and everyone else the true story however is when they grow up and how their lives arewhen i first saw the trailers i thought i was high watching it after seeing the movie they must have been high making it in fact teddy and marky mark are getting high an awful lot in the movie but their a few things along the way that surprised me like the chemistry between marky mark mila kunis it was very good not only that mila acher butt off in a movie about a teddy bear dont believe me there is this scene where she gets really mad at him outside teds place and it was a very solid performance i was actually convinced that she was irate with him whats odd is that a movie about a talking teddy bear actually worked on an emotional level thats no small feat and the fact that the teddy bear sounds just like peter griffin and it made me feel something is also amazingif there are a few things to gripe about i would have to say that the marky mark character is almost too much of an idiot throughout the movie i also have a hard time understanding why someone as hot as mila would even stay with some a weirdo toothe movie is pretty funny and it is very entertaining its not the funniest movie ive ever seen but it does get the job done after seeing black dynamite for the first time last night the bar was set a little too high for this film anyway highly recommended though,comedy
the creator of family guy seth macfarlane makes his first live action film debut and boy its was funny makes us forget about that cinematic abomination that is thats my boyin 1985 an 8 year old boy named john has no friends on one christmas is giving a toy bear as a gift then makes a wish that he wishes that the toy bear would come alive and they could be best friends and his comes true the toy bear comes alive john names him 27 years later johnmark wahlberg and tedmotion capture voiced by seth macfarlane are still together and are pretty much slackers john starts having a relationship with lorimilla kunis after four years she tells john that has to move out so there relationship can improve how will this end this was funny it spoofs everything from heartfelt too narrative moments mark wahlberg was funny so was the motion capture well voiced by seth macfarlane and milla kunis was good too so was everybody else in the movie its toy story with bite,comedy
first i may include spoilers in this i may not i watched it last night and this is my review after having slept on it teds one raunchy ride if you find yourself cringing during or avoiding family guy entirely youre going to have a bad time you have to come into this movie with an open mind comedically speaking everyones toes are stepped on from the jews to the trailer trash and everything else outlying and inbetween there was plenty of laughs to be had an interesting albeit foreseeable story line and an ending thatll leave you wanting more of i see a sequel in the future even though it didnt leave you hanging in the least bit my mark is an 8 out of 10 if you come in ready to have fun youre going to have a bundle of laughs waiting for you,comedy
my wife and i were out for dinner and decided at the last minute to see a movie i saw that had gotten some good critical reviews and that fans on fandango said must go we got the theater right on time but found out it was sold out i was shocked but intrigued so we decided to wait an hour for next showing turns out that the theater had added an additional showing again making me more curious about this movie we sat down and watched the seating completely fill outfrom start to finish i was pleasantly surprised by the entertainment value of this movie i was laughing so much at times that my stomach hurt and so was my wife who rarely finds raunchy humor amusing but it also has a fairly deep story about friendship the acting was fantastic and the editing superb at no time did it dragbut i dont want to build it up too much part of the reason we enjoyed it so much is because we werent expecting much go see it i agree with the fandangoians warning definitely not for kids or for those who are easily offended but it does manage to offend everyone,comedy
seth macfarlane had great success as the creator of acclaimed comedy cartoon family guy and follow ups american dad and the cleveland show but when i saw the trailer for this film his first direcfeature film i was really looking forward to it basically in swampscott massachusetts when he was five years old john bennett mark wahlberg was given a large teddy bear that he named teddy he saw the bear as his only friend since he had no real ones and was lonely and that christmas night the boy wished the bear was real and alive and his wish came true johns parents family guys lois  alex borstein and ralph garman were shocked and soon enough the story of the living teddy bear was all over the news and media as teddy became a brief celebrity and in the present day johnny still has his best friend macfarlane now a potsmoking drinking and foul mouthed waster living with him in boston along with johns longterm girlfriend office worker lori collins family guys meg  mila kunis lori is hoping that with their four year anniversary approaching that john will propose marriage but with around she feels he is not able to live a normal grownup life and obviously he is not happy to go along with his lifelong friend moving out until of course he has four prostitutes round and one during a game of truth of dare craps on the floor manages to find a new apartment john helps him find a job in the grocery store despite his disinterest in it working there teds gross behaviour attracts beautiful coworker tamilynn jessica barth but he still manages to see john a good amount of time even skipping work which frustrates lori while this is happening also has to deal with a stalker obsessive donny giovanni ribisi who idolises the bear since being a child seeing him on television he wants to possess him for his fat and destructive son robert aedin mincks it is at a party hosby loris lewd boss rex joel mchale that things come to a head for her and john he sneaks away and rushes to teds apartment where the star of their most favourite movie flash gordon leading actor sam j jones is there to have fun john ends up spending longer there than he planned lori caught him in the act and in a rage breaks up with him and in anger he blames for this and says he should stay away and that he has ruined his life they meet up again in a hotel room have a fight but slowly reconcile and realise he has to try and get his girlfriend back making an arrangement with sunrise singer norah jones convinces her to let john go on stage at her concert where found out that rex convinced lori to go on a date with him his singing of octopussys all time high is embarrassing but lori was moved by him trying to win her back decides he should help the couples relationship by going to loris apartment and having a talk he takes responsibility for the party incident and not allowing his friend to have his own life he offers to leave them alone but after she is convinced by this he gets kidnapped by donny and his son at the stalkers house is tortured with having his ear torn off by the boy who wants to play with him but he manages to distract him long enough to make a phone call to john and tell him his situation but he is recaptured john uses donnys contact card so he and lori can rescue the bear this becomes a big chase gets damaged along the way and they end up in fenway park the baseball park after the stalker tries to grab the bear ends up torn in half with his stuffing scattered he dies in his friend arms the wish magic fading away with his life john and lori return to the apartment and put back together hoping that he will return to life but it doesnt work lori tries the method of making the wish on a falling star again the next morning the magic worked and is alive again and in the end john and lori get married and has his own life and is promoas store manager narraby sir patrick stewart and also starring family guys joe  patrick warburton as guy matt walsh as thomas aliens tom skerritt family guys cleveland  mike henry as southern newscaster ray romano and ryan reynolds as jared wahlberg is good being the naive friend of the walking talking bear kunis as always is good at being beautiful and feisty and the computeranimateddy bear that is rude crude completely lovable and voiced and animaby macfarlane does almost steal the show you could think of this as a spoof of childhood fairy tales maybe like pinocchio but it is done in a sophisticaand modern way the humour is obviously very vulgar and offensive but the fantasy element helps even it out it is well written and retro stuff like flash gordon involved is great fun it is a really funny comedy film it was nominathe oscar for best song for everybody needs a best friend very good,comedy
this movie accomplishes exactly what it set out to do to be hilarious i think its easily the funniest movie in 2012 its up there with the hangover ive been waiting all year for a movie that i wanto see again and this one definitely meets that threshold its refreshing to see hollywood make at least 1 of these laughoutloud rar movies a year the trick is in the quality im not a fan of marky mark but the bear makes the comedy sing i think the writer and director has a good sense of comedy which seems to be in short supply with all these pathetic weak comedies coming out these daysthis movie scores in that department a definite must see,comedy
although its a stretch to call anything by the family guy creator cute directorwriter seth macfarlane has endearing moments in his comedy however the preponderance of jokes here are raw rude scatological and outrageous as is macfarlanes trademarkhe is the voice of teddy bear brought to life when little john bennett mark wahlberg wishes life into him now at 35 john and are best friends sharing life with johns girl lori mila kunis the laughs are plenty even clean ones like thisdressed in a suit and tie i look stupid john no you dont you look dapper john i look like something you give to your kid when you tell em grandma diedthen the romantic tension sets in and the humor vanishes while john and lori work out the expecproblem of the teddy bear buddy occupying johns time and imagination instead of lori while some of this convention simply has to be followed in romcoms the predictability compromises some of john and teds fastpaced workingclass boston dialogue that otherwise carries the show suffice it to say all will turn out right even if the stuffing gets knocked out of because love wins the day for the humans and come to think of it for the bears as well,comedy
it kind of reminds me of an adam sandler movie except funny this is the most ive laughed at a movie in years sure hall pass was pretty good as was horrible bosses and even the hangover 2 but this was all of those rolled into one movie i just wish mcfarlane would make a family guy or american dad movie and definitely make it at the very least rarand ladies ryan reynolds and taylor lautner are in this movie how bad could it possibly be im gonna see it again tomorrow night and if i can find a babysitter lie to my wife by telling her that the new medea movie is sold out well have to see insteaddo not miss this movie you bastids,comedy
is funny from the word go it has been a long time since i laughed this hard i thought dictator was the most abusive film this year but beats it hands down what makes the movie such a laugh riot is all the foul language coming out of a cutsie little teddy bear the movie mocks the music movies and tv shows flash gordon especially of the 80s and the 90s and takes a dig at some of the celebs the one on katie perry  taylor lautner was too funny a lot of guest appearances sam jones ryan reynolds norah jones to name a few i was totally shocked by norah jones talking all nasty never expecthat watch out for the fight sequence between and mark wahlberg cos it is so freaking awesome  funny the dialogues were too racist and very abusive but if you can digest all that the movie is fing hilarious make sure you leave your brains outside of the movie hall you will just enjoy the movie d,comedy
hollywood made many surprising films shawshank and stand by me were two films based on short stories both were successes something about mary controversial yet hilarious not one person would expect a comedy about a living cussing pot smoking alchoholic sexcrazy teddy bear,comedy
is such a fantastic movie it has laughter throughout the entire movie true friendships love silly antics heartache however a wonderful outcome for the end of the movie a film,comedy
this movie is so hilarious that i get tears of laughing,comedy
i watch every movie with mark walberg in it because he is really great actor and that is why i give this movie 7 i didnt give it a 10 because it has a beer in it that is like stuffed plush toy but it is talkingi dont believe this kind of movie where toy beer can talk it is difficult to believe it is true even as good as mark walberg is at some point in movie you start to think even after you watch great performance by mark walberg this is not possible how it is possible that toy bear is talking mark walberg is good actor but it is still impossible to believe even mark walberg and toy beer can have real conversationso if you like movies like this where real people talk to toys then maybe you will like this movie i did not like it i think movies where people talk only to other people is better because i can believe it more,comedy
mcfarlane basically just took the way he writes family guy and made it into a movie even the music and comedic style are exactly the same is essentially a bear version of peter griffin if you arent a fan of the adult humor family guy brings then you should pass on this one,comedy
is a very entertaining movie although its not for every age group its an r16 and its not surprisingit contains a lot of sexualsexistracist comments in the movie it also shows the uses of drugs and contains a lot of swearing and sexual intercoursebut the political incorrectness of the movie makes it there for funnyis a movie were a very inappropriate teddy bear comes to life and becomes best friends with a man called johnis very family guy like mainly because it has the same director seth macfarlane the movie has pretty good acting since mark wahlberg is the main character of the moviethe movies main female character is mila kunis who plays meg in family guy and the teddy bear is seth macfarlane himself i recermend this movie to family guy watchers and anybody that loves politically uncorrect conntent,comedy
before watching this film i didnt know what it was going to be like or if it was crap but i loved the film is a comedy which is not for all its more of an adult comedy even though it was ra15 but it is hilarious and there was excellent acting by mark wahlberg as john bennett mila kunis as lori collins seth mcfarlane as joel mchale as rex jessica barth as the sexy tami lynn and giovanni ribisi and aedin mincks as the very evil donny and robert ribisis character donny is a very evil man who wants and kidnaps to give him to his evil son robert played by aedin mincks the film also featured a guest appearance by famous film actor tom skerritt is an enjoyable and entertaining film to watch and i loved watching it,comedy

i love some raunchy comedies and is an example of where it can really shine it takes a premise that could be for kidsan adult needing to give up a childhood toyand explodes it with excessive profanity drugs and even sex and by even sex i mean that the teddy bear actually can bang womentakes these aspects and does something hilarious with it take a scene in which lori the teddy bears friends girlfriendcomes home to find poop on her floor she screams at for letting a hooker do thattheres a st on the floororor is the floor on the st argues to lighten her angerjohn walks in and sees it to which he simply responds is that a stshortly later its revisiin a flashback lori has to clean itscreaming this is so gross oh my lord its on my thumb she then screams and runs awaywhile this would be juvenile humor for adam sandler or a comedian like him this is almost masterwork by the voice coproducer cowriter and director seth macfarlaneyes this is from the same guy who creafamily guywhich i do not really care for but he can make raunchy workand this is how,comedy
i like macfarlane family guy was one of the first animations to genuinely make me laugh his profane use of comedy felt refreshing over ten years later his comedy hasnt changed and those who grew up with his crude dialogue have now become fully adjusthis leaves feeling somewhat empty despite the fluffy stuffing a young lonely boy wishes for his teddy bear to be his friend one night his anthropomorphic toy comes to life where they still remain best friends 27 years later however the inclusion of a girlfriend rapidly causes a rift between this friendship bros before hoes is the theme here an everlasting common message in buddy comedies romances do not last forever unless youre lucky so stick with the bromance and everything will be great except the whole point of the film is diminished in the last act when both the romance and bromance are equally balanced but lets not read too much into the core of this comedy after all it features a talking teddy bear macfarlanes feature length directorial debut contains an extreme amount of creativity and technical flair the motion capture was decent directing was solid where he dabbles into a variety of styles including a car chase and the acting was fine the problem with macfarlane is that he just does too much his famed voice acting career has left his talent specifically trademarked to peter griffin so for him to voice a teddy bear makes it rather difficult to not envisage the lead character of family guy then he also decides to write the script which unfortunately didnt make me laugh once this shouldnt come as a surprise to most but despite the promised obscenity it felt rather placid this is simply because we are used to his style of comedy now he needs to evolve profanity isnt funny anymore intelligent wittiness is what cracks people up i shant be saying i love you to this film due to its lacklustre screenplay and outdamessage yet it still remains watchable,comedy
is a movie well rather a puppet that came to life because of a xmas wish and becomes best friends with its owner since childhood and somehow the duo makes a good timekilling movie with fine humor including dirty jokes and whatnot i found myself laughing spontaneously from time to time the movie gets serious sometimes but generally this movie is nice710,comedy
i own a copy of this film on blu ray not for children very vulgar language expressive inappropriate themes sexualy explicit subject mater this film i for adults a gut splitting experience funny from the start to finish even though i am not really a seth macfarlane fan cant really stand him but this film overcomes that hate because of its funny nature the jokes are not meant for young ears the puppet work is amazing looks very real,comedy
dont usually like animafilms but i absolutely loved this movie i love mark wahalberg movies i think has great i wished i had a talking teddy when i was wee lol i dont understand how so many people hate this movie the second movie was funny too  i love the humour in this movie u get a good laugh with this movie,comedy
because the family guy tv show has been on the air for over a decade now there is an entire generation of comedy fans who have grown up with its raunchy celebritybashing voiceacting fratparty style of humor as such a film like can now wildly succeed in a contained theater format and it does in this case with hilarious resultsfor a basic plot summary sees young john bennett mark wahlberg giving life to his childhood teddy bear voiced by seth macfarlane via a magical wish one longago christmas night fastforward about 26 years however and suddenly is now a potsmoking wise cracking babechasing celebrity who keeps john from realizing his full potential when girlfriend lori mila kunis comes into johns life john must ultimately choose between her and in order to figure out what his future will holdquite obviously this movie is made for the family guy set i mean practically ever fg voice makes some kind of appearance here and the jokes are of the same sort of crudesexualcelebrityjuvenile nature as such i know a number of individuals who would walk out of the theater in disgust for those who get it though it is absolutely hilarious i dont want to go into any details and ruin the fun of many of the films best jokes but suffice it to say that youll never go more than a couple of minutes with a bellylaughbesides the jokes the acting is also tremendous kunis is fast becoming the queen of the rom com and turns in another great performance here while wahlberg is convincing as a sort of peter pan character who is in no hurry to grow up macfarlanes voice of in which can be heard all of peter brian  stewie from fg fame never gets old eitheralso there is more to than just comedy it contains some impressive action sequences as well as some character development and drama surpassing that which one would expect in movies that should showcase those things this movie despite the humor type takes itself very seriously at its core and strives to provide more than just the laughs that one knows will exist coming inin essence is a sort of coming of age for seth mcfarlanes unique set of skills whereas he once was thrown off foxs airwaves for being a little too crude he can now make a movie about a potsmoking expletivespewing teddy bear that leads its opening weekend at the box office why the switch because after years of honing his comedic style macfarlane found the right mix of actors and tone to produce a movie that stands up well on its own merits,comedy
after watching the movie many times i can assure you that it is very offensive and at first pretty stupid but similar to family guy is an ingenious work of art with great satire and acting you manage to feel sad when is ripped in half and almost killed is like a family guy movie with similar humor and actors while many criticize for its plain dumbness and offensive humor i believe that those factors contribute to the story of we live in a society of political correctness where nothing can be offensive all of seth mcfarlanes work including pushes those limits making it a movie that is extremely hilarious and wont leave you feeling disappoinwhen you are done watching,comedy
ill admit family guys shtick wore thin for me after about half a season after they brought it back from cancellation i can only watch it with a particular buddy who thinks its the greatest show ever so im not the target audience for this movie on the other hand i think blazing saddles is the funniest movie ever made including  maybe especially  all the nbombs fart jokes and inside references so there should have been something here for me to enjoy but there wasnt is a meanspirivulgar obnoxious movie i didnt laugh once in fact this movie managed to make unfunny the only thing guaranteed in life to make every man laugh  seeing another guy taking a shot to the groin its depressing to think this movie has brought in more than 500m worth of business and spawned a sequel its not the worst comedy ever made  little nicky is still probably the worst  but its right down there,comedy
the most popular stuffed animal doll in 2012 perhaps that is my new nickname for because of his appearance in this movie teddy bear become more famous and people just wish they had a friend just like the story itself is quite unique the fantasy relationship that turns out to be modern day  buddies friendship between a human and a talking stuffed animal doll seth macfarlane did a quite impressive job in here as a voice cast for but also the producerdirector writer of this movie and the most wonderful thing about this movie is  seth takes the audiences from the starting point of johnrelationship and then their highest point when they are already thunder buddies then lowest point when john leaving for lori and all of that wrapped with a beautiful soundtrack from norah jones that really blows the audiences away overall i really like this movie,comedy
i feel often times the term overrais used or rather taken too harshly when i say that is overrait does not mean that its a bad movie in fact i really enjoyed as far as a seth macfarlane creationfirst things first the music in this movie is fantastic this isnt usually something relevant in a comedy film but it simply needs to be addressed nominafor an oscar walter murphy and seth macfarlane do an incredible job on the films premier song everybody needs a best friend macfarlane has always been a great songwriter and it really shows in this productionanother really strong factor in this movie is the animation with the teddy bear animation really can do incredible things and its remarkable how good looks in this movie honestly there are scenes where i actually forget that isnt really there because even though the idea is obviously imaginary the bear fits in perfectly with the rest of the scenethe acting in this movie is what id call a mixed bag macfarlane does a great job voice acting for and mark wahlberg does fine in his role as teds best friend john as well the supporting cast is all good too the villain in particular i really enjoyed as well as patrick warburtons character and mark wahlbergs boss the only performance i couldnt get behind was mila kuniss for some reason her acting has never done anything for me ive always found her to be just sort of a pretty face think a female predallas buyers club matthew mcconaugheythe ending of this film is sort of lame i find that macfarlane usually struggles with writing the sentimental scenes and its certainly prevalent in its a sappy ending and it just doesnt really fit into the sort of black comedy style of this movie sentimental moments in black comedy can work but only if theyre done perfectly unfortunately for macfarlane this is not but its not that bad and kudos to macfarlane for at least trying hard to bring a quality sad scene because its obvious that macfarlane clearly gave it his all in this one at leastbut lets talk about the most important aspect of any comedy movie the comedy to be honest this movie made me laugh hard macfarlane definitely has the ability to create funny scenarios and he shows it very much so here but with this also comes the main problem in all of macfarlanes writing the cutaways this has always been an issue for me sure i loved the cutaway bits in family guy the first 1000 times but by now the trope is simply getting old this is interesting too because macfarlane has shown that he can in fact create good comedy just from a story which works a lot better just simply the fact that a teddy bear is a potsmoking cursing boston meathead is already hilarious in its own right but yet seth macfarlane still insists on using this cutaway style of humor abundantly in his movies and more often than not it just doesnt work macfarlane can also be a hit or miss at times when the jokes work they work great and are good for tons of laughs but when they dont work they seem to go on forever and fall really flat and that happens a few times in this film but to macfarlanes credit he did a good job overall in my opinion there were certainly more ha ha moments than eye rolling moments by farin conclusion not great but i would definitely recommend its certainly a hilarious movie that has some really quality moments you might enjoy some of the cameos as well seriously how did seth macfarlane and patrick stewart become friends ive always found that amusing but anyway go see this movie youll be cracking up and will probably find yourself saying wow i cant believe a teddy bear just said that,comedy
is a movie that presents a powerful use of symbolism in the film industry which i have almost never seen by observing johns immaturity and his constant struggle to keep his inner child alive in his parallel reality i was witnessing the preseninternal struggle of one man between immaturity and adulthood all of us can understand this relation because in each of us lies a teddy bear a major symbol of our childhood the best comedies are the ones that have an element of truth mark wahlberg showed again more than a solid wellpainconfusion between johns best friend and the woman he loveswas fun but also a learning experience it is impossible to miss the essence of the message of this film,comedy
it starwatching this with the notion that it might be a bit too much a bit strange and a bit childish and yes it is these things but in a good way slightly overdoing it at points maybe a bit to long or stretched but allinall very funny entertaining and actually just a great moviethere is a lot a cute bear can say and do that doesnt seem that harsh or offending coming from a teddy bear but would be a bit too much coming from a real live character but when this live characters talks to the bear it is also alright  lets just say that they exploit that fact many times in this movie they do it well and they do it hard it is hilarious at timesvery nice entertaining some will still find it over the top but i just liked it and enjoyed it very much,comedy
john wishes for his teddy bear to become alive and he does twenty years later lives with john but the later has now to choose between his best friend and his girlfriend who thinks is a bad influence surprisingly the film is good although i had a hard time remembering what it was about the next day i can recall that i was laughing a lot some of the jokes are not funny true and the story does have some clichs in it but if you watch it without expecting too much from it then youll have a good time so 5 out of 10 for because even though it is about a teddy bear it doesnt fail to entertain grown ups,comedy
seth macfarlane director writer producer star has proved time and time and again that he is a comedic mastermind and is one more testament to this truth full of kneeslappers the film covers the story of a thirty fiveyearold boy who just will not grow upand his talking teddy bear mark wahlberg costars in this comedy along with mila kunis giovanni ribisi and jessica barth the ensemble works well together and every joke hits making for a winning comedy thirtyfive year old john bennet wahlberg has his ideal living arrangement in boston with his best friend and his girlfriend of four years macfarlane the talking teddy bear who came into johns life when the boy was eight also loves the arrangement  he lives rentfree and can get into all kinds of mischief with his pal lori kunis on the other hand wants her boyfriend to grow up and has determined that the source of his immaturity is youll never guess his teddy bear she demands that move out and that john take their relationship seriously john finds it hard to let go of being so close to his companion and things get even more complicawhen teds stalker donny ribisi wants to purchase the bear for his disturbing son to play with im in love with the casting for macfarlane wahlberg and kunis all have fantastic chemistry although hes interacting with a cgi teddy bear wahlberg pulls off the best friendvibe splendidly the conversation between john and flows naturally with both macfarlane and wahlberg showing their aptitude for their respective parts wahlberg portrays the contrasts in john very well the audience can tell that he needs to grow up and get his life together but his humor and sensitivity make it clear that his heart is in the right place kunis character is different from the stereotypical femaleinamaledrivencomedy lori clearly loves john but she is also goalorienand demands be trearight by him kunis does a great job at showing loris torn emotions when she realizes she is unhappy with the way her relationship is going during the film the audience sees john and lori during both happy times and arguments in both circumstances the writing and the acting is spot on the music is very unique in this film with a couple original songs norah jones and seth macfarlane cowrote the opening number everybody needs a best friend link and walter murphy composed the score some of the tracks in murphys score have a jazzy swing to them which feels appropriate for a macfarlane film the music is absolutely a pleasant surprise in the script acting and music were all great in but the film wasnt completely spectacular although i enjoyed macfarlanes performance i couldnt help but be bored by the fact that had the same voice as peter griffin im not sure why macfarlane didnt come up with a unique voice for but i was not a huge fan of his recycling overall the biggest flaw i can find in this film is its predictability there truly are no surprises in everything that you would expect to happen in a film like this does indeed despite these minor drawbacks id call the movie a success ill come right out and say that im a huge fan of seth macfarlane the man has a great sense of humor hes a talenvoice actor and a fantastic jazz artist has seth macfarlane written all over it in the best way still putting my bias aside this film is hilarious and perfect for anyone in need of a good laugh,comedy
i reckon this was first pitched as a kids movie then some smartie says no too many like it so how to make it an adult movie i know just throw in as many gratuitous swear words and sexual double entendre as possible double entendre no we dont want that sophisticaan audience just give them bare faced bear balled sex its crap at the start middle and finish laugh at this shite take a good look at yourselfone of the worst movies ive seenbut i should add that the acting is not bad especially the bear if you ignore the voice and dialogue,comedy
i understand why some people wont like this film but dont go reviewing it if you dont like family guy this film is similar to family guy so you not liking family guy just says you wont like this film so stop entering reviews and starting with by the way i dont like family guy because those reviews should be discarded and not actually count towards the overall rating of the film because that might discourage other fans so if you dont like family guy dont review seth macfarlane i happen to like family guy and think this movie is entertaining and well worth a watch if you enjoy family guy if not dont watch this movie1010,comedy
i came into this movie expecting to be laughing almost the whole time but i sat through the movie almost bored out of my mind i was on the verge of getting up and leaving but that would of been rude so instead i sat through the almost unbearable part of the movie where and john mark wahlberghave a big fight surprise surprise and johns girlfriend dumps him another surprise  its just a barrage of clichs to be honest the humour of the film was well below mediocre i didnt understand some the jokes because they were referencing a celebrity that i have never heard about the other jokes are about drugs swearing and getting drunk the only time i managed a laugh was when was pretending to be a retard  all in all if youre american youd probably understand and enjoy this movie more than i did if not stay away nice,comedy
i really struggled with short for tedious clearly aimed at the teenage market the humour such as it is takes you back to the smut laughed about behind the school toilets foul mouthed although simultaneously attempting to be cute the teddy bear friend of mark wahlberg who should know better pretty much bored me silly within half an hour im not sure that ill be able to take mark wahlberg all that seriously as an actor any more after this drivel which is a shame as hes been so good in movies like the fighter and the deparmila kunis is wasi thought i saw ryan reynolds an actor ive taken little notice of popping up for no apparent reason and tom skerritt also embarrasses himself at the end norah jones a singer whose albums ive collecalso disappoints in a sort of guest appearance and id rather not have spoilt my image of her as a good singer a complete mess this one and unbelievably theyve made 2 although i couldnt see mila kuniss name in the cast list when i quickly looked through it wise girl,comedy
rating510is an animabear who starts off being cute and cuddly and ends up being a party mad foul mouthed well still a cuddly bear has its funny moments and laughter can be had throughout but i just couldnt see this as that that funny and some humour is wasand lazy its not badly written or direcjust not good enough in the end and you can feel this a comedy not on par with others or things seth macfarlane has done beforethere are parts that can be enjoyed and very much so and the movies fascination with flash gordon is fairly funny and provides some great cutaways to the characters pasts mark wahlberg i felt was likable in his role as john bennett and acts fairly well for a comedy his serious side and his funny side mix well and he ends up probably the best out of the various performers i enjoyed the performances involved and no one acts poor really at all and one person who stands out is giovanni ribisi who should have been seen more because of his wildly funny interests which form a very funny moment of the moviewith this kind of comedy you really have to like seth macfarlanes brand of funny and it doesnt harm watching a little of his shows before hand it does feel in parts like an episode of family guy was used to create this but even if it was it has its moments of laughter look i think macfarlane can be a top comedian but with projects like it just isnt sharp enough and almost crosses the line in terms of over the top dramatic scenesdespite what i say there are moments to be had where laughter can flow and i particularly liked a certain cameo involved where many things are smashed i wasnt so keen actually on the bear and felt characters such as johns boss and various others were actually the best thing about this with macfarlanes writing skill coming in to play and making something work i have to say with this that some jokes made can be offensive and although i think comedy can touch anything there are times when the offending doesnt quite make sense and although as well we can see macfarlane is playing a joke here i couldnt help feel gay jokes and misogyny were either unneeded or miss timed completely in fact on that point if you are easily offended then dont watch it its a not a good enough excuse to say it offends you if you yourself watched it knowing it may offendoverall i felt it deserved a grade of 510 and a strong and high one of that in word terms it felt pretty average but again a strong kind of average and not far at all from being an ok movie this is a piece where 15 year olds are expecto laugh and elders expecto find it immature but watching it and thinking back on it it has its moments and with a type of humour that is hard to sometimes laugh at it seems to at least do it partly well at the time of writing this 2 is in the works and although i wouldnt and wont expect anything of it with bits of macfarlanes skill and many a slight tinkering in the script department it could be very funny so i will be interesto see just how that goes down,comedy
in my honest opinion is a really funny film but i was rather surprised as to how rude it actually was going to be is the first ever 15 rafilm ive watched and it is probably one of the funniest films i have ever watched that beats mr beans holiday as probably my favourite film of all time it was funny because when was with john theyd always be trying to be high on drugs i really liked because it had some rather funny jokes in it such as f you thunder you can suck my dick at the time of watching the film i was very surprised as it was quite vulgar ie reference to sex overall i really liked the film because it had lots of comical jokes in it but also it ended with a happy ending which is always nice,comedy
this movie has received some bad reviews previously and i cannot understand why i found the movie to be a laugh out loud comedy dont go into this movie thinking its going to be an oscar winner because its not however if your up for a great comedy and night in this is your film the plot focuses on jonny and his teddy bear it shows you the changes they have to go through from childhood then to growing up i believe the 2 characters are realistic in what they are and go through real life situations these situations are work relationships and family the jokes and comedy that are included are very goodthey are not for the easily offended which is what i think makes this comedy real just because there is a talking bear in it it it doesnt hold back and i believe its what makes this film more real overall funny movie and i would recommend,comedy
the movie was funny and cute i liked how some of the family guy  american dad cast members were in the movie i felt like the jokes were great family guy at its finest i laughed and smiled through out the entire movie mark wahlberg  mila kunis were great together mark  seth was really funny also patrick warburton  ryan reynolds were awesome i hope theyre in 2 i love their straight face humor mila kunis was great  she looked beautiful not a surprise my favorite part was saying he could hear the fat kid running and bet it was funny looking seth macfarlane did a really good job with teds voice mix of peter  stewies voice which are the best the other writers did a good job also there were a few minutes of the movie where it got a little depressing between mark  milas relationship but it wasnt too bad in conclusion awesome movie i laughed i smiled and ill be waiting for 2,comedy
now i love family guy and i think seth macfarlane is a creative genius so when this film was announced and that he was voicing i knew that this film was going to be a hit and boy was i right this premise sees an 8 year old boy wish his teddy was alive and it obviously does now at 35 years old he is still with and starts to realise that may be holding him back now the character of is just awesome and mcfarlanes voice was perfect to truly encapsulate this raunchy teddy bear that has some of the best one liners ever the supporting cast was really good too with mark walhberg delivering a really funny performance with his chemistry with the teddy bear and helping really add to the film mila kunis was also good in the film with her dialogue being funny and her chemistry with walhberg being good too giovanni ribisi also had a good performance as the bad guy and added a lot to the film the one i didnt really like was kunis boss who i thought didnt have to be in the film at all the story is okay with the premise being crazy but i think some of the dramatic moments did work and added to the film but a lot of the film is just random scenes and doesnt add anything to the film the script is fantastic with all dialogue working and all the lines especially from being hilarious the style is okay with some of the crazy aspects working but also some of it also seeming just too ridiculous to take seriously overall this is a hilarious film that if you are not offended easily is definitely worth a watch,comedy
i loved this movie i loved this teddybear i loved the plot i loved the characters i think you should see this movie if you like comedies and mark wahlberg and also if you are into something weird being normal if that makes any senseso i need to write a few more lines ad it will be something like it is a very light and easy movie but it is fun and straight forwarda teddy bear smoking weed you gotta love iti will see it again for surehere goes the last lines  i think it was an unique movie i will surely look after more work from this writer,comedy

seth macfarlane finally enters the film industry and takes a break from television if your familiar with his work you know he can create some raunchy and daring shows imagine what he can do in cinema his first feature film is called mark wahlberg plays john bennett a car dealership worker who at a young boy received a magical teddy bear as a christmas gift now hes in his thirties and still has the teddy bear only they both switched from sweet and cute to lazy rude and rambunctious the two are best buddies and are absolute bums is voiced by macfarlane and constantly smokes pot makes jokes and is a total bum the plot moves from just pure fun and games to a little melodramatic due to john having a relationship with a woman named laurie who is played sweetly funny by mila kunis this film is a total party its a great film to just enjoy and laugh your face off at 200 am macfarlane is even more raunchy and vulgar than his characters are in family guy and is absolutely hilarious as mark wahlberg is hilarious as well and him and have a great buddy relationship the main factor that makes this comedy so special is the originality most comedies these days have the same recycled jokes and plots that they become repulsive and not funny is pure comedy creativity that makes a great time and has lots of fun laughs and outrageous scenarios that make this the ultimate popcorn comedy film,comedy
this is a very good comedy i recommend this movie for those who like dirty jokes there are a lot in this movie the teddy bear is very funny and seth does teds voicesounds like peterbrian griffin you may not get all the jokes in this movie but you will get the most of them i can say its similar to family guy and if you like family guy i am sure you will like some characters are annoying though in the movie but its ok is not the only funny guy in this movie john and lori are funny sometimes although there is a minus with the plot i will not spoiler something so i stop with the plot i highly recommend for if you love dirty and nasty jokes,comedy
there are some films that are so low brow they make you want to chew your own neck off keith lemon the movie im looking at you then there are others which are also pretty low brow but actually work im pleased to say that is one of themis the tale of a young boys magical wish to bring his cuddly teddy bear to life so that they can be best friends forever he gets his wish and stays with him until adulthood which causes more than a few complications with his longsuffering girlfriendif you didnt know is seth family guyamerican dadthe cleveland show macfarlands first big screen outing and the bottom line is that if youve seen and enjoy any of his shows youll probably enjoy his writing is not meant to be subtle some of it can be shocking other bits offensive he like family guy has an open insult policy where no one is beyond being made fun of although he does cover some controversial topics he mainly makes fun of eighties movies and tv plus some healthy ribbing of blist celebritiesits crude but its funny as long as you set you mind at that level and know what youre getting you should have more than a few laughs with a bear who swears and engages in recreational drugtaking not to mention is quite a hit with the ladies  youll have to watch the film to see that bitenjoy a real life swear bearhttpthewrongtreemoviereviewsblogspotcouk,comedy
mark wahlberg mila kunis seth macfarlane joel mchale and giovanni ribisi star in this 2012 comedy wahlberg boogie nights plays john bennett a 35 year old man who has a had a teddy bear for 27 years is not only a special friend but he talks and certainly has a way with words kunis that 70s show plays johns girlfriend lori collins who wants to move forward with him soon johns friendship with interferes with his relationship with lori and tries to help them mchale plays loris obnoxious boss rex who has a thing for her and ribisi avatar plays donny an odd man who tries to get for his son macfarlane family guy not only provides the voice of but also writes and directs the film patrick stewart xmen narrates singer norah jones actor tom skerritt and flash gordon star sam jones also appear as themselves this is funny wahlberg  the cast are good and i recommend this,comedy
once in a while you finally get a comedy that makes you belly laugh and heres a great example was never going to fail with seth mcfarlane at the helm writing directing and voicing ticks all the right boxes its a simplistic tale of a boy johnwahlberg who struggles to mix and makes a wish for his teddy bear to be real life  his best friend forever his wish comes true and at first is a sensation but like with most things people lose interest and just becomes part of johns  girlfriend lorikunis everyday life a bit too much of a part for lori and it soon puts a strain on their relationship thrown into the mix is donnyribisi and his son who stalk wanting to take him for their own there are some really funny moments  some superbly placed cameos which i wont mention so as not to spoil it it pays particular respect to some eighties icons and fads the cgi on is superb none of that jar jar binks nonsense strong language drug references  sexual innuendo ensure its an effective adult comedy the film even manages to conclude in a fashion that does not leave you reaching for the sick bucket an all round hit comedy,comedy
until collapses at the end with a generic etish tragedyturnedvictory jerking of tears i was laughing sometimes so hard i regreteating at taco time yet since i have only seen two or three episodes of family guy and im enjoying the maturity of my midfifties i got the distinct feeling that there was an inside joke in or my age precluded me from seeing the movie as an joke to be appreciaby younger folksanywayeither way the movie is crude and stupid and pretty darned delightful with mark wahlberg mila kunis and seth mcfarlane having a grand old time on screen i saw with my wife and i must be getting old because there were times i was so embarrassed from the crude humor i actually apologized to her then i saw her laughing hard too and i knew i didnt have to apologize maybe thats what makes workits unapologetic in its crudity its attention to its demographic i saw the rocky horror picture show back in the early 80s and i didnt get the cultish devotion that the movie generai did recognize that i couldnt recognize what was going on then i do recognize that teds audience is about 30 years younger than meluckily im smart enough to see what i know im not seeingthats why i recommend this hilarious vulgarity,comedy
is the best comedy i have probably ever seen in 2012 mark wahlberg is funny and hilarious with seth mcfarlane should have got nominaand won for best writing and directing universal studios brings people a inappropriate teddy bear who is best friends with a human everything is funny i would suggest 14 and over see this movie because of the sexual content and crude content is a bear for teenagers and adults the unraversion is totally for adults they are going to make another movie that hopefully will be good and awesome like the first one is the number 1 comedy of the year for 2012,comedy
who would have thought this film would be as funny as it is not a knack against seth macfarlane but i didnt think family guylike humor would last for two hours but thanks to a hilarious witty though perhaps inconsistent script this film is able to work and ends up being a likable comedy this concept of girl vs growing up has been done before a countless number of times but not with a foulmouthed teddy bear for sure and that gives this film some originalitythis is the first foray into film for seth macfarlane and for the most part he makes a very good and hilarious film john bennett happens to be the most hakid in boston so he wishes for a new friend his wish is granwhen his teddy bear comes alive now many years later his manhood becomes put at test when he has to choose between and his longtime girlfriend lorithe acting is really good especially in spite of working with a puppet mark wahlberg rarely works in comedy if at all and i think he does a good job in this film shedding his macho toughguy image here mila kunis is good as lori who desperately wants him to grow up giovanni ribisi is a bit creepy as the man who wants for his son finally macfarlane adds a bit of his peter griffin to teds voice which actually get its own joke in the filmoverall is a hilarious comedy though it may overstay its welcome for just perhaps a few minutes nonetheless i enjoyed the film and i laughed very hard people may find this meanspiribut its seth macfarlane we are talking about here there are many references to flash gordon here including a surprise appearance this is a good recommend for anyone looking to laugh i rate this film 910,comedy
this was a funny film a word of advicedespite the everprecense of a cute teddy bear this might not be for kids and if they do see it make sure the parents are with them due to the persistent crude and drugrelahumorthe movie starts off when an outcast kid wishes his new teddy bear were real and of course it comes true the bear becomes a celebrity overnight which unfortunately fades out soon many years later the kid is an adult in age only the bear is still his friend and constant companion and is also foulmouthed and loves to dabble in drugs and rather gross stuff and it tests the guys 4year relationship with his girlfriend of course a bad guy and his son have their eyes set on and pushes his owner to his limits and the owner does the same to the girlfriendyou will love the ending it is very satisfying the special effects were nothing short of amazing and i loved the leonard maltin review overall not bad out of ,comedy
is the greatest movie that i have ever seen i really dont like or care about movies i think they are a poor art form if there is an art form and i think that even the best of them are boring to the point where i can hardly bring myself to watch one i have seen about 25 minutes of it various parts i fastforwarded to after putting the dvd of it in that i got from the library because its free it was pretty funny especially the scene where spanks mark whalberg i cracked it laughing i had a pretty good time that couple minutesthe performances are run of the mill i recognized most of the actors from other comedies they are pretty good in this movie seth mcm is pretty cool at directing good comedy actors in live action as compared to his comedy cartoon family guy which i dont like as much my second favorite part of the movie after the spanking was the computer animation which was very realistic in this movie and very confusing to look at other comedies i would recommend as much as are bill and teds bogus journey and 2 as well as my favorite movie little man staring the wayans brothers i own it on vhs and dvd,comedy
youll either love or hate depending on if you appreciate seth mcfarlanes humor if yes a no brainer but this movies not for kids watching a good bear gone bad talk filth for an hour is so offensive that it pushes boundaries but what the heck i was hooked from the beginning because i was too busy laughing my head off at the corny jokes to care mark wahlberg does a great job alongside on screen girlfriend mila kunis if you like family guy youll surely love this sure it has its flaws a bit dumb and hitandmiss in places but for the most part pretty funny and worth checking out for the humor factor alone,comedy
after seeing this trailer yesterday i could not believe how funny this looked as fan of family guy and amecina dad i could not wait until aug 1st last yearfirst half of the movie was very funny i felt like i was laughing for 30 minutes no stop there was really funny jokes i love the thunder songs crack me up big time after the first half hour the movie dose lose a steam and dose feel less funny they do have some descent jokes that will make giggle for rest of the movie i was hoping for full on comedy i do think they put a tad too much drama in this movie which made less funny some might find some scene very sad i really enjoyed how the movie ended i think was perfect ending to this movie7 out of 10,comedy
seth macfarlane really know how to make people laugh that is really well established and he does not disappoint you with this one as well is one movie you should definitely watch if you are in the mood for some laid back fun on a friday night its about a little lonely kid john bennett mark wahlberg without any true friends who on one magical christmas night wishes to have his teddy bear come alive and unexpectedly the wish comes true the narration goes that the teddy voice by seth himself and john become really close and remain each other true friends forever as promised fast forward 30 years john is now a grown man of 35 years and is in a relationship with a beautiful philly girl lori collins mila kunis and the story really startsi am not gonna sit here and talk about the story its not something we have not seen its boy meets girl boy screws up friends comes to the rescue and the girl and boy end up happily ever after if you want to see something new and thoughtful you are in the wrong place the thing that sets this movie apart is the dialogues the one liners i already told you this for the laid back fun mood movie and it does not disappoint you one little bit in that regard go and watch it if you need your mind off things and party,comedy
although regarded as a high concept bad taste comedy featuring a teddy bearis a really a twisromantic comedy from seth macfarlanemark wahlberg plays john who when he was 8 years old received a teddy bear for christmas that came to lifefor a brief moment became a celebrity but 27 years later he and john live together in an apartment with a low rent job smoking dope getting drunk and making risqu jokeshowever john has mila kunis as a girlfriend who feels unappreciashe also attracts the attention of her sleazy employeris also attracting the attention of a creepy guy played by giovanni ribisiwhile the film has some bad taste jokes and scenes of humping a woman which some might shocki some people it is not that heavy going to many british viewers who have been used to grotesque alternative comedy for over three decadesat the heart of the story is a predictable rom com is fun tasteless and enjoyable it was also nice to see flash gordon again after all these years,comedy
ive been in the mood for rracomedies lately and ive been lucky to find a string of them that ive all enjoyed was one of the better ones in that it didnt totally deflate in the final act although it did start to feel clichd and conventional the early scenes are funny as john and have to grow up and get separate lives getting the job at the grocery store might be my favorite bits mark wahlbergs character gets dangerously close to unlikablei liked it better when he was playing it straight as opposed to trying to make his girlfriend laugh by acting like he was twelve i know that was the point but i thought they showed it better through his lack of ambition than his childish humor the subplot with the kidnapper and his kid doesnt pay off except for the scenes in their home the chase at the end and the wrap up had some good lines by but felt too much like a thousand other movies to be interesting himself looked amazing as accomplished as anything in cg or animation however i found myself really wishing someone else had done the voice it was distracting that he sounded so much like another well known character i think he needed his own unique sound but that seems to be less of a problem as i rewatch it over i would definitely check out a part 2 i dont know teds lines were all in the script or if the voice actor did a lot of improvising but his dialog was the highlight and what kept the whole thing together also id like to see joel mchale as this sleazy villain in every movie from now on 6 out of 10,comedy
first there was gollum then caesar the ape and now  if you thought motioncapture animation was beyond the range of foulmouthed r racomedy heres your evidence to the contrary family guy creator seth macfarlane has taken his love of characters who shouldnt behave like humans behaving like humans to the next level and the big screen  with a story of growing up  at the age of 35fans of macfarlane and family guy will be the first to tell you that the comedy pioneer has been more cold than hot lately i guess those manatees in the tank of idea balls have been worked too hard its not easy to keep scoring laughs using the same nonsequitur formula over and over again but fortunately is a more comically cohesive effort than youd ever expect from the king of unexpecrandom jabs references and political incorrectnessif you havent been curious enough to find out what the film is about already tells the story of how young john bennett who grows up to be mark wahlberg who had trouble fitting in as a kid made a wish on christmas day for his teddy bear to come to life his wish comes true and becomes world famous even appearing on the johnny carson show but as patrick stewart lovingly and frankly reminds us in his role as narrator like corey feldman and frankie muniz eventually people stop giving a despite a serious relationship of four years with lori mila kunis nearly middleaged john is,comedy
john bennetts childhood wish made his teddy bear seth macfarlane alive its 27 years later and a talking teddy bear is no longer shocking john mark wahlberg is dating lori collins mila kunis john considers breaking up with tedsome people love seth macfarlane i could go either way its definitely low brow broad grade school humor theres nothing subtle about it no detailed explanation is given for and none is really needed the sad part of the partnership is that overshadows mark wahlberg in acting skills mila kunis is no wallflower and she can keep up with the boys the film is complicaunnecessarily by giovanni ribisis kidnapping scheme it disjoints the movie its serious nature causes great disruption but theres enough funny moments to overlook these minor irritants,comedy
seth mcfarlane is pure genius ive been dying to see him do a real live action movie thats unrelato family guy speaking of family guy if you dont like it then you have problems that show is so incredibly on point hilarious and touches on all kinds of social issues in the best way possible didnt have much of a message other than heres a movie you can watch over and over and it will remain hilarious i cant wait to see what he does next i heard something about a new sitcom hes doing coming out soon havent seen any commercials though just a couple of billboards i wish he would just stop making american dad and the cleveland show and take the creativity hes wasting on those mediocre shows and put it into this new sitcom and more movies please,comedy
i dont care what the hell anyone thinks this movie is funnyperiod some jackass from the uk suggesmilan kunis is just average looking as part of his critique of this movie fu buddyshe is absolutely gorgeous for those of you that didnt think the movie was funny please remove the stick out of your tight ass everything from the narration to all the sarcasm and stupidity made this hilarious one of the best comedies made in a very long time and i hear 2 might be a possibility i certainly hope so i was just amazed at how many negative reviews there are sounds like some of those individuals would find humor in the wall street journal,comedy
seth mcfarlane cannot get over the idea that ridiculing racism sexism and homophobia can be accomplished by doing some kind of meta mumbo jumbo that lets you still make jokes at the expense of those who are nonwhite nonchristian nonheterosexual and nonmale and its too bad because this is a very funny movie but unless you are a white heterosexual male of a certain age you might struggle to get past the offensive stuff and miss an otherwise very funny moving story with great acting and directing and superb comic timing considering how well this movie did at the box office i can only assume that if mcfarlane stopped the extreme offensive stuff his future movies would do even better because hed have an audience that includes people that are not just white men raised in the 80s every time the offensive stuff popped up in it was superfluous and actually stopped the momentum of the story a flat unfunny bit involving the patrick warburton character comes to mind and the payoff later in the movie was not worth it a cameo character involved in the bit was momentarily funny but there are so many other ways to achieve the level of humor he was aiming for without stopping the momentum of his story and offending a significant proportion of the american public in one fell swoop its clear he can be hysterically funny without the offensive material so why interrupt a great funny story with stuff that alienates up to half of his potential viewers and make no mistake the offensive jokes are as superfluous as the relahumor is necessary to the story the jokes that are specific to the story work without fail and are great including one that was the most extreme scatological bit ive ever seen but i still found hysterical the offensive jokes do not work and are just not worth it the best humor takes aim at those with the wherewithal to handle it not those who are already marginalized ive read mcfarlane making the excuse is that hes poking fun at a society that allows these issues to marginalize people given that the story is about maturity coming when one learns to take responsibility for ones own behavior his excuse comes across as lazy immature and extremely ironic i challenge seth mcfarlane to make a movie that does not require his fans to defend him but can appeal to everyone take a lesson from chris rock who knows how to engage in topical humor without cutting down those who are already victimized by society and learn to write jokes without using the word rape,comedy
this movie was just funny as hell like funnier than family guy even though the voice of is peter griffin from family guy there are some rude scenes during the film but it was just funny as hell the plot was interesting and funny at the same time the jokes are crack up and it also had other actors that were from family guy like jo swatson the police man in a wheel chair ryan reynolds also appeared in the film as well which was interesting what also surprised me was the amount of swears in the film like fk st and many other bad swear words but that ok because seth macfarlen always has swears in his tv shows and movies over all i thought it was interesting most of the time was either being funny drunk taking drugs or fighting a duck over all i would recommend people seeing this film that are fans of family guy,comedy
is rude crude full of crass humour and clever references selfaware to the point where the characters do all but wink at the camera and absolutely ludicrous yet it is this acceptance of what it is and complete lack of loftier ambitions both genuinely funny and actually endearing in a bizarre kind of way the premise is so simple its genius a boy wishes his teddy bear would come to life and by a miracle that is exactly what happens and the boy and the bear promise to be friends for ever but rather than a childhood friendship story flashes forward to what happens when the boy grows up and the bear ages along with him what we see is the now grownup johnny mark wahlberg living with his long term girlfriend lori mila kunis and the eponymous bear voiced by family guy creator seth macfarlane who is now a foulmouthed weedsmoking and generally hardliving waster the plot then such as it is leads to a somewhat obvious theme of learning to grow up and take responsibilityunfortunately the paperthin predictable plot only seems to serve to detract rather than add to the films premise which in itself grows slightly wearing after a while certainly there is a great novelty value in seeing a grown man eating drinking talking and fighting a talking teddy bear and in hearing the bear swear and tell vaguely racially offensive jokes but the novelty starts to wear off when the film tries to enter the more serious middle third fart jokes and an actual reference to family guys peter griffin all serve to point out that this actually is all rather derivative after all no doubt fans of macfarlanes earlier work will love it and will cry shame that macfarlane remains misunderstood but they would no doubt have watched it anyway and therein lies the problem this almost feels like a featurelength liveaction version of a family guy episode which might be great for some but it is unlikely to win any new fans to macfarlanes work most of the characterization is very simple and 2dimensional with wahlberg himself for all the films message of taking responsibility and growing up not actually developing much as the film goes on leaving the audience to wonder why on earth the similarlybland mila kunis is with him in the first place the rest of the supporting cast are little more than paintbynumbers stereotypes particularly joel mchale as loris sleazy boss while the underused giovanni ribisi could have been something interesting had his wannabebear owner donny been given more than a few minutes of screen time here and there however patrick stewarts opening and closing voiceovers do provide some genuine laughs and hearing captain picardprofessor xavier swear is quite an eye and ear opening experience having said all that does contain a large number of genuinely funny lines even if a lot of them do appear in the trailers and did produce a few laughoutloud moments particularly with the numerous references to 80s movies although sense of taste and political correctness may need to be left at the door a liberal sprinkling of the fword and isolastronger swearing ensures that this film should definitely not be mistaken for a familyfriendly film in the end wahlberg and kunis do not need to do a great deal and allowing themselves to be outacby a computergenerateddy bear in a predictable growingup plot line while slightly embarrassing for their cvs somehow does not detract from the overall appeal of the film there is something about the predictability and seeing the friendship endure between johnny and that is both enjoyable and somehow strangely comforting just like a teddy bear,comedy
most definitely has some laugh out loud moments and overall i enjoyed it sadly though there is an overabundance of scatological jokes and other offensive material while i am a woman with a sense of humour i found a lot of the lines to be outrageously sexist of course i dont take this movie seriously its about a talking teddy bear still though i think that seth mcfarlane has gotten a little out of hand there are some scenes that just made me ask why why did you have to cross that line those are scenes that i would skip over if i watched this again giovanni ribisi and the boy who plays his pudgy son are hilarious with their kathy bates in miserytype characters the sexscenes leave me perplexed because i do not understand how those acts are anatomically possible considering that one participant lacks the body parts necessary to engage in said act anyway this is a great movie to watch when you just wanna chill but seth mcfarlane has issues,comedy
the first thing that comes to my mind when i think of seth macfarlane is family guywell to start off i have to say that is amazing macfarlane does an amazing voice overthe jokes are the ones we find in family guyjust the only thing is that they do not contain any cutaway gagsmark wahlberg does an amazing job he carries the movie without any difficultymila kunis does an amazing job complimenting the other two actorsif i have to just summarize the movie i would say that the whole movie revolves around the friendship of these three actorssometimes though you get bored and you think that the story is just going nowhere but after a funny first half the story starts to take a turnwhich tests the friendships of all the three charactersso if i just have to say yes or no i would say that everyone should definitely go for the moviei give it 7 out of 10,comedy
creator of popular shows such as family guy and american dad seth macfarlane leaps on to the big screen with the comedy a young boys wish brings a teddy bear to life and an unbreakable bond between the two is formed however as they grow up life creeps in to their wholesome life as becomes a washed out child star while his friend played by mark wahlberg is in a job going no where the college mentality between the two friends puts a strain on wahlbergs relationship with the stunning mila kunis forcing him to make a tough choicemark wahlberg known more for his action and intense roles has transitioned in to comedy rather successfully and doesnt disappoint in this feature kunis tagged the sexiest woman alive by esquire has a long history of working with macfarlane and plays her role adequately as macfarlane will keep you laughing and all the 80s references are icing for those who remember that erawith a host of amusing cameos macfarlane hits another home run with this refreshing comedy that will undoubtedly spawn a sequel this is definitely worth a watch just make sure its without your kids,comedy
finally a comedy that i laughed out loud at more times than i can remember i cant remember a comedy this good since i love you man now for the criticisms although i felt the writing and the jokes were very funny it was the same story told a million times over the only difference was the substitution of a teddy bear in place of a real person mark wahlberg was good as usual i do like his work but as other people have said i was a little distracby his character being 35 when he clearly looks several years older than that im 34 myself so i should know just sayin the film may skew more towards the male audience with the humor and the lead male protagonist roles also i didnt find the film overly offensive the comic timing was good and the jokes were funny and not too over the top definitely american humor if that is up your alley anyway i have been putting off watching this film for a long time because i just found the premise weak and have been jaded by so many bad comedies releasing in recent memory but i finally watched and i wasnt disappoinbest comedy in a long time,comedy
a funny movie that will make you laugh like you never laughed before but why the answer is simple its because it managed to use something that youve always been attached to when you were a kid and twisthat a little to make something unique that thing is a teddy bear toy a teddy bear that talks you wont hold yourself laughing after hearing any word that is saying even if it wasnt funny its the idea of having a speaking toy that is funny yeah we could say the same thing about toy story as well but the argument here is that managed to bring in the reallife element into the story the story is still believable in every aspect you wont feel the fantasy behind it the character is part of our lives and the movie goes as far as even involving him in social and professional activities he is trealike a normal person just like me and you so when you see that on the screen and you start to comprehend the fact that he is just a soft toy thats when youll start laughing and laughing in summary is one of the funniest movies i would recommend to watch there are however some nudity scenes and excessive use of obscene language so parents should think twice before allowing their young children to watch the movie otherwise a great movie and a mustwatch 810,comedy
i am a big fan of seth mcfarlane therefore i had some idea what kind of humor might be in this movie it was accommodating with puerile humor mixed with very sophisticahumor and irreverence was the overriding tone as expecanyone who goes to this film expecting anything else is not realistic or knowledgeable that would be like going to a film by michael moore and then complaining that it is left leaningthe best way to describe this film is to call it the opposite of a chick flick but there were scenes of genuine emotion and tendernessthe lead character is so well realized that one almost forgets to even watch for the technical accomplishments the film is worth seeing on that basis alone,comedy
i do not watch family guy so i dont know what the maker of this film did before and i dont really care either this film taken stand alone was pretty entertaining now that doesnt mean it was great but for a hollywood comedy to not suck is already way above averagebesides look at that amazing cast doing this film just because it was fun to do so mark wahlberg i love him mila kunis who doesnt love her giovanni ribisi playing a really creepy guy patrick warburton who is always funny norah jones sam j jones flash gordon himself tom skerritt and the narrator is patrick stewartthe plot is rather silly and basic but the script is good with a lot of funny jokes and a light and careless feel i enjoyed this film and i was pretty sure i wouldnt glad i was wrong,comedy
i didnt have the chance to watch this movie when it was in theaters and i was pretty upset by it because i was rather curious i ended up watching it later and was deeply disappoinby itthe movie starts out alright for a comedy movie but about halfway down the line it starts going downhill it is like youre not even watching the same movie anymore theres a shifting in movie genres from comedy to action or romance i dont know the movie puts you in a good mood and then just ruins it by beginning to be awful all of the sudden its undeniable that you will laugh out loud a few times in the first part of the movie and for the rest of if youll just be wondering whether you starwatching another movie without realizing it i gave it a 6 because the first part is actually good if the whole movie was like the last part of it id rate it a lot lower,comedy
watched this last night on dvd is hilarious a pot smoking beer swilling foul mouthed teddybear howeverthe joke starts to wear thin during the first half of the movie which is essentially a series of set pieces for to show off his rudeness it was tempting to switch off in the first half but we stuck with it and it was worth it  in the second half the story kicks off and the laughs really begin with some wonderful cameos by norah jones especially ryan reynolds and othersthere are some big laughs in the movie and excellent acting by mark wahlberg and mila kunis whose love story is very well played as a backdrop to teds grossout humour we finished the film with a smile on our face and would rate it as worth a watch it isnt great but is good fun i too would caution parents that this is not for youngsters with pot smoking cocaine use a humping bear and some pretty bad language but it certainly has some laughs and if youre broadminded you will enjoy it,comedy
i was surprised over all the negative reviews of this movie i think it was quite funny  not a movie for the one thats easy offended though but it was clearly stafrom the early beginning and it indeed did have a lot of scenes where drugs where used if people would have taken some time to view the trailer and description they probably would have chosen another movie overall it was a great movie but you also need to have the right humor and mood to enjoy it all the way mark wahlberg did good and this is actually one of few comedies his in i usually see this guy in action and thriller movies but he did better here than expeci would definitely like to see him in some other comedy in the future instead of those bloody action films to summary this if you are in your early years and have good humor then go watch this movie you wont be as disappoinas the old men,comedy
is not your typical movie this much can be said about it but nor is it a movie that is so odd that it cant fit in any category is a comedy by seth mcfarlane direcby him and the main characters voice by him as well seth mcfarlane is the creator and executive producer of family guy among other cartoons for the fox network if you enjoy family guy then you will very much enjoy but lets start at the beginningis the story of a magic wish that happen on christmas day its very simple there was a lonely boy who got a teddy bear and he wanthat teddy bear to come alive and it did you would expect the teddy bear to grow up and be responsible and good citizen not this teddy bear not smokes pot swears drinks beer drinks alcohol and has sex with prostitutes he is irresponsible and basically holds back his best friend played by mark wahlberg to being a perpetual teenager pothead thrown into the mix is the longtime girlfriend of mark wahlbergs character john bennett she wants john to grow up and he wont with around so starts the story when after throwing a party with prostitutes is put in to his own apartmentbut this doesnt stop and john from hanging out every day and getting high off the pot so things go from bad to worse and lori johns girlfriend ends up leaving him thrown into the mix is an obsessivecompulsive fan that wants for his own and for his son does not end like you expecto but then again maybe it does ill let you watch the movie and you can find outso given all that but the movie is from seth mcfarlane and its rar who is this movie for obviously it is not for someone under the age of 13 even though given the character you might be tempto think so know this is an adult movie for someone 16 or older but given that it is an rramovie with lots of rrahumor it is still a smart movie in many ways hits on all eight cylinders when it comes to the story the pacing the jokes the inside jokes and overall script also the special effects of which 90 of the movie has in it which is because hes not real hes all computer animathis side of the movie is so seamless by the time the movie is over you almost believe that was a real character so given that gets 95 out of 10 enjoy the movie the dvd looks as great as the theatrical release and its even better with some added footage so enjoy yourself good night and good luck,comedy
seth macfarlene is a lover of old films and with this very modern style comedy he has tried to make references to old movies and they go well with this tale of comedy in our modern timesthe story for this film simply can only be described as impossible the film centres around john bennett mark wahlberg who when he was eight had a magical wish that brought his teddy bear to life cut 27 years later john is in a relationship with lori collins mila kunis but he still is best friends with seth macfarlene even though lori feels that john should ditch and finally grow up during this time we see teds fame has passed and he gets stoned a lot with john but also there are some other weird characters in the story that do some strange thingsthe film is like an extended version of the comedy styling seths tv shows are known for which did make me laugh at times but other times the comedy seemed to out there for me laugh along with which is usually what happens when i watch seths shows also i like how the film even with its real teddy bear did not skip over that detail by making the whole world accept him but they allowed him to be famous which was a smart idea to make this film seem more real the film did contain to many scenes that were not needed in the end because most of those scenes were just there for comedy and could have been cut to make the film move better also continuing plots just seemed to be done for comedic effect and did not translate well to a film that does not want to seem overly longmark wahlberg plays the older version of john and something i did not like about his performance was his accent maybe because i did not feel it was as believable as his previous attempts of the accent also mark for me does not have screen charisma that wants me to care for his performance which distracts me from the story of the film seth macfarlene is doing the voiceover for the teddy bear and sure he does have some funny moments but i was distracby mostly everything he said because the voice he used was similar to the voice of peter griffin on family guy which they also make a joke of in the film mila kunis who i have liked in previous film just was given nothing to do except be the complaining girlfriend which i think she deserves more then that because unlike the other main actors she actually has some talent the rest of the cast were forgettable supporting roles which just did not work for methe film was funny but unlike other comedies done in this style the characters in this film are not as well written that i actually feel for them when things happen to them i can see why some jokes were included but i felt a lot of them could have been cut and small cameos did not have to be the film because they were just there to try shock the audiencemovie grade c mvp seth macfarlene,comedy
tedit was goodit is typical toilet humour a lot of swearing getting high hookers etc basically it is what you would expect from seth macfarlane if you have seen family guythe movie is about a little boy who gets a teddy bear for christmas one year and wishes it would actually talk to him on the night he wishes for this a shooting star happens to shoot by in the sky the next morning the bear is alive 20 years later the bear and the boy have grown up and are partying hardthe bear actually looks real through the whole movie the effects are very good i didnt notice mark wahlberg talking to himself at all when he was talking to he was actually looking at himthere are some really funny moments in this movie most of which are in the trailer there are some other really funny parts that are not in the trailer though i was just hoping there would be more it is a laugh out loud comedy but there could have been more which i am hoping will be in 2 which i have read is going to be made soonthere are some great in jokes too as well as some retro tunes knight rider naming one and a classic guest star appearing in the form of mr flash gordon himself sam j jonesi will give this film 7 out of 10a very funny film but thought it was going to be funnier than it wasfor more reviews like my facebook pagehttpwwwfacebookcompagesordinarypersonmovie reviews456572047728204refhl,comedy
i starto watch this movie without knowing that set mc falrane from family guy was behind this i therefore didnt place any expectations with this movie in fact i wasnt even sure if the bear would be kind or more rude in the sense of pauls moviethis being said i discover the movie as it came and i must say that even thought it is not a glorious piece of comedy still it is a good movie mixing jokes with the questions relato our modernage adult who are sometimes still acting like kids after they passed the 30sthe family guy spirit is there a bit with teds comment but its time to time to my opinion and mark walberg play an average performance which leaves overall an ok experiencenot a super great movie but cool to watch especially if you lived during or like the 80s which are a constant reference in the moviei rate 7 as 75 is not available,comedy
i am very happy i saw this movieit is funny to be exact hilarious here is the story of a living teddy bear escaping an evil dad and son who are trying to capture and kidnap him one of the ending scenes really sets the whole movie off great effects but at the same time really emotional for example where fights to get away desperately climbing up a tower to escape the maniac chasing him if you want to just have a relaxing day with a movie this is my recommendation for youi give it a high overall 74 rating,comedy
i watched the movie without prior knowledge and the very beginning did not look promising but then with mark wahlbergs as grown up john bennett entrance the things changed and lots of fun and irony filled the screen the plot has its roots in romantic comedies and there are several relaclichs but used vocabulary and awkward supporting characters provide additional  and captivating  value in spite of overlay fun and hectic events there are serious topics in place including but not limito growing up letting go commitment love andversus friendship greed jealousy childhood influencesit took some time for me to recognize mark wahlberg as a gifactor  but i have admitit for a while and the movie in question is no disappointment in that respect in a convincing way he can be both a tough action man and a pleasant childish ordinary guy the director seth mcfarlane as is also sweet and funny mila kunis role has the most clichs but thanks to appearance and talent she does her part nicely and smoothly giovanni ribisi is an atypical actor who could be used more frequently soundtrack of the movie is wellpicked and good as well especially queen and nora jones queen is one of my most favorite bands and all respective references make my day  owing to the topics could easily be a family movie but due to strong language it has been raunsuitable for childrenteens in many countries so far it the highestgrossing original rracomedy of all time well done mr mcfarlane and your team,comedy
in his directorial debut seth macfarlane does not wander far from the family guy tropes that made him wealthy during a party montage the film even admits the voice macfarlane uses for mimics that he uses for the peter griffin character it is these montages and asides that are macfarlanes strong suit basically family guy is an referential and observational standup comedy routine held together with a nominal plot and their lack makes the film somewhat plodding macfarlane is forced to rely more so on plot which represents a challenge which he attempts by cobbling together a coming of age story about mark walbergs delinquent loser character and a talking teddy bear walberg feels much too put together to pull off the potsmoking middle aged delinquent and mila kunis is much too onenote to be of consistent interest the teddy bear character is just stupid and ultimately adds little to the proceedings a more conventional character couldnt have sufficed however some laughs pepper the overlong affair although they tend to be of the in december comes a very special day  the day the neighborhood kids beat up the jewish kid variety in short watching backepisodes of the show on hulu represents a better return on time,comedy
with macfarlane managed to create a tale that seemed to be child orienbut that is definitely for an adult audiencethe movie is riddled with references and parodies the dialogues fly and the caustic humor is enjoyable even though it is quite uneven qualitativelywhat can be blamed is the script being easy and nice enough with this bland love story which contrasts with the quirkiness of the movie macfarlane couldshould have really gone much further on that aspectthe direction is very good the teddy bear animation is topnotch and some scenes render very well like the fight at the hotel,comedy
is a teddy bear given to a lonely eight year old boy for christmas who wishes for the stuffed animal to be real well his wish comes true when begins to have human like conversations with the kid word spreads and becomes famous fame is fleeting and as we flash forward to the now thirty five year old john bennett who has remained best friends with the pot smoking foul mouthed bear the film becomes a fairly routine romantic comedy mila kunis is lori johns girlfriend of four years who has grown tired of john and teds sophomoric and immature antics she demands that he drop the sarcastic childhood toy and commit to her fully the predictable breakup occurs and a few mildly amusing scenes are used as filler including a funny one with the actor sam jones from the campy flash gordon movie from yesteryear mark wahlberg is easy going and he has good chemistry with kunis on screen the script is decent but nothing new or different other than the concept of a talking teddy bear i give it a 710,comedy
was a charming  quickwit hilarious film which is sure to keep you entertained with few comic scenes at bayjohn wishes for his teddy bear to come alive and his wish is granthe teddy bear becomes his best buddy since his childhood days eventually  john gets so attached to his best buddy that he never becomes serious in life which becomes a big hindrance for his girlfriend lori john must go through an acid test if he wants to choose between his girlfriend or best buddydirecby seth faclane sends a signal of the genre of the film from its trailer itself it is hilarious  spooky  funny which is full of quickwithumor and comic scenes right from the beginning  will give you dose of entertainment the chemistry between walhberg and teddy bear voiced by seth faclane himselfis great however i felt some scenes were weird and yucky as well which could have been avoided this is not a family entertainment at all mark walhberg was good and dependable as always seth faclane did a good a job both as director and as voice mila kunis was looking gorgeous if you need a high dose of entertainment is the right medicine for you good 35,comedy
i would like to preface this review by saying that i am not offended by anything and cannot think of anything that has ever offended me in a film before  except the scene at the end of hostel 2 you know the one  and so that perhaps factors into my love of this filmthe basic premise is that of a young boy aged 8 who gets a brilliant teddy bear for christmas and wishes that it could talk to him as he has no friends the wish comes true and is bornthe film takes place about 27 years later when and john have grown up and has become an irreverent crude and bloody hilarious character the voice acting by seth macfarlane is fantastic as always  huge family guy fan  and the boston accent is perfect the story is pretty basic and predictable but that is really irrelevant anyone who has watched family guy before will appreciate that the overall plot of the story is not important it only serves as a springboard to launch a series of hilarious and rude jokes off ofthe cameos by assoractors are great ryan reynolds rocks up as a silent gay dude and nora jones appears as herself the arrival of a much older flash gordon is also great an excuse for a brilliant party montageall told this movie really is not for everyone its not a classy or thoughtful movie its not the best acting in the world but it delivers on what i wana 2 hour long collection of awesome jokes and comedy loosely tied together with a predictable plot and a giant teddy bear as the main protagonist if you have a limisense of humor or take yourself your gender your race or your class too seriously then you will not enjoy this film a sad indictment on you and not this hilarious film,comedy
well since almost everyone i know had already seen this picture as it became very famous in brazil i decided to give it a chance as many people had advised me this is surely a very american comedy with some male chauvinist messages so if youre a woman you wont probably enjoy this as much as your boyfriend characters are well developed and it is good to see such a pretty woman in the main couple even thought story is at many times corny and you feel like its just another dumb comedy sometimes you have strong laughs such as the karaoke scene when sings only the vowels albeit only me and my friend laughed out loud in that cinema in the end i cant affirm this is a great movie because the story is pretty cheesy and sometimes ridiculous but if youre looking for free laughs this may be a good choice,comedy
this film is very funny and i didnt think it would have been as funny as it was the background of it is a little boy wishes on christmas that he had a talking teddy bear the animation of the bear is really really good you wouldnt no it is an animation it looks that real i would recommend this film to people who watch other stuff made by seth mcfadden like family guy and american dad sometimes when you hear talk you could hear some of the other voices seth mcfadden uses for family guy and american dad well thats what i thought but overall the film was good and i would highly recommend it to people i wouldnt say that people under the age rating should go watch this film because it contains some bad language,comedy
i was very reluctant to the thought of liking this movie after seeing previews hearing the general story and hearing a bunch of positive reviews this usually sets me up for a disaster and most people tend to like movies like that because others peer pressure them into doing so this one turned out to be great is a spin on the old boy with a teddy bear story a young boy with no friends gets a stuffed teddy bear for christmas and wishes it would become real so he could have a friend the wish is granvoiced by seth macfarlane is born and john bennett mark walhberg has a stuffed friend to hang out while he grows into a man child soon johns girlfriend lori mila kunis tires of the manbear relationship and the man and the bear may have to part ways in order for john to grow up and have a big boy relationshipthe good this is a comedy and a good one that doesnt pretend to be anything it is not the story is pretty much the same as any other romantic comedy but not one that bores a man to death the way most of the others do call it a mans romantic comedy the writing was great and there were some scenes that were hilarios many scenes in the beginning are what you would expect but combined with the musical score the corniness factor of the movie actually makes it more amusing this is not some super intelligent artsy comedy it is meant to be rude and crude and makes for one of those great guilty pleasure moviesthe bad i cant say a lot of real bad things mostly the bad part is just the fact that this is sort of a basic story line but then again for a mindless comedy it is not intended to have any deep meaning there is also a lot of vulgar language and references in this one so definitely put the kids to bed before watching sometimes a teddy bear just isnt for kids personally i didnt mind the profanity laced dialog but there are many that may be offended or it may not me their cup of teddy but hey if you like or can stand it go for it because this one is funi give it an 8 out of 10 the story is basic but has an original take it is mindless comedy fun and it has a lot of laughs it was one of the funnier movies i have seen in awhile although profane and vulgar at times it was well worth watchinglike my review hate em comments questions or want a dvd reviewed before you waste your time email me at  subliminallithiumgmailcom,comedy
as a fan of family guy and american dad and the 80s i was quite looking forward to this movie and i was interesto see if seth macfarlane could pull it off with 106 minutes of flesh  blood characters apart from tedwhat surprised me was that for his first film macfarlane chose to make an r raromantic comedy oh dear if you want a decent r raromantic comedy then go see the changeup with ryan reynolds and jason batemanif you take out the few brilliant moments of flash gordon airplane and the star wars references then what you got left is idiots saying nonsense a very mediocre and predictable comedynorah jones are you actually trying to put me to sleep in the words of gob bluth come ondislike romantic predictable drama booooringlike is that my ringtone oh yeah what is it cause it sounds negative no no no its from the notebooktom skerritt sam jones savior of the universe joel mchale ryan reynolds that took guts we need guts im promoting youso cut out all the relationshipdrama stuff and youve got a pretty good family guy episode just over 20 minutes,comedy
the story is about a talking teddy bear who has remained the best buddy of a 35 year old man from his childhood with the voice of seth macfarlane acts just like a funkiest person who always frenzies to make raw humor bake pots bang trollop crack out at party p it made me burst into laughs at its dialogues p in some scenes i really had to roll over my bed especially the best scene was that mila kunis grabbing hookers stinky feces from the floor mark wahlberg is grand at his comical functions while mila kunis does not appear as just smoke alarm as in previous movies being a very own closer being also draws some emotional setting in the script though that appropriate emotion is vividly missed at the end notwithstanding this blemish it was some topnotched entertainment for me and made me wish for a thunderbuddy also in my life p,comedy
the film is adorable because of the talking bear and this is alone a reason to watch it no need to go to the theaters the dvd will also give the same pleasure the story is average you should not expect anything more than laughter which for many is genuine the adult talk that he does in the entire film was hilarious the story is about a boy who wished for a talking teddy on a christmas night and he got it than starts a normal journey of a person who has this talking teddy ever since which makes him special nothing happening in his life is so interesting or worth watching but of course the teddy makes him interesting for most of the time it looked that the adult talks and funny moments were chunks in the film and were inserforcefully without actually making the film interesting but nevertheless those were laughable it seems like the director could not forget his 20 minutes south park episodes and was bound to insert these short clips at places without making much effort towards progressing the story never felt that i was watching a film it looked as if it was a number of pages of an adult comic book in the field of acting everyone performed very nicely and the voice of given by seth macfarlane was awesome mila kunis however didnt have much to showverdict a hilarious adult comedy film,comedy
this movie is not tedious this is pure fun  its a great and funny way of seeing life with different eyes it is like a connection between childhood and adulthood linked by great fun humor and criticism too those false moralists who piled tons of objections to it just didnt get the idea of the movie which is very original in its conception and performance is by far a great wake up call for all of those who carelessly waste their lives in a makebelieve fairy tale where everything is idealized sinless and pure the acid jokes the society criticism and the whole plot of the movie will lead you through a mishmash of sensations each will ironically put you to the test what have you done of your life  are you happy with it  these are questions the movie does not intend to answer but which are surely damn well right to be asked watch it and take your own conclusion,comedy
this film is about a man who is the best of friends with a talking teddy bearis an interesting comedy that tells the story of a man who is overattached to his teddy bear the teddy bear goes against all stereotypes as he indulges in sex alcohol and drugs the teddy is a cute transformation of a mans worst best friend derails all the good things in life that can happen to john leaving him with irresponsibility a lack of career and a failing relationship if was a human being then the film would not be half as interesting and entertainingmila kunis is very good as the girlfriend mark wahlberg shows much emotions towards her and they have good chemistry i think is an entertaining adult comedy,comedy
i was surprised that the makers put the credits at the beginning and at the end of the movie but then i realized how good this movie is when i saw the trailer i knew it would be great even though the main character is a teddy bear i wouldnt recommend it to a child the movie is full of jokes and i love itits easy recognizable that the movie was shot with a notsoperfect camera because its easy to spot such things nevertheless i love itrating 9109 just because of the camerak,comedy
say what you will about seth mcfarlane but the man can be really really funny you know when hes not shoving his liberal and atheist views down peoples throats and making you feel like an idiot if you dont agree with him i actually still do enjoy family guy even though its mostly hit and miss but when it hits it can be comedic gold american dad is still a damn good show and while i dont really watch the cleveland show anymore i didnt think it was awful it just got old really fast so his first movie could either be really funny or really annoing thankfully i found myslef laughing quite a bit in this filmwhile it does have some jokes that follow the family guy formula of going on for a little too long and the plot itself is nothing really knew in fact being a teddy bear didnt really affect the story as much as you would think it comes up a few times but for the most part it could just be a normal person and there wouldnt be much of a difference plus theres a couple of dry spots where theres way too much talking and drama and not enough comedybut did i laugh oh yes i did i laughed at almost every joke in this film with either a laugh out loud or a small chuckle himself is actually a pretty likable character yeah he can be a bit of a slacker but he has a good heart and the cgi work on him is really good i like how it turned a few clichs on their heads like making you think that it was going to go in that way and then explain why that wouldnt work but like i said the main reason to watch this is just because its funny sure this comedy may not appeal to everyone but to me i laughed quite oftenis easily one of the best comedys of the year if you dont like seth mcfalanes style of comedy you wont like it but even if you felt family guy is completely awful now you may be surprised by this film,comedy
yeah i admit it im into family guy on top of that i admired markymarks upper bod in feel the vibration and ive been following his rise as an average joe character on the big screen over the last ten or so years rock star invincible the departhe fighter are all some of my fave films and marky sure did a fine job in em admittedly ive done my best to keep from watching the loser movies mr wahlberg has done to pay the rentduesfavors but have watched four brothers and the other guys hey a guys gotta watch some crap to get some know what im sayin in those crap movies it wasnt markys acting that was at fault ill leave it at that back to its a nice mix of msr wahlberg playing straight man to the voice of seth mcfarlane in the body of a teddybearcome to life asxmas miracleturned drunken loud mouth perv with a heart and if thats saying a mouthful just wait til you hear the bear go on and on itll make you want to get him a paci or at least a personalsized melon if your girl aint into crass do yourself a favor and beg for a boys night otherwise you might not get any for a while,comedy
is a really funny film that could have been brilliant if there were more laughs in it mark wahlberg was absolutely the right guy for this film he is definitely at his best when he is in comedic roles not necessarily in comedy films and he carried this film better than anyone else could have mila kunis was really funny in this but her character held her back a bit she could have been a lot better if the script hadnt stopped her seth macfarlanes voice performance was really funny though he was pretty much just playing peter from family guy in a bear form there was a lot less cameo roles than i expechere but the ones from sam j jones and the delightful little one from ryan reynolds were really funny lets not forget the hilarious narration from patrick stewart who is just brilliant despite only saying a few sentences at the beginning and ending the script was really funny despite the story outline being kind of basic the jokes the insults and the dialogue were fantastic seth macfarlane has definitely excelled here with this script i really hope he goes on to write more films after thisoverall if you love family guy american dad etc then you should love this its the same type of humour and is arguable just a giant episode of these but it is still as funny if not more it was still missing something however the jokes were spread throughout the film meaning you werent laughing nonstop,comedy
when my brother walked into our local multiplex two weeks ago to see he thought it was going to be a disney film i can tell you now that is many things a charming fantasy about a boys christmas wish coming true a bromance and an anti romcom but it is most definitely not a disney filmcomedy isnt a film genre that i like to gamble my money away on very often in fact the last comedy i saw on the cinema was tropic thunder back in 2008 however id read and heard nothing but praise for seth macfarlanes featurelength directorial debut and had unlike my brother watched a few episodes of family guy so i went in with relatively high expectations  and deliveredthe film begins with mark wahlbergs outcast character john bennett when young making a christmas wish that his teddy bear will come to life sure enough he wakes up the next morning to a walking talking bear named macfarlane who immediately professes his eternal friendship to john you have to suspend your disbelief a fair bit just is just go with itfast forward a quarter of a century and john and are best pals of the simon peggnick frost ilk spending most of their time watching flash gordon smoking cannabis or something and generally enjoying a life of zero ambition and responsibility their carefree existence is threatened however when johns girlfriend mila kunis her patience having been pushed to the brink gives him a simple ultimatum or her throw in a very creepy giovanni ribisi who plays the villain and what has to be one of the best cameos ive ever seen from sam j jones and youre left with a highly entertaining filmsucceeds where so many comedies fail in that its crammed full of quality jokes that make you laugh as well as moments that might  just might  bring tears to your eyes the premise is amusing enough on its own without macfarlanes brilliant oneliners the edgy sexual humour and eclectic pop culture references in addition to sam j jones there are surprising cameos from actors like tom skerritt and hilarious deadpan narrative interludes by patrick stewart all of which combine to give an apparent seal of approval from hollywood itself either that or seth macfarlane just has friends in high placesbizarre is a fitting word to sum up true its a little formulaic in places  and increasingly so towards the end  but the overall sense of randomness is what youll hopefully walk away with whether its the films silky soundtrack or its many homage sequences oozes with the maturity of a more experienced director as youd expect from anything seth macfarlane touches most of the comedy crosses a lot of lines which will undoubtedly offend some viewers but this gives a competitive edge over less risqu films in my opinion its strange to think that grossout vulgarity can have a place in a genuine and touching tale of unbreakable friendship theres just something refreshing about a film that sets itself no limits in terms of what it can and cant do to show you a great timeas for performances macfarlane clearly steals the show but wahlberg and kunis more than hold their own in his presence its perhaps a rather introverperformance marky mark gives but this suits both the film and his characterwhen i got home after watching i felt somehow corrupby that teddy bears playful influence  but in a good way this expressed itself in my shoddy parking job on the driveway perhaps we all need a in our lives fluffy physical manifestations of our ids that only want us to have funthe only reason why i havent awarded full marks is because  just like an episode of family guy  i dont think i would enjoy the jokes as much second time around this is an inherent flaw of the comedy genre as a whole though not a specific criticism of macfarlanes film which is by far the funniest ive seen in ages,comedy
the storytelling opening genuinely invite audience to the fantasy of making the rest of the film very relaxing to watchthe film is given life by the witty touch with the combination of cg figureand familyguystyle jokes its awkwardly funny watching a cute fuzzy teddy bear cursing in a mans voice the change of teds voice in different life stage interestingly legitimized the peter griffins voice when is 25the only thing i disliked was the presence villain fatherandson contribute little to the comprehensiveness of the plot all it did was making the film going to the path of disneystory good thing they didnt appear for very long time in the moviefeminine readers should not expect too much the film would probably be logically more popular among men than women because of the masculine style of playwriting surrounding two men technically a man and a bearhowevery one could never be too serious watching seth marcalanes production its obvious that he is intensionally dirty and maybe telling us something deeper than it superficially seems,comedy
i had been looking forward to ever since i saw the first trailer not just because it was from the creator of family guy but also because the concept was freaking genius its basically a parody of pinocchiothe nutcracker it tells what happens when a kid grows up with his living toy glad toy story 3 didnt turn out like thisis a very funny movie very few of the jokes fall flat and while i personally prefer the dictator as the comedy of the year is basically a better movie in the dictator a few of the jokes fell flat and some of the characters where overshadowed by general admiral aladeen in however most of the characters that are supposed to be funny are funny and not just and the actual story is much better than in the dictator so while i personally prefer the dictator this movie is betteralso doesnt have any jokes that fall flat but the reason its not as funny as the dictator is because it doesnt have any truly brilliant jokes its just great comedy all the wayill stop comparing it to the dictator now i personally enjoyed how the movie developed its own story rather than being just a comedy about the bear being all rude and peter griffin ish it starts off as a dilemma for the main character to choose between his beautiful girlfriend and his best teddy bear friend but quickly develops into a more emotional story that i wont spoil but im glad it developed itself like that it made it much more excitingthere are very few problems with its just that its not as funny as a 910 comedy would be such as the dictator it doesnt have any oh my god thats a joke ill remember for decades to comemoments its just a great comedyis a great movie its got a great sense of humor good characters a good story for its genre and a touching finale,comedy
i was a big admirer of the tv programme family guy during its initial seasons precancellationresurrection however i later starto loose the taste in it due to the repetitive style from its creator seth macfarlane full of incongruent flashbacks and bizarre references which sometimes sacrifice the integrity of the characters or the stability of the story now in his debut as a film director and coscreenwriter macfarlane found a good balance between both extremes of the humor complementing the comic asides with interesting characters and a screenplay which is kinda predictable but well handled in its structure and feelings sure there are pretty much opportunities of displaying the characteristic vulgar and politically incorrect humor from family guy but ended up being a pleasant surprise because of its narrative care and emotional warmthbig part of the humor from consists of the contrast of seeing a teddy bear a traditionally childish and innocent figure enjoying his numerous vices and behaving as a vulgar and irresponsible lout the joke functions on the beginning look at the bear smoking weedlook at the bear hiring hookerslook at the bear seducing the dumb blonde but it quickly wears fortunately this film isnt only based on that and it offers us much more things to make us laugh and keep our interest in the two main characters adventures to start with mark wahlberg and the bear brilliantly brought to life by macfarlanes voice have a perfect chemistry with each other and their conversations are full of funny details not always because of what they say but because of how they say it the bromance between man and bear feels sincere and even though the existence of a harmful codependence is obvious the genuine affection they have with each other is undeniable as well as the support they bring to each other when they need it the most besides we have the previously mentioned humorous flashbacks and unexpecreferences which go from the obvious hes still a better singer than katy perry to the complex such as the satire inside a satire which combines airplane with saturday night fever without forgetting the obligatory winks to star wars and the unexpecdevotion to a certain scifi film from the 80s i really enjoyed seeing honoredmila kunis character is written more as a mesh of the narrative than as a real person but her natural charm rescues the character and she brings a totally honest work during some touching dramatic moments the special effects are perfectly made not only bringing the teddy bear to life but also making his interaction with the real world completely credible the scene in which we see him fighting is very funny but what drew my attention the most was the perfect integration between 3d practical effects and filmed footage a truly excellent work from the tippet studio in order to sell us a digital character we never see as a mere special effect on the negative side from i can mention the unnecessary final action sequence i understand the necessity of introducing a danger element and an emotional catharsis to impulse the characters and take them to a satisfactory not necessarily happy conclusion but it feels a bit forced specially because the arbitrary antagonist was obvious from almost the beginning of the film nevertheless i recommend as a very entertaining adult comedy which balances vulgar humor with interesting characters and credible situations yes despite including a magical teddy bear macfarlanes style is present from the beginning to the end and i liked to see that his talent goes beyond than laughing at director george lucas or obsessively satirizing 80s icons i will expect his following films with interest and i think i will even give another chance to family guy in order to see how many other elements from modern culture have fallen under his sharp satirical scalpel,comedy
of course this is not aimed at kids i just thought that summary line was funny this movie actually does one thing right some other movies fail to do it stays consistent from start to finish and that on a really good level of entertainment kudos to the director also the voice of in the movie for mastering thisnow as you can tell by the trailer this is a really insane comedy outrageous and crazy would be two other adjectives you could describe it with foul language and crude humor should be your thing if you want to watch this and enjoy it if you havent seen the trailer and you dont want too many story spoilers just search for thunder song and watch that little snippet from the movie if that makes you laugh you will love the movie one other thing i took from watching this so this is where we draw the line something everyone can use to good effect  o,comedy
is a film thats filled with ribaldry and gloriously unpc pop culture references its also handy that the marketing never made it out to be anything other than dumb if you were a dissatisfied audience member who was expecting a movie starring a talking teddy bear to be deep then i dont know what to tell youi dont think its a big surprise that people who are huge fans of family guy are more likely to enjoy this than those who arent most of family guys jokes are lazy too but in general theyre funny anyway because theyre semitopical and delivered well not all humour has to be clever in order to amuse maybe there were a few epic movie type jokes where a random reference is thrown in for no bigger reason than a surprise laugh but they were carried off with a lot more style and context than friedberg  seltzer manage not every joke can be right on target but i thought that there were more hits than misses and you soon forget the bad ones if youre laughing at the shots that struck home a couple of the movie references did annoy me though being almost shot for shot and really unimaginative there was no need to spell out the second aliens joke for example  it would have been far funnier for a savvy audience to need to work it out by themselves but i laughed long and loud at other parts of the movie so im prepared to forgive the odd moment that fell flat they cant all be winners overall its a fun time at the movies provided you have an inkling that macfarlanes style of humour is your cup of tea,comedy
first things firstthe concept of is completely ridiculous that being saidis also completely hilarious writerdirectoractor seth macfarlane best know as the creative force behind the tv animahits family guy american dad and the cleveland show brings the same kind of humor to his feature film debut jokes that offend everyone from all walks of life and expecand deliveredalthough is a walking talking teddy bear macfarlanes script keeps the story grounded in the real world which actually makes it more realistic and believable then the recent comedy duds thats my boy and the dictatormark walhberg the fighter boogie nights and mila kunis black swan friends with benefits form a strong basis for macfarlane to bring the cuddly little peter griffinesche title character to life and major props have to go to giovanni ribisi playing the awesomely creepy stalker who plots to steal away for his own son his gutbusting scene where he sexually dances by himself in front of his tv to a 1980s debbie gibson music video while drinking apple juice through a straw is one of the funniest in recent memoryparents bewareif for some reason you think this would be a funny movie to bring the kids tothink again curses like a sailor smokes pot and bangs hookers if this seems like a movie you want to enjoy with your children then the parent of the year award went out the window for you a long time ago if you dont let your kids watch family guy then you wont want them to see tedif anyone could make a funny movie out of a teddy bear that has come to life im glad it was macfarlane who attempand not someone at the disney cheese factory now that he has a taste at feature films its excito see what he will come up with nextfor more quick reviews check out wwwfilmstallioncom,comedy
as the result of a childhood wish john bennetts teddy bear came to life and has been by johns side ever since  a friendship thats teswhen lori johns girlfriend of four years wants more from their relationship lets see for me it was a good movie  funny the bear was so cuteawwthe only bad thing for me was that it was very vulgar  full of dirty humor not really my style but if youre into that youll love it a littles ok for me but when you have so much it becomes stupid  raunchy in my opinion  no longer funny it does feature drug use but then again you could find that in a wide variety of movies not to mention tv shows so thats almost the norm there are some pretty funny cameo appearances too,comedy
the problem with this film is that it sets itself up to be a pastiche on a childrens story which is aimed at adults by the end of the film however it feels as though the producers are patronising its audience having forced them to sit through 100 minutes of recycled unoriginal and highly formulaic ideassure there are a lot of laughs to be had along the way but its not long before we start to see the characters develop in to their hollywood stereotype kunis starts off funny and cute before quickly descending in to a wining selfish stereotype who wants wahlberg all to herself the latter generally mopes around like a sad looking monkey in the last half of the film whilst also managing to overegg it in the firstthere are lots of family guy references throughout which do work well in live action although they lack the sublime ridiculousness the cartoon format can bringoverall the film lost its way half way through which was a shame as the great cgi could have really made this one something to remember for years to come,comedy
you know the story the erstwhile marky mark and his talking teddy this is so bad it makes mad mel and his glove puppet look like laurel and hardy it might have been better had the bear given a better voice as is it sounds like one of those guys on tv selling cars from their own lot mark wahlberg has come a long way but if he sticks to comedy hes not going to go much further lets just say is timing his awry though it does help if the joke are funny mila kunis looks lovely as his main squeeze but having appeared in the robot chicken tv series shes in danger of getting typecast forget the bear angle which youll soon do anyway and what youre left with is a crude obnoxious jock in a film with no other narrative,comedy
let me start this by saying i dont really like seth macfarlane despite the fact that i enjoy family guy a whole lot i really dont like the man as i feel he has a certain arrogance which really made me not want to see this film but i did anywaylet me start off my commenting on the animation of it was brilliant it was totally believable that he was there and his interaction with mark wahlberg and other actors was great his voice didnt distract me as much as i thought it would as i was too into the animation of to really caremark wahlbergs performance was great and to me it was the best thing about the film his character is very likablesome of the jokes were quite good especially when they introduce the villain no comment as he is extremely funny and his interaction with is even funnierthe film wasnt as raunchy or rude as it was made out to be and to be fair doesnt even take drugs as much as you would think some of the time its a feel good comedynow lets talk about the bad partsi didnt like this movie but i didnt hate it either sometimes the jokes fall very flat and sometimes there are references that the audience in my screening did not get especially when theres a small reference to airplane sometimes the film felt too family guyesqueto cut it short it was enjoyable but its a film i wish i didnt pay to see in the cinemasfinal verdict if youre a fan of family guy and is happy to see a film by seth macfarlane see it even if youre not a fan youd probably enjoy itbut i would probably just wait for the dvd,comedy
seth mcfarlane has a great idea for a story about a little boy who wishes that his teddy bear might come to life this happens and all is well with the worldbut what happens when the boy grows up and his teddy still wants to be his best friend it turns out that and john mark wahlberg are still living together along with johns girlfriend lori mila kunis and they like nothing better than drinking and getting highlori keeps reminding him that he has to get away from and start acting like a grown up it takes most of the movie for this to sink in with john but there are some funny scenes in the meantimeit stretches disbelief more than a little that wahlbergs underachieving character could be going out with a mila kunis lookalike for four years but he is a talencomic actor so he just about gets away with itthere some funny scenes as the obnoxious struggles to start a life on his own mcfarlane also throws in a lot of trademark edgy oneliners mostly spoken by tedhowever the movie does drag a lot and an unnecessary gets kidnapped plot line makes this even worseperhaps best saved for a dvd rental,comedy
is the best movie of all time why well here we go seth macfarlane the genius guy that creathe legendary family guy with a sense of humor that blew everyone away he also creaamerican dad and the cleveland show and in these three shows he voices multiple characters with very different voices and hes just amazing seth decided to bring his enormous talent to the big screen is macfarlanes first motion picture where he takes care of the directing the writing and voicing the hilarious teddy bear in the end of the year people will think what was the best movie of 2012 some will say the dark knight rises some will say the hobbit some will say the avengers some will say 21 jump street and some others some others like me will say is a fantastic mash of one of my favorite tv shows family guy sense of humor with a very smart plotjohn is an 8 year old kid with no friends at all one christmas his parents give him a teddy bear he wishes for him to come alive that wish comes true and 27 years later john wahlberg and macfarlane are still best friends they live together and their favorite hobby is smoking pot and watching flah gordon but johns girlfriend lori kunis wants them to move on with their lives and get out of the house john and teds friendship will be testedno one would not like to see a movie which concept is about a talking teddy bear that swears all the time smokes pot and has sex with lots of women including norah jones macfarlane used family guy humor in here my favorite type of humor and it worked even better in here cause he made this movie rar restricand that way he could go even further with the dirty and politically incorrect humor in this movie we even see a grown man punching a young kid and only a macfarlane project could have that he brought other things from his show like mila kunis meg patrick warburton joe and alex borstein and they were all very well used now lets talk about the cast which was a very solid element of the movie mark wahlberg was a superb choice he keeps surprising me since the other guys i knew he was amazing with comedy and in here he was terrific he just had to make his bostonian accent have more encases and he had a great performance where he fires off jokes all the time mila kunis my favorite actress was also a perfect choice to be the mature of this weird trio she was very good here and she was also pretty funny and seth macfarlane is also amazing voicing making a voice that sounds a little like peter griffins voice mashed with brian griffins voice and the movie also had amazing cameos the jokes well let me put it this way is probably the most hilarious movie ive seen its a laughaminute movie and each joke is hilarious and im a person that usually doesnt feel comfy at laughing at a theater in front of everybody but this time i couldnt help it and although it wasnt that loud i did laugh a lot and if i was at home the windows would break botttom line is if you love family guy and macfarlanes humor youll love its a heart warming and also raunchy hilarious movie that i just loved well let me say it again is the best movie of all timefrank you think you got what it takesill tell you what i gotyour wifes pussy on my breath frank nobody has ever spoken to me like that before thats because their mouths were full of your wifes box frank youre hired sht,comedy
this movie was hilarious but it slowed down of course was the life of the movie mila kunis wasnt bad either mark wahlberg did a pretty good job if you watch this movie there will be a lot of laughing some of it is stupid funny and some of it is legit funny i would recommend going to see it in theaters or waiting till it came out on dvd it really is no difference it is kind of immoral to have a teddy bear acting the way it did but thats what makes it funny you will laugh you will be close to tears because you are sad but it is a good movie all in all i was originally going to wait till it came out to dvd to watch it but now im fine with having seen it in the movies and i will buy the dvd,comedy
funny idea funny movie the idea to have living teddy bear is grandiose more than this its awesome since the childhood its the dream of every man to have a living teddy bear well you could ask now is this guy serious oh yeah iam serious just imagine the idea that your best friend is really taking part in your whole live even though the movie has a great idea behind and the story is quite funny the idea sometimes lacks on new ideas so the first half of the movie is more than less the same however i can really suggest to watch the movie together with friends the movie would fit great in a movie night with hangover and crazy race though,comedy
i hemmed and hawed for five minutes before going in to see this movie i hadnt heard anything about it and the poster made it look like a childrens movie however i didnt want to wait too long for the next film and i noticed seth macfarlane had direcit  so i took the plungefor the first 20 minutes i was worried i had made a mistake the only other person in the theatre was a kid then the movie took a strange direction and gradually morphed into a family guy kind of film it took me a few years to warm to family guy but im at the point now where the oddball humour entertains me somewhat and there are times when the show is brilliant especially in scenes involving the stewie character im afraid however that i did not really fully appreciate most of the writing and humour in this film i just didnt find it that witty or funny the gratuitously offensive jokes and the toilet humour fell flat for me it was supposed to be irreverent but much of it just seemed stupid perhaps i was in the wrong moodhowever i did enjoy the original premise at the core of the movie once i accepits lack of realism and some of the gags that arose out of it i was also impressed at the technical wizardryi had problems with the casting of mark wahlberg as john bennett im a fan but he is too old too hot and too worldly to play a 35 year old loser i dont see him as the peter pan figure that the script calls for in general i didnt really appreciate this characters quirks it was forced wahlberg pulled it off i suppose he has a wider range than people give him credit for i saw lori played by mila kunis as just being annoyingly demanding i thought that wahlberg and kunis were a hot couple but they were in the wrong roles and the wrong movie together giovanni ribisi was good as alwaysi was put off by the constant drug and alcohol indulgences of and john i mean look at what john looks like this is a guy who would be into the gym and into his healthi am not quite sure how a young teenager could be allowed into the theatre to see this film im not a prude but i suppose there are no age restrictions anymore a lot of the material and language in the movie seemed inappropriate for children especially the antisemitic and homophobic humourif you really enjoy family guy i think you might enjoy this film though,comedy
when i first heard about it was a few years back and i was looking forward to it because of macfarlane eventually i heard it was moving up from july 13th to june 29th and i was even more excibut when i saw it i gotta say i was a little disappoini had been waiting so long for this movie to come out it was a decent movie but not too funny most of the funny stuff came from obviously the rest was just kind of bad even mila kuniss acting was kind of overacin my opinion overall i guess it was okay but not really too great you should see it if you like comedy but if you want something more seriousgood you should see something like tdkr or tasm it wasnt too bad and id definitely watch again but maybe renting it or wait till its on tv a lot of the jokes are just flat something i wouldnt expect from the guy who creaamerican dad also mark and mila have no chemistry at all so its kind of awkward watching them together not really too much of a problem though overall 610,comedy
if you like seth macfarlane humour youll like this film simple as thatin his first feature film mark wahlberg plays john bennett at a time in his life when his childhood friend creates a rift between john and his girlfriend played by mila kunis theres no cinematic risks taken just seth macfarlane humour with attempts at being touchingthe jokes are spread wide with modern jabs and many throwbacks some hit hard some dont and some i found to go too far one 911 joke is horribly distastefulthe film overs many cameos of varied success levels probably a product of the macfarlane namewhile acting isnt the draw here everything is sufficient and giovanni ribisis creepy dad character is hilarious and steals his scenescan be a fun film if you let it most people probably are less sensitive than i when it comes to potty humour also theres a fair sized twist at the end but its funny that the i do what i want macfarlane cant stick to his guns with it6510,comedy
at the end john and his wife will marry at a church where they dont have any respect for godsam jones alias flash gorson had to be the priestso he dont have nothing to do with godand at that church 2 homosexuals have a kiss togetheri observed that many american movies parodies weddings which are a mystery of god who deserved to be respectedso seth macfarlane gives people a very bad example for doing this scriptmark wahlberg who think he is a religious man is a bad example for the kids from nowadaysi dont know why he accepto do a movie like this with so much dirty jokes and filthy language and even worse bad jokes about gods churchhow to face his mother after doing thishow to enter in a church after he made bad jokes about godhe dont realize he will pay on life after death for doing thisthe movie is alrightis very entertaining but is a bad bad example for our youthlets hope that seth macfarlanemark wahlberg will clear their minds,comedy
is a pretty funny movie but it is by no means justified a rating in the high 7s going by what other comedies are rathis deserves a 62 or so it is of course predictable and it makes you laugh out loud for about 15 minutes or so what makes a great comedy to me it is having classic lines that you and your friends will be talking about for years thats what happened with wedding crashers old school happy gilmore etc this isnt in the league of those and therefore i would like to see its rating settle down in the 6s imdb seems to have every other genre of movies racorrectly outside of comedy i dont see why people have such differing opinions and senses of humor,comedy
this movie surprised me and exceeded my expectations this movie is direcwritten produced and co starred by seth macfarlane and while family guy may have been new and fresh and creative at one time it certainly hasnt been as good today so i figured since this movie was about a bear and a 35 year old man mark whalberg hanging out there would be random cut away scenes characters that you see in family guy played in here stereotypical characters and i figured this movie would be taken way too seriously but no theres only like two cut away scenes the characters are actually in some ways relatable and it didnt take itself to seriously it knew there story was stupid and ludicrous and i wont say they treait like one but they knew what to put in and what not to put in i was also surprised of how funny it was there were some of the usual jokes to pop culture and a few other things they make fun of in family guy but they put a twist on it and made it hilarious mark whalberg mila kunis and seth macfarlance were all great in there roles patrick warburton joe in family guy has a bit part ryan reynolds made a surprise appearance and flash gordon the real flash gordon was in this film it was a raunchy comedy that was filled with laughs all the way through it through in some annoying cliques and the whole kidnapping thing was unnecessary some of the jokes were a little to over the top or felt forced in but again its a comedy just for teens and adults and they treat it like one with no limitations like they have with family guy on fox it was funny fun and an enjoyable movie currently out in theaters see it,comedy

glowing reviews are no predictor of a movie experience i had hoped the movie would be enjoyable and though was endearing and had s lot of funny one liners the rest of the movie was an ordeal mark wahlberg has as much aptitude for light comedy as sylvester stallone while mila kunis begs to be pimp slapped mainly because shes so mean to if youre going to be a raunchy comedy stick to the sleaze dont put in a feel queasy love story thats so unbelievable even the actors arent convinced the whole premise of the story is kunis lori wants wahlberg john to marry her because theyve been dating for 4 years wahlberg finally agrees but then mila adds the stipulation he must get rid of the bear so for four years mark is happy with his situation but when he finally reluctantly agrees to marriage he suddenly thinks its a good idea to ditch his best friend too that plot was stale 50 years ago with good actors but falls completely apart with these hacks the nadir of the movie was a flashback to how the two met featuring a disco scene copied verbatim from the movie airplane how can you plagiarize something so well known and not get slapped by any reviewers collective amnesia is rampant that said was funny likable and completely believable cgi if only mark and mila were cgi theyd have something,comedy
the movie storyline is really predictable and boring which ruins the movie for me i was expecting this but i thought it would still be a funny movie it was alrightdid do some funny things and he was a good character but it was all the same material be used over and over again from family guy mark wahlberg and mila kunis both did a great job acting their parts and seth macfarlane puts the computer generaimage to life the movie would of been better with a more dicey script and not having the only amusing part of the film overall i was pretty disappoinwith the movie but there were a few mildly humorous parts that made me not give it a horrible review,comedy
you want bear puns look no further thankfully though the humour in is somewhat more refined for most tv show creators the opportunity to translate their talents to the big screen comes with a license to push boundaries in new and exciting ways not available through the medium of television for seth macfarlane creator of the outrageously outrageous family guy and ridiculously underraamerican dad it must have just felt like another day at the office john bennett mark wahlberg is the loneliest kid in boston while the other children engage in unique christmas traditions john spends his days inside wishing for just one friend on christmas day that wish comes true in the form of the stuffed bear macfarlane who is magically transformed into a living being the miraculous story of which spreads like wildfire across the country fastforward nearly thirty years and teds fame has longsince vanished he and john now spend their days getting high watching bad movies and managing johns relationship with lori mila kunisas if to state the painfully obvious the amount of fun to be had with this film is heavily influenced by how familiar one is with macfarlanes comedic style each of his animacreations employ sharp oneliners bizarre set pieces and a ton of pop culture references all of which are prominent in naturally the humour is all sorts of politically incorrect with jokes ranging from drugs to sex to september 11 highlights include teds job interview at the local supermarket patrick stewarts narration and a house party with sam jones star of and johns favourite film of alltime flash gordonit is made clear by the closing credits where the bulk of the effort went into making this film as most jokes hit resulting in an array of instantly quotable material making it difficult to watch without a perpetual smile on your face with so many references to popular culture jampacked within two hours most international viewers are likely to misunderstand jokes about tom brady pepperidge farm and those promiscuous bahstan gahls but the film does more than enough to keep all viewers chuckling throughoutthe motioncapture argument typically begins and ends with andy serkis the lord of the rings rise of the planet of the apes and deservedly so but an honourable mention must go to this films visual effects team for the creation of who both voiced and controlled by macfarlane looks about as close to believable as can be the film tends to cruise in areas not pertaining to straightout comedy which may be a direct side effect of macfarlanes first outing in the directors chair the plot has been done literally thousands of times before and the character arcs established early leave the viewer in no doubt as to where the movie is heading to the extent that once you take away the fact that is not human it starts to look a lot more like every deliberately offensive romcom ever regardless the film refuses to take itself too seriously with plenty of tensionbreaking jokes that along with a multitude of alist cameos work a whole lot better than would appear on paperbegins to deviate from its comedic roots just slightly during the climax set afterhours inside fenway park just out of shot david ortiz socking a few dingers but it does allow for an epilogue that at least temporarily strikes the audience offguard by neatly showcasing the charming bond formed between a man and his bear indifferent viewers will enjoy without differentiating it from most other contemporary comedies while fans of the directors prior work are likely to draw a lot more enjoyment out of every scenetheres nothing i love more than a bit of feedback good or bad so drop me a line on jnatsisiprimuscomau and let me know what you thought of my review if youre looking for a writer for your movie website or other publication id also love to hear from you,comedy
being a fan of other work by seth macfarlane i was expecting nothing less than edgy i was not disappoinalthough a first see is great this requires a repeat or two to appreciate all the nuances and details crafinto this piecethis not for the weak or fragile step up or step back simple as that that being said the ability of the actors to interact with an imaginary lead character requires immense skill conversationally and physically the hotel fight scene is a great exampleyou will love this or it will shock you hopefully both enjoycheers,comedy
parents dont give this movie a low rating cos youre dumb enough to take your kids to see it i just returned from seeing and was bemused that so many parents took their kids just because the main character is a teddy bear doesnt make it appropriate for children those parents were probably the kids that were taken by their parents to see childs play because its main character was a doll its rar for a reasonanyway is an adult movie suitable only for adults and it was hilarious wahlberg  kunis were great together but they were in supporting roles to seth macfarlanes ted,comedy
i saw with my mom the day it came out but wasnt expecting much what i got was one of the funniest movies i have seen in awhile and i really enjoyed itseth macfarlane is hilarious and did a very good job with the movie mark wahlberg also did a great job and played his part welli will buy this movie for sure and i am thinking about seeing it again in the theaterit might not be a good movie to see with kids but it is a good movie to see with older family members for a good laugh and a fun timei gave an 8 out of 10joe,comedy
while there really isnt anything wrong with there isnt anything that great about it either for his first film seth macfarlane did a good job but hes still got a lot to learn as a director the film feels very much like his material and some scenes felt exactly like a live action episode of family guy mark wahlberg did a good job in his role and macfarlane and i really enjoyed the character of he really carries the movie and the scenes without him on screen really seemed to go by a bit slow as for the comedy in the film there are plenty of funny scenes but most of them deliver on a level of chuckles instead of big laughs thats not to say the film doesnt deliver some laughs at points but not as many as it should the one thing that did kinda bug me about this film was its constant references to the 80s some of them such as the references to flash gordon were funny but the film relied way too heavily on them and some of them felt forced i also felt the film was a bit too long and couldve easily been 15 minutes shorter overall isnt as good as it couldve been but there really isnt anything wrong with it that will keep you from enjoying it either its much better than the new episodes of family guy but theres much funnier films that have come out this year such as 21 jump street,comedy
i went into this film with much trepidation considering it emanafrom the mind of seth mcfarlane the creator of family guy a once hilarious animaprogram that has since become nothing but a leftwing propaganda piece with mcfarlane himself nothing more than a shill for the democratic partyeven trying to atone himself with american dad and the cleveland show earned less than stellar repentance points still not one to prematurely judge i tramped to the screening with a somewhat open mindand to my pleasant surprise i really enjoyed this comedy based on no small part much of the earlier family guy vibes in short this is one of the few comedies released in the past few years that will make you laugh it ill make you laugh out loud in some spots and with so many unfunny movies disguised as comedies being released today this earns my solid recommendationin a spirit of generosity mcfarlane also gives employment to many of his television show staff including mila kunis voice of meg griffith patrick warburton voice of joe the cop alex borstein voice of lois griffith and patrick stewart the narrator and voice of the cia director in american dadtells the story of john bennett mark wahlberg contraband who as a boy played by bretton manley receives a teddy bear for christmas back in 1985 lonely and friendless he makes a solemn wish that the toy would be his friend forever and of course in movies like this the wish comes true and the bear comes to life  complete with the voice of peter griffith mcfarlaneamazed and almost shocked to death the parents ralph garman and borstein grudgingly accept the miracle of a living stuffed animal while becomes famous for a while appearing on the covers of dozens of national magazines and the subject of many tv and radio interviews included in this is a great clip of his appearance on the tonight show with johnny carson think forrest gump herelater though in the advent of instantaneous journalism and as he grows older he is subjecto more embarrassing moments such as a public arrest in an airport for smuggling mushrooms john does not age any better and the duo spend much of their adult lives getting drunk high and watching reruns of the old flash gordon tv seriesbarely making a living at a rentacar office john somehow attracts the beautiful and successful lori kunis but despite an amazing amount of tolerance for her boyfriends situation not many women would continue to endure his vapidness immaturity and complete irresponsibility she finally has enough giving him the ultimatum the bear or memeanwhile john and his toy meet flash gordons sam j jones in a hilarious party scene while a darker subplot concerns a father giovanni ribisi contraband and son who want to kidnap tedthe laughs come amileaminute some heartier than others plus with a few surprising cameos along the way as well as loving pokes at past and present american pop culture i have to admit that director mcfarlane who also cowrote with fellow family guy scribbler alec sulkin has a real winner herethe premise of a living teddy bear albeit one which goes from saying i love you to one that snorts coke and wrecks hotel rooms is certainly pretty dumb but the fun harveshere is well worth the 106 minutes spent in the theater watching this film,comedy

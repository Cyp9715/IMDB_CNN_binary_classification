all i want to say is this film compelled me to write my first ever review easily one of the best horror films i have seen and i am an absolute fanatic i found the film around a year ago as i looked up upcoming horrors and i couldnt wait for it to be released although the wait was long i spent time looking up about the true story that the film is based on for anyone who hasnt watched it i really think it is a good idea to read up and watch videos about the true story  it really adds to the film knowing that most of what your watching happened in real life great acting consistent scares throughout and just a very original horror from start to finish,astonish
i didnt let those rave reviews get to me and i didnt get my hope up like i did last year with sinister  which i thought trailer was great but the movie was huge let down and found the movie very boring and dull and not creepy or at all scary other part of the movie that really annoyed me and i fell sleep in some scenes so that is the reason i didnt get hope up to much for this year horror movie 2013  first of all the trailer did make this look it was going to full of those scary jumps scene that dont last for then one two seconds and i do think they showed a little to much in the trailer i clad i didnt get my hope up to high for this movie it was really good horror movie it dose not any new ground that not already seen saying that i did really enjoy the whole movie i found that did prefer the first half of the movie where the strange thing started to happen to each member of the family there were some really good decent creepy scenes in the movie that lasted much longer then those 2 seconds jump scarce you normal see in horror movie these days other think i liked about this movie they didnt really try to make you jump at all they wanted to creepy you and keep you clued to the screen the on time i wasnt to keen on last half hour of the movie it cause it seen those scenes done many times in the recent years it get a bit boring and very predicable however the scenes it was not boring which is a really good thing i was hoping for more of aftermath of the thing that just happened but it ended a bit soon after the story came to a end i didnt get what last scenes about could not make what i meant to be seeing it was very good and very creepy horror another really good horror movie from 2013 7 out of 10,astonish
is one of the most genuinely creepy films to have come in a very very long timejames wan had shown sparks of brilliance in the horror department in insidious and dead silencewhich is surprisingly underrated but here he goes full throttle to horrify the viewers with every trick up in his sleeveright from the opening credits this movie has a been thereseen that feeling but startles you with its effective simplicitywith such aplomb does it showcases its moments of scares that you clap when the ghost claps you hide when something unexpected is going to be revealed and most importantly you feel what the victims in the family are going throughthe film starts rather slowly and takes time to build up but as the supernatural occurrences start to happenthe thrill gets to you and you cannot but be at the edge of your seat and occasionally even jumping out of your seatyesthere are quite a few darescare moments which have been placed very well in the movie with good build up to them in the form of scenes portraying deep emotions and some scenes evoking laughter as wellit takes quite a doing when you have to recreate a bygone era in a horror film and more so since the odds have been against recent filmmakers who have failed in the recent past to provide a genuinely good horror film employing all techniques they could like shakycams and tortureporn to titillate the viewers sensesbut james wan aided by superb camerawork and sound design goes oldschool this time which works in his favour as the imagery and the build up sets you up for some genuine scares as in the classic horror films just that here james uses some deft camerawork to make the frightening moments like you have never seen before the principal cast scores well with sound performances from vera farmiga and patrick wilsonjames favorite horror actor as the paranormal investigators and sympathetically effective ones from lili taylor and ron livingstone as the perron family experiencing the increasingly disturbing events in their newly bought farmhouseentertaining to the core and frightening as hell this movie is my hollywood movie of the summer and makes me believe that there is still some hope in the classic horror genrehope that insidiousii james next project establishes that and continues the genre revival,astonish
reviewed by dare devil kid ddk rating 415 starsjames wan saw insidious has carved out yet another horror masterpiece is psychologically disturbing and also scary as hell mr wan delectably creates palpable tension and a nerve wracking atmosphere by smartly playing around with camera angles and lights  laudable qualities that hes already exhibited in his previous effortsbut there are also plenty of jumpscare moments without the director resorting to any cheap thrills or mundane horror clichs the plot though not novel is based on a true story and is executed with gusto and freshness among the performances vera farmiga patrick wilson and lili taylor truly stand outthe penultimate scene and the epic climax  again to the directors credit  are among the best ever in horror movie history  and thats really something considering the plethora of classics is stacked against mr james wan  please take a bow once again you sir shall definitely cement your position one day among the likes of wes craven dario argento frank darabont and other masters of horror films,astonish
great movie i truly really enjoyed it it got my attention from the first moment it began  i would hope it was longer in order to get more details from the casesafter watching it i was searching the story behind the movie and there were so many links for example about annabel doll and the next case that the were talking about in the ending of the filmthe movie makes you get to know the characters and it makes you care about them  the annabel doll story could have been a movie on its own i truly hope the make an other one with more cases that they had was scary and interesting  good cinematography great acting as well i would recommend it to all the horror movie fans,astonish
im not really all that sure what to think of after reading several rave reviews and many omg scariest film ever tweets i went to go see it last night this film is scary there is absolutely no denying that the film follows a fairly typical series of events of course beginning with the bumps in the night the mysterious stoppings of the clocks in the house and the somewhat expected death of the dogcome on we knew it wasnt going to live long out there these happenings across the house help to build an intense tension which thoroughly had me on the edge of my seat when the mother becomes possessed the film thankfully doesnt go too over the top and the scene where shes facing her husband smiling like awell possessed woman was utterly blood chilling however i found the end of the film to be just a little on the cheesy side the whole yay mummys not possessed anymore group hug with big smiles and the cheery music was a little corny my biggest issue however is that the plot is a little confusing the film begins in an apartment i believe with two women and a male describing how they believe a toy doll is possessed then the film cuts to the family moving into their new house the doll has been placed under the watchful eye of two ghosthunters and doesnt feature until the climax of the film where it doesnt play any key role i felt that the beginning of the film and the rest of it were a little disjointed overall id say that was an enjoyable watch the creepy goings ons around the house and the extremely unnerving climax to the film featuring an exorcism provide a truly scary watch the film however stumbles a little due to the confusing plot line 710,astonish
like the exorcist made 40 years earlier this feature is based on a true story taken from the case files of husbandandwife paranormal investigators ed and lorraine warren although the set up is familiar enough the execution and delivery are solid and assured in the capable hands of director james wan the screenplay nicely balances the drama and suspense and unlike many other offerings in this genre has hardly any gaps in logic the acting is superlative vera farmiga and lili taylor are especially affecting as the wivesmothers particularly vulnerable to the proceedings there are horror movies like jeepers creepers that just aim to scare and succeed in that department on the other hand is not just about being scary but leaves the viewer gasping because what took place really happened and can happen to anyone let this therefore be a cautionary tale as well,astonish
this movie is not your usual throwaway trashy slash flick built strictly to take money from teenagers with nothing better to do it has all the under pinning to be a horror great was it full of clich yeah clearly this was part of the design so it didnt bother me but despite the fact that they did the detailed work to make it look like 1971 despite the great cast they tell you its november in rhode island and the leaves are full and green in the trees thats just one example of the laziness that plagues this almost great horror flick just have a clue and call it september there are so many details that just dont get integrated into a coherent whole where the locket come from did it come from the high security room full of manipulated objects if not where and what is the point and who was sitting with the doll in that room this movie threatens to be very dark in a few spots and well    its hollywood where the east coast is just a foreign vision where the leaves are green in november was there a more interesting original story that got chewed up and digested for the screenplay babyfood see this movie and enjoy it but prepare for nagging and unnecessary disappointment,astonish

reportedly based on true story renowned paranormal investigators ed and lorraine warren are called upon to investigate the most frightening  baffling case of their career in 1971 roger and carolyn perron have left suburban new jersey with their five daughters to move to rhode island but perrons hope for a peaceful new start is soon ruined by a powerful otherworldly entity intent on waging war against them james wan director of saw and insidious injects a relatively tired concept with some life here via a neat narrative spin unlike most haunted house thrillers doesnt focus solely on the family terrorized by a demonic entity from beyond the grave instead screenwriters give us tandem narratives framing the story within the history of the warrens its a smart move preventing us from growing too irritated with the perron family wilson and farmiga are personable and great at conveying hidden pain while taylor and livingston are authentic and likable theres a lot here youll have seen before if youre a fan of the genre the perrons dog is spooked out upon arrival at the farmhouse roger feels compelled to investigate the dark dangerous basement and if a character in jeopardy suddenly pauses in apparent relief you can be sure something will make you jump in around few seconds time the body count is low bloodshed is minimal  gore effects are limited to minimal towards the end is scariest movie ever made no but that doesnt stop film from being an enjoyable thrill ride in theater,astonish
im not a big follower of horror movies because i always perceive them as mere distractions squeeze a proper horror film tight and all you get is a murky story that thrives on gore and special effects theyre made with a sole aim to shock you to creep you out enough so that you know that this experience has been worth the wait but thats not the case with it is a more archaic version of an clichd plot of a demonic spirit that spooks a family that has just moved into their new home and spook it does being so gleefully scary and wonderfully crafted that its one of the better horror films ive seen in a whilein 1971 carolyn and roger perron lili taylor and ron livingston move into a new countryside house with their five daughters from the first night they notice strange things happening when they go to sleep doors open and shut of their own accord their daughters complain of someone pulling their legs in the middle of the night a rotten smell wafts through the place all day long but when carolyn notices bruise marks beginning to form on her limbs she grows suspicious once while investigating strange clap noises her fears are confirmed she seeks the help of two demonologists and paranormal investigators ed and lorraine warren patrick wilson and vera farmiga who agree to perform an exorcism on the house after they catch the unusual happenings on tape but when lorraine figures out what the demon really wants she finds that the task will be a lot tougher than she had initially guessed when her family is also targeted by itdirector james wan who had gained a substantial amount of notoriety for his 2004 film saw a whole new evaluation of the genre but complete detritus intellectually certainly knows his thing the tension mounts gradually with just the creaking floorboards and moving objects giving you the chills in the firsthalf and wan slyly exploits the baffling episodes to magnificent effect ive got to say creaking doors have never creeped me out so much these are old tricks you see with the abandoned farmhouse and dark history behind it theres bound to be a creaking door somewhere and when the demonic spirit restlessly stealths and haunts the perrons you are assured to have a tough time staying in your seats the premise is simple yes but its also supremely effective minus the loud sound effects and garishlydressed ghosts the film is one of those rare ones that alarms solely because of its tension and some smart filmmaking my favorite sequence in the film the one that spooked me the most was a comparably mellow sequence in which carolyn plays hideandclap with her youngest daughter its the first shocker of the film and a memorable one smartlydirected and petrifying to the bootworks rather well in the firsthalf but gets increasingly smudgy in the second after the demon is finally revealed the plot goes terribly awry then come the floppy investigations and supernatural observations wherein lorraine sees visions of an old witch who is now haunting the family the scares keep coming though but they seem to shabby to invest in the exorcism scene in its climax is caricatural and the memories of the 1971 horror masterpiece the exorcist make it look laughably awful in comparison but wans too smart a filmmaker to let this blemish the filmof the performances none of them are memorable but they arent bad either wilson and farmiga are largely convincing in their respective roles taylor manages to give a potent performance which is a surprise considering she started out as an incongruous accessory but she maintained a dignified presence as the story progressedisnt a great horror film but its satisfyingly scary based on a true story it is a believable account of the terror a family witnessed but as a film it doesnt work after a while and ends on a whimper still it unnerved me enough to rob me of my sleep for a while and i cant pay it a higher compliment than that,astonish
did scare me but twenty minutes after i left the theater id momentarily forgotten that id just seen it while i was watching it i got a little bored and some scenes tempted me to laugh if youve seen 1963s the haunting 1973s the exorcist and 1944s the uninvited youve seen three much better films from which gets its bag of tricks probably any clever film student could make something like this movie we all know the basic ingredients a large old house in an isolated setting the house should be attractive but something about it makes it ugly its in new england its autumn cold winds blow skittering dead leaves an innocent family moves into the house the family is generic without too many details they are allamerican and the audience can identify with them they do normal things like go to the beach and watch the brady bunch their new home contains many dark and dusty nooks and crannies there are antique curios that look a bit menacing suddenly during a quiet night a strange noise is heard for some reason no one in this family ever switches on normal lighting rather they use weak flashlights or match flames an innocent child arises from bed in a long white nightgown she moves slowly slowly slowly down a dark hall to investigate the noise the scene is very quiet very long and very repetitive you know that eventually the innocent child is going to come across something unusual a vision of a hanged person the reflection of a ghost in a mirror or something truly terrifying an irs man there to conduct an audit you know that at the same moment that the defenseless family member sees the unusual thing the previously silent scene will burst with sudden loud and oppressive noise the sudden vision and noise will startle you and you will be scared what you paid the ticket price for oh and the family dog dies birds act weird and mom is bruising easily at first of course everyone in the house writes off these events as mere chance everyone is rational and is not tempted to believe in the supernatural eventually someone in the family levitates or clocks stop or people feel cold or something just like in the haunting there are loud banging noises just as in the uninvited a family member is possessed by the dark energies of the house and there is the ghost of a bad mother and a notsobad mother just as in the exorcist there will be an exorcism so the team of experts is brought in they speak some ancient language like latin and possess arcane knowledge i wont tell you any more because that would reveal the end of the movie to you but i bet you can guess ill just say that at one point the satanic shenanigans in the house reach fever pitch satan is beating the stuffing out of these poor fools any sane person would immediately evacuate at that point a paranormal investigator lorraine warren vera farmiga says leaving the house wont help because the dark spirits have attached themselves to you oh come on vera farmiga may as well have said you cant leave now because theres still fortyfive minutes to go in the movie vera farmiga is a scintillating actress she electrifies every scene she is in patrick wilson is perfect as her husband they have great chemistry the movie wastes them though the filmmakers dont seem to realize that farmigas human depth and complexity are the best thing the movie has going for it and utilizing that human power would have made their film a classic rather than just another boo movie the excorsist the haunting and the uninvited are all scary but they are also deep they present big themes avoids big themes one character tries to kill another and its the kind of killing that makes your skin crawl the movie makes no attempt to plumb these murky waters misrepresents evil and catholicism when the warrens arrive at the haunted house lorraine has a rosary strung from her wrist ed warren places little wooden crucifixes around the house in the exorcism scene latin is spoken this isnt true spirituality its fetishism  the belief that objects and rituals possess supernatural power they do not only god has power i am a catholic i pray the rosary and i believe in satan the force that defies satan is not an object a rosary it is rather faith in god,astonish
for readers information i am not a big time horror fan i have seen other horror films like the paranormal activity series and some of the amityville horror movies and also some other movies like insidious and the poltergeist i was not a fan of any of these movies because they either did not have enough suspense or showed too much of the apparitions i went into this movie with some excitement because ive wanted to see a well done haunted house movie well 10 minutes into the movie i was given was i asked for and more the movie was everything i hoped for spooky horror with a good underlying story i was so engaged into this movie that i left the theater still thinking about it for the night and trust me this was one of the scariest films ive seen this is not an original work but it is the most well acted and filmedcinematography by far and the best thing about it is how real it feels the director wan did a great job of not revealing too much about the apparitions just like every haunted house film you will ask yourself why dont they just leave they give a good explanation with this this is a movie you wish could go on and on,astonish
is an outstanding nostalgic horror film a vast improvement over the disappointing horror films of the past couple of years it abandons the cheap jump scares in favor of slowly building up the tension to the final event and creating that great creepy unsettling feeling of an old style horror film james wan does an excellent job as director and the film holds together very well with great performances by all the cast especially vera farmiga lorraine warren and lili taylor carolyn perron the script is wonderfully paced prepping us for the ghostly realm by opening with a more fun but still creepy story about the annabelle doll and the haunted past of ed and lorraine warren adds depth and complexity to their involvement there is a small lull about 23 in but the film gets quickly back on track overall its quite entertaining film,astonish
having seen far too many horror movies on the big screen kind of kills it for me everything seems familiar a house in the middle of nowhere its dark past forces beyond what we see and feel make their presence known to the new tenants with events escalating as the film progresseseven the fact that it is based on a true story did not have any impact many such reports of inexplicable incidents have occurred in various countries by people of varying educational backgroundsi would not however bring a film down due to genre predictability this has been an effective experience and it did made me jumpy on few occasions so those who do not consider cinema as their second home in the way i do should be warned the ride is going to be bumpy sometimes extremelywell made convincing cast and effective gradual build up with not much tendency to hyperbole could create an argument that it is not ones typical horror filmthe fact that having seen lots of similar film on the big screen the authentic film experience created a sense of expectedness should not in any way denigrate this serious endeavour,astonish
james wans is one of my most anticipated films of this year wan the director of the original saw film as well as 2011s insidious has a fair amount of experience in the field of horror although he has had some missteps 2007s dead silence was a joke of a horror film and did not live up to the expectations set by his previous work he is also directing the upcoming sequel to insidious which i am looking forward to his newest film is packed with an all star cast starring are vera farmiga lily taylor ron livingston and patrick wilson based on the true story of famed paranormal investigators ed and lorraine warren patrick wilson and vera farmiga who have participated in such paranormal investigations as the infamous amityville horror case as well as many others the film is centered around their supposedly most terrifying case that has not been revealed until now in the first few scenes we see the perron family carolyn perron lili taylor roger perron ron livingston and their many daughters they are moving into their new home a remote farmhouse located in rhode island having settled in the family heads to bed in the morning they wake up to find that every single clock in the house has stopped at exactly 307 am as well as a foul stench seeping through the floor and walls not to mention a shocking discover made by their youngest daughter christine over the course of a few days strange events begin to occur in the perron house and it becomes evident that something is terribly wrong in desperate strides to protect her family carolyn seeks the help of noted paranormal investigators ed and lorraine warren it takes her some convincing but the two decide to help her after inspecting the perron house it is clear to the warrens that something evil has latched itself onto itfirst of all i will say that i greatly enjoyed this film but it did not genuinely frighten me normally i would dismiss a horror film if it would fail to frighten me but in the case of there is so much more backing up the film that the scares dont feel as important as they should this is a very well made film the set design and camerawork showcase james wans impressive directorial presence as well as set up a chilling atmosphere if i were to pick a work to describe my feelings whilst watching the film it would probably be unsettled the entire cast deliver exceptional performances which is no surprise when working with such highly talented actors my main problem with is that at times it feels very predictable and uninspired story wise other than that i have to say that i thoroughly enjoyed i am convinced that james wan has the potential to be a fantastic directorit did not scare me but the fantastic production value and the performances delivered by the actors along with james wans eerie direction had me invested in the film all the way through managed to unsettle me as well as provide a gripping story and worthwhile characters,astonish

dont summon the devil its a bad thing some people dont believe in the devil but when they see this movie they will believe it is a cold very cold movie full of surprises  full of suspense and curiosity what happens next ed warren is a brave man knowing all of exoticism  the horrors that happens in that beautiful house in the 70s those murders in this fact its supernatural see a person talking strange languages its very full or triller i dont know how people end like this this things happens everyday but people make it top secret the devil enters to weak people that are very scared about the situation and dont believe in god this movie teach you how to believe in the supernatural and science that science and religion are two different things,astonish
i went to watch this at an 11pm session the crowd was childish and annoying they were too noisy but i still managed to enjoy this movie simply because it was really worthwatchingif you only watch a horror movie to scream then this movie might not interest you at all but if you appreciate a great movie in general this is an awesome moviethe story was believable thanks to great directing editing and acting by all the stars in this moviecant wait for the bluray 8510,astonish
there has been a lot of horror in the past 5 years a lot of it seems to be in love with the found footage format which frankly is getting very tiring im happy to see that not everyone thinks horror has to have a shaky firstperson camerajames wan is a terrific horror director with very good instincts he is oldschool i never caught saw in a theater because im not usually attracted to horrors that arent fantasy slasherbased horrors with the original texas chainsaw massacre being a rare exception but when i did catch up to saw i was struck by its wonderful suspense and plot twisting i am surprised however that wans directing career took a long hiatus it seems to be firing up better nowlike the rest of wans work has strong character and plot building and careful camera work ive seen so many horror movies that nothing really scares me anymore and yet wans insidious chilled me in a few scenes so i was really looking forward to while i didnt feel it was quite as scary for me as insidious it has its moments sure got some screams out of the audience and thats whats fun about seeing horrors at the theater anywayis alleged to be based on a true story and i really liked the attention wan gave not just to the victims but to the investigators weaving the personal lives of two families around the events in a classic haunted housei will always be looking out for another james wan movie to see,astonish
james wan is a horror genius he has made his mark in the genre as the greatest horror directors of our generation he knows how to creep someone out with a tense buildup and a wellexecuted payoff there are quite a bunch of scenes in the movie where i shrieked gasped and made my heart pound like crazy and not to mention some very creepy moments where i caught myself numerous times forcing myself to look away from the screen seriously the movie pace has no mercy on the audience uncountable bone chilling scenes ive ever seen this is easily the scariest movie of all time i think it will go down as one of those films that people will talk about for years the best part is  its a true storyits an experience that i would like to revisit time and time againmy ratings 1010,astonish
intelligent suspensethriller horror and not at all for light hearted hats off to james wan the directorsuper loaded special effects make the film stand out with respect to story isnt anything new as compared to its same genre ones its based on a real life case story but the oldie goldie stuff is well placed portrayed  creatively casted with furniturebanging exorcism so much that it carries a rrating as the movie matures we feel as if the entire theater is holding its breath full credit to the director for putting life in some old haunted stuff from which many people evade themselves watching  making it fresh juicy still serious intense suspense it also doesnt leave my personal favorite the others far behindits a classic masterpiece which is thoughtfully designed from the very first thumping baby doll scares to the last closing squeaking credits shots the show is set in an 150 year old rhode island house where almost immediately moving in the livingston family a couple  five daughters start experiencing disturbing events right from their dog never entering the new house  found dead the very next day just when they weirdly  strikingly notice that clocks stop at 307 am the chill continues till the family starts feeling the presence of a spirits which also results in scars on their bodies its the just the start of 3rd stagepossession where demonologists the warrens are called in infestation  oppression being the first two stages  have a look  this is when it starts getting a lot interesting the spirit seems challenged by the presence of warrens  starts getting out of hand for what lies ahead are a series of incidences that follow which are breathtakingly terrifyingevery masterpiece leaves us with some unforgettable scenes for an our lifetimes  the clapping sequence scene is one in which the audience not only hold onto their chairs but also laugh aloud when its overi found myself saying whoo hoo when it was overits just brilliantly made do you wanna play clap clap  ah awesomein the second half the movie enters into its own pace with the spirit creating havoc  the audience getting goose bumps now  then because of james wans cinematic scare tactics hats off yes again the use of crude technology like cameras that click photos when change in temperature old fashioned tape recorders uv light  sound detecting headphones are all witty inclusions indeed all the actors deliver top class performance without any doubt  may be their acting goes unnoticed because its too scary around  all in all its the unpredictability which steals the show for me stellar moments the poster itself the setting of a big oldish farmhouse on the lake the picture perfect huge tree with bended branches creaky doors superb camera angles  placements excellent screenplay well supported by sound effects make this a must watch if you are a horror movie goerso if you feel like going in there to watch a warning from my side enter but at your own holy risk  njoy censor rating  r running time112 minutes number of times i saw my watch  56 i was irritated by getting scared a number of times   my rating8510 my highest rating till date ,astonish
has nonstop genuinely creepy moments my skin was crawling regularly during this movie twenty minutes into it i was wondering if seeing the movie at night was a mistake yes it was that creepy add to that the fact that the movie is based on a a true story was reminiscent of the amityville horror the 70s versiononly scarierthe movie is set in 1971 the wardrobe and autos were true to the period and elicited fond memories of the time and a chuckle or two the plaid doubleknit tie the adult cast all did admirable work and the five daughters were adorablethe movie has little gore but excels in lowkey creepiness dont take the kids unless you want to be up all night with traumatized kiddos,astonish
i love horror films and as someone who loves horror films i ask other fans is there ever a moment when youre watching something really scary and you go  this was a mistake i hate this crap i cant watch this i have to leave its a very rare reaction especially in a cinematic sea or remakes retreads and countless unnecessary sequels not to say that some are great the new film from james wan made me have this reaction yes the film has all the tropes of a standard haunted house thriller but the films smooth ultra realistic execution is what sets it apart the film tells the story of a family in the 70s who move into a new house and begin to experience strange occurrences those occurrences increase rather quickly and they list the help of the now famous paranormal investigators ed and lorraine warren played perfectly by patrick wilson and vera farminga what culminates is something truly unique and horrifying and hasnt been seen in the movies in a very long time if ever although it sounds fairly generic but this film is anything but the proceedings are handled with a genre maestros finesse smoothly moving between each set piece to create a tapestry of terror and to add to the films overall effect the proceedings are given an emotional girth so we care about the characters and the events going on the film boasts solid performances all around especially from vera farminga patrick wilson and lili taylor the cinematographic is creative and top notch the score haunting and effects nightmarish but the star of the show here is james wan he has effectively made a instantly classic horror film its finely tunes feels very real and pacts an emotional wallop while scaring the crap out of you itis the scariest movie ive ever seen and one of the best not just of the year but ever 55,astonish
and gave me clinical anxiety i mean jesus christ almighty i dont scare easily im a manly mans man but this film was horrifying i was very worried about it being overhyped especially since ive seen enough horror movies that ive gotten to that horrible point where i can tell generally when a scares coming by the camera angle and the sound cues it wasnt overhyped nor were the best scares given away in the trailer in my opinion even the ones you do see in the trailer they spin them or cut them in such a way that its not quite what you get in the movie which was really nice it still caught me off guard anyway im going to try to explain as lucidly as possible why this film actively crippled my soul and tried to kill me this is not a cheap jumpout scare movie i know a lot of people say that and you may wonder then what kind of movie is it this movie is a horrible slow simmering buildup of suspense to the point where i was praying for the jump scare to come just to break the tension this movie is physically exhausting and makes you anxious as hell throughout almost the entire thing its a long time before you even see the freaky ghost lady and they manage to make it horrifying without her when the scare does come it does not last a second and then pass its not a startling thing no you see the horrible ghost great make up effects by the way the camera lingers on the ghost for an unsettling amount of time and it somehow doesnt lose any of its shock value and then theres an extended sequence of said ghost attacking someone or just generally being a ghostly dick that will leave you exhausted by the time the scare passes i will say the climax and end of the film goes into slightly more welltrod less frightening territory but its not bad at all just not quite as ballscrushingly horrifying as the first 34 of the film the bottom line is if you have anxiety or a heart condition are nursing pregnant or may become pregnant you should consult your doctor before seeing this movie oh also the cinematography and the sound and acting was really neat and stuff even from lili taylor which ill admit surprised me a little after her horrible stint in the haunting which i do not recommend because it sucks,astonish
this scary movie is the best since the exorcist ive read the bad reviews and i couldnt help but disagreei heard some reviews saying that it had cheap jump scares this movie is the opposite of that it builds up the tension for way too long that you just want to walk outin a good way after all that tension has build up something scary happens and what happens is not a face popping out of nowhere its actually something terrifyingthis movie is so intense even at the beginning while theres something happening downstairs theres something just as horrible happening upstairsand people who gave this review a 1 just because it says based on a true story why dont you do your research first so you can find out this movie was based on house of darkness house of light which was written after the horrible experience of the perrons this movie has incredibly talented actors including the little kids 50 percent of the scares arent because of loud music 50 of the scares are due to amazing camera tricks and angles they seriously couldnt have chosen a scarier angle to show the activity fromthis movie isnt just scary it also has a good story its not a movie about a killer that kills for no reason its not a movie that has ghosts terrorizing a family just becausethis movie also doesnt just have doors moving and windows closing until the very ending this actually has terrifying things in the beginning middle and endonly bad thing the trailers did reveal a bit too much of the scary scenes so just watch trailer 11010,astonish
great modern horror with its roots firmly in the 1970s both in the storys setting and also with its production style and cinematography  doesnt disappoint without going into the plot i will simply say that this is a highly effective ghost story that surpasses its peers by way of the skillful direction of james wan and the uniformly excellent cast we care for the perrons and want to see them survive this terrifying ordeal and we believe that ed and lorraine warren also care for the frightened family and are willing to do whatever it takes to help themthe good  the sets script and actors are all fantastic the atmosphere starts off creepy and just gradually increases until the climatic final act extra marks for the highly effective sound design that heightens the audiences sense of terror during the scares it was also nice to see a couple of welcome touches of humor offering some much needed light when things threatened to become almost unbearably tense and heavythe bad  even though the director teases the audience for almost an hour before showing us anything of the main ghost i still felt that he could have held off a good while longer some of the most effective scares in the film involve seeing nothing more than the black shadows behind an ajar doorit was great seeing and hearing the audiences reaction to this film in the cinema once the film started the cinema fell completely silent apart from moments when anxious viewers implored a character to be careful etc great stuff there is at least one unexplored plot thread that would make for a great sequel so heres hoping that wan signs up for at least one more film,astonish
when i first heard announced i wasnt that excited the plot wasnt something new and i just was not that excited james wan a good director with movies like saw and insidious kind of brought my attention to this movie however when came out it got very good reviews with critics and even better ones from fans i then got exceptionally more excited for the movie and planned to see it in theaters i came in waiting for a movie to scare me out of my seats but what disappointed me the most wasthe scares themselves i had watched a couple of trailers for the movie before going to the theaters and the trailers revealed more than half of the scares it got so bad that i was even calling out the scares before they even came out it really ruined the movie for me but i didnt let that influence my review is a good horror movie dont get me wrong but its not anything new sure its better than most horror movies coming out now but it is not as terrifying as most people say it is my recommendation watch it but do not watch any trailers for it if you did youre going to be a little disappointed with how much the trailers show,astonish
this kind of story has been done many times before but captures a vital element that most others fail at something absolutely vital to a horror film and it does it without excessive swearing sex or gore and that vital element is family relationship you are immediately wrapped in a bygone era when siblings are close and parents are doing everything they can to live the american dream james wan brilliantly reinforces the warm atmosphere with subtle camera work pacing and music the relationships are put to the test when malevolent forces threaten what they hold most dearpowerful writing like this is very rare in films these days it plays on the paranoia everyone feels at some point as a child as a mother as a father the acting is magnificent and the production solid it all comes together to create a very terrifying experience,astonish
i gave it a 6 for the acting i thought vera farmiga and a couple of the kids stirred some emotion although the movie was supposedly based on a true story i sort of doubt the accuracy otherwise this would have been nationwide media material regardless its just a movie and if they would have had a better sense of fright something that made you grip your chair and at least say wow every once in a great while i may have added one more star but lets just say for the sake of story telling i left the theater once again disappointed i think for the most part i am satisfied once in 10 movies the majority of them seem to be geared more toward individual glorification and computerized graphics sorry but thats just who i am my friends dont care a lot about that side of me but i am pretty satisfied about my critical demeanor after all that one in ten makes me quite satisfied indeed and hopeful that there are still some good writers and directors out there at this point in the movie industry i have to say they are doing a pretty lousy job as far as the money they make well the viewers are also doing a lousy job in not being critical enough i went to see based on the score on imdb take it back to a 6 fellas,astonish
may contain spoilerstheres no doubt that is a scary film but what happens throughout most of the film isnt anything we havent seen before to me it was like paranormal activity and insidious on steroids girls getting dragged out of bed paranormal activity girl getting lifted in the air by her hair paranormal activity 3 but just more amped up ghosts walking around and standing in places insidious and some of the music sounded similar to insidious some of the scares instantly reminded me of even more horror films before and even the possessed woman at the end kind of looked like regan from the exorcist but has some scares that are well placed and the suspense is high throughout the film the scares were terrifying in exception to the cheesy annabelle doll sequence at the beginning of the film i thought the film had very good acting and was very well paced the film was very entertaining to watch and will probably have many people looking more into the story of the warrens and the people that they helped is a scary film that borrows a lot but doesnt necessarily mean a bad thing i look forward to seeing the next film in the soon to be franchise but i doubt it will top the original but we will see,astonish
this movie is a mix between amityville and the exorcist first its about the house then its about and evil entity and it ends with possessioni really liked this movie it was interesting it was stressful not in any horrific way the plot seem to be good until the end the ending was like a slap in my face downright too easymaybe it took them too long to get to the end and they had to rush it because of time limits i dont know but the possession part ends all to quick and they live happily ever afterand whats the link between the doll and whats happening with the perron familyand with everything happening in the movie i dont see lorraine suffering much from anything,astonish
im not normally a fan of horror films because i think ive burned out my ability to feel fear from years of watching horror films mostly i watch this genre because it makes me laugh so its not often that im scared watching these films but this one scared the living snot out of me james wan director of saw made a ghost storyhorror film and successfully made it feel real and authenticand this is coming from a dude who doesnt believe in the supernatural he magically used light shadow and sound to create some unbelievable scares that made my hairs stand on end and my heart try to burst out of my chest leave the theater and hide under my covers on my bedfinally the actors cast really did their jobs tremendously and continued the theme of making the movie feel less like a fictional piece of work and something you were actually watching unfold in front of you yes i know its based on a true story but in the world of movies that doesnt always mean nonfiction overall i was really impressed and super scared of this film,astonish
okay lets go over this checklist one more time we got the exorcist covered check how about the shining check enough stuff and folks tossed around for poltergeists sake check did we remind em that pets have a sixth sense check toss in the usual stopped clocks kids imaginary friend bumpsinnight checkcheckcheckwait this is 2013 gotta have paranormal investigators and their gizmos check dont forget to sprinkle some prerecordedfootage stuff through out the film check need evil doll dammit we got chuckies sistercheck spread the usual cringy stuff like monstersunderbed check dead animals check wejustmovedhere check secret passageways check underwater bodies in white gowns check and of course weve pretended that paranormal investigation is a legitimate profession allowing a lucrative lifestyle prestige and scientific acceptance right check last but not least wehee heeindicated that the devil isguffawreal and that chortlethis is a really true story correct check okay lets throw it at em they gotta be tired of super heroes by now,astonish
so you think you like scary movies you might want to think againbased on the case files of reallife paranormal investigators ed and lorraine warren is nothing if not scary the story of a family haunted by a particularly evil spirit with plans to kill them all is almost certainly the most horrifying movie that will be released in 2013and it is superbly executed on all counts director james wan lets the unfolding nightmare speak for itself and dispenses with many of the cheap blood and thunder effects often associated with films of its type in fact the whole film looks a lot like a documentary which is appropriate given that it is based on a supposedly true story the script treats the subject matter with respect and while i dont know if any of the filmmakers are christian themselves the plot retains the inherently christian worldview underlying the narrative from beginning to end the cast is superb particularly vera farmiga and patrick wilson as lorraine and ed warren the devoutly catholic couple who spent much of their adult lives investigating supernatural events and helping those plagued by otherworldly afflictions in many ways is perfectly madebut while i give high marks in every fundamental area of filmmaking its still hard for me to recommend it to the general audience without some serious qualifications as a longtime horror devotee who has watched countless genre films of varying styles and who is always up for a good scare i have to say that im not sure qualifies as a good scare its not a monster movie its not a slasher film or really even a ghost story the monster in is something far worse than any of that and the result is a film that isnt merely scary but often genuinely disturbing the fact that its based on reallife events and that something at least generally like the movies plot really could happen makes it all even more terrifyingheres a good test if youve seen the exorcist and it didnt bother you any more than a typical horror film then you can probably enjoy otherwise youre probably better advised to spend your money elsewhereagain im not saying isnt well done it is not only is it technically well made but more importantly it actually conveys a strong prochristian message which is increasingly unusual in the movies today the plot is involving the characters exceptionally empathetic and at times the film is genuinely moving in a way few films of any genre often achieve but for all that its not really an entertaining movie its scary but its not very fun and i think even a scary movie should be entertaining as well let the buyer beware,astonish
a demonic entity lays claim to family living in a secluded farmhouse prompting them to seek the aid of two renowned paranormal researchers in this tale of possession inspired by actual events the story gets underway as paranormal researchers ed patrick wilson and lorraine warren vera farmiga evaluate a mysterious doll discovered by a trio of young roommates in 1968 believing their house to be haunted by the wayward spirit of a deceased young girl they give the girl permission to inhabit the doll and soon their lives become a waking nightmare informed by ed and lorraine that they have fallen victim to an inhuman spirit aka a demon seeking a human host the roommates entrust the doll to the warrens who place it in their personal museum for safekeeping flash forward three years to harrisville ri where the perron family have just moved into their country dream home  an 18th century farmhouse that offers plenty of space for parents carolyn lili taylor and roger ron livingston as well as their five daughters andrea shanley caswell nancy hayley mcfarland christine joey king cindy mackenzie foy and april kyla deaver it seems like the ideal place to raise a family until a series of unsettling events leave the perron family convinced they are not alone terrified carolyn reaches out to the warrens for help and learns that a demonic entity has attached itself to her family and has no intentions of letting them go meanwhile the deeper the warrens delve into the farmhouses history the clearer it becomes that this spirit has a murderous agenda and that no one will be safe until it is driven back into darkness,astonish
i may as well just cut to the chaseis a great movie period over the last decade or so films classified as horror or thrillers have relied on a tired premise teens find themselves in a spooky area bad things start to happen a baddie demon crazy guy undead creature reveals itself hero star survives and defeats baddie sequel shows up a year later this film actually puts classic haunting lore back into the big screen something that has truly not been done since poltergeist back in 1982 the films plot is simple a family moves to an old farm in the country and finds themselves face to face with paranormal forces they seek assistance from well known investigators and together they attempt to gain back the familys regular life and control of the home but along the way the viewer is treated to strong scares not via crazy special effects but by simple camera tricks and down right spooky settings and situations because of this one can be made to feel that they are being placed into the scene and encountering the haunting activity themselves rather than watching gore being splattered via fake acting or computer generation fair warningthis is an old fashioned ghost story meant to deliver scares and thrills by means of accuracy and ghostly reality if you are a fan of recent scary films you may be shocked at how effective at delivering the scares this movie truly is but throw in accurate 70s attire language and period scenery as well as strong story telling you will be treated to a very good movie,astonish
i typically do not enjoy horror movies these days they are overdone with shock factor values and not enough content exceeded my expectations in a good way the acting was well done and i liked the use of the eerie music and the fact that it was not overpowering i found it to have a good pace and i was able to keep up without getting confused but at the same time not doze offvery nice cinematography and the effects were good for the most part my only thing i felt could be laughable to some were the few times where some characters seemed to be flying around the screen other than that i really enjoyed this movie,astonish
on paper the premise of reads like a carbon copy of any other supernatural thriller but to dismiss it as such would be to deprive oneself of experiencing the most chilling horror film in yearscarolyn lili taylor and roger perron ron livingston have invested all of their savings into purchasing a large farmhouse to raise their five daughters almost immediately the family begins to experience sinister phenomenon that escalates so violently that they make a desperate plea for help to notable paranormal investigators lorraine vera farmiga and ed patrick wilson warren accustomed to dealing malevolent spirit activity even the warrens are unprepared for the hostile evil that dwells within the perrons homeis a perfect example of how a stale premise can be transformed by quality filmmaking director james wan of saw and insidious fame is a master of the genre wan goes back to a much more traditional and grounded style of delivering scares mercifully avoiding overblown cgianother main contributor to the films success is the intelligent screenplay by chad and carey hayes whom treat the material with the same respect as one might a great drama theres not one superfluous scene in as the tension unrelentingly builds throughoutadding further weight to the project is the stellar cast livingston and taylor have long been amongst the most underappreciated actors around and are always welcome screen presences thanks to their amazing versatility wilson and farmiga are flawless as the warrens both are the type of performer that elevates whatever project theyre in and its indisputable that the actors make what would have always been a good film greatwith a look tone and quality reminiscent of the all time great horror flicks is one of the best surprises of the yearhttpinfilmandtvlandwordpresscom,astonish
never strays from welltread territory and where that would almost automatically trigger a negative review from me i have to say that i liked it anyway the exposition was rushed to the point where i dont even know why they bothered wan devoted about 3 minutes to explaining why everything was happening but that was also the worst part of the movie so im glad we didnt waste too much time on it it was pretty standard anyway the scares were good wan has finally perfected the craft after a few misfires everyone in my theater looked sufficiently frightened it was much scarier than both insidious and sinister which were both pretty lame imo id say its ten dollars worth of boo noises so i am happy with my purchasei probably would have liked it more if i hadnt already seen the haunting the house on haunted hill the changeling poltergeist the amityville horror the woman in black juon a tale of two sisters or read house of leaves like i said welltread territory the story is old but it is a good story so i dont mind being told it again spoiler maybe villain tropes are a pet peeve of mine so others might not find this so troubling but witches and satanists are not evil and shouldnt automatically be the bad guy the christian religious message was really heavyhanded and gets pretty annoying for nonbelievers i imagine it would be downright uncomfortable for actual witches and satanists they go out of their way to get the catholic prayers right but blunder through alternative religions without even looking at the wikipedia page this might be annoying to just me thoughoverall its nothing new but i was scared in a funscared kind of way its worth the movie ticket,astonish
when i first watched the preview to this movie i told myself that is a must see for me i have always watched anything in the horror genre that i thought worth watching ive always tried to rate these movies on a production quality basis how the scenes are constructed how the characters are the scare factor the back story and the i didnt see that coming factor im no expert at all just a fan of the genre and to get to the point this movie blew my flipping mind it was excellent i know its a good movie when i walk out of the theater and all i want to do is talk about it and explain how good it was this movie has been on my mind for over a week now i can not get over how good the acting was how good the mood was set from the beginning the back story was excellent and not to mention some very very good i cant watch moments i caught myself numerous times forcing myself to look away from the screen and not to mention my wife covering her ears and her eyes on multiple occasions ha ha but my final word and review is go see this movie it is brilliant without question i would see it again,astonish
horror films have gotten a tough break lately with lazy directors lackluster scripts and mindnumbing plots when said horror films are r rated that usually means they are equipped with nudity language gore and usually on unnecessary levels james wan who directed modern horror classic saw not the crappy and countless sequels brings a refreshing turn in horror films with where its r rating is based solely on the scares atmospheric and haunting the film boasts a clever twist on a familiar story and top notch performancesbased on true events tells of ed and lorraine warrens most frightening paranormal experience the warrens are known for their work as demonologists and paranormal experts as seen in their work on other pop culture phenomenon like the amityville ny case which led to the classic the amityville horror patrick wilson and vera farmiga star as the warrens and bring a sense of realness to a couple who have been mocked over the years after speaking at a massachusetts university the warrens meet carolyn perron the fantastic lili taylor a mother who is concerned with events occurring in her home foul smells strange noises bruises appearing from nothing ghostly sightings though reluctant the warrens visit the perron home only to find that the house is indeed haunted by a very mad being who wants the perron family deadthe story is in itself not that original a haunted house a scared family crazy happenings but its the way the story is told that sets it apart wan has a great way of piecing together an interesting story and allowing even the slowest moments to keep us on the edge of our seateach moment lends itself to going one of two ways harp on cheesyeasy scare tactics or build on a growing atmospheric fear and allow the creepy feelings to permeate this works as its a decent amount of time before we even see a portion of an entity where spielberg made jaws scary by not really seeing the monster at first and the others freaked us out by ripping out a crazy twist no one saw coming doesnt expect you to pretend you dont know the story it allows you to fear what youre expecting by not really being able to see anything if only more horror filmmakers took this devicewhile the r rating is a little reaching since the bits of violence and gore are so minimal it shouldve received a hard pg13 the film does provide quite a few jumps and leaves one feeling pretty creepy for hours after its the kind of scary film you see when youre a kid and it sticks with you foreverif youre looking for a cheeky fluff horror film go see the purge with the middle schoolers who have snuck in there if youre looking for gore at its finest check out the remake of evil dead if youre looking for a smart thoughtprovoking thrill then is the film for you,astonish
i thought was a good movie the scariest i have ever seen no the exorcist still occupies that spot in my world it was still well done thoughimo it would be better viewed while sitting at home in the dark by yourself or with a significant other unfortunately my movie theater experience was plagued by a group of foul mouthed teens who felt it necessary to keep a running commentary on the happenings in the movie clearly they werent mature enough to handle the subject materiali plan on watching it again on dvd at home in the manner i described above i recommend the movie but watching it in the right environment makes all the difference in the world,astonish
ingenuity is a word that has sort of strayed away from the horror genre and i have to say gives me hope in my opinion james wan has created a masterpiece this movie is genius in its construction the way it was devised from the moment it begins towards the second the credits begin to roll at the end it was well paced intricately and elaborately shot upside down shot of christine who thinks she sees a man by the door and i mean seriously incredibly shot this movie honestly gave me the feel of a seventies classic if youve seen carrie a nightmare on elm street or suspiria then youd understand what i mean the plot is well constructed you have the move in the occurrences of ghosts the search for a plausible explanation then the search for the help that inevitably ends up being ghost hunters with a past of an exorcism gone wrong  which by the way was perfect for an internal character conflict because i dont think its been done since the exorcist 1973 and that horrible conflict happened at the end when the priest died all of the incidents with the entities were original and were never seen coming at all complete and under jump scares that were actually scary the fact that the movie was given its rated r on the sole fact of horror is incredible if you are looking for a movie worth watching honestly and sincerely watch this its more than worth the money because it is actually terrifying its not a cheap knock off horrorcomedy like cabin in the woods,astonish
im not gonna lie and say that im experienced in the field of scary movies to be honest this is only my tenth horror film and my first in a cinema i walked into the theater with my friend both about to pass out with terror and walked out of the theater with that fuzzy feeling we all know and love after a good movie set in the 70s a family of seven moves in to a house that is haunted by the demon placed there by a suicidal witch after a series of haunting events they call upon a tormented couple that busts these demons for a living the cgi special effects were incredible but lets not forget the effect of the human mind to scare itself every creak was a demon every open window was a mirror to the ghost world i may be new to this genre but this movie is worth every 10 it receives,astonish
after reading so many good reviews i had to see this film i love the horror genre but there arent too many that actually scare me but with there was no shortage of terror the whole movie kept me on the edge of my seat i thought that the cinematography and direction was superb and the acting was great as well i think what makes this movie even more intense is that the characters are actually likeable as most characters in horror movies have few to no redeeming qualities and theres no emotional connection so you dont care if they live or die another thing i must touch on is the cinematography and direction as i mentioned earlier both were superb i am a huge fan of james wans previous films though i dont think dead silence was very good and i really can see him being one of the great masters of the horror genre because he nailed it in this film he nailed it in insidious and the first saw film was great as well the cinematography really pulled you into the 1970s overall i would say this film will haunt you long after you leave the theatre,astonish
when the movie starts we find the warren family teaching a college course on the paranormal and their family business of paranormal researching ed warren is an educated paranormal researcher and his wife lorraine is a clairvoyant someone with the ability to exercise an extrasensory perceptionthe director james wan is a master of suspense and horror he uses a lot of moving camera shots and spectacular angles all of which combined with screeching sounds create a sense of suspense not felt in recent horror movies the film was cast perfectly with vera farmiga lorraine warren pulling out a fantastic performancefind the rest of my review at httpwwwlgndvrycom201307themovie reviewhtml,astonish
i wonder y people are excited about dis movie i hope dis going to b d best horror movie  i didnt watch but i guess probably the best horror movie this year can this film beat the upcoming movies like the insidious chapter 2 jeepers creepers 3 paranormal activity and all the classic collection of the horror movies such as the amityville horror a nightmare on the elm street fright night the haunting in the connecticut 2 grudge the descent let the right one in i saw the devil saw resident evil possession the exorcism of emily rose rec devil 1408 jeepers creepers one missed call friday the 13th folks i guess yes it must be a sensational movie of all time,astonish
after a slow start provided an excellent thrill ride it had evocative music and sound effects intense acting and enough lulls comic or quiet for breathing space that said i nominate four films that defined the genre for me the original the thing from another world which i saw as a child made me move to the back of the theater the haunting had incredible performances particularly from julie harris and clair bloom filmed with great style and sinister flourish by director robert wise it made a creaking bulging door swooshes of chill a childs frightened whimper behind a wall and the suggestion of a dead hand clutching julie harriss into shivering tension the innocents based on henry james own creepy story the turn of the screw had deborah kerrs incredible acting as an infernal meddler and selfappointed guardian angel in trying to save two innocent but tainted children she manages to cause a breakdown in the girl and the death of the boy it has in several brief scenes the best depictions of the living dead ive ever seen the very real former governess is spinechilling dressed in funereal black and hanging in the reeds she stares from a distance across a swampy lake at the little girl but only deborah kerr sees her finally the best from a true master alfred hitchcocks psycho starting with bernard herrmans incredible score from deceptive but sinister moodiness to shrieking violins it builds to an escalating tension anthony perkinsplaying a deceptively sweet stuttering mamas boy gives us creepy duets with janet leigh martin balsam and john gavin building a sense of foreboding that shoves us all down those cellar stairs to meet the monstrous stuffed matriarchal owl rocking in her chair and not one oscar shame on the academy,astonish
i had seen the trailer and loved it but nothing prepared me for what i saw on screen my wife says the only movie to ever get under her skin was the exorcist and i suspect that one goes for a lot of people i saw the exorcist for the first time in my late teens and it didnt have that shock value to me that others felt when seeing it much younger back to which now has become officially the only other movie to scare the hell out of my wife im much more hardened when it comes to horror movies but i got to tell you that i had shallow breathing at times and even had sweaty palms i loved every minute of it a horror movie done right the based on a true story label in movies almost always results in the makers screwing it up for sure well this time they pulled off a masterpiece of a horror movie i wont touch the subject of how accurate the film was based on the actual events that happened because i dont know the book which i have not read seems to suggest this all actually happened  that scares the crap outa me if you dont handle tension well stay away if anything that has to do with demonic possession  exorcism scares you then stay away because we get a ghost hauntingdemonic possession movie that will not give you a breather you will leave the theater spent also i had no idea this movie was rated r no vulgar language but they got the rating for disturbing images  the possession scene is very intense i suspect this movie will be playing at the theaters for 2 months or more  go on to make more money than any other this year and for good reason a solid 10 stars,astonish
in spite of the trailers and the horror hype built around this movie the movie does have a heartwarming end good triumphs over evil  something that is so lacking and so much needed for our times today what is so powerful about this movie is that it is based on a true story you have to watch till the very end during the credits and youll see all the documentary texts and photographs referencing the actual event very impressive the movie itself is brilliantly crafted i saw patrick wilson in insidious but this time he in this movie does not spook as much he plays a very believable lay catholic demonologist the rest of the cast needless to say performed par excellence who can forget lilli taylor in ransom or vera farmiga in source code and here they all are knitted as one stunning ensemble of true artists yes the movie the exorcist will come to mind but the difference is that in the exorcist the battle is against satan himself in this movie it is subtly against the same ancient enemy but disguised as hateful entities or souls that have possessed items or latched into persons or things both terrify horrify and even paralyze but in this movie you leave feeling good add to that the superb music that was just right,astonish
my first review because i had to i watch a lot of horror movies and enjoy all of the genre  paranormal slasher found footageetc but mostly enjoy the paranormalpossession types i found to be the complete horror movie without a weakness it was brilliant and every horror movie fan should see it as it might be the best of all time great acting good storyline excellent scares and unlike most horror movies they didnt botch the ending also unlike in many other movies where the scariest scenes are shown in the previews it is not the case here i cant wait to own it on dvd and watch it again and again good luck sleeping at night,astonish
from the man who brought you saw and insidious casts you into a familiar setting one that revolves around a haunted house a terrified family and some experienced veterans in this paranormal field what follows is an incredibly tense and frightening ride through a traditional hauntedhouse story the films major highlight is its effective use of jumpscares and placing you into that seat of hopelessness and the unknown of whats to come next and i have to say that the cinematography is terrific horror movies in general really have to rely on cameras to deliver the scariest experience to their audience from focusing on aghast faces to subtle placements of certain items anyways s overall look proves how much more stupendous a film camera is over a digital one but thats beside the point this film greatly depends on jump scares to affright its watchers and it accomplishes just that as i found countless individuals in the room screaming gasping and holding on to their friends in anticipation of what awaits admittedly there were numerous sequences that had me holding onto my chair shocked at what just transpired and hoping for that particular character to escape unharmed rightfully so the film takes a while to get to the problem of it all as it takes its time building up its characters there are actually two branching perspectives and the issue thats arising within the house and as usual in most horror films the buildup is much more entertaining and daunting than its climax on top of the scares also benefits from its strong acting performances from the likes of vera farmiga to patrick wilson to even the kids yes usually the kids in horror films are horrible actors but this time theyre extremely believable the chemistry between lorraine warren vera farmiga and ed warren patrick wilson is quite evident and the other family delivers as well whenever the kids are endangered youre dramatically concerned then theres the script which is satisfying in some parts and underwhelming in others the greatest element that suffers from is its toofamiliar everything from the setting to the characters to the story and its progression the film contains almost every single clich that most hauntedhouse movies are riddled with at times a specific scene feels utterly cheesy and slightly lackluster due to the fact that weve heard these characters saying these exact lines and performing these exact actions in other movies to the point where it feels predictable and unbelievable ruining the immersion level in the meantime its also a little hilarious that after so many haunted stories yet another family foolishly decides to move into an obviously creepy home that sees its floors constantly creak and its basement scream do not come down here the home is old and messy and theres a freakish tree resting right in the frontyard how can you not be suspicious right from the getgo in fact during the first half of the film i wondered why james wan chose to direct this picture when its so similar to insidious at the moment hauntedhouse movies are a fad that should finally be stopped because at this point no matter how horrifying said movie is the film will lose points because of its traditional and uninspired route the music was okay but at times it was just more of the same generic horror music that youve heard in almost every single haunted house movie before it but then when that bass kicks in your feet start tapping against the floor and your hands begin shaking in the end shocks you and disturbs you while youre in that theater room but after you leave youre likely to forget the ending and perhaps confuse the film with another one when its brought up in a conversation simply put if youre looking for a new horror film with an interesting concept and a memorable unique experience is not the place to look but since theres a shortage of decent horror flicks recently itd be nice to actually witness an effectively scary one for a change in that case you cant go wrong with if half of my theater screamed like a group of little girls chances are you might to,astonish
i saw this film today and it brought me back to my own childhood i wouldve been 7 yrs old in 1971 and i have to say i was impressed with everything the film offered to make it feel like it was the 70s from the clothing hair styles paranormal equipment cars house decor even down to the coffee cups i remember all of those things just as they were now about the film itself the acting was phenomenal especially lili taylors role that had to be tough but she pulled it off just as she did in the addiction in 1995 if youve not seen it please do it also cast edie falco and michael imperioli veras always great to watch and i was happy to see ron livingston as roger perron i always think of him in office space the entire cast was so believableone would think heres another movie about demonic possession but its really not in fact its quite frightening when you think of the possibilities yes its based on a true story and as with all films based on true stories its got the hollywood touch the fx were amazingly real shockingly real i like that for once there was a horror movie without sex nudity foul language and lots of gore in fact the only other horror film i believe to have been made without all that was the omen with gregory peck another favorite of minethere were parts that really scared me but the entire story is just creepy and i think thats what makes it so scary not gore but the premise itself i would highly recommend this film even if youre not a fan of horror films i think its one ill have to add to my dvd collection in the near future,astonish
okay this movie was one of the best new horror films of its time to date in my opinion it has all the tension and build up of the old school scary horror films the atmosphere throughout has you perched on the edge of your seat and you know something is going to happen but when it does it still takes you by surprise james wan out did himself here his other films dead silence saw insidious although great horror films as well are trumped by this masterpiece of tension and fright i heard news that he may be heading away from horror films if so it would be a huge loss to the genre this film reminded of the good old 70s horror films slow tension build up setting the movie up for the main story then hitting you hard with a sensory overload of pure visual fright and delight in the final stanza ive seen thousands of movies in my lifetime and ive had some good scares while watching them some of the formentioned films to name a few but this movie had me jumping for the first time in years i left the theater with my girlfriend and we both said that we couldnt remember another possession film that scared us like that since the exorcist we were in our seats at the back of the theater and when the scary scenes happened the people in front of us jumped so hard the seats moved people were turning away and screaming i havent seen that happen in years at a horror movie this is one movie that id be happy to see again and again i think it will go down as one of those films that people will talk about for years just my opinion though so i give this the 95 out of 10 it deserves,astonish
yet another excellent scary movie from james wan i truly do trust this mans style for horror like insidious this film is high on scares and awkward thrills to keep you on the edge of your seat my opinion with watching scary movies though is pretty much its gotta be at home to be scary so due to whispers and popcorn chewing i didnt find myself scared watching this but im positive i wouldve been at home in the dark and silence there is a lot to be terrified about here the film builds up perfectly to me i think the current formula of the slow build up to the real terror works well to help keep you nervous i really enjoyed this film and look forward to experiencing the terror again on blu ray,astonish
horror movies are rarely made well these days let alone this well james wan has finally made his true masterpiece after making the original saw he ventured off to make a gritty action movie and the underrated dead silence then came insidious in 2010 a more suspenseful movie with a better execution its like saw dead silence and insidious were all practice shots for a much bigger and better movie is supposedly based on true accounts from paranormal investigators the warrens whether or not anything in this film is true is truly irrelevant to me because i dont get caught up in the hollywood gimmick of based on a true story the movie alone captures real terror all on its own from bumps in the night to horrid faces creepy dolls a constant in wans films shadowy figures and straight up exorcisms this film has it all the theater was going nuts throughout the film this movie based on language sexual content and blood and gore could have easily been rated pg13 but its rated r simply because its that scary,astonish
camera is the soul of every horror movie its a privilege to use and not to abuse the director james wan has achieved that skill at the very young age the story the plot and the construction of the 70s era is perfect the movie gives you chillsforget goosebumps you can watch it again and again and still get your hair stand its a carefully crafted horror thriller one should be careful if heshe has a light heart it may haunt your life the music  sound effects the camera angle the shots and the story is so well conceived that one should get the full satisfaction of watching it on big screen it is one of the very few good horror movies in recent time that is based in old times,astonish
i was looking forward to a heartpounding eyecovering scary movie but it wasnt that this movie was scary like most of the horror movies ive seen and i havent watched many though thats the only thing i didnt like about the movie but everything else about the movie was perfect the acting was perfect as in most movie and the scares in the movie do actually scare in some way and just the setting of the house is so eerie and creepy the story and direction were perfect james wan can really the story of the family and the investigators come to life and make you feel what they felt it was a very well made film now i dont watch bloody horror movies because theyre just stupid and gross so i dont watch those type i watch horror movies like this movie just about ghosts and possessions so this movie was perfect for me but i think it should have been rated pg13 like the makers planned it too everything else made up for that though so if you like a good scare this is the movie to see id recommend this movie to anyone who like scary movies,astonish
reviewcan i get a popcorn some skittles and a change of pants please you will need a fresh pair coming out of the theater after watching directed by james wan saw insidious hits the nail on the head for the genre the scares start right in the beginning and do not let up until the very end so scary you will be clutching the stranger next to you patrick wilson watchmen insidious and vera farmiga bates motel play as world renowned paranormal investigators ed and lorraine warren they set out to prove or disprove haunting demonic possession ghosts etc they are led to a case involving the perron family played by ron livingston office space and lili taylor six feet under whose farmhouse is being terrorized by a dark presence the warrens are brought in to determine whether the dark presence constitutes an exorcism what ensues after they reach the house is pure evil genuine horror edge of your seat kind of terror mind you this is all based on true events theres no spinning heads or split pea soup projectile vomit but make no mistake serves up its fair share of bone chilling terror including a cameo from a possessed kid sister doll the direction the cinematography and the acting are all superb of course there are the non scary moments like in all horror movies that tease a scare out of you but overall is not to be missed hell the germ and the jew drove half an hour to see it we rate this one on the highest of standards when it comes to horror germers and jewettes dont forget to read like and share us,astonish
ok its 307am im wide awake out of a dead sleep i can honestly say now that this movie got to me i havent seen a genuinely scary movie since i was a child im beginning to think helping that random 17 year old girl get into the theater to watch this was a bad idea dont get me wrong i wasnt scared while watching this film in the theaters like others were im scared now haha some images you dont need to think about as you peer into the closet at nightthis film was well worth the money it kept me interested all the way through never a dull moment really it was intense i consider myself somewhat of a movie connoisseur and  really was impressive best ive seen of this genre in a very long time now i can imagine what people went through when the exorcist came out wow thanks for the scare,astonish
i just came back from viewing it is a fantastic horror movie heres whydirector james wan along with his team of writers are not afraid to take it back to basics back to a day when those things that go bump in the night actually scared you the shadows the unexplained noises in the dark the creaky doors that open on their own objects that are moved or fall off the walls all of which are elements of true horror moviesit seems that these days the kids want senseless gore blood and porn in horror movies but to me thats not true horror james wan  co decided to not hollywoodize this film and let the story and events creep you out i had friends watch it opening night with an audience that laughed full of teens of course to me thats a big distraction to fully take in and appreciate the dialog atmosphere cinematography and soundtrack all of which are genius i always choose the late screenings to avoid the annoying texting teens and chatty kathys and boy am i glad i didthere are a handful of horror movie classics that have elements i love such as the under lighting of people casting weird shadows in rosemarys baby or the same lighting but the sounds and creepy shadowy atmosphere of the exorcist or the little tricks mr wan enjoys such as the flashbulbs used by paranormal investigators but most importantly its the lack of cg creatures monsters cheesy special effectsmr wan instead chooses great actors to execute great scripts and in that process the characters become believable the story becomes believable and it all becomes creepy to the nth degree filmmakers should take note and make movies like this better horror movies where less is actually more and that is what i love about this film it kept me still in my seat with an uneasy feeling from the opening shot until the very end excellent writing and directing along with a great cast of excellent actors i highly recommend this movie after you watch it and only after you watch it i recommend looking up the real people involved and the story which inspired this film of true events 5 out of 5 stars,astonish
its possession galore for the perron family in the film for the most part takes place in 1971 and thats we meet the perrons a nice all american type family with a couple and their five daughters they move into a house which is basically possessed and is haunted its all okay at first until the family dog dies and then some doors start opening on their own and finally some of the teenage daughters begin to feel a demonic presence in the house at night trying to get at them they call the ed and lorraine warren for help a couple who investigate paranormal activity eventually we discover some history of the people who lived in that house over the years and the terrible things that went on in the house can the investigators save the perron family from being possessed completely or will it all end in tragedyis a chilling horror movie and it uses many different things then what we are used to seeing in recent horror flicks mirrors and shadowy figures and creaking doors opening are used to create fright instead of blood and guts and over the top jump scares great direction by james wan this film had a dead silence feel to it that was also directed by wan i liked the background story of the people who lived in the house before although i wish it wouldve been explored more what i didnt like about this was the exorcism parts i just felt like it was sort of ripping off of the exorcist and it fell a bit flat and was a little silly any demonic possession movie will get that comparison the special effects and make up for it was well done though acting was good all around in particular from vera farmiga and lili taylor is basically the amityville horror meets the exorcist with a few more scares some of the scenes late at night with the kids being basically stalked by the ghosts were genuinely scary i thought it was really well done id check this out810,astonish
not bad if i could i would rate this movie 675 i dont think this film is too scary a tough 10yr old girl could handle this film just finethe characters in it were decent and the actors were good enough me to believe that no other actor could fit the roles they played any betteri think the movie was about 30min too short from being a 9 or 10 the director had great ideas and he should have stretched out a few of the scenes a bit longer because some of them happened too fast if the scenes were longer i dont think it would make the movie boring i just felt that some of the horror and gore was done in a hurry and there could have been more time dedicated to more of the characters in the moviei am happy to see that someone finally made an r rated horror movie that didnt have to get there by using nudity  sex dont get me wrong i love me some naked girls in movies but a truly scary movie has its work cut out for it to become an r rated moviesome of the horror scenes in the movie were funny to me the exorcism went by too quick it definitely could have been a few minutes longer to make me feel a little uncomfortable about it i love the messed up feeling i get after watching a warped moviethe marketing done for this movie was too strong and lead me to expect more than what was in the actual commercials they could have held back and still sold it just fine i dont think i got ripped off by going to see it in the theatre but i would have been happy to watch this film on dvd,astonish
is a blood curdling treat if youre into movies that spook the bejeezus out of you fastmoving tense and dark this is not one of those laughable underwritten suspense movies with more special effects than actual plot its the kind of movie that slowly builds for a half hour or so before figuratively unleashing itself upon its audience in the same vein as 1979s the amityville horror a family moves into an old farmhouse in harrisville rhode island its 1971 people have porkchop sideburns and wear loud pants roger perron ron livingston and carolyn perron lili taylor have five  count em five  daughters and a dog the house was cheap it didnt take long for the family to find out they picked the wrong farmhouse to inhabit yep you guessed it malevolent spirits legs are literally pulled in the middle of the night a smell not unlike rotten eggs comes and goes various pieces of furniture left behind by previous owners shake and rattle theres a boardedup basement an old music box is found by an even older tree by a deceptively tranquil stream pictures fall everyone particularly the kids is terrifieddesperate for help carolyn contacts the warrens ed patrick wilson and lorraine vera farmiga ed is a demonologist  yes  and lorraine is a clairvoyant as soon as they step over the threshold of the perron house lorraine sees a presence and she and ed both veterans of investigating the paranormal are soon faced with the most treacherous beguiling case of their livesthe framework of the movie is that of a traditional hauntedhouse story with the terror turned up past 11 thats because  no spoiler here  there are multiple spirits about although they share a common ancestor spiritually speaking roger and carolyn are helpless which we expect ed and lorraine are as well which we do not also poor lorraine has already suffered tremendous emotional trauma from previous investigations even if and when the investigators can determine the root of the perrons problem they may not be sufficiently equipped to deal with them even with their cameras infrared devices temperature sensors and the help of assistant drew and police officer bradthis movie is terrifying director james wan is an expert at manipulating light and sound to heighten our sense of dread and fear when carolyn descends into the cellar we descend with her our hearts palpitating like a lawnmower both ed and carolyn are inherently relatable as are their five daughters who hasnt played a game like hide and clap its sort of like blind mans bluff or marco polo on land this is definitely one of the scariest movies of the year and thankfully it wasnt released in 3d there are long tracking shots that will exhaust and exhilarate offcamera noises sound closer and closer with each pressing bottledup moment there is very little blood but dont be fooled into thinking this is a harmless movie for kids either whereas the amityville horror was almost cartoonish  bleeding walls  relies most heavily on the human psyche for its fright attack and it is very very successful at scaring one almost breathless there are a lot of things to love about this movie from its creepy atmosphere juxtaposed with its allamerican family to the evocative acting by all of the principals particularly farmiga and taylor for whom this is her best role to date no character feels generic or illformed and the intricate tortuous plot is complex without being complicated this is a movie to see,astonish
director james wan once again brings us another amazing horrorthriller film and proves he is still one of the best horror directors of the last decade plus his style of film making brings the best out in the actors and the best out in the stories that surround himmore recently over the last five years or so horror films have generally been in the paranormal activity found footage mold where they lure you in and scare you with consistent jump scares director james wan has never been a director who relies on those types of scares throughout a film he build up a good story and lets it play out to bring the scares to you with that type of style james wan brings much deserved acting to the screen we generally get no name actors or actresses who cant act at all in this film vera farmiga patrick wilson ron livingston and lili taylor all work so well together it adds a lot to the film they make you believe what is happening to them seem quite and in turn makes the scares even more intense with a good secondary cast as well this film overall in the acting department adds something that is usually missing from these types of filmsthe writing was actually very good as well especially when you consider writers chad hayes and carey hayes have up until this point only wrote second rate films that arent nearly as good the film is loosely based on ed and lorranie warren and they do a very good job adapting the film to the big screen however with a runtime of roughly a hour and forty five minuteswithout credits the film does tend to slow down here and there nothing that takes away from the film too much but it is noticeablethe soundtrack is fantastic in this film director james wan doesnt usually doesnt disappoint in this part of the filming process as this is the same man who who brought the famous theme to the saw franchise the soundtrack in the film will leave you with chills and truly does add to the thrills of the filmoverall this is truly one of the better horror films to be released in recent years director james wan and the amazing cast makes this well worth the viewing price expect good thrills that will last with you long after the film goes to black,astonish
there are basically 2 types of horror movie those that rely on lots of blood and gore and those that rely on the simple fact that all of us are still afraid of what we cant see and dont understanddelivers us those latter fears in spades this is the first genuinely freaky modern horror film since insidious where its all about fears that are almost impossible to control and forces that are totally impossible to controlthe story starts as an introduction to ed and lorraine warren as paranormal investigators who help people either explain strange occurrences within their homes or debunk assumed spectral activity as nothing more than creaking floors and rattling pipes they tour various universities giving lectures on their experiences and showing footage of exorcisms they have been involved in and footage of them explaining the otherworldly forces that manifest themselves in everyday objects such as a scary looking doll etcwe are then introduced to the perron family whom the main story is structured around the family moves in to a new yet somewhat rundown two storey farmhouse in rhode island in 1971 reminiscent of other earlier horror movies abound such as poltergeist amityville horror or the exorcist when strange yet seemingly coincidental or easily dismissed incidents occur such as the clocks all stopping at the same time strange offensive odours or the family dog refusing to enter the home and then suddenly dying overnightas time goes on incidents become more and more frequent and more eerie the mother wakes up each morning with new bruises on various parts of her body the youngest of the 5 daughters ends up having what is at first an imaginary friend that can only be seen in the reflection of a mirror on an old toy right up to sudden and freaky events such as hanging pictures being torn from the wall and people being locked in rooms etceventually the mother tracks down the warrens during one of their lectures and convinces them to come to her home to help them find out what is happening to their family needless to say that with the inclusion of paranormal investigators now on the scene the entity is none too happy about it so events start to escalate and finally come to a dramatic conclusion once they realise that the mother has become the conduit for the malevolent spiritfans of spooky movies will see nothing new in that they havent seen in countless other movies of this genre people being dragged across the floor by their hair tons of photographic and light sensitive equipment demonic possession sudden apparitions witches curses etc have all been done before in poltergeist rose red haunting in connecticut paranormal activity insidious and countless others so what makes worth seeing the fact that no matter how many times you see a movie like this or how many times you simply know that something is coming that sharp jolt of instant darkness or helplessness when facing forces that are out to get you and the adrenaline rush it gives a movie goer is why so many people love a good ghostdemon storythere is very little cgi in and it appears that they have gone for proper special effects with effective use of shadow and atmosphere to create something that you dont often see in horror movies these days is not overly flashy with exceptional effects but gives a definite feeling of dread and it shows that things that go bump in the night can still scare the hell out of you,astonish
in a way director james wan has evolved as a horror filmmaker for the better his first effort in the field was the torture porn flick saw a mostly solid amiable effort his followups were the equally tense films dead silence and insidious whose sequeltrailer precedes and now has evolved as a filmmaker who articulates tension and buildup beautifully with a taut display of creepy horror cinemathe plot carolyn and roger perron lili taylor and ron livingston and their five daughters move into an old decrepit farmhouse in the middle of nowhere and begin to experience the a string of paranormal activity in the house the clocks all specifically freeze at 307am a music box one of the daughters plays with has her claiming she can see a boy named rori when it finishes playing music and odd smells and physical abuse come about from what appears to be paranormal entities as wellhelpless and after the haunting seems to cause mental harm to the children carolyn and roger seek out the help of ed and lorraine warren patrick wilson and vera famiga two paranormal investigators that try to piece together what if anything is haunting the perron farmhouse and how the inhuman spirits came abouts plot is obviously sickeningly familiar and horribly unoriginal however despite the overused and questionable based on a true story that the film states earlyon it works largely in part because it tries to make the events here believable and not real the film itself is meant to serve as something of a retelling of true events  not the actual thing when watching a sequel to paranormal activity which is passed off as real and not a work of fiction you find yourself asking how is this real when watching this film which is passed off as realistic you find yourself asking how is this not real this is largely thanks to james wans studious camera framing and john r leonettis wonderfully creepy seventiesstyle cinematography its difficult to make a modern home scary but one from the seventies featuring eerie knickknacks odd wallpaper strange little porcelain dolls and a load of dark places is inherently creepy in its oldness the film features the wonderful slowburn technique which will likely take criticism because s agenda doesnt call for anything to be rushed at onehundred and twelve minutes it has just enough time in the beginning to show you the atmosphere of the rural area where the farmhouse resides and takes the time to build tension effectivelyusually the last thing i find myself discussing when reviewing horror films is the acting but the naturalistic acting of everyone here must be formally mentioned patrick wilson and vera famiga who always seems to take frontandcenter in several contemporary horror films works wonders as two demonologists who will inevitably become victim to the perron haunting as well as trying to be the ones remedying the effects ron livingston has been spectacular in the several film roles he has taken in the last few years and this one here is no exception and lili taylor takes the cake here as the strongest performance as he simply tries to be the caring and compassionate mother when the uncertain is taking effecttakes the personality a lot of hammer horror films do which are what have now been called classic horror films that emphasized tension and atmosphere over blood and quicklypaced action the closest thing ive seen to in the last year or so was probably the forgotten but memorable woman in black which was largely a movie about daniel radcliffe roaming a house full of eerie decorations and cobwebs it was a creepy tonally effective picture and thats just what isnot everything works here as well as youd expect the development gets a little predictable and the ending seems to cave too much into mainstream expectations however this is still a wonderful changeofpace for contemporary horror especially being a summer release when if anything the most serious horror films come out in the early months of the year if anything reminds us what the fundamental principles of horror filmmaking are its that the environment is everything and that forgoing that thought for lame contrived scenes of slaughter exorcism or mindless drivel is an act of genreblasphemystarring patrick wilson vera famiga lili taylor and ron livingston directed by james wan,astonish
i saw this movie the day before opening day i think this movie was very well done the whole cast did an awesome job to me the movie wasnt to scary to make me jump in my seat but it takes a lot for a movie to get me to jump lol although i did jump in the beginning because the girl next to me screamed so loud and i wasnt expecting that lol i do know if a haunting like that happened to me in real life i would scream like a little girl lol love the fact its based on a true story i recommend this movie to everyone its a must see movie if your into the paranormal i give this movie a 1010 i will definitely be going to see it againclap clap,astonish
first the good the movie is scary there is little in the way of psychological thrills and chills which is my favorite think evil things for a fantastic example but lots of shocks jumps and boo moments that give you that jolt of adrenaline fear we scary movie lovers desire visuals are pretty darn disturbing well done and scary toothe not so good the reason this only gets a 7 is its a formula its sinister  paranormal with some parts taken directly from each film its a lot of haunted house clichs right back to amityville horror it has a slight hole in the plot the experts arrive to inform the terrorized family the spooky entity is attached to them not the property  even though their research indicates the spook is strictly concerned with the property of course the terrorized family wont leave the houseetcif this had been an original story with more and well established psychological thrills minus every haunted house clich this film would be an easy 8 or 9 and possibly a 10 the cinematography was brilliant the acting was adequate the spooks were spooky just needed less formula and more originalityim glad i went to see this in the theater im also glad i saw 30 days of night in the theater to give you a reference of my taste even though its a 7 its easily the best movie ive seen all year and likely will hold on to that spot if insidious 2 doesnt knock it from top spot you wont be disappointed,astonish
gosh ghost  the movie started with the nice backdrop of america in the 60s era  patrick and vera opens up with the way the exorcism is performed and the technicalities of being paranormal researchers  the movie picked up the pace at the right moment and slowly caught up in the web of some terrifying horror scenes  this director knows his stuff  his approach is flawless adding with some good performances from patrick wilson and vera fermiga  kept us on the edge of the seat all the while one of the best horror movies i had seen as far as my memory goes back  the cinemas we had been to  was filled with some exciting screams  certainly a thumbs up in this genre  go watch it  but not alone ,astonish
this movie is the latest from james wan who has done saw dead silence and insidious and he delivers like no other time this movie got rated r because of its scares and well it was scary as f and i want to see it again the thing that makes this movie scarier is the angles of the camera and the sounds but the makeup also makes the movie amazing so if sinister and have a battle will kick sinister a ass in many ways shapes and forms so yea dont bring anyone under 13 oh and the people who are comparing it to insidious are wrong it does not feel like insidious in any way it actually feels like a different director completely,astonish
i saw starring vera farmigabates moteltv the departed patrick wilsonthe ateam2010 lakeview terrace lili taylorpublic enemies high fidelity and ron livingstondinner for schmucks office space this is a horror film that reminded me of the older classic horror films such as the amityville horror the exorcist and poltergeist maybe its because there are not a lot of cgi special effects used instead it is mostly actors in make up as the demon spirits this movie is also based on a true story and takes place in the early 1970s vera and patrick are a married couple that are paranormal investigators or demonologistsshe has psychic abilities that drain her every time she uses them they investigate paranormal activities and either debunk a situation as having a normal explanation or they help get rid of the problemthey have to call the vatican if an exorcism is needed patrick even has a room in his house where he keeps occult mementos from his past cases as souvenirs anyone visiting the room can look at but not touch an object in case they were to release some evil lili and ron are a married couple with 5 little girls that buy a haunted house and call upon the services of patrick and vera after strange happenings start disrupting their lives i thought it was suspenseful and had some pretty good scares it is rated r for violence and terror and has a running time of 1 hour  52 minutes i would buy this on dvd,astonish
its a very unique horror experience it keeps a moderate pace while still giving more than enough time to introduce the central characters so you get a feel for them their motives and a sense of empathy as these horrible things happen to themthere is some backstory a flashback or two and the main story is occasionally punctuated by lessons taught by demonologists vera farmiga and patrick wilson who eventually get involved with the story of the warrenswhat makes it really notable amongst horror movies is that its fairly hard to predict yes there are tropes like there are in all horror movies but it doesnt follow poltergeist to a t and it has a fair few twists and turns that will really catch you off guardanother thing is that there are very few jump scares theres a lot of building tension but surprisingly little ahh oh my gosh theres a scary ghost behind you and once the center of all the trouble is revealed things escalate very quickly theres no horrible torture or mindless gore but there is blood and some seriously unsettling scenes that take placei give it an 8510 but for imdb purposes i have to give it an 8 meaning i think its extremely watchable memorable notable and something worth being put on a top 10 list somewhereand another thing you definitely need to see it in theatres seeing this movie with a full crowd of people is the only good way to see it,astonish
i have to admit that the selling point of to me is the fact that its based on a true story and i think thats what makes the story so disturbing and chilling for the audienceunlike films such as paranormal activity or insidious this is not just simply meant to frighten you but to actually make you think about how there are evil spirits out there among us and that stories like this many of which we probably will never know about do exist the acting was superb and not over done by any means its not a fast paced thriller and its more deliberate pace is the stuff stories are made of in place of a cheap thrill there are many pretenders to this genre of film is most certainly an original and a mustsee,astonish
is nastysometimes very hard to watcharguably sickhorribleyou name it its also a near masterpiece by its director ruggero deodato who never came near the quality of this film again its a horror film in the most literal sense its not scary in the slightestit doesnt attempt to make you jump despite its scenes of horrendous violenceits not even a simple gross out a la braindead what deadato attempted with this film is to disturb the viewer provoke a reaction and make him or her think the film has a powerful message about mans cruelty and violenceand deodato just tackles it totally head on thisand the fact that it is so well madelets face itsome of the socalled video nasties seem laughable noware probably why the film has had so much censor trouble even if you hate itit sticks with youits horrifying images staying in the mind for agesand they are indeed many people being ripped open and eatenincluding even a penis being partially torn off a woman having a foetus torn out of her and it buried in mud another woman raped with a dildo and than having a mudball with nails on thrust between her legs too a brief fake documentary showing disturbingly realistic executions the list goes on you would be forgiven for thinking that this is just exploitative nastiness however and this is just one of the many things that separates this film from the many other films of the cannibal subgenrewe are being shown this stuff to get us to thinknot just about mankinds violence to each other and his ignorance of other races but also about violence in the news and oddly enoughthe glut of realityshows on tv today also make the film pertinent and it also toys with our sympathies in a devilishly clever way cannibalism seems horrible to most of us but at the end arent we almost pleased to see the protagonists eaten by the natives when they have spent the previous half hour mistreating and abusing themthe film is oddly structuredwith the second half being basically the film which the characters in the first half of the film find the second half has the most powereven if there are shots which couldnt actually have been taken by the filmmakers deodato actually shows great skill in many of the gory effects scenes by showing just enough of the effects to be effective but not dwelling on them so the fakery starts to showand the climatic orgy of cannibalism is all the more shocking because much of it is only partially glimpsedmaking more of an impression riz ortolanis often bleakly beautiful score is superb and even the dubbing of the good if not greatactors is not badthe one thing about the film that is hardest to defend is the animal cruelty unless you see the uk dvdwhich removes it in one particularly notable scene a large turtle is dragged out of the water and in what seems like real time is disembowelled it probably is sickening that animals were killed for a filmyet this is how the natives of many places surviveby killing animals and eating themand is this really any more sickening than the way chickens are couped up in factories stuffed with food and basically bred to die answers on a postcard pleaseis quite simply essential viewing not just for fans of extreme cinema but for adult fans of cinema full stopas long as of course they can stomach it,cruel
professor harold monroe robert kerman aka porn star richard bolla travels into the jungles of south america to try and discover what happened to a group of three documentary film makers who have been missing now for some time after locating a primitive tribe monroe manages to strike a deal and salvage what is left of alan gabriel yorke faye francesca ciardi and jack perry pirkanenthey say there is a fine line between genius and insanity and i think in director ruggero deodatto made that line as thin as possible to call this movie depraved and sick would only give it half the credit it deserves because is meant to be sick as it shows how sickening our own society is but in the most morally corrupt way imaginable featuring numerous repulsive acts such as a real live turtle flaying a foetus being ripped from a womans body rape castration and impalement the film sets about to portray the civilised documentary filmmakers as no better than the primitive cannibals even though the actors are barely competent enough to do their job it becomes almost enjoyable in a very sadistic way to watch them suffer at the hands of those they have wronged however from a moralistic standpoint even watching this movie is wrong i dont think this is the type of movie you either love or hate on an entertainment basis but you either agree or disagree with how it presents its case is certainly nothing short of an endurance test in viewing as the senses are raped by the foul imagery constantly portrayed within filmed on a shoe string budget with virtually no production values evident has a disturbing realistic grittiness that is almost unparalleled by any other movie and a huge influence for the blair witch project almost twenty years later i feel that because the movie is so badly made and the very fact it was produced is more damning to society than the events portrayed within many people feel that it is nothing more than a senseless bloodbath with no redeeming features and a hypocritical storyline  and to an extent they are probably right whether the viewer appreciates or despises this movie is totally dependant on the viewer and it is unfair for anybody else to make judgements on that person based on their opinion of this movie is not about a sharp storyline great acting or superb special effects though the unsimulated effects are generally good instead it is about humanity in general if you believe you can cope with violent and repulsive imagery and scenes of unbelievable cruelty then go ahead and watch it but otherwise it is certainly one to avoid some people will probably find the moralising over such repulsive subject matter offensive and i cant say that i blame them however there is a message there and this movie makes an extremely bold statement the question is though whether it was right to make the statement in this way from an artistic standpoint it holds no real value but remains an interesting movie my rating for  610,cruel
is not the campy little horror flick i expected its a serious and wellmade movie and its an experience youll hardly ever forget according to imdbs trivia section the movie can only be seen completely uncut in the ecultrabit dvd which means that ive seen a tamed down version and that my friends is insane is easily one of the most graphic movies ive ever come across the violence is incredibly realistic its no wonder that director ruggero deodato was taken to court to prove that he hasnt slain real people for his motion picture i still think the real animal slaughtering in the movie was unnecessary screw you for that deodato its hard to tell if there really is a message or if the moral is just an excuse for all the gore in a strange way the violent scenes somehow speak for themselves and do deliver some kind of message but thats open for discussionif ever a movie deserved the label disturbing its its controversial but totally worth watching if you can take some seriously sick images,cruel
i cant believe some people have scathed this great film it deserves a lot higher ratingi got this movie out thinking it was going to be a brainless splatter fest but after watching it in completion i was bowled over i wasnt expecting to be challenged by its visuals as well as with the sociological lessons and questions it raisedthe film is real genuine and honest to the subject topic barbarity can be innate in all humansit can be argued that humans coming into the homosapiens stage of evolution survived and expanded because of what is now considered barbarous savage ways savagery was a survival tool we came from barbarityand to an extent we still are savagesthough the acting is poor in most places the film director portrays cannabilism and barbarism and portrays it rather intelligentlyobvious connotations can be made to blair witch project im sure the crew that made bwp was inspired by this moviethe film follows a professor investigating the disappearance of an american film team 3 guys and girl that went into the jungle of south america to film a documentary about the native cannibalsthe professor with a couple of jungle assistants venture into the jungle to trace the lost americans footsteps he manages to get on the trail and slowly uncovers the grizzly ways of the jungle tribes by carefully befriending these natives he captures the lost film reels and returns back to his skyscraper clad conurbationin amongst the film there is the media business cogs turning the dilemma of tv executives battling with the professor to air the once lost footage on tv for the viewing public the professor is reluctantthe professor seems the only person possessed with moral understanding and compassion throughout the film everyone else it seems is after ratings fame money or bloodthe film commences its ending by playing back the raw footage of what the expedition team filmedand it is shocking questions arise who is committing the real evil savagery hereas for the animal cruelty scenes yes they are real and shocking but should it be anymore shocking than the beef burger that is served up in mcdonalds cows are slaughtered everyday perhaps one needs to watch a bovine neck getting slit before they take it for granted they are eating a nice juicy steak on their plate the film portrays the reality of human meat consumptionand yes all kinds of animals are killed for the human appetite especially in the wild  someone will do it for those who dispute this film on these grounds can you handle life this stuff still goes on regardless of whether u see it happen or notthis film is absolutely brilliant a cult classic i can see it making a revivalbut dont know whenperhaps in some years time,cruel
was first and foremost a disgusting movie with more violence than i have ever seen despite this it is also one of my favorite movies it gives a feeling of blair witch done right even though there are some very obviously contrived scenes in which nobody is holding the camera but despite some small cosmetic problems this is the best horror movie i have ever seenunlike most shock films such as the guinea pig movies has a very well written plot and a definite progression the focus is still on making the audience ill but we dont even see any violence until fairly late in the movie so the emphasis on plot is much stronger the story told is a deep one showing the lengths at which people will go for some goal the example given being fame and fortune the theme is reflected in parallel story lines through the second half of the movie as alan and his crew go to more and more desperate lengths for fame and the professor struggles against a big media company to suppress the release of their footage even in a meta sense we see the theme appear once again in the lengths the director of itself went going so far as to kill and butcher four animals on camera,cruel
is very deserving of its controversy but it is definitely not tacky and for pure shock value something i half expected i discovered this movie while reading about the august underground movies and was way more intrigued by a controversial movie with meaning and plot its in your face it at least seems real and is real in some parts never have i ever seen such convincing special effects in a movie and this was a lowbudget 70s movie cgi will never recreate it but beyond the special effects there is a message and meaning and very engaging storyill break down the review into sectionsplotstory 910 think of the blair witch project except not trying to put itself off as real a group of 4 documenters go into the amazon jungle to film the savages and cannibals that live there they do not return and it is up to an anthropologist to find them or at least what was left of them throughout the movie we learn of the documentary crews tendency to push and bribe people into committing extreme acts of violence through actual footage from people being killed by soldiers in nigeria the movie portrays it as if it was a documentary shot by the crew in which they payed the soldiers off to kill innocent people execution style as the story progresses the viewer is forced to try and comprehend who exactly are the real savages not to mention the social overtones of how modern society ties into all of this it loses a point though because the dialog sometimes is very iffy even though you can tell they were trying to be realistic but this hinders the actors especially with their lack of experienceacting 710 this is where the movie suffers it gets better as the movie progresses and things get more intense this may be do to the actual moralities of the actors and how they felt about the movie showing through in their characters but when it starts out im almost reminded of campy bmovies the cinematic presentation and pure intrigue is what kept me going again though the script writing obviously provided some challenges for the actorscinematography 1010 speaking of cinematic presentation this movie does it beautifully even from the opening shot from a helicopter flying over the rainforest the studio and moviestyle aspects of the film are very convincing and very welldone hollywood couldnt do better with a 10 million dollar budget the creativity and use of closeups really pulls you in and you begin to question the reality of even the part of the movie that is presented as fictional and that doesnt even cover the great mockumentary work the directors understanding of how documentaries are made and how they work is extremely convincing the use of normal scenes of the crew kind of doddling around really help to present a feeling of reality and the aspects of limited film and the amateurishspontaneous filming style are almost convincing enough to make the viewer think they used real footage to build a fictional movie aroundaudio 1010 again im reminded of apocalypse now the music is melodic and somewhat peaceful adding a real eerie tone to the serious and macabre theme of the movie it is very 70s though and i would not expect to here the same soundtrack in a new movie although some of the musical flavors are indeed timeless and there are some more intense scores in the film but they are not overintense like most hollywood today then we get into sound design which is very convincing the tearing and the screaming all sound real or as i would expect them to sound the new mixing with stereo is well and really helps immerse the vieweron the animal violence this is something that i thought would disturb me the animal scenes in amorres perros disturbed me even though they were not real but this was real and i wasnt that perturbed by them people have said that the killing of the animals is useless and doesnt help the plot of the movie but i feel otherwise it brings into light that you do have to kill to survive the documenters kill 6 animals one is a spider which some may not count i do on screen and 1 is killed off screen and it obviously irks the actors a little bit note when you see vomit it is indeed real but the animals are eaten and all of this adds to the reality of the documentary it would have been hard fake some most of that plus think of the meat industry today hundreds of thousands of cows and pigs slaughtered and millions of chickens and turkeys slaughtered every day in gruesome ways just so we can eat them just because you dont see it doesnt mean it doesnt happen our society frowns upon killing animals but that burger doesnt magically appear blood had to be spilled for our dining pleasure,cruel
yes this film was banned and heavily censored in a few places for being disturbing it does have some really well done gruesome scenes but the real censorship came from the cruelty to animals lets just say this film doesnt have no animals were harmed during production scrolling the end credits the animal killings include a pig being shot in the head from close range a muskrat being slit open for no reason a giant turtle being split open in an overly long scene and a monkey getting his brains bashed in which required two takes so two monkeys were killed during production these were real killings and not faked a lot of the actors on the set protested this but the show went on in fact one of the lead actors feared for his life thinking this might be a snuff film and might meet the same fate as much as this bothered people is it really that different then buying meat in a supermarket at least it made me think the movie centers around found footage of a group of documentary filmmakers the filmmakers are in south america searching for a tribe of flesheaters hoping that this documentary will win them fame and fortune the movie was marketed in a way that made viewers believe all the documentary footage shown in the movie was actual footage of a group that really went to south america to do a documentary some questionable acting gives it away and you thought the blair witch project was an original idea didnt you,cruel
is a truly charged viewing experience in all its 20 years of existence no other non mondo film until maybe men behind the sun had such a reputation to shock even today it is believed by some at the uks trading standards to be an actual snuff film ch is not the goriest film ever made but in terms of themes and narrative its still the cruellest most fascinatingly harsh piece of filmaking in the horror genre ive seen all the traces of death the men behind the sun films and the guinea pigs and i still think this is king  it is simply so well made acted atmospheric and the brilliant score by riz ortalani sets the scene so well the fake documentary style never slips up but perhaps the most unsettling thing about ch is that it is an exploitation film and the scenes of animal cruelty and even human unsettle because they are being shown to promote a responseshould you look away or notlike i said is a truly unique experience not some gory novelty like cannibal ferox and in this time of increased media coverage of true life atrocity maybe its pertinent maybe its just nasty cruelty maybe it even dissapoints youyou just have to see it to gauge youre own response for me at least its a classic,cruel
what havent i heard about only that its one of the most disturbing movies of all time and still to this day manages to shock its audience honestly im surprised that it took me this long to watch it but i found the film on google because i was cautious on paying 20 dollars for a film i never saw thankfully is much more than just shocking but actually has a great message to it the film isnt as shocking as im sure it was when it was released but it is a jaw dropper mainly due though to the real killings of the animals which is a bit too much to handle at the time the director was also accused of murdering the three lead actors talk about motivation however he made the actors break the contract of silence since he wanted the audience to think that this was a real film in order to prove his innocence before the blair witch project there was no film like i dont think a film has even touched its ground since thenthere is a television documentary about a missing united states film crew who disappeared on an expedition to the amazon to make a documentary about indigenous cannibal tribes the team was alan the director faye script girl and two cameramen jack and mark harold monroe an anthropologist has agreed to lead a rescue team and flies to the amazon to meet his guides there the team meets hostility and learn that the film group had caused great unrest among the people the yanomam invite monroe and his team to their village where they are treated with suspicion a group of yanomam women take him to a shrine which he learns holds the bones of the missing american filmmakers monroe confronts the yanomam about this after playing a tape recorder for them he trades it for the first teams surviving reels of film back in new york executives invite monroe to host a broadcast of a documentary to be made from the recovered film monroe wants to see the raw footage first finding out who might be the real savages after alldid the animal killings bother me the turtle scene definitely did i understand that the meat was used for meals but it was a bit too much for me to handle the brutality of the killing i wont go into details just if youre an animal lover like i am then fast forward through that part too however what i did appreciate about the film was how realistic it did look the director did a great job of finding locations actors and the over all feel of the film as you feel dirty and embarrassed watching such horror on the screen while i may not agree with the animal killings this message of who are the real savages really got to me i loved that this wasnt about just grossing people out but showing how crazy people can get over money and power its really sad and its weird to think that the documentary crew that went into the project that you thought were originally the victims of such violent tribes were actually the ones who are wild animals and in some sick way deserved the justice that was served to them while its a hard movie to watch i would say that it was worth it again not for the faint of heart but a true classic and im sure will still shock for many generations to come810,cruel
i first heard about through the internet my initial curiosity and desire to see the film was because it was supposedly the most violent and gory film made which is a subject matter than can be debated but when i eventually got a copy of this i was blown awaythe opening of the film has probably some of the most beautiful music i ever heardwhile filming shots of the amazon from birds eye viewi was surprised to see that this film was much more than a violence fest i would be lying if i said that the violence in the movie is insignificant to its underlying message because its not there are real animal killings which are pretty brutal to watch but on the lighter side the animals killed were eaten by cast and crew after filming so they did not die for the viewers entertainment or whatevercan be called ahead of its time due to the fact that makes you question watching reality as entertainment and where to draw the line also themes of consumerism the media and what it means to be civilized are present within the killingsflesh eatingrapesexual assaulttortureand other such extreme things filmed i would compare this to clockwork orange in the means that there is a message in the madnessand it was quite obvious where the blair witch creators got their inspiration from this movie,cruel
directed by italian maestro ruggero deodato is a haunting beautifully filmed masterpiece  deodato known for a spattering of mostly laughable erotohorror hit the mark with a few wonderful pictures notably house by the edge of the park jungle holocaust and this his greatest film  contrasting powerful horrific imagery with a gorgeous melodic soundtrack by composer riz ortolani  the most impressive aspect of the film however is its remarkable superrealism  i have seen very few horror films if any that are acted with such passion and naturality  the film is exploitative extreme brutal and marvelous see it,cruel
the second word in the title is important ruggero deodatos 1979 metasnuff movie far more than a chichi trinket like the night porter is the real holocaust porn here the trigger is not frights or even shocks or even splatter atrocity is the name of deodatos gameand the genius of this monsterpiece is that deodato horrifyingly delivers the goods at the same time he coruscates his audience and himselfthis is a hard movie to recommend to any but those who would find it anyway but it must be said that deodato here created the most rigorous critical almost philosophical movie in the italian horror canon the audiences lust for third world exoticism and envelopepushing violence are gratified and held up to the painful light of dayand not necessarily in that order the overwhelming feeling of this picture is of a pornographer pleading stop me before i shoot againthe conceit of the moviean academics journey into the amazon to find the remains of a western film crew devoured by cannibalspermits deodato more pirandellian boxes within boxes than a double bill of blowup and the player but the atmosphere of the movie despite scenes of cruelty so extreme you sometimes want to put out your eyeballs is relentlessly elegiaccapped by riz ortolanis theme music it can be said with certainty that no romantic ballad was ever used underneath what deodato stages hereis the farthest edge of extreme cinemaas in extreme sports it feels stuntlike yet the combination of amplified bloodlust and worldweary regret is unique like lucio fulcis even more personal cat in the brain its an affecting enactment of an exploitation artists conscience tearing apartit might make good viewing for y2k eve it puts together the centurys two salient wordsholocaust and entertainmentas no other film did before or since,cruel
a group of 4 filmmakers and their guide take a trip to the rain forest aka the green inferno to shoot a documentary about the native cannibal tribes after a short period of shooting they discover that the footage they have shot so far is not spectacular enough so they decide to stage the whole thing their misbehavior is put at an end when they come across one of the real cannibal tribes of the region when the home front discovers that the crew shows no sign of life they decide to send out a rescue mission these people an anthropologist and his guides retrieve the original footage that the missing crew has shot and they bring it back to the usi decided to wait for the uncut european version of the film because i am not a fan of censorship each individual should be able to decide for himself what he wants or doesnt want to see but this can only be the case with fiction this film however contains actual footage of animal killings a snake is beheaded a spider is squashed a monkey is scalped a turtle is beheaded and afterwards eaten a pig is shot in the headand this is not the essence of a horror film horror movies are supposed to be fictional stories with great special effects and effective story lines that entertain or scare you with their originality movies like this one give the horror scene a bad name and why this film is famous for its great special effects the special effects in this movie are so bad that every scene that contains one of these so called effects is shot out of focus the filmmakers get away with it because they can use the excuse that it has been shot using small portable cameras the only times the gore is convincing is when they use actual guts from real animals and make it look like it came from a human body the story line of the movie is completely unbelievable with footage of rape and torture that are just thrown in without adding any originality whatsoever the mere reason they put this in is to shock the viewer even more they didnt succeed the makeup effects are weak just some guys painted white and wearing wigs made out of straw and the acting is probably the worst acting in the entire history of cinema the only positive thing i can say about this movie is that it contains some great images of the untouched fauna and flora of the rain forest this is however not the reason why i have bought this film it is said that deodato regrets that he has made this film and he should be it is a total waste of time and money,cruel

what you have in is a story about a group of people from nyu that go to document a culture of cannibals and never come back not that the story matters having watched i think three cannibal movies now this is three more than the average healthy adults lifetime recommended dosage it has become clear to me that they are nothing more than exhibitions of movie violence and sickness and in that area the movie succeeds brilliantly it is so tasteless and so disgusting that its amazing that things like this ever get madeand not just for the animal mutilations or the feces flinging yeah that really happens in this movie its not just a tshirt for smartass teenagers or the orgies of misogynistic violence but of course there are tons of naked natives in the movie many of them obviously underage but i guess that is just not a concern in whatever country the movie was distributed from i am guessing we are meant to be impressed by the feeding scenes since logic would lead you to believe that that is what a cannibal film centers on if so maybe that explains why all the natives must smear their food all over their faces before they eat it although i am at a loss to explain why women are regularly mutilated dismembered fornicated with and then eaten it becomes clear early on that surely someone in the group of nyu people must snap unable to take what theyre seeing anymore and of course it does happenone guy since the natives distrust them maybe it was all that shooting decides to strip naked to become like them evidently this man has never seen the whiteness of his naked self before but the island girls dont seem to mind as soon as this awkward white guy strips off his khakis a whole group of naked girls run up to him and start grabassing for a little while hey maybe cannibals arent so bad after alloh but minutes later the group are forced to eat human as is to be expected the natives gleefully shove entrails in their faces as they inexplicably turn into savages for the purpose of this bizarre plot why the instant and total descent into barbarism i have no idea the movie isnt intelligent enough to explain such a thing all it knows how to do is show you something that you would be much better off never seeinga giant turtle is torn apart alive with bare hands while the cameraman zooms in for an extreme closeup so as not to miss a single revolting detail a monkey gets its face cut off a backwoods amputation is cauterized with a hot machete and when the poor amputee immediately dies the rest of the crew forget seconds later laughing and joking in the subsequent footage this is of course all documentary footage that theyre watching of a past film crew it seems that these mental giants went into the village and started screaming and shooting their guns and burning the village and then wondered why they were massacred it is not exactly a massive intellectual surge when one of the new crew says these people probably think were the savagesyeah what tipped you off the burning of their village or the fornicating in the ashes clearly this is meant to be the movies thinly disguised message white people are savages at least as much as the people that we think of as savages oh and in case you didnt happen to catch that message when it smacked you in the head numerous times like a ton of bricks at one point the civilized people grab one of the native girls and rape her trying to show her the errors of her ways cleverthese people are nothing like any manner of civilized people they are absolute degenerates and should be imprisoned they even shout for joy when they find a woman impaled on a pole what the hell is this garbagebut in watching a movie like this it seems to me that it is the people that would make and distribute something like this that are the savages at least horror movies are fun even bad ones and this is not a bad horror movie its not a horror movie at all i dont know what you would call it but it is truly horrible a mother gives birth to an infant in the movie for example the baby is taken away from its mother drenched in blood and then buried in the mud while the mother is beaten to death with rocks there is a point in the movie where the utterly talentless writer evidently unaware of how breathtakingly obvious his story is has one of his characters spoonfeed you the real meaning of the movietoday people want sensationalism the more you rape their senses the happier they arethis sentence betrays a staggering lack of understanding of filmgoing audiences but at least it is a flawless description of the thought behind the movie too bad you have to watch it to learn that you should never have watched it,cruel

and im including krakatowa powers and the geyserettes 1997 in there has always enjoyed that special sort of notoriety that comes from been banned in various territories but whereas some movies get the cull for reasons of selfcensorship or cultural sensitivity a clockwork orange for example holocaust is a thick soup of voyeuristic demented violence and gore  censored despite the fact that the sort of people whod want to see it more than once are precisely the type of malforms that will get a copy anyway whereas most others would either chose not to watch it or start to and realise that its a load of old crap indeed its got internal organs galore but curiously no brains banning it serves no purpose other than to give it an aura it doesnt deserve it is when all the hype is cut away say like the guts of a giant turtle a supremely souldestroying pointless experience artistically worthless the only reason to watch it at all is to see how much worse its going to get and im not spoiling anything for you by saying that your looking at quite a scale and the journey is long and tough the story or hook if you like is that some movie makers go into the jungle encounter a tribe of base savages who eat their fellow man and get horribly brutalised murdered and consumed but luckily for us the whole thing is captured on film this is preblair witch stuff with a great deal more calories conceived by deodato the wouldbe snuff peddler when those directors were chestlunching to say that ol holocaust is hard going is just ever so understating the case many movies claim to be a difficult watch but in this case the real holocaust might have been a preferable experience men and women have equal reason to fear its many stomach churning sequences for the boys itll be the scene in which some poor sod has his penis excised from his genital space and eaten while the baying mob disembowel him alive girls sit back and look forward to the woman mounted vaginally on a spear scene and lets not forget the animal snuff pigs monkeys turtles  you name it they get it if youve always thought that babe was missing the scene in which he gets the bullet or that finding nemo might have worked better with a display of turtle guts then this is the flick youve been waiting your whole life to see scalped monkeys are the perfect antidote to all those cutesy born free type movies weve had to suffer over the years but the directors a brave man because if the alf ever see this hell need to be checking the underside of his car with a mirror for life there was a lot of nonsense when this was made about it being snuff and those sensitive italians didnt like the animal slaughter this is the nation that invented fascism but the authorities may have wondered why youd release a film that portrayed you murdering your cast its damning evidence after all  why not just murder them in the end the only people who really get slayed are the audience but not in a funny way  if its this or while you were sleeping its still the bullock moviebut only just of course,cruel
i hate to talk about the films that i hate but a person who loves movies dont have any alternative for that reason as i enjoy talk about the movies that i love i think that sometimes i can talk about the films that i hate but this time is the hated film until this moment i dont think that anyway suppers this piece of garbagecannibal holcaust is about 4 filmmakers who do documentaries 3 men and a woman who go to the deep jungle in south american to film about the different hide cannibal groups that i think that now are extinct the supposed filmmakers dont appear time later a doctor go in their search only for found that they are eaten by the cannibals but they found too a tape then back in the city the doctor try to convince then to others that the film not must be showed and we going to see whyfor much this film is one of the best ever made  for me and for much others this is just a exploitation film that go to the extreme disguised as a social film if you see the real intentions of ruggero deodato it was only to make a cannibal film but not as a social commentary if only as a horror film i can say that this film is not even bad of course that its wonderful that movies treat social topics about different cultures about media abuse and domination for that you can see shock treatment or network seems to bring that message but really dont its only another gore film that dont have any intent more than give repulsive moments the film dont have any intelligent horror this film dont going to scare you it goes to make revolve your stomachfor me is trash is not cinema and is not art not even a regular soundtrack by riz ortolani can save it and much time i get surprised seeing all the people who defends a movie like this of course is likes and i respect them and believe me i always try to dont say bad commentaries of films so quickly but i dont see any reason to save itat all if you want to see an horrible film totally inhuman with real animals which suffer until death it is worth to clarify that all the polemic of real human deaths was just rumors and is not truth this is the film for you if you want real art a real social commentary a real horror film or just a good film dont even think about it dont watch itsoldier warned dont die at warsorry for the mistakeswell if there any,cruel
is garbage at its absolute worstfirst off this film is commonly referred to as disturbing truly the only two things truly disturbing about this flick are the animal killings and the appalling atrocious acting directing and writing first there was absolutely no need to have actors kill real animals this is hack work both literally and figuratively at its absolute worst at the sacrifice of defenseless beasts watching a turtle get decapitated and eviscerated does not fall into the category of enjoyable viewing for meas for everything else in this film what a crude barbaric amateurish attempt at filmmaking people talk about the special effects as being so convincing i was so convinced in fact when i saw the cannibals blatantly miss stabbing the girl with their spears that i would have laughed had i not been so awestruck by just how pathetic this movie is and why oh why are these documentarians out to destroy villages kill innocent villagers and rape women arent documentary makers supposed to avoid interacting in the fates of their subjects the four filmmakers were so obnoxious and downright cruel and evil that i actually enjoyed when the cannibals killed and ate themdeodatos masterwork is a cheapjack con job which in the hands of a talented director could have been disturbing im only disturbed that i took 1 hour and 37 minutes to watch this atrocious garbage when i could have been saving a turtle,cruel
its pretty sad people call this art this was just disgusting im not a person who dislikes gore i can stand it and i like it im not some animal rights pusher i support it but if it were me or the dog the dog would die now this was just truly disgusting and cruel they did things to these animals that is so i want to cry horrible i just think what was the unimaginable pain of that muskrat or the turtle or the monkey and fing a vgin with a wooden stake wtf who sits down and comes up with this and if you do you dont film it i love artistic movies like the tracey fragments and the blair witch project but this was by no means art this was a journey through a disgusting slaughterhouse what saddens me is that you people act as if it werent real well honey those animals died for you entertainment now thats what i call art,cruel
truly is one of the most disturbing and uncomfortable films ive ever had to sit through released in 1980 has gained a reputation over the years as being one of the most controversial films ever made and rightfully so its hard to recommend a film like this especially considering all of the brutal onscreen violence rape dismemberment genital mutilation and real animal killings however whether youre a fan of it or not you have to admit it is a very well made film from its shocking visuals to its griddy realism is a very effective film that successfully gets its point across it shows us a very ugly dark side of humanity which most people would like to believe doesnt exist the movie also has quite a sporadic fan base with famous directors like oliver stone quentin tarantino and sergio leone all supposedly being confessed fans of it if youre looking for a fun horror film to watch with friends this is definitely not one of them its very unsettling and makes you feel horrible after viewing it this movie is not for the squeamish faint of heart or easily offended only recommended to the most hardcore of horror fans you have been warned,cruel
ruggero deodatos repulsive masterpiece in horror is probably the most controversial horror film in existence ive heard and read about it for about five years before finally sitting down and watching the uncut version the delay was through my own fear of not having a strong enough stomach to be able to sit through the endless scenes of barbarity and sadism the film strongly divides audiences and i too am divided in my opinion of it as a piece of entertainment it doesnt work at all because the downbeat nature of the narrative and the graphic gore can hardly be enjoyed but then the film must work as a horror film a true horror film that can evoke feelings of anger disgust even sickness and fear undoubtedly the novel filming methods after the deliberately slow pacing of the initial setup the latter half of the movie becomes a mock documentary as in the blair witch project and just as horrifying make it the best of its bunch and the most effective of them all its the only cannibal film that comes close to resembling a mondo movie and the final events involving the student filmmakers are truly and horribly believable the only way to watch this film is to live the lie and the result is a challenging and disturbing but somehow rewarding viewing experiencethe movie is professionally made in that the filming seems unprofessional lacking gloss and shine and therefore more realistic the various expeditions into the jungle simply convey the humid atmosphere the constant danger from deadly wildlife and hidden tribes the first half of the film is slowly paced and gradually builds up to the horror with glimpses at a maggoty skeleton the camera zooms into the grubinfested eye sockets of the rotting skull and a tribal rape which is effectively powerful stuff however in comparison to the last half an hour this is childs play the supposedly real video footage shot by the students is harrowing and disturbing but doesnt engage the senses as much as one might think  mainly because the students themselves are far worse than the cannibal tribes they seek their actions are a catalogue of torture rape and even worse as they impale an innocent girl on a spike a painfully realistic  but simple  special effect and burn down a whole native village for the hell of it actions which of course act as a catalyst for the ugly conclusionevery five minutes something pops up which is likely to offend or shock a viewer somewhere whether it be graphic moments of sexual violence possibly the hardest parts of the film to sit through or at least the most uncomfortable or cheap but realistic gore effects of people having their legs sliced off and the like the cannibal antics of the finale are the most powerful part of the film as the filmmakers keep on shooting for the love of their documentary this is as horrible as the film gets and will have most viewers breaking out in a cold sweat blurring the border between fantasy and reality includes a segment of real news footage showing africans getting burnt and shot which is very hard to watchharder still to stomach are the scenes of animal cruelty the bane of this particular genre nobody can enjoy watching such scenes but they do add considerably to the films false reputation of being a snuff movie and their inclusion adds to the powerful impact that the film has on viewersproductionwise the quality is topnotch director ruggero deodato proves himself at the pinnacle of his career and directs the film he will be remembered for forever the camerawork is authentic and the acting works especially in the case of the student filmmakers who fill out their roles very well indeed muchneeded light relief comes from robert kerman eaten alive as the pipesmoking professor monroe who acts as the audience in viewing the discovered footage and who gets to utter the immortal line i wonder who the real cannibals are at the films conclusion the most effective aspect of the film is undoubtedly riz ortolanis emotive score which really adds to the overall impact that the film has its frankly brilliant like it or hate it is a film with a lasting reputation and i personally think its an original and deeply disturbing slice of almost reallife horror its a wonderful exploration of the medias obsession with violence and the lengths to which theyll go to exploit it and in this sense its like the 80s version of the controversial thriller natural born killers,cruel
lies within the annals of the horror genre with an immense reputation looming over it i like many had heard various things about the film over the years with the most general common threads being that it was disgusting and utterly abhorrent watching it for the first time i actually didnt know what the film was about and my assumptions of it being a mindless splatterfest were slowly eroded over the course of the film aside from being utterly shocked by its raw depiction of violence i was simultaneously shocked by the density of its social thematics and the skilled presentation of its imagerythe film essentially focuses on an nyu anthropology professor who travels to the amazon to observe local cannibal tribes and comes back with footage from a group of young documentarians who filmed there several months earlier before disappearing ruggero deodato presents the film in a framed narrative which tells the story of the anthropology professor as well as the persons whose footage he has obtained which is presented to us in its gritty 8mm format cinma vrit style the double narrative is just one of many unusual and interesting things happening in this film but its worth noting because its remarkably well balanced as has been noted there is a jarring sense of realism to the cinematography comparisons have been made to national geographic pictorials which i believe are apt comparisons as i at times felt like i was watching a national geographic documentary gone terribly terribly wrong narratively there are shades of joseph conrad lurking under the surface which come into play particularly during the problematic last half of the film in which the social commentary comes to the forefront its up to you whether or not the message is lost in its gratuitous translation and even then the message itself is problematic and loaded with historical implications that run deeper than the film can accommodate but it is no less a noble and impressionistic effort in forcing its audience to think about what they have just seenthe violence oh yes the violence its gruesome no doubt but i think its actually less graphic than most people believe it to be the reason it is so disturbing is because it is presented so unflinchingly and the special effects themselves are shockingly impressive far more grit and realism than something youd see in a lucio fulci film of the time period there is actual filmed murder of animals which is an entire issue in and of itself and something that did irk me as someone who has a moral position against killing animals did i like it of course not who would in a film of such horrendous subject matter though it is oddly fitting problematic in so many ways yes but i do believe there is a significance to seeing actual death on film of animals considering how removed most people are about what killing a living creature actually looks likeoverall i got way more than i bargained for with its a film whose moral implications run far deeper than the gorefest reputation it has attained and that was something that caught me completely off guard its uncompromising and often scarily realistic and above all else makes a confused albeit profound statement about what it means to live on this savage planet 910,cruel
the original purpose of the video nasties list drawn up in the uk in the 1980s was to assuage media driven hysteria originating from movies in the unregulated video market and with explicit and exploitative depictions of gore andor sex and which as a result were seen as a threat to public morality these days it all seems ever so shrugworthy as stripped of the hysteria most video nasties invariably fail to have any effect on the viewer and are revealed to be the bad films they are bucks this trend in a major way in both having an intelligent point to express about humanitys savagery as relevant then as much as now and doing so in a manner which despite some patchy acting and directing retains the power to challenge and shock even the more jaded modern film buff ie methe plot of the movie sees professor monroe travel into the south american jungle to find out what happened to a group of three documentary film makers who have gone missing he eventually finds a primitive tribe who seem to have the documentary crews lost film reels and through befriending the tribe manages to retrieve them back in the city the filmreels are shown to some executives and the full horrors of the expedition are revealed so far so typical exploitation video nastybut both the realistic depiction of some of the horrors via the found footage format which this movie basically started and which would go onto to spawn the likes of the blair witch project 1999 and cloverfield 2008 are so well done that there is a story that upon finishing the film and returning to italy the director was suspected of actually killing the actors in the film and had to track them down to prove that it was not a snuff film apocryphal or not the story captures the mood of the film and indeed the animal cruelty scenes are actually real and may sincerely disturb some viewershowever the violence is not for no good reason the movie is not about entertainment in any respect and instead sets out to provoke the audience into looking at society with a critical eye as well casting the same critical eye on our own dirty reflections the film does this by playing with the sympathies of the audience and showing that rather than the cannibals being the primitive savages we imagine them to be at the outset the civilized filmmakers and executives are equally if not more barbaric and heartless furthermore the film avoids the trap of heavyhanded moralizing and instead shows the sickness and brutality inherent in us all heavy stuff and really not for those of a nervous disposition or those who delight in typical video nasty splatterfest romps,cruel
i really loved aspects of it was far gorier and shocking then any of other of the so called video nasties ive watched so far and it was put together with aplomb although this wasnt the first film to use fake documentary footage its incredibly realistic and undoubtedly bought the technique to a mainstream audience influencing if not directly the last broadcast the blair witch project and cloverfield much like the blair witch project it was deliberately implied during promotion of the film that the four documentary filmmakers were not actors and that the recovered footage shown in the film was real unlike the blair witch project this claim is slightly preposterous as half of the film is shot in a traditional cinematic waythe gore in is at times incessant but still manages to maintain its realism and shock factor one infamous scene shows a woman impaled on a tall wooden stake the spike protruding through her mouth the effect was so realistic the filmmakers had to explain how it was achieved in court to avoid a murder charge the marketing trick of blurring the line between fantasy and reality obviously worked on the italian authoritiesis a damning criticism of the medias tendency to focus on horrific images when covering war and violent conflict at the time various news agencies had been accused of faking such images to improve ratings more broadly the film questions who is more uncivilised the cannibals with their unusual and primal rituals or the civilised filmmakers who exploit them for ratings and cheap shocksalthough often lacking in subtlety s script makes its point well especially during the last half of the movie when the viewer is shown the recovered reels of films these scenes are narrated by the disapproving professor ensuring that even a ten year old can understand the underlying point of the film the documentary makers not only exploit the tribes by filming their day to day rituals in a lurid manner but they also interfere terrorise murder and rape the tribes people to elicit responses for them to film when the documentary makers discover the woman impaled on a spike the cameraman has to tell one of the men on film to stop smiling he cant help showing his glee at finding something so horrific to capture on celluloidthe original cut of the film lingers on a depressing amount of animal cruelty presumably because its a cheap way to make the viewer question what is real and what is fake after all these crazy uncivilised tribes will cut anything up for some wacky ritual or a quick bite the films just showing what happens in the real world rightand this alludes to my problem with how can one point the finger at media for exploitation when the filmmakers themselves think its acceptable to film an extended sequence of giant turtle being caught decapitated and gutted just for a cheap thrill how can they justify cutting a live monkeys face off twice to get all the shots required in the name of art or to make a political point the filmmakers are either completely naive or worse making a film they know is exploitative and immoral using the political message as a getout clause something to excuse the barbaric and stupid stupid stupid animal cruelty its heartening to read interviews with the directors and actors expressing remorse for using animal cruelty but this doesnt excuse itis in parts a fun film but it cant escape its own hypocrisy its a shame that the animal cruelty happened because without it the film would be a sure fire classic,cruel
what can i say  i would like to rate this movie a 20 out of 10 for the pure horrofying shocking heart devouring impact it had on me and a 50 out of 10 for its attempt to approach the reality of a documentary  because at first thats what i thought it was  but then i read somewhere that in the making of this movie the animals were actually tortured and that this part was no se work in total six animals are brutally killed on screen  a large screaming coatimundi often mistaken as a muskrat is stabbed multiple times in the neck by an actor  a large turtle about three feet long is captured in the water and dragged to shore where it is then decapitated and its limbs and shell removed the actors proceed to cook and eat the turtle  a large spider is killed with a machete  a snake is killed with a machete  a squirrel monkey is captured by a native actor portraying a tribesman who cuts the monkeys face off with a machete while it is struggling and then eats the brains  a pig is kicked and then killed with a rifle when shot in the head by an actoralthough im the kinda guy that likes to be shocked now and then and have his blood being pumped faster through his veins by a film this is not quite what im looking for when i consult the horror section when i found out a couple of years ago that ch was not a real documentary of people molesting hammer smashing killing and eating each other that was a relieving thought and a weight of my chest and heart however i will not support any film that includes the intentional harming of a creature in order to capture its screamings in pain on tape sickening  no thanks,cruel

i wont go over the plot for two reasons one the less you know about a horror film going in the better and two the plot is almost legendary by now so youve probably heard about it already with that said heres a very quick summary to get you started some people film a documentary they disappear the footage is found later and watchedthis movie was disturbing the deaths are realistically shot and the grainy stock footage quality plus the believability of the situation makes it truly shocking and horrific but that didnt warrant the 1 i gave it horror films true horror films are supposed to be shocking  thats their nature films that make people take that force people to participate in debate because of their extreme nature always are a good thing movies are there to provoke reaction anything less is failure on the part of the filmmakersso in that respect it was a stirring successhowever there are scenes of animals being tortured then killed now this alone would have been fine and would have added to the films horrorhad it been faked like the deaths of the people it wasnt every bit of animal torture and death is real the animals died all for a movie and thats shocking for all the wrong reasonsso i was forced to give it a 1 and if it was possible a 0 people have made the argument that the pain and suffering incurred by the animals were warranted because of the pain and suffering that goes on in the wild everyday amongst the predators and their prey this is a bad analogy predators kill and eat their prey because they have to they need to kill and eat to live the filmmakers tortured and killed these animals to make a 70s horror movie see a difference the fact that the tribe ate the animals afterward is inconsequential  it wasnt necessary and if its not necessary theres absolutely no excusehorror movie lovers will undoubtedly like this film for its uncompromising brutality logical minds who think about the real deaths wont,cruel
this is a bad movie do not believe anyone who claims any of the followingthe gore effects are so realistic this movie has a powerful message the music in this movie is so haunting its amazing the acting is so excellentthis movie falls apart under the weight of its own pompousness filled with an annoyingly high sense of selfimportance and selfrighteousness the entire movie plays out like some twisted morality play that takes itself far too seriously the acting is pretty terrible from start to finish particularly the doomed film crew yes i know that italian films are filmed without sound and dubbed in post it doesnt matter ive seen many italian films using that method that featured excellent performances there is not one performance in this movie that comes anywhere near acceptable much less decent the performances are so bad that i couldnt even be compelled to dislike the film crew i just didnt care the music is annoying phil glasstype garbage and it sounds like two pieces were written and deodato alternates between the two anyway the same music is featured over and over again with no variation another element inspiring apathy its one thing to have a theme that plays throughout a films score but to use the same piece of music ad nauseum is another completely the music becomes gratingly annoying by the end of the film and when the movie ends the end of that awful music is just one reason you are glad the movie is overapparently im the only person to ever see this movie and think the gore effects are incredibly unconvincing the gore effects fooled me never for a second nor did they even inspire me to suspend disbelief or become squeamish like the eyesquishing from kill bill 2 as for the animal slaughterings im no member of peta but these are completely unnecessary the muskrat killing is particularly hateful purposely drawn out for no other reason than for shock purposes perhaps deodato was sending a subliminal message about how watching this movie will make you suffer like this unlucky muskratin the end after watching this movie the only reaction i experienced was that this movie was two hours of my life that i will never get back,cruel
political correctness is not something i usually expect to see in an italian cannibal gutmuncher flick and theres none to be found in but the filmmakers would like you to think theres some in there and that in a way actually hinders what could have been a really powerful movienot that isnt outrageously violent and extremely disturbing at times but like so many other serious exploitation movies eg salo men behind the sun the filmmakers go so far over the top depicting the spilling of blood and guts that whatever points they purport to want to make are drowned in their own gruesome sensationalismthis is especially counterproductive in because it is the very thing that director ruggero deodatto claims to be satirizing the movie lacks the sophistication of george romeros dawn of the dead or stanley kubricks clockwork orange two similar movies which tackle their social commentary with wit and styleits similar to and better than oliver stones natural born killers in that it claims to be a satire of the medias passion for presenting violence and depravity to audiences who eat it up while its really just an exploitation of it deodatto like stone smacks you over the head with a bludgeon making his points so obviously and selfrighteously that they go right out the window and the movie winds up being little more than a freakshow of eyepopping special effects and nauseating live animal slaughterthe animal slaughter in is especially offensive more so than any other of this odd subgenre because most of it is perpetrated by the explorers and not the supposedly real native cannibal tribe in cannibal ferox and jungle holocaust one can make an attempt to condone the violence against animals only because it appears to be committed by jungle dwelling people as part of their natural routine one cannot make the same excuse for but if youre looking for outlandish sleaze and carnage look no further than its definitely a mustsee for any selfrespecting cannibal movie fan everyone else should steer way way clearit was obviously an inspiration for both the last broadcast and the blair witch project,cruel
stay away from this poorly directed and acted snuff film if you like watching real animals being murdered for on screen entertainment then you should have your state of mind reviewed this film crosses into snuff territory for the sake of failed attempts at hyperrealism but unlike the french film base moi and pornography where you assume all participants are willing in scenes of extreme violence or sex the director deodato crosses the line and films the screams of an innocent jungle creature as an actor rips its guts open other animals are killed later but i couldnt be bothered watching such cruelty for the sake of what this film discredits the horror genre and is an actual cause for censorship something that doesnt sit well with any lover of films and especially horror films do yourself a favor and dont part with any money towards grindhouse realeasing who are making money off this vile maggot infested mess,cruel
going into a film like its difficult to know what to expect anyone who has any interest has read all the hype  the most disturbing movie ever made banned in 60 countries real animal killings director ruggero deodato had to go to court to prove the human killings werent real etc what i didnt expect to discover was such a wellmade film parts of the film are indeed very brutal and at times difficult to watch there are images in the film that i wont soon forget the story is incredibly compelling because it is so real tribes of indians similar to the ones presented in this film did and in some cases do exist in the south american rain forests i suppose that if someone were looking for a deep meaning to deodatos film they might point to the man vs nature aspects of the film where nature is represented not just by the animals but by the natives as well i suppose one could find something in the notion of who the real savages are  the natives or the filmmakers who exploit them but the most amazing thing about is that somehow deodato has made it very beautiful,cruel

youve got horrorand then youve horror with a capital h and surely belongs in this last category its a misunderstood masterpiece that yet has to find an equal unlike the savage and schlock title leads you to believe theres much more to discover in this film than just gore bad dubbing and shocking rites in the very first place its a portrait of extremes the socalled civilized world versus the savage tribes in the columbian rainforest in a subtle way ruggero deodato asks the question who the real cannibals are in this filmthose whore just following their traditional and ancients lifestyles or those whore full of disrespect and willing to sacrifice everything in order to shoot a controversial story the basic plot handles about a young filmcrew who mysteriously vanished while shooting an anthropology documentary their footage is retrieved by a university professor robert kerman and hes given the chance to broadcast the documentary after all butthe horrible and inhuman truth as shown by the recovered footage explains the crews disappearance more clearly and it questions severely whether they deserve a tribute or not a funny detail to this movie is that it more or less spoofs exploitative filmmaking while its practically an exploitation film itself nonetheless the film is surprisingly professionally made with a terrific cinematoghrapy and good editing the most barbaric sequences become unforgettable thanks to the magnificent and intense musical score by riz ortolani enjoys an immense cultstatus in cinema and its one of the only films who deserves this for a 100 im not going to debate whether the vicious animalkilling scenes are real or not because frankly i dont care and they contribute a lot in the breathtaking realism and effectiveness of this film should be avoided by the fainthearted whining moralists and easily offended pansiesall the rest of you watch deodatos greatest achievement and acknowledge its power,cruel
why everyone say so good things of a worthless garbage as this it is just pure sadomasochism and shows that some sick people should never be able to direct moviesthe gore fans hail this movie and keep saying that it had a deep story we should add hypocrisy to the bad things of this moviebecause if the message of this movie is against sensationalism then why this movie just feed it with morbid publicity the big deal of this movie was the fake rumors that the people in this movie were really killed that wasnt true and only the animals were killed that cruelty doesnt not make this movie to be more realistic it only made it more disgustingthe acting is mediocre just as the story i guess thats because most of the cast only worked in porn movies before the script was incredibly pretentious and vainis in my opinion nothing more than overrated garbage directed by one talentless hack ruggero deodato a filmmaker who never made a single good filmi just dont understand why some people could say that this disgusting trash was something beautiful  yeahsure if you consider rape or see how a idiot open a turtle and show his organs in a full frontal scene as something nice to watch this is one of the worst movies ever made,cruel
ive watched this movie after seeing all the good comments reviews and the trivia section saying that the director was in prison and all i was mislead into thinking this might be a really good moviethe acting is bad i dont know why there are so many reviews saying that it is good the camera shake makes it look like its real but you can tell at the first glance that it is notthe plot is weak and the violence is not what i expected it is not brutal its just something that might look brutal and have an impact but in another movie with a different crewbasically if you would take aside the animal killing which is for real it doesnt bring anything to the movie and is just disgusting  i dont know how some people can enjoy watching that you would end up with a movie that doesnt make you feel anything no tension no disgust no fear no nothing just a waste of timeavoid at all costs,cruel
follows a film crew as they delve into the amazonian jungle and end up discovering the true meaning of horror this plot line sounds remarkably similar to the 1999 travesty the blair witch project but im pleased to say thats where the similarities end as the crew in the worst film ever made may well have found a true horror if thats what you consider a few sticks and stones to be but even so it doesnt even nearly compare to actual horror which is what the film crew in this film found is a remarkable horror film because unlike the majority of the rest of the genre this film depicts events that actually do take place in the world as the film claims towards the beginning theres so much we dont know about our own planet and the dense jungles of south america represent one of the greatest unknowns and therefore makes for a great setting for a movie it has to be said also that ruggero deodato makes best use of his location and as the actors venture into the jungle a constant foreboding atmosphere hangs over them which does the film no end of favours in the tension departmentone of the many things that this film is notorious for is the fact that the animal killings in the film are real this is something that i definitely dont like as i can honestly see no reason why animals should die just because ruggero deodato decided to make a movie its also shocking that the perpetrators of this animal cruelty werent sent down of course the animal deaths help the film because it adds to the atmosphere but really special effects would have sufficed the violence in the movie isnt all senseless however as the director does have a point to make at several points during the film comparisons are made with the cannibals and our society and the question that surfaces most often is who are the real cannibals this is where this movie comes into its own as one the surface its just a violent exploitation flick but beneath that its a rather potent comment on society the gore in the film is brutal and very realistic which is always nice for a horror fan such as myself to see if youre not a horror fan however is a film that you should stay away from but if you dont mind gore youre in for a rare treat with this movie its controversial for a reason and it really needs to be experienced,cruel
civilized mans heart of darkness is explored in this predecessor of the blair witch project about three young men and a young woman plus a guide who trek into the south american jungle with ulterior motives for a documentary and successfully find cannibals but with lessthansuccessful results  how about cannibal apocalypse for this one vs deodato comparable jungle holocaust unlike in the terrible blair witch however we see most of the characters most of the time and although they are distasteful they are certainly dramatically compelling there are juxtapositions of the goingson back home and the group of people that later track the expedition party but the search for and confrontation with the cannibals are the principal focus   deodato combines extremely graphic displays of depravity and violence torture and mutilation on men and women people and animals for their own sake with his efforts to communicate who is really the savage and succeeds on both counts  the explorers are young greedy and egomaniacal willing to do the ultimate in damage to living beings as a means to their own fame and fortune  the cheap highschool character and mindset of the explorers creating a false stage for themselves magnifies the presentation of the worst whiteman stereotype  they are just jerks and you enjoy disliking them  expectations and failure of the expedition are mirrored back home in civilization where presumptuosness and greed are also prevalent but then shattered as for the acting specifically the main three and partially the usually hidden camaraman it was amazingly convincing  it may be that the camerawithinthemovie contributed to this and was used skillfully in terms of distance and angles and selection to contribute to the realism of a relatively uncomplicated situation of people passing through a jungle but make no mistake about it yates and his companions are as believable as natural as they are repugnant  and the overall cinematography as well as the music was excellent  yes all this but paramount is just the opportunity to watch the scenes in the last part of the film unfold  you will not forget them,cruel
is a unique and powerful film which has been treated disgracefully by the media since its release over twenty years from the predictable cries of snuff movie through the heavy criticism of the animal killings and the condemnation of the exploitative footage the critics missed the point completelyits a chilling look at an unknown culture and it tells us a lot about our own civilisation the documentary team unlikeable as they are at least inject the film with a degree of zest the same cannot be said of the ugly hateful cannibals with their lank hair grotesque pygmy bodies and ridiculous ritualsthe descent into chaos for the final twenty minutes so is shocking in its extremes and realistic in its execution professor monroes unanswered question on the new york street at the films will linger on in many a viewers mind after theyve watched thisdisgracefully banned in a number of countries is a film which needs to be seen by as wide as audience as possibleguage your own reaction810,cruel

is it real or is it fake no matter your view its realistic as hell your stomach will turn in this film there is no denying that but for some they can see past the blood and gore to reveal a truly iconic film i am one of those it does get full on more full on than its good for but without that extremity of violence and rape the film would be a monotone adventure through the amazon and no one wants a pg cannibal film expect to be grossed out and stunned as you watch real animals brutally ripped apart and male genitalia removed entertaining as hell to the people that can handle it and if you can handle there awaits a glorious expedition into the darkest areas of the secluded human race,cruel
its impossible to talk about without mentioning the blair witch project blair witch is wrongly labelled as inventing the found footage genre when in fact it simply rebooted it did it almost twenty years previouswe hear at the beginning how four young filmmakers travelled deep into the jungle only to never be heard from again a professor curious as to their fate retraces their path and finds their footage what you have here is two stories in one you have the more traditional hollywood storytelling of the professor talking to tv executives about showing the found footage on network television and the footage which was retrieved from the jungles first person ala blair witchi only got to see the edited uk version of this film but the footage both from the professor who follows them and the filmmakers themselves remains as shocking today as it was at the time was banned at the time of release and even had claims of being a stuff film ie one where real people are killed on camera this maybe untrue but viewers should be warned that although the people who die are all just covered in fake blood and prosthetics real animals were killed for the making of the film those with strong views on this may wish to steer clearhowever the animal cruelty is only fleeting what you have are pretty strong scenes of torture which make the hostel franchise seem tame in comparison the footage being shot in the eighties and on non professional cameras gives the film a deliberately raw feel about it which even the blair witch project cant even match plus you have the music which is both creepy and tranquil at the same timeas you have probably guessed the filmmakers on film meet a grisly end at the hands and teeth obviously of the cannibals in the jungle although where we probably felt sorry for those behind the camera in blair witch and other such films here the filmmakers were pretty horrible some may see that they got what they deservedits hard to enjoy this film in a traditional viewing sense yet it remains a deserved lynchpin in the horror genres historybottom line for those with strong stomachs onlyhttpthewrongtreemoviereviewsblogspotcouk,cruel
four college age kids disappear their footage is found what was once thought to be an amazing documentary ends being the most brutal representation of human monstrosityis shockingly brutal and gruesome if you didnt know the animals in this film were actually killed during filmmaking hence why its the most controversial film of all timeit feels completely ahead of its time with amazingly realistic images this is probably the most brutal film ive ever seenthe acting was very realistic the music and camera work help add to the eeriness of it allthis is basically the birth of the found footage subgenrewhile i agree what they did killing the animals was horrible and unforgivable i feel the director and actors should be held accountable but the movie itself should not be considered trash due to thatit has an amazing story thats really quite poetic questioning who are really the monsters if you can stomach it its a must see an american horror classicrecommended rating r for disturbing brutal violence including rape and animal cruelty graphic nudity and a strong sex scene,cruel
finding entertaining may well come down to personal boundaries of taste for is an uncompromising exercise in exploitation filmmaking about as far as you can take it it contains scenes of real animal cruelty which are far more sickening than the rehearsed acts of violence in the film it seems a common ingredient in a lot of cannibal films which have understandably been criticised and black listed because of it but for anybody to suggest it has any redeeming social commentary to make maybe looking too deeply into something that is simply not thereadmittedly deodato the director deserves his dues for an exploitation pic is a lot more crafty and manipulative than most and is certainly the better of a pretty awful bunch of movies but that doesnt mean its all that good in its own right either despite its shortcomings it does manage to effortlessly attract the curious like a bad roadside accident and has the same strange unclean and hard to ignore quality which ultimately becomes a nauseating experience leaving the viewer wondering why the hell they are watching this sickening display something a few of the video nasties have in common the other being that most of them are plain trash recently has collected more of its fair share of attention with people pointing out similarities with the blair witch project and its use of lost footage and a storyline of a film crew ending up in st creek down in the woods or in this case the jungle unfortunately this is giving the cannibal film a bit of cheap publicity riding on the back of the more recent genuine bit of clever student film making that blair witch is personally i believe should remain an obscure oddity because a film that delights in animal torture has no right to be more than even that  like i said in the beginning i guess its a question of taste or lack of it if you are on the look out for some kind of queer cheap thrill some may find in the carnage of an autoaccident which lets face it can be pretty horrific if youre into that kind of thing or perhaps you are simply intrigued by so many peoples comments you may be suckered in by attempting to find this movie but on the other hand if deodatos disregard for both human and animal life sickens you and i hope it does as much as the director relished putting it up there on screen i can only hope youre choice in whether to watch is more of a thoughtful than voyeuristic one,cruel
i pretty much saw here what i expected to see in a cretinous cheap italian exploitation horror film mutilation rape cannibalism of course authentic footage of animals being killed for the camera killing humans is still illegal so the filmmakers didnt do that as well decapitation a pointless sex scene with a flatchested italian woman and other idiotic stuffto all the losers on imdb and elsewhere who found social meaning in this id say keep in mind 3 things 1 this is an exploitation film and such films by definition pretend to have a higher moral agenda as an obvious excuse to help the viewer indulge in the basest of nonsense 2 this is a dumb horror film look no further than the violence and gore for meaning and 3 youre a fking moronwell we have the usual problems idiotic plot bad acting inept dialogue lousy photography stereotypical characterization clumsy editing etc the only surprise came in the form of the professor coming back to ny ie the unexpected change of setting but thats also when things took a decidedly imbecilic turn just so we can enjoy the eventual brutal slaying of the 4person missing crew they are presented to us as the worst kind of barbarians imaginable like a bunch of immoral immature criminals shouting and giggling like apes half the time  no strike that all of the time is this the horrormovie answer to animal house one might wonder who in the world would finance such a retarded bunch to film each other tying shoelaces let alone make documentaries in remote regions of the world in the end these 4 imbeciles actually end up filming each other getting slaughtered  instead of running for their lives  just so we can see each of them die its just too stupid for words severely retarded not to mention the fact that these 4 have no fear about invoking the wrath of remote tribes they know nothing about by raping their women and burning their huts and yet theyre supposed to be professionals who worked together for years ie should know better than to behave like degenerate dumb schoolkidspredictably the professor gets the last line with his ultrapathetic comment who are the real barbarians here i guess this line made all those morons think this movie had an intelligent message how easily suckered some people are into believing anything they see or hearthere was nothing shocking here because all the parts that show violence perpetrated on people are so fakelooking totally unconvincing the exceptions are the real footage the bozos who made this junk included of various executions in africa footage which is ironically referred to as fake by one of the ny characters however i was disgusted by the authentic scenes of animals getting butchered that sort of material shouldnt even be used in crap like this but left for faces of death and some such junk,cruel

an excellent film and by far the best of the cannibal genre the first half chronicling monroes journey to find the lost filmmakers is typical jungle survivalist stuff combating the elements and assorted wildlife while snorting a few lines of coke and frolicking naked in the nearest river it is the second half of the movie in which we see the documentary footage shot by the missing filmmakers in which shines the shaky handheld camera the straighttocamera delivery the choppy editing the varying focus and poor framing all add to a genuine sense of authenticity the whole thing makes blair witch which copied the conceit 20 years later seem extremely staged and phony by comparison the visual effects are outstanding and made all the more effective due to the realism of the filmmaking techniqueperformances despite others criticism are surprisingly sound and well above the norm for the genre only francesca ciardi possesses that laughable and vaguely embarrassing bad acting quality but her real purpose is of course to wander around naked which she does very well the script is linear and makes sense with none of the usual surreal leaps of logic and cavernous plot holes the music in cannibal movies is often unusually good and of a quality far beyond expectations s score is brilliant ranging from mellow 70s easy listening to traditional full orchestra suspense to modern abstract soundscapes while i miss the raucous chords of donatimagliones score for mangiati vivi and cannibal ferox theres no denying that riz ortalani is a far more talented composeras ever there is the usual moral message with characters spouting pseudoliberal nonsense whilst gazing profoundly into the middle distance this is of course as much a part of the genre as ritual gang rape and mud wrestling but in it is particularly hypocritical considering the obvious amorality of all involved while condemning the on screen filmmakers for encouraging acts of cruelty and violence deodarto encourages his actors to indulge in similar acts of cruelty and violence towards animals in the name of entertainment without the usual moral justification of observing tribal acts of survival whilst such scenes dont really harm the movie they make a mockery of any message deodarto may claim to convey and ask some serious questions about the ethics of both him and his castreally a very good movie that were it stripped of its scenes of animal cruelty would enjoy far more popular success isnt just good for the genre but a good movie in general and far more original and entertaining that anything seen in cinemas of late,cruel
what a surprise i sat down to watch a splatter film on a saturday night after the pub and found myself having to think and form an opinion i knew my thinking was not that straight after the beer so i watched it again the following day stone cold sober and i found i really liked this film it was not what i had expected the acting was not that bad the sound and filming acceptable in fact i really liked the music but it was the story that held me you really do side with the cannibals actually i would have made the film crew suffer a bit more they become more savage then the savages the savages do not break their societys codes the film crew leave very few of their societies codes unbroken this is a good film watch it if you must for the gore then try again as i did for the story and moral,cruel
has the name of being one of the most shocking movies ever made although it sure does live up its name of being shocking im not sure if its the most shocking because i never saw that many shocker flicks but i bet some mondo flicks are worse but the gore isnt really what make this movie so powerful and shocking the rape is worse but that isnt really he key element neither this movie isnt all about the gorerape it tries to shock you by putting you in the jungle with the crew and showing you what they did how purely evil they actually were offcourse it is fake but sometimes you really believe its all realone of the most shocking scenes had no gore or rape in it it just showed you how far these people would go for some images the most direct criticism of the movie was directed towards the makers of mondo cane shocumentaries ironically the makers did sort of the same by slaughtering a total of 6 animals in front of the camera even though this is offcourse gross and shouldnt have happened you should realize this is nothing at what happens on daily basis in our civilized community i am a vegetarian not without reason even thought the animals in this one are killed pretty brutality they died a quick death compared to the animals in the bioindustry but im rattling and probably boring you so lets get back to the movie the movie is about a crew of 4 3 men 1 woman who decide to go into the jungle of southern america the green inferno to search for 2 cannibal tribes in war they never came back and a rescue expedition is organized after a subtle progression in the green inferno they find the remains of the crew and the cans of film back in nyc a big tv company wants to air the material but the professor that was on the expedition knows what the material shows and tries to convince the tv dudes by showing them the most gruesome footage this includes a total of 5 scenes of rape a shtload of gore mutilation and other stuff that would surely gross out the average personthis movie isnt something you watch with a cup o tea with your parents you should realize before watching it that it does have some very intense and graphic images make sure you can take it and watch it it will be worth it very powerful intense and very well made movie never mind the acting its terrible with maybe an exception here and there it will leave you thinking about it for the next few days810,cruel
rugero deodatos controversial masterpiece of 1980 is without exaggeration certainly one of the most disturbing films ever brought to screen and an utterly brilliant and stunning cinematic experience that no one who is not too sensitive for this can afford to miss gruesome disturbing and brilliant but often misunderstood is not the average 80s cannibal exploitation flick one might expect but an utterly unique stroke of genius that can not really be compared to any other movie begins when new york anthropology professor harold monroe robert kerman is sent to the south american jungle in order to investigate the disappearance of a team of documentary film makers known for their hazardous journeys in order to achieve original footage filmmakers alan yates carl gabriel yorke faye daniels fraqncesca giardi jack anders perry pirkanen and mark tomaso luca barbareschi have disappeared after traveling to he amazon jungle in order to make a documentary about the green inferno where the last cannibal tribes are reputed to live i dont want to spoil the most brilliant moments of this masterpiece so in case you havent seen it i advise you not o read on but to rent or even better buy he uncut version and watch it as quickly as possible it is impossible to explain why this movie is so brilliant without giving away parts of the plot sowarning spoilers ahead  is a stunning film from the beginning but what makes this movie such an outstandingly brilliant masterpiece is its second half in which we become aware that it is actually not the socalled savages who are the monsters but the ambitious film makers who dont have the slightest scruples to murder rape mutilate and commit all sorts of abhorrent atrocities in order to get shocking footagesince its release this film has been one of the most controversial maybe the most controversial and widely condemned films ever made moralists have condemned it for the violence and because they misunderstood the movie furthermore the likes of animal protectors who probably dont give a damn about human rights but who scream murder as soon as a rat gets hurt keep complaining about the real animal killings in the movie this is debatable of course but i find it to be legitimate the animals were actually eaten by the crew and the scenes do add a raw and shocking mood worst of all ruggero deodato was even accused of actually killing human beings for his movie which was of course proved to be absolute nonsense and which is even more outrageous regarding the fact that it is the main aim of this film to criticize the unscrupulousness of some mediaend of spoilers  the raw and unique atmosphere in is built by the shocking story and documentarystyle filmmaking as well as some great camera work and the mesmerizing score by riz ortolani the performances are furthermore great and very authentic i can understand that this is too brutal and disturbing for many people and those who are easily offended should definitely avoid this film but to all others this is a mustsee director ruggero deodato created something incomparably shocking brilliant and unique and as far as i am considered alone makes deodato a genius all said is a stunning disturbing brilliant and absolutely unique masterpiece of filmmaking that not only horror fans but every serious lover of cinema who isnt too easily offended must see brilliant 1010,cruel
going into i was anticipating an exploitation movie with really nothing to share besidesbasically what everyone hears about the movie i did not expect the movie to give you options on how you feel i was expecting to be disgusted and disturbed i did feel both of those feelings but i felt much more the movie takes itself 100 serious with its morals its production especially the music everything this movie unfortunately is looked down upon by people just because of what they hear about it i also was tentative to seeing this movie because of a certain aspect  the animal killings they are killed for a purpose which they say in the movie they even have a scene where an actor is repulsed by the death every killing was done fast except one which was the one that bothered me most it was not the turtle one that still bothered me thoughwhile watching a movie sometimes you know that this could be about as perfect as they can make it this is one of those times it is a masterpiecei think sometimes that if they only had a different name for the movie more people would see it personally i love the title i find it to be badass but its such a hardcore title all you have to do is say it and you will see a cringe on someones facethe last line of the movie was exactly what you were supposed to think to yourself i have my answer thats for damn sure im again surprised that this quote is not as popular as it should be,cruel

someone loved it someone hated it ethically was a really well made film its not a gore fest or an animal dismember show it showed us that sometimes civilized guys like us could be worse than that senseless cannibals the plot and the cameras of this film made it a masterpiece just think about blair witch project and all the others horror movies that got the deodatos idea of the film inside a film the cast isnt exceptional it was a really low budget film starring some of the italians cabaret guys like barbareschi and sometimes it can be tasted by the viewer saying that this film is pointless just for some gore actions its stoopid in my humble opinion timing is perfect cameras are wonderful scenarios are great and the art direction is quite perfect even if you dont like it was a masterpiece many newer films copied it badly,cruel

one of the oddest pleasures in life is witness the work of a filmmaker who not just satisfies himself entertaining the audience achieves that after this trip to the deep corners of the savage nature of man its hard to forget ruggero deodatos masterpiece as a cyclic process in the late 70s and early 80s italian creators made for horror the same thing they did for the classic western in the 60s in 1974 tobe hooper created a savage tale inspired by ed gein murders the texas chainsaw massacre massacre shocked the audience for its raw cruel vision of the world but the ultimate piece of cruelty in film reached the surface some years laterruggero deodato was an exploitationdirector he could pick a movie of gladiators spaghettiwesterns or horror movies but for some strange design he ended up directing one of the most extreme violent and gritty films ever made and maybe to be able to make movies out of profit helped deodato creating this massive work of desolation despair and cruelty yet is not only a collection of brutal scenes one after the othersome calm and quiet music introduces us to what the world has come to name the cornerstone of civilization new york but if the movie is comprehended as it should be after the final titles close well have not only to feel disgust of how an inhabitant of the amazonas eats raw meat the first thirty minutes of holocaust work as introduction to the world of the tribes of the jungle in a semidocumentary style after minutes pass we see more and more of the brutal human nature at its best its a crescendo of blood and death that crushes the senses of the audience more and moredeodato uses nudism and a wide range of cinematically avoided elements to transport the audiences to a dark cornerstone of the mind we know but we refuse to accept inside this distorted view of reality we recognize we are not as civilized as we claimed to be we are greedy we kill for fun money or lust uses gore which is as realistic as it could be to be the ultimate lesson of how the self imposed habits of society create the ultimate butchery thats the reason why this could be made once and worked perfectly once finally holocaust is a moral tale it can be a real enlightening experience there are little chances that someone remains unchanged towards this work whether you define it as good or a bad movie,cruel
actually it is hard to even call this a horror movie horror movies tend to be about scary monsters that dont really exist the monsters in this movie are for real and the cannibals arent the only monsters in this movie after viewing this movie i felt like i had just witnessed something really bad like i needed to talk to a counselor i dont even know if there is anything i can say that hasnt already been said better this is not for the weak stomachedfor those who were offended by the animal killings yes it was hard to watch but from what i gather these animals were not wasted but eaten by the local people this is normal for many cultures for those who thought this movie was cruel to animals and are also meat eaters go visit a slaughterhouse sometime i love eating meat of all kinds by the way mmmmmmmmso for serious horrorexploitation film fanatics this is a must see but you have been warned this isnt nightmare on elm street,cruel
less gory as time goes on yet more influential hampered by special effects of the day the directory wisely chose to view the gore both from a distance and with quick implication we all know this was a statement but the statement pales as the years pass except for cinematic historians caught in this rally against ugly and genuine news delivered daily to those having dinner and the selfrighteous condemning films depicting fictional atrocities a mini gem was delivered to horror cinema history it would be easy to pass this off as a mondo somethingit aintthis offering to buffs has atrocious acting right on target acting colliding score and an unsettling fusion of documentary and movie the killing of animals on screen has been widely condemned but for much of the worlds population that understands the meat on our plate requires the killing of an animal unless you intend to cook an animal alive you must kill it first thats how it works want a hamburger you gotta kill a cow like bacon or sausage a pigs gotta die and someones gotta kill itthere is no chicken strip farm folks chickens are killed their carcasses divided into sections and you wind up with strips two piece snacks and family dinners or turtles or muskrats they all have innards that must be done away with and heads heads dont show up on menus youll find them if you look deeply enough in lunch meatscreated atrocities sensationalism over truth maybe the director had a point maybe he made it and in the meantime he created an uncomfortable cinematic venture to boot one that a full generation later is still capable of reaching inside us and grabbing us by our collective throttleswow,cruel

despite all my love for violent gory films i can barely tolerate this movie not because it shocked me but mostly due the contradictory and nonsensical message of this we the viewers are supposed to believe that this is a criticism of how the media makes the public hardhearted and indifferent toward the violence but deep inside is just a vulgar exploitative film that only wants to shock the audience there is absolutely no beauty fun or joy in this film it is ludicrous and disgusting but it takes itself way too seriously to be unintentionally funny or interesting ruggero deodato shows us the most shocking and disgusting scenes but unlike filmmakers as david cronenberg who are able to make the ugliest and most grotesque situations beautiful and poetical those scenes are just plain ugly and tastelessthe title of the movie promises us a cheesy gory bmovie and yet what it delivers is a dull pretentious and heavy handed tale of human cruelty without any kind of originality nor art is a complete mess it tries to be way too hard to be solemn and poignant and instead of that it ends being just nihilistic and boring yes there is a lot of blood sex and violence in this film yes the animal cruelty goes beyond anything that i had ever seen before but it is a good horror film i dont think so there are thrills no mystery or anything that should be considered as horror material just mindless graphic violence without any beauty thats all this movie was a huge disappointment to be especially after all the good things i have heard about it i simply hated it from beginning to end,cruel
is gritty intense and disturbing sadly it effects you the same way off screen for many days onwards this is the type of film that is tolerated on a gut level but should be by no means enjoyed whilst on the most part the animals slaughtered in this film were killed in true hunter gatherer fashion the treatment of the south american tribes depicted on film is truly something unforgivablethe directional style of this film isnt really direction in a conventional sense and the acting for most part seems entirely improvised this alone would make for an interesting pseudo realist picture but combined with the blood curdling violence and the unnecessary rape scenes and i will include the abortion of foetuses with that comment becomes something entirely different this is quite frankly a film spawned from the pits of hellsure one can argue that ruggero deodato and his crew of merry men were showing us a metaphor for our own westernised society but i beg to differ i can see no thought at all put into real life debates on consumerism war or gender roles this is exploitation at its pinnacle a loathsome experience by any standard the only thing more disturbing than watching is the thought of those in our existence who can frequently watch it with enjoyment,cruel
what a lame friggin movie i cant believe everyone going on about this like its the most disturbing thing ever put on filmgrow up watching this nonsense is a definite feat indeed not because of the content but because its so damn boring like i had to chain smoke just to keep my eyes openso it was banned big deal its not shocking its not disturbing its just stupidand yes i saw the uncut version like i kept waiting for these appalling scenes to come and they just never did then ten minutes later id be wondering if what already passed was one of those parts that was supposed to do what exactly make me feel sick close my eyes feel the horrorwhatever i mean everyone goes on about some rape scene oh its so shockingare you people for real its some guy motioning on top of some tribe girl like its almost laughable at how ridiculous the scene looks coupled with the fact that there is zero acting or emotion i mean it just comes off like a goof 90210 portrays stuff like this more realistically and im not saying i wanted the scene to be more realistic my point is on just how far from being actualized the ideas the incentive to shock or basically the whole damn movie really is total crap,cruel
im often interested in seeing a film to find out what all the fuss was about and usually to discover that once again a film has been unfairly criticised for its content without any thought being given to the points that the film was trying to makewas the exception with a title like that i should have known better but nevertheless i was staggered by what i sawi had the misfortune to get my hands on an uncut version of this disgusting film and i was amazed that it was possible to get together a large enough group of sick individuals to make something so appalling and on such a scalethis whole film is basically a fantasy for those who get sexual gratification from images of rape murder and animal cruelty and it presents it in the most unpleasant and lascivious tone imaginable then to make matters worse and in order to get around the censors the film makes a pathetic attempt to appear to condemn all the atrocities it has shown usthe awful and inappropriate nostalgia for the past hope for the future music merely adds to the depravitythis may sound melodramatic but i watched this film wondering if it would change me as a person as i looked upon it as nothing more than a series of purely evil images i should have turned it off but my habit of never leaving a film once ive started meant i sat through the whole thingthis movie is quite simply evil and only disgusting and seriously twisted perverts could have anything good to say about it,cruel
spoiler alert spoiler alertif youre a horrorexploitation fan you will eventually hear about all roads lead to it you will hear that its an intense experience full of carnage cruelty and unparalleled viciousness in a horror flick believe the hype is an experience worth having anyone who claims that this movie is weak or that theyve seen worse is lying nothing has topped it yetis a movie that will bring conflicting emotions out of you it pretends to condemn the violence that it shows when it is clearly reveling in it a professor ventures into the jungle to find some lost reporters all he finds is the film they left behind he takes it back to new york to screen it we get to see the film in parts and every part is brutally violent this is where the movies power lies the scenes in the reporters film are shot very realistically animals are actually killed which adds to the illusion of reality there are scenes in the film which show the reporters as being a corrupting influence on the tribe and stirring them up enough to warrant the tribes vengeance the last scene in the reporters film is intense this is what will stick with you after the movie is overso is an exploitation film or a brutal horror flick the answer to both is yes it is while the last scene is brutal it also flashes back to the professor watching the tape and has him and his fellow movie watchers acting revolted at what theyre seeing does this mean that we the viewers should also be morally disgusted or should we be thrilled to be watching such intense violence the movie offers no answers people who would watch a movie called want to experience some violent thrills and perhaps be disturbed as well pulls out all the stops when it comes to jungle carnage but then proceeds to condemn it like its disgusting filth why the movie wants to have it both ways is unknown it probably has something to do with the censorship at the time but it still leaves a bad taste in your mouththat said still must be seen it is certainly the greatest cannibal movie ever made it is also on the top five best exploitationhorror flick list a must see,cruel
refers to the uncut versionhaving seen this version i can understand why both the bbfc in england and the mpaa in the us have always had a problem releasing this in its uncut formunlike many other films that fall under the art category but are still shocking nonetheless guinea pig the devils experiment  salo to name but two this film has no purpose on this planet other than to put in front of you a nihilstic vision of the world and to purely and simply shock you into oblivion though on the other hand what do you expect when you send a bunch of people with cameras into the jungle thats populace is made of cannibalsbasically the version that many people all over the world have seen is the 86 minute cut in britain anyway almost everywhere else it has either been banned or is still under considerationin this version you seeless cruelty to animalsthe killing of a muskrat by the jungle tourguide the complete evisceration of a large turtle the kicking of a pig that is tied up the headslicing and blood drinking from a monkeys headless violence both sexual and well beating up and stuffan angry native dragging his adulterous wife through mud and forcing her legs apart the same angry native raping and humilating her with  what seems to be  a large wooden phallus the same angry native putting nails into a mudball and placing the same mudball with nails in the womans groinal arealess of the rape scene between the female camerawoman and her colleagues less of the female camerawoman being raped by the natives after they are overpoweredless nudity throughoutall in all the film has 5 minutes and 44 seconds worth of cutson one hand i can see after viewing the uncut version why these cuts were made to the british video release on the other hand i dont admire censorship and believe that people should choose whatever they wish to watch no matter how horrificthe question is  will these cuts be made to numerous other releases of the dvdlaser discvhswhether they do or they dont this film is still as shocking today as it was whenever it was first released so bear in mind that its not very pleasant whatever the version still you have to watch this film just to notice why just about every selfrighteous moral guardian in the world wore sandwich boards upon this films release,cruel
i first saw this film through a bad copy and since then am to still recover from the effectsto call this film beautiful or wellmade is insane there has to be something wrong with humanity if we can call castration animal killings and rape beautiful  this film in so many words is ugly and awful i got no enjoyment out of it at all just came out the room feeling quietly discustedi am a huge fan of the horror genre and respect such early works of directors like peter jackson a god and george romero but this isnt even a horror its the nearest thing to a poorly done snuff filmi understand that some quite sick people may find this picture remotely interesting for some unknown reason there are people who enjoy seeing a rare giant turtle being ripped open alive or a woman being raped and having her head smashed in by a rock on the aftermathif your after cheap thrills through real kills then this is the film for you but personally i feel youd have to have a screw loose to enjoy this poor atempt at film making,cruel
i first became a fan of the horror genre when i was around 14 years old and so i became fascinated to discover all the classics of the genre i started viewing films such as halloween and the exorcist and became obsessed with all the old classics i then started moving my way in on more violent and disturbing stuff for me at the time such as the saw series and eventually seeing and loving hardcore horror from other countries particularly france with inside and martyrs however one film was popped up on disturbing movie lists and that was reading how horrifying it was i decided to wait until i was over 18 i finally summed up the courage to watch it yesterday ive just turned 20 and was pretty bloody appalledis an uneasy mix of campy 70s naffness and utterly repugnant violence i fail to see why it is considered a classic of the genre let alone a masterpiece of film reviewers lead you under the impression that the entire film is done in a found footage manner when actually its only the final forty minutes which dips in and out of lost footage being watched by other characters the first fifty minutes is the more tedious although less repulsive half which follows a team going into investigate what happened to a bunch of nave students who went onto an island overrun by cannibalsits difficult to believe that was released in 1980 because it comes across as so dated as with most italian horror movies at the time the acting is absolutely atrocious it doesnt help that the dubbing doesnt quite match with their mouths and every line is delivered in a wooden manner i read somewhere that one of the actors was actually a porn star so that gives you an idea of the calibre of acting you can expectthe direction is almost as bad at times it came across as a parody especially when the natives started blowing poison darts at the group it comes across as extremely rough and amateurish which i suppose prepares us for the final third where were shown footage from actual amateurs the music was also pretty awful with an illfitting romantic main theme and another piece of strange electronic music which sounds like someone pressing random keys on a cheap keyboardwhat absolutely turns my stomach is the actual real footage of animals being killed is obviously renowned for this however i still wasnt prepared it is completely vile and totally unnecessary the image of two men pulling a giant sea turtle out of the water and slicing its head off whilst its legs are still kicking will never leave me the image of a man cutting its shell off with its organs and tissue spilling out will also never leave me the descriptions you read of the scenes will never prepare you for the actual graphic content which is shown on screenthe worst thing about it is that the film has absolutely zero artistic merit the only reason why animals are killed on screen is to shock it has nothing to do with the story which is barely there i would recommend that you think really carefully before watching the film because ive never actually felt so upset or sick whilst watching a filmthis film is obviously the work of a sadist and i find the films message of sensationalism in the media and the psychotic nature of human beings absolutely laughable the entire film is the perfect example of hypocrisy at its worst how dare a sadistic director lecture us about human nature a man who is quite happy to torture and kill animals for shock value should not be making a film about how civilised people can be more barbaric than cannibals apparently the director was also vile towards all the native extras and was particularly nasty towards the ones who couldnt speak italian or englishi rarely get angry about films but this one makes my blood boil i cant stand films which are only there to shock people and is just a string of shocking scenes some of them look laughable the rape scenes however some of them are just repugnant the forced abortion scene and totally cross the line real animal torture i didnt even realise i had limits until i watched and that is not a recommendation the sheer level of hypocrisy in the films heavyhanded themes is beyond laughable and it is just not made well in the slightest people who hail this film as a masterpiece are either delusional or sadistic maybe bothread more weird and dazzling reviews at wwwasdamanwordpresscom,cruel
wayyy overrated i went into this thing expecting to be shocked disgusted or even traumatized in some way and instead i was bored i read all of the reviews commenting on how great and intense this movie was only to be let down completely the acting is pretty horrific the entire plot is a mess and the violence is mostly laughableif you enjoy fake rape or the totally unnecessary killing of real animals this film is for you im a little more interested in story acting and directing none of which can be found here ignore any and all reviews praising this as some kind of cult classic with special artistic value or hidden meaning only the truly gifted can comprehend its a poorly executed attempt at shock and ends up falling well short of being anything less than an hour and a half of your life wasted,cruel
a gratuitous pseudosnuff film that tries to pass itself off under the guise of social commentary  unfortunately the film displays neither the intelligence nor insight to be anything more than sensationalist tripe this isnt even a horror movie  its faces of death with a plot and even thats a bit of a stretch since the story is strictly bare bones pardon the expression  the acting is pretty much nonexistent and by the time the end credits rolled by i found myself wishing that director ruggero deodato had been devoured by a tribe of cannibals himself thus sparing us from such amateur fairnow let me be clear that i am not a squeamish type when it comes to movie gore  i think directors such as george romero peter jackson and david cronenberg to name but a few have raised blood and guts to an art form but its painfully apparent that all deodato strives for is shock value there is no artistic vision evident here  just plain ol exploitation it boggles the mind why would appeal to anybody except aspiring serial killers who might get a kick out of watching animals being tortured and slaughtered for the sake of a dumb movie,cruel
where to beginthe plot as other reviewers have stated is probably already known to whoever is reading this so i wont waste words explaining it suffice to say that i was wholly unimpressed with it it was not creative nor original i was not compelled to think about society and its morals rather i was compelled to think about society in regard to how one could possibly call this amateur attempt at filmmaking a movie acting what acting i am all for attempting to capture realism and so forth in a movie but i am appalled that some other reviewers deemed the acting anything more than abysmal it felt as if the actors were reading their lines off of a teleprompter rather than having memorized them and recited them with passion and conviction dialogue let me start out with this statement i do enjoy 80s action movies and so forth and as such i dont mind corny oneliners somewhat cheesy bad dialog and what not this movie elevated the definition of cheesy to new extremes the dialog sounded like a fourteen year old who has a d for a grade in english class had written it normally in a decent movie the dialog is meant to illicit some form of emotion serve as a vehicle for character and plot development and so on in this movie i would say it detracted from the experience whenever one of the actors though i find it offensive to put them in the same category as credible actors reads a line and spews it forth it comes off as contrived and unbelievable not that it isnt to begin with but that is beside the pointspecial effects well if you enjoy movies that dont even qualify as b grade horror than you may enjoy this i was looking at the display to see how far into the movie i was because though some scenes were brutal i found them utterly ridiculous and boring the special effects if one would go so far as to call them that as they lacked any semblance of special and barely qualified as effects were fairly atrocious i wont spoil the killings for the reader but i will say that as stated before i found them banal and ridiculousentertainment value seeing as i am an individual and tastes vary i wont make any broad claims but i found the movie to be nothing but an exercise in pointlessness watching this movie is like watching a child pull the wings off of a fly and then burn the fly and watch it writhe in agony before finally stepping on it to anyone who finds that entertaining its like watching a group of adults who are drunk play scene it and act out the scenes from the movies then drinking some more and attempting to hack apart a chicken after hacking apart said chicken they then proceed to play with the organs and laugh hysterically whilst trying to appear serious and menacingthat is what i experienced when watching this movie some may see this as a masterpiece but i see it as nothing more than a black hole that sucks viewers in and spits them out 90 minutes later wondering what just happened and lamenting the 90 minutes of their life that was wasted,cruel
while it may be the most controversial film of all time as many hail it to be  remember that controversy does not make it necessarily good did not scare me at all it just made me sick there is no acting no trace of the director trying to elevate this film above the gore element and spoiler no reason for the 4 scientists to behave in such a way if this is the way the director tried to tell us that even civilized people are still savagewellhe failed miserablyon a sad note influenced quite a few directors eli rothfor example who think that gore carnage and blood are enough to make a good horror movie as you might probably tell i am not a big fan of hostel either those 3 elements might scare me in the real life but as far as a movie goes it takes a lot morei give a 1 out of 10  spoiler  oh and the rape scenes that shows a serious lack of good taste,cruel
group of very annoying people go to the jungle of veneuzuela or wherever to make a doc about a tribe of cannibalsat first it goes ok until they start raping woman in the tribe killing they cattle and stuff of course you understand whats about to happen next seriously this movie was crap at its finest freaking boring shizzle as for shocking moments there arent any except that there are some animal slaughters  only thing that was real and some guy who gets his privates cut off  but that looked so lame you wouldnt believe  now for the more basic stuff the acting was horrible at bestno known names in this turd of a movie the directing was bad as well but the worst part besides the acting and the plot has to be the cinematography which seriously made me wanna hurlso what else can i say except avoid this garbage unless your one of those social rejects who gets his kicks out of animal slaughters,cruel
so lets get this straight in the name of showing the irony of violence covered by the news and other mainstream media outlets deodato decides the best thing to do is to make a film where they kill every animal they can get their hands on so what we are subjected to is the torture of a muskrat the disembowelment of a tortoise two monkey killings the shooting of a pig and a spider and snake killing why why kill real animals this is a movie use props or better yet imply the killings this disgusting show of violence towards other living things is enough to make someone pukethen as if that isnt enough you have four of the most unlikable characters ever created they rape villagers torch their homes enslave the same villagers and of course murder them how exactly is this a film that has any redeeming values to it is the most vile and disgusting film i have ever seen we all know that people kill animals for food and clothing but doing it in the name of art is very sad and has no place in this world110,cruel
i saw this at a screening in the cinematek and i was surprised by the amount of people who went to see it it was packed i still felt like the odd one out since half of the people there had seen the movie before and looked like rockers bikers and rob zombie lookalikes the guy who presented the movie gave a 30 min speech which i didnt mind because he went through the history of the genre and interesting facts of the making of it but he did talk for maybe 15 minutes too long an old man sitting in front of me gestured with his hand in a get on with it way the whole time then when the presentation was over he pointed his middle finger at the presenterhalf of the movie is shot in the traditional cinematic way and the other half is found footage there are some gruesome images in this that i have no words to describe theres a lot of horrific things happening and at the same time its self aware it critiques the medias way of fabricating stories and tinkering with reality those aspects are interesting but the movie is still hard to watchthere were times were i had trouble keeping my eyes on the screen i was actually expecting someone to walk out whenever they showed an animal getting killed in closeup i will say that some bloody images went on for too long bloody in the sense that they were violentits a movie im happy to just see once i dont need to watch it again the subject matter is something you can discuss and the way it was made was before its time dont expect a full found footage movie though since its a mix of things the last lines were really good and sums everything up nicely horrific images and a clever critique and then happy music plays in the creditssome people will call it a masterpiece and others will be disgusted and horrified its a little bit of both for me but judge for yourself if you decide to watch it,cruel
is a 1980 italian horror movie directed by ruggero deodato which is shot in a documentary style it sounds campy by the title but it is anything but it has been often titled as the most controversial movie of all time if you measure controversy in terms of international legal action then that might very well be a true title if it wasnt outright banned in a country it was almost always censored heavily due to its graphic violence animal cruelty and allegations of murder of some of the actors with the murder charges dropped only now did the original uncut version become available for consumer viewings and its no surprise to those that have seen it that it still shocks and disgusts to this daythe premise is that a group of film students at nyu go to the heart of the unsettled and uncivilized south american rainforest dubbed the green inferno in order to shoot a film about the natives there and their customs they never return however and an anthropology professor embarks on a rescue mission to discover the fates of the students i dont think this is much of a spoiler given the title of the film but surprise he discovers that they were eaten the film they shot however remains intact which he takes back to new york and is viewed by the film executives who were responsible for publishing the original film despite the preconceived notions the viewer probably has about the savages vs the civilized filmmakers it becomes apparent upon watching who the real savages were murder and rape of the natives along with the brutal animal slayings performed by the students with smiles on their faces all for the sake of filmmaking will disgust you to your core as the professor says at the end of the film i wonder who the real cannibals arepersonally the most fascinating aspect of the film for me is that i consider this one of the most revolting films ever made but not because of the actual violence dont get me wrong it can be bloody and horrific but strictly speaking in terms of gore its not bad compared to modern torture porn films the real reason it sends shivers down your spine is because of the incredible disregard for life and a lack of basic humanity in people that surround us every day i wont spoil these horrendous acts because honestly they need to be seen to be believed as to how terrible they are another reason the film is so brutal is that it never lets up and never pulls a punch the horror is nonstop especially during the sections set in the green inferno even the ways that the film producers shrug off much of the horrifying acts shown in the recovered footage are sickening to methe most controversial aspect of the film is probably the genuine animal slayings portrayed on film even though i am a meat eater this is where i feel the films biggest blunder is the point of the film is that us civilized people can be extremely savage but actually killing animals for the sake of a movie even one with a message such as that is hypocritical to me even the director later regretted the decision to kill these animals if youre of faint of heart you will be horrified as to what you will see in what is probably the most infamous scene a large turtle is decapitated has its exterminates cut off and its shell torn off followed by the removal of the entrails all shown in graphic detail another scene people tend to point to is one in which a small monkey has its head chopped down the middle to me however the most disturbing animal killing is one in which a coatimundi a type of raccoon is stabbed multiple times in the neck while it shrieks until it finally succumbs to its wounds all the more horrifying is that the actors do these acts with smiles on their faces im not sure how someone can do something like that and seem so ok with it unless they are just as morally corrupt as the characters they portray despite how disgusting and sickening the film is i still recommend it but with caution this film is not for everyone and it is likely you may be sick to your stomach nonetheless it is well acted well shot and well executed animal killings aside the political message behind it is refreshing even though it will make you depressed and degrade your hope for humanity you can find the original uncut version on youtube but know what youre getting into,cruel
like hannibal lector in 1991s silent of the lambs there is a thin line that between genius and insanity i think cross that line to insanity this movie could had been really smart but end ups being unpleasant to watch directed by ruggero deodato known for a lot of cannibals film and written by gianfranco clerici is the first film to use the found footage structure that works similar to a flashback the films notion of recovered footage has influenced the nowpopular genre of found footage horror films such as 1999s the blair witch project 2008s cloverfield and other works the film tells the stories of two parties of explorers and how they dealt with an amazon rainforest indigenous tribes one of the parties treat the tribe to the best of their ability with respect while the other party end up being chow down because they were being jerks to the tribe the party that treat the tribe with respect leaded by new york university anthropologist harold monroe exporn star robert kerman end up with the rescue mission of looking for missing documentary film crew and to learn what really happen to them is notorious for its graphic violence that aroused a great deal of controversy to the point that some people thought it was real and the director was charge for a crime people really thought it was a snuff film due to rumors that claimed some actors were killed on camera in my opinion it is there is old footage filmed during the crisis in uganda in the 1970s where real life people were executed by a firing squad in the last road to hell that scenes alone is disrespected for the family of those people that die in that crisis to see that footage be used for entertaining purposes for another fake horror movie is horrible although deodato was later cleared from the crime when he show that his actor didnt die the film was still banned in several countries due to its disturbing portrayal of graphic brutality sexual assault such as rape and animal violence critics have suggested that the film is a commentary about civilized versus uncivilized society making the real life yanomamo tribe look like vicious cannibal man apes in truth the yanomamo people are some of the friendly smart civilize tribes in the amazon they are not truly cannibalistic although the yanomamo do partake in a form of postmortem ritual cannibalism another thing while people might see the animal killings as the biggest complaint of the film because how brutal they kill it and how long those scenes were like the insidious turtle scene at less it looks like they ate it or the natives ate it the biggest complain for me are the rapes scenes not only on the team raping native women but the native raping the team women for revenge it was just unpleasant as hell i couldnt watch any further for a while after those scenes until i took a long shower i felt dirty watching this movie it was just sick to the head i have to give the movie so points here they were really going for shock value and i have to say they deliver on that for sure it work because of the cinma vrit technique that the director learned from his mentor roberto rossellini a style which people called hyper realistic i just didnt like the shaky handheld camera work it really make my stomach turn i doubt i will watch it again because of that fact it makes me hurl not only the camera work but how graphic it is but as less i can say i watch it and it did deliver on the hype in a way i would deeply interested in seeing what the piranha scene that was cut from the final film would have look like it is a scene where group of yanomam cutting off the leg of a shamatari warrior and feeding him to piranha in the river the underwater camera did not operate properly and the piranha were difficult to control so the director reportedly dropped the scene due to its graphic content there are several different versions of in circulation which are edited to certain degrees the movie was barely made due to tension on set due to the exotic location and how much the actors were jerks to each other these tensions were further heightened by unscrupulous payment practices the actors barely got their money for the film the film really misused the native extras they basically were slaves and work for free as they went unpaid for their work despite their involvement in numerous dangerous scenes thats ugly while the movie was trying to make a theme that show how bad modern society morals are in italian media in this film by making the lost film crew heartless jerks behind the film the director himself was treating the natives and his crew like trash its hard to take a director serious about talking about good morals when he himself doesnt practice good morals did the movie deserve to get banned not really there are worst films than this but this is high up there plus banning it only speak more people interest to see it censorship only works for a little while as the internet gave more freedom into seeing sick films such as this if a person wants to see it i dont think all audiences who went to see this film are mental disturb i can see people seeing it for curious reasons does it make them psychos for wanting to see this film not always now if you watch this and you find it not disturbing then you might want to see a doctor right now for treatment,cruel
id toyed with the idea of watching for a long time before actually taking the plunge i suppose i was wary of the films reputation as a piece of extreme cinema and subconsciously kept putting off seeing it having finally viewed it  and whats more in its uncut version containing all the animal killings the longest available road to hell footage and all the other gory moments  i must say im rather surprised surprised that i admire the film when i expected to hate it surprised that in parts the film is remarkably well made and surprised that an italian cannibal film of all things manages to be so prescient in its depiction of media sensationalisma group of four young filmmakers vanish in the amazon while making a documentary a few months later anthropologist harold monroe robert kerman sets off to find out what happened to them after various adventures monroe and his guides eventually find a group of natives the yacumo tribe who have had contact with the filmmakers they push on further into the jungle to the unexplored regions peopled by much more dangerous and isolated tribes like the yanomamo and the shamatari where monroe eventually locates the barely recognisable remains of the film crew amazingly the movie reels they have shot are still intact and monroe manages to persuade the tribesmen to let him have them in exchange for a tape recorder the recovered footage shows director alan yates carl gabriel yorke script writer faye daniels francesca ciardi and cameramen mark tomaso luca barbareschi and jack anders perry pirkanen journeying into the depths of the jungle where they use increasingly unethical and violent methods to get the footage they want eventually the yanomamo tribe turn on the filmmakers and brutally slay them their horrible deaths captured on film as the documentary crew desperately try to escapefor its first half is not particularly good this part is a standard jungle expedition adventure with typically bad acting wooden dialogue and bursts of gruesome violence where the film suddenly and unexpectedly makes you sit up and take note is in its second half referred to in the film as the green inferno segment using an effective cinma vrit style director ruggero deodato shows the exploits of the film crew in the jungle he uses scenes of real animal cruelty to shock the audience and knock them off balance then moves onto realistically simulated human horrors such as rape impalement beheading cannibalism and more these simulated scenes have added believability because our senses have already experienced the onslaught of real cruelty and death deodato relentlessly shows how unscrupulous and corrupt the filmmakers are and how they will commit the most horrific acts against animals and natives just as long as they get their film made the problem is that becomes the very thing it tries to condemn  a piece of sensationalism its hard to accept this fierce assault on the immorality of the media when the film itself resorts to the same offensive immorality nonetheless this is an effective and disturbing horror film which should be seen at least once if only to experience the raw cinma vrit sequences which surely inspired later lost footage movies most notably the blair witch project there isnt a single moment here that will make you jump but there are many appallingly cruel moments that will play on your mind for a long time afterwards tough viewing,cruel
i had truly mixed feelings about this film i knew about it being banned i several countries and that it was the center of the video nasties collection as i am a fan of horror films as well as euro shock films i decided that i would ignore the warnings and watch it for what it truly isan exploitation filmi had trouble watching particular scenes in the film mainly because of how real all of the effects and acting skills are i now see where films like the blair witch project got their inspiration the only difference here is that shows literally everything the first half of the film built suspense and laid down the story for the rest of the film to follow the native tribes were very realistic in their portrayal of primitive and violent people the disturbing parts of the film are in the second half and build up the almost unbearable tension until the devastating brutal climax where my mixed feelings are about the film is its multi layered characters i do feel that the journalists were savage and brutal and deserved what they had coming to them but on the other hand i did not feel that i had to see it in such horrifying detail if you want to see a scary movie i highly recommended this one although it is nearly unwatchable not due to its direction or action but more its content and realism be warned that there are real animal deaths on film which added to the extreme controversy upon its release but i only feel that this made the film seem more real and it succeeds in making the viewer uncomfortable and ultimatelyafraid but thats hat horror movies are supposed to do this one certainly holds up to the hype,cruel
is a masterpiece never have i watched a movie that was repulsive yet subtly poignant it was way before its time blair witch even ripped some elements off of it this movie completely captures the media induced stupor that was 30 years in the making you can see shots at reality tv in this movie and it had not even been conceptualized yet the things that were done in this movie could not happen today and that is a shame in the fact that if there was ever a time when a movie like this was relevant it is upon usdisclaimeri do not condone animal cruelty i just think that this films impact would have hit harder if it came out today then in 1979 why was i born in that year maybe thats an omen or probably just sheer stupid luck anyways check out this film if you want to be challenged not only visually but morally as well,cruel
this film was disturbing on so many levels in fact i could not even sit through it all at once i had to take a break and come back and finish it the next day i have not seen a film as disturbing as this since i spit on your grave one shouldnt be disturbed at seeing animals slaughtered if you eat meat after all you have to kill it to cook it but the animals slaughtered in this film seemed still alive when they were being cut up the chopping of the monkey head to get at the brains was especially harsh it made me want to join peta and become a vegetarianthe punishing of a native woman for adultery was hard to watch it would have been easier to just stone her and not have to go through this rituali felt sorry for the four adventurers when i saw what happened to them but i changed my mind when i saw what they did in the village just before they met their fate good riddance to such trash watching the last few chapters today was even more difficult with gang rapes disembowelment and decapitations this is the ultimate cannibal movie and the only one that anyone needs to see to experience this type of film making,cruel
opening with a spectacular aerial view of the amazon accompanied by a score as lush as the tropical foliage depicted ruggero deodatos infamous cannibal shocker begins innocuously enough however by the time the end credits roll the viewer will have experienced one of the most gruelling cinematic experiences ever to have been filmedwhen a team of documentary makers go missing whilst filming in the amazon a professor his guide and an assistant attempt an expedition in order to discover what happened to them they discover that the jungle where the filmmakers disappeared is ruled by two rival tribes of cannibals they make contact with one tribe and after gaining their trust they stay a while to experience life in a stoneage society at first hand they even witness savage rituals and are invited to stay for a spot of lunch bloody entrails anyone after discovering the remains of the missing documentary makers fashioned into a strange monument the professor manages to retrieve cannisters of undeveloped film and returns to new yorkupon viewing the film he discovers the shocking truth about the filmmakers they were vicious sadists who deliberately engineered violent events in order to spice up their footage after killing and raping some of the tribe members they are eventually set upon and end up being mutilated in front of their own cameradeodatos movie is an expertly crafted film and is undeniably powerful and unforgettable stuff the last fortyfive minutes or so which comprises mainly of the recovered documentary footage is extremely disturbing featuring graphic and realistic gore fx animal mutilation and violent sexual abuse perpetrated by both the natives and the filmmakers deodato forces the viewer to reevaluate how they feel about their own society and asks the question are we really any more civilised than those we call savages whilst hard to describe as entertaining the revolting animal scenes are particularly hard to stomach is a cut above most cannibal films it is a relentless attack on the senses that should be seen not just by fans of extreme horror but by all serious movie fans who appreciate innovative groundbreaking cinema,cruel
real animals were afflicted and killed not only one but about 7 without the outtakes which sure caused them to kill several more this is not only a perverse act of killing this is insane illegal inhuman dreadful and just everything but right id like to see the director going into jail for this foreveri love animals but even if id not id still never accept thisi heard that the director was fined for this but only a few thousand dollars this movie should have never been madeeverybody who wants to watch this should think about that first and if you still wanna see it even only because youre curious about it then download it or whatever dont buy it010,cruel
like others i cant believe people relate to this vomit in a manner that offers the excuse of art its exploitative trash plain and simplethe copious amounts of animal torture serve no practical purpose and exist only to garner a measure of controversy to help titillate the films jaded audience to argue that this type of cruelty is no different from that meted out  no pun intended  in the butchery trade is risible as this sort of snuff is done exclusively for the entertainment of the viewer and offers no redemption for the act of killing other than to satiate the bloodlust of your average voyeurleaving the animal torture aside what actually exists in the body of this film to justify such overblown praise the acting is abysmal the soundtrack is monotonous the story line is sophomoric and the dialogue is laughable and oh yes it wasnt even scary  not at all not even in the remotest sense of the word it certainly was revolting and amoral ill give it that but frightening not a chance,cruel
this movie is hands down the worst piece of horrendous trash that i have ever had the misfortune to see it will make your stomach turn repeatedly due to unnecessary violence to both humans and animals the scenes depicting torture of humans were acted but the scenes depicting animal dismemberment were real the words to describe this movie are shocking graphic disgusting disturbing depraved and ultimately unnecessary some reviewers have given this movie ratings ranging from 710 and i cant see any reason for such a score reviewers have written that this movie is a social commentary of evil and that it shows depravity and disintegration of human society people have also written that animals are slaughtered for food all the time as if that excuses the slaughter of animals in this movie some have written that its all right since the animals were eaten after the filming i completely disagree with all of this knowing that animals were killed to film this atrocity will make you feel even worse if you decide to watch it and i strongly recommend that you donti want to point out that i dont consider myself squeamish and have no problems with watching gory horrors which are filled with movie violence but this piece of trash is where i draw the line this should not even be placed in the category of horror or category of movie for that matteri will not go into too many of the details of acting directing and the script because you can make up your mind if you ever make a mistake of watching it i will also not go into those details because the acting is horrible and the script and direction worse still the premise of the movie if we can call it that is that an anthropologist finds film footage which a film crew shot whilst going through the amazon rain forrest and filming the primitive cannibals that live there it turns out that the footage was mostly forced since the film crew terrorized and abused the natives in order to get the shots that they wanted this was due to the fact that the footage that they obtained naturally was not exciting enough for them the anthropologist takes the film reels back to new york and watches what the film crew did to the natives and ultimately discovers their fate as well you might guess that cannibals dont react well to being tortured and murdered basically the film crew sinks deeper and deeper into depravity until their behavior is as savage as it can get they become worse than the cannibals that they describe as savages and there are scenes of human and animal mutilations galore a turtles is ripped apart in detail and women are raped and tortured one woman is impaled on a stake and her body is left hanging on the stake there is also disembowelment and obviously cannibalism of various body parts and appendages just plain horrible i guess that those who described this film as a social commentary of the disintegration and depravity of society were right they were right in the sense that those responsible for this movie are depraved savages who shouldnt be allowed near cameras ever again again i advise you to stay away from this at all costs it is absolutely horrible on every level if i could rate it into the negative figures it would receive the rating of 10 alas i have to rate it as 1 since that is the lowest rating allowed on this site,cruel
recently seeing a documentary about the moral outrage about the infamous video nasties that were on the market i thought id try and track one of the nastier nasties and with a title like it doesnt sound much nastier than that  lets not forget this is italian exploitation horror cinema and these italians really know how to push the boat out when it comes to this gore laden genre  add to this an infamous marketing image on the original video cover and an even more infamous reputation since the film really does feature real life animals being killed and youve got a film that someone who has even the most vague interest in horror films wouldnt want to missthe film starts in a rather pretentious self important manner with quotes from thomas jefferson and others pointing out the importance of liberty and never forgetting the past  the first filmed sequence takes place via a television broadcast that while we now live in the space age we know very little about whats going on in the more remote parts of the world  as i said theres a pretentious and self important element to all this especially when the tv reporter comes out with hyperbole that the human race are about to conquer the universe which would be difficult enough achievement for a highly developed race like the daleks  never mind humanity in the late 20th century but despite all this it doesnt really seem to harm a film that is merely exploitation cinema and exploitation cinema it is and its not long before the film starts nailing its colours to the mast by having an intrepid tv journalist leading an expedition to darkest south america to find out what happened to a previous news crew  now its at this point you realise how easy it would have been to have the story to continue with intrepid tv journalist suffering the same ordeal as his prior peers but doesnt happen  he finds the film cans of the previous journalists and takes them back to nyc to find out their fate and how it happened of course the films marketing took over on its initial release and the film was being touted as real life footage and if you read the trivia section on this page youll find that director ruggero deadato was arrested by italian police and accused of murdering the actors in the film  im sorry but im calling bs on that one  as unpleasant as some of the scenes might be it would have been fairly obvious back then as it is now that only thing going on was acting  okay its not great acting and its filmed in a grungy manner but its impossible to believe anyone would be taken in by this  as one character spouts as a man on the street i find this documentary footage dishonest this is all a pity of sorts because despite its infamy which is earned where the real slaughter of animals is concerned and the infamy that is unearned  cast members being murdered for real indeed  there is a very serious subtext in the heart of the film and white people venturing in to a remote jungle  upsetting the natives and coming off second best reminded of ill fated colonial campaigns in general and vietnam in particular  as someone says makes me wonder who the real cannibals are ,cruel
you know that feeling when you watch a really tough movie i had that feeling after watching only a few movies and the worst were sal or the 120 days of sodom and lars von triers antichrist but i was not prepared for the cruelty of ive read a lot about the most controversial sequences of the film before seeing it but it was too difficult for me to not feel shocked with all the violencegore of the film was definitely one of the toughest movies ive ever seen its more than just an exploitation film its a like a free ticket for your worst nightmare its a ride you wont forget for a long time sequences like the impalement scene and the murder of a large turtle were to cruel and nasty to watch and for a 1980s film i have to confess that im shocked how real it seemed in the film six animals are killed and those are really intense and gruesome scenes its a crazy rude and cruel ride where you will ask yourself sometimes why are you watching the film but at the end of it after all the evidences of this crazy journey are finally destroyed you will understand that this is not just a simple horror movie shows us the cruelty of men and leaves us with a really interesting quote i wonder who the real cannibals are its a really graphic film and its hard for me to advise you to watch it but despite all this things ive said manages to deliver and accomplish everything a true horrormovie fan really wishes violent cruel gruesome graphic will maybe force you to close your eyes in the toughest scenes it was definitely one of the best and toughest horror movies ive seen,cruel
is one of the more controversial of the once legendary video nasties partly due to its scenes of actual animal slaughter and any number of faked rapes beating stabbing and in one particular scene a violent ritualistic abortion the plot prefigures the successful blair witch project in the respect that the second half of the film is supposedly made up lostfootage from a film crew who disappeared whilst making a documentary in the heart of the amazon rain forest the first half of the film involves a university professor retracing the steps taken by the film crew in order to retrieve this lost footage juxtaposing the lush forest landscapes against the lingering spirit of evil in such a way as to recall the works of werner herzog with the roving naturalistic camera work and drifting shots of rivers swinging treecanopies and locals positioned ominously amongst the tall jungle grass leaving us illprepared for the onslaught still to comethe second half of the film is where the nastiness begins with director ruggero deodato revelling in every moment of the violence and gore yet failing to offer anything approaching character drama tension intelligence technical proficiency or depth the saving grace of the film in this respect is deodatos moralistic message  which really arrives far too late to take on any kind of real relevance  in which the natives  who we expect to be savage  turn out to be benign welcoming peace loving people called into conflict by the filmmakers who surprisingly turn out to be morally bankrupt opportunists only there to torment and torture the amazonian natives in order to create heartwrenching social propaganda the director further reinforces this idea by showing us the crews previous film snappily titled road to hell which features actual shockfootage of reallife political executions bodies and decompositiondeodatos concept of a morallybankrupt media in love with ratings and awards at the sake of human suffering is an important one a prospect still very much relevant today what with the overabundance of reality tv shows atrocity websites and the concept of violence as entertainment however for me the relevance of the debate is dwarfed by deodato shocking treatment of animals to my mind any film that uses violence in order to comment on the violence in the media or indeed society in general leaves itself open to questions of hypocrisy in depicting the violence in such a glorified and exploitive way the film becomes just as appalling as when such material is used to sell newspapers or to illicit sympathy during the six oclock news you may disagree with this particular criticism and see some sense of truth in deodatos subtextual ideology but either way you have to ask yourself why are you watching this film instead of creating an intelligent and emotionally moving depiction of media manipulation and the doublestandards of war which here includes the most successful aspect of the film with the allusions to vietnam  the depiction of the american film crew apparently the heroes invading these small peaceful villages and causing a great deal of damage and offence in a manner that recalls the massacre at my lai  deodato instead creates a sluggish vacuum of attention seeking setpieces and overthetop goreas a result the moral message of is diminished and the film instead becomes a work of morbidcuriosity like most of these oncebanned features the film is one that anyone with an interest in film should see if only to gain a greater perspective of the ideas and ideologies of that particular time its also likely to attract an audience who just want to see how violent the film is or to revel in the excess and the continual sense of cruelty i watched it to see if the slant magazine review was accurate when they referred to it as artful enough to demand serious critical consideration yet foul enough to christen you a pervert for even bothering they could be right overall i dont buy the validity of the moral message here anyone with so much compassion for the human race wouldnt feel it necessary to chop a monkeys face off or cut off the head of an endangered turtle before waving it around in front of the camera theres also a lot of sexual violence particularly involving women and blunt objects being inserted into various orifices this kind of leering voyeuristic excess renders the antiwar anticonsumerist antimedia message obsolete you can say the same about man bites dog to some extentthe people who have written about this film as if it were some kind of important social document or worse a horror film that is actually scary must have been watching a different film even the notoriously dodgy zombie flesh eaters was more disturbing than this for me is an interesting film but also an interesting failure one that clearly had an underlined message and sense of intent that is muddied somewhat by the over the top violence and disregard for life if you really want to see how violent this film is then by all means give it a try if only to satisfy some greater sense of morbid curiosity,cruel
this film is hailed as the mother of all cannibal movies and has been dubbed the most controversial cult movie i certainly agree with the controversial part the version that was released by vipco recently had 6 minutes of footage cut out of it so when i saw it for the first time i wondered what all the fuss was about that was until i got my grubby hands on the full uncut version from ebaylet me just warn you all that certain companies these days release films that claim to have been banned in several countries for decades however the versions they release are butchered to a much greater extent than the characters in the films themselves bare in mind that these films are mostly only available now because they lack the footage that got them banned in the first place the internet is an invaluable source of original uncut gore movies but many of them are not region 2 uk so be carefulanyway back to holocaust banned in over 50 countries since 1982 and rightly so the uncut version of this film is considered hugely offensive very disturbing extremely graphic and im inclined to agree but of course i would add highly entertaining to the list there are infamous scenes of animal killings which are horrible not only because of their gruesome nature but because they are very real and very pointless the turtle scene made me cover my eyes and look away which doesnt happen often if anything these scenes make the simulated acts of rape and human butchery easy viewing for me the hardest thing about this film to stomach was the appalling soundtrack,cruel
does the world need another comment  maybe not but ill add one anyway    this is easily the most disturbing movie ive ever seen  not the goriest that would be dead alive or terror firmer or the most violent hard boiled perhaps but definitely the most disturbing  why  because unlike putrid trash like cannibal ferox or i spit on your grave this movie is actually pretty well made  the dialogue is reasonably intelligent the acting at least by the documentary filmmakers ranges from acceptable to good and the handheld camera keeps all the nastiness looking believable on top of that the score is curiously haunting  it sounds ridiculously childish at first but provides a strange counterpoint to the action that is quite effective especially in the hut burning scene if you read enough of these comments youll hear more than you need to know about the animal deaths  they should never have been allowed to happen the poor harmless young boa constrictor being hacked up was especially disturbing to me but thats just because i have a pet boa  for another thing id like to know what kind of turtle is killedits one big honkin turtle  ill bet it was an endangered species to boot  the turtle killing is probably the single most disgusting thing ive seen put on celluloid makes day of the dead look like an episode of iron chefindeed the outrageousness of the cast of in killing these animals recalls the outrageous conduct of the filmmakers within the story who rape  kill the natives  deodato hammers into our heads over  over that the filmmakers are the real cannibals the real savages because of what they did to the natives merely for the sake of their film  but didnt deodato do much the same thing to the animals merely for the sake of his film  i think this is either an incredibly stupid oversight of hypocrisy by deodato or a brilliant touch of irony  overall i cant say i enjoyed the film  honestly i hope no one enjoys it  i dont want to see it again anytime soon  its effective and interesting like dissecting a frog in biology class but id be a little wiggy about someone who called this one of their favorite moviesi would warn those of you probably most of you who are reading these comments and want to see this film because of its reputation not to build up your expectations too much  if you learn too much about its shocking scenes they might lose some of their shock value  and frankly the true horror would be watching this movie without being shocked,cruel
possible spoilers lie withinok first things first this is a bad movie but had the potential to be great to say this is a blueprint for the blair witch project is a joke blair witchs filmmakers were innocent people exploring a legend and it was just about them and their psychological rollercoaster ride through the woods s filmmakers are as savage as the cannibals theyre out to exploit and get what they deserve and the movie makes a half assed attempt to exploit them as figures of how corrupt our society is and most important there is nothing psychological going on in this film it was said best by another reviewer all thats going on here is just the film pushing the violence as far as it can go in 90 minutes it also disturbs me to read that the animal deaths in this movie were real it wasnt so much watching the deaths themselves that troubled me but that theres so much of it and for what a stupid movie i was also impressed by how realistic they made the human death scenes seem and even the cheesy stock footage music added to the horror giving it a faces of death feel to it i recommend this movie to no one since youll probably have to go out of your way to find it and its really not worth it it is definately entertaining in its own morbid way and the violence doesnt disappoint at all im just waiting for a film to come along to combine the violence of and the psychological terror of the blair witch project now that would be something,cruel
four cocky americans go into the rain forest to document a cannibalistic tribe other crews have tried and not come back but this group mocks such losers when it turns out the quartet isnt heard from for two months a new yorkbased anthropologist sets out to find out what happened when he returns with the doc crews rough cut he learns their fate and resolves to burn the filmthis last fact is one of the weaker elements of this exceedingly hard to watch but profound film professor harold monroe robert kerman is the anthropologist who presumably strives to understand the human animal he discovers some horrible truths in his probe  so why on earth would he want to destroy the evidencesure there is a lot in the sensationally titled that is hard to witness however the movie is exceedingly welldone and has important things to say i discovered it while doing a little internet reading on foundfootage films during which i learned that is the granddaddy of a genre that includes such other fine works as the blair witch projectthe movie takes us to a border zone spanning brazil and peru a nomans land in which tribes armed with spears blow darts and a taste for human flesh have occasional encounters with the white man and his superior fire power the westerners shortcoming is a far inferior knowledge of the junglewhen monroe treks into the rain forest he has a supremely experienced and nononsense guide who critically understands and knows how to treat the native peoples effectively as a result this guide and his entourage manage to survive the expeditionin contrast the documentary crew loses its guide to a snake bite early on and does not know enough to turn back and quit while theyre ahead rather they are spurred on by dreams of winning an oscar and getting rich they show themselves to be utterly amoral as they taunt and abuse the native peoples with absolutely no compunction for what they have wrought karma follows shortly behindyes there is violence against animals in this film but all of it serves a purpose a muskrat is slit open but its organs feed a native youth captured and managed most effectively by monroes posse the documentarians capture a large river turtle and we must watch as it is taken apart while alive but the animal serves as foodsome extremely sorry truths about human nature arise from this film along the way it dawns on the viewer that the film crews arrogance cruelty and mayhem are likely part of our very own history after all native peoples once ruled our homeland and it doesnt take much of a leap of imagination to guess that many of this movies abuses likely tainted our own home turfimportant questions arise as to who is civilized and who is primitive the natives in this film were not looking for trouble they wanted to be left alone to live their lives in peace which is not to say that they did not exact horrible penalties for criminal behavior and did not battle their own native adversaries with ruthlessnessthere is a lot here to ponder and i do not think this movie should be shunned because of its excesses that would be like mimicking the anthropologist ultimately i once saw a documentary about japanese director akira kurasawa who had witnessed the carnage following the atom bombing of hiroshima never look away from the truth he advised good words for us all to remember,cruel
the director is trying to convey the message that the west unethically exploits primitive cultures and nature for the sake of sensationalism yet ironically the only one who unethically exploited living beings for the sake of sensationalism was the director himself when he ordered the slaughter of numerous exotic animals on camera in gruesome ways they stabbed a baby coati raccoon which was wrongly identified as a muskrat in the movie in the face dissected a large river turtle decapitated a boa constrictor chopped the face off a squirrel monkey squashed a tarantula to death and kicked and shot a pig in the face at point blank rangei give this movie a 510 whilst the realism is certainly astonishing especially for its time the message of this movie combined with the animal cruelty it displays are the work of a morally bankrupt mind and shouldnt be condoned ruggero deodato set out to prove something about western civilization but all he ended up proving is that he himself is an uncivilized barbarian,cruel
one must keep an open mind when viewing deodatos infamous cannibal film while the feature is shot beautifully and has a truly mesmerizing score by riz ortolani its hard to break past the aspects that made this film so controversial to begin withyes the film depicts the actual slaughter of jungledwelling creatures yes traumatic horrors such as rape seem glorified as just forms of punishment its not easy to handle and yet that was the goal of the filmdeodato did not set out to make a film for the masses he created an underground feature for a very select crowd but shot edited and scored it masterfully is more of an experience than an actual film  and thats just what the makers of this feature plannedif you can stomach it watch it in disgust shock and reverence it might be a monstrosity but its oneofakind,cruel
amazing and very depressing to see how many adult individuals will justify deem irrelevant or simply ignore the killing and torturing of animals in the name of human entertainment and shallow shockvalue a really awful film which relies heavily on the visual representation of violence and kills animals because humans cant be mindlessly killed on screen if you expect to earn some bucks is a cowardly hypocritical and clearly damaging work its degrading to watch to make to sell and to buy it tells a lot about people and their numb ways really hopelessi could of course just say that the story is stupid and clich that the characters and actors are extremely poor that the cinematography couldnt be worse that the music is frankly pathetic that the ironic ohbutwereviolenttoo twist is laughable and unbearably childish i could arguably point out that this work of art hah hah  would have been forgotten the very minute it was premiered had it not been followed by sheer controversy on the grounds not of some revolutionary philosophical standpoint but thanks to the most reactionary and ordinary tool available gratuitous easy lawabiding cruelty but quite honestly after having witnessed the deaths of several animals just for the sake of it and to make the fake and boringly told human deaths more shocking what a cheap trick gawd  i cant even said its a film what ive just watched its a piece of pathetic crap its so easy to shock people by torturing defenseless beings and it shows belowzero brain activity congratulationsits all so ironic and amusing yeah in the saddest most revealing and extratextual way,cruel
dont know where to start really  bad director awful acting bad cinematography crap music should i go on  anyway the sick and extreme proves that you really dont need ethics or talent to do a movie the worst thing about the whole thing being the socalled morality you get at the end of that truly incredibly bad film miss it,cruel
i really dont understand the need for killing real animals in long drawn out scenes just to film the animals frightened and tortured reactions first is a musk rat which is stabbed in the neck repeatedly with a knife then you see them drag a sea turtle up on shore and decapitate it not only do they cut off the head but the first whack doesnt kill it and you get to see its feet kicking in fury as its head hangs halfway off next is a monkey whos face is cut off with a machete then you have a piglet which is tied up kicked around shot but not killed yet and left twitching on the ground theres plenty of realistic looking gore in this movie done on people with use of special effects yet the animals do not get this luxury and are just slaughtered for a shock effect it eventually gets to the point that every time you see an animal you find yourself saying are they seriously going to kill a insert animal name here nowfor those saying animals are killed all the time you eat hamburgers yeah animals are killed for food purpose these animals were killed for reaction not a single animal in this movie was killed for foodoh and to those calling it a masterpiece really this is the most boring piece of garbage ive ever seen yeah i like the idea behind the story but they played it out horribly acting is bad and you eventually just stop watching it and it becomes background noise in fact its still playing on my tv right now ive just lost interest in it,cruel
to anyone who thinks that this film is a horror film  its not its not scary its not thrilling its not capturing and its not breathtaking the only thing that this film is is disgusting you see lots of animals screaming in pain while they get stabbed headed skinned etc that films for anyone who enjoys watching animals sufferbesides this the acting is poor you dont believe anything that the actors in the film say because it just seems that they memorised it and have to think of what they had to say nowanything but a masterpiece awful,cruel
okay so the lecture this movies teaching us that civilised people will under certain circumstances act no less savage than humans out in the jungleoh really now thats a truly groundbreaking discovery isnt it and thats already the first and major problem im having with this movie only to show off how thin or even nonexistent the layer of civilisation is the movie utilises some or actually a lot of the worst racist clichs ive ever seen its as if all the fantasies of the 18th and 19th centuries with its blackandwhite contrasts of the noble and the beastly savage have come to life fantasies we should already know were a product of the ideas of western of caucasian superiority granted the movie tries to show or at least claims to do so the minimal difference but nevertheless depicting natives like that is racist to the extreme as if cultures outside our civilisation had to be savage and cruel by default besides does the civilised man really need to be out in the jungle to behave like a beast the holocaust part of the title alone should make you doubt that as to the animals being killed no im not a vegetarian and yes i know that the burger on my plate was once a cow which had been slaughtered but i wouldnt get off killing them or watching them being tortured and id seriously consider changing the butcher if i found out that they were enjoying the act of killing hypocrisy burying my head in the sand maybe but i think theres a crucial difference between not having problems with a fact like animals being killed to be served on my plate and relishing watching and hearing them being tortured the coatimundis piercing screams of panic and agony the spilledout gutts of the turtle the smashed spider which turns the female scientist into a damselindistress etc are lets be honest only included to add some real kinky stuff they lack both dramaturgic if the movie has any at all and cultural relevance ritual slaughtering be it indian tradition or any other eg roman kosher halal to stay within the boundaries of civilisation does not include gratuious cruelty to the contrary an animal slaughtered that messily would be considered impure and i doubt a real indian hunter would be that clumsy this here is merely wanking material be the wanking physical or intellectual,cruel
this movie is crap there are few cruel very realistic scenes of killing and torturing and  that is all and there are also some scenes that are pretty weakly set it does not bring anything new all the actors are just pathetic screenplay sucks and  in my humble opinion  there is no excuse for killing animals i am talking about the scene showing the crew killing that turtle just to make some art if you want to watch some shocking pointless cruelty  go to ogrishcom if you would like to watch some brutal yet progressive and surprising film  go and get irreversible this one is really not worth your time i think that you would be really disappointed,cruel
my friends told me that beyond the violence this was actually a good movie wrong its godawful on every level it may have the fewest redeeming features of any movie ever the writing is ridiculous the acting is a joke and the dubbing sounds like iron chef when i saw this in the theater everyone was always laughing at the stupidity of this thing when they werent cringing and the violence serves no artistic purpose this is the lowest form of smut it has no artistic value and it is interested in things that are far more horrible than any sex act its just there because the filmmakers were madmen the only conceivable reason to see this movie is to test your ability to watch truly disgusting things,cruel
when i clicked on the button to grade this film i wasnt quite sure which number to pick  i mean i refuse to give any film a 10 because i would never be able to give anything a higher score and i want to wait for that one film to come along that will without a doubt demand the perfect 10 and one would assume that this would not be that film  i mean its disgusting boring reprehensible obvious and unoriginal  it actually shows animals being killed and ripped apart  so it deserves a 0 right well i think so but i am not surewhat is a movie supposed to do if not show us something we havent seen before  this plot is so stupid these characters so disgusting and flawed and this murder so indefensible that i am forced to wonder if this is the worst or greatest film of all time  in real life the plot isnt always interesting or brilliant the people arent always good or useful and animals die by our collective hands  and there are actually people in this world who eat people  this film is so stupid its actually realistic  it is bad but so are we and as the only film to be evil enough to actually show how bad we are it must be great right  it must be the greatest film of all time to show us something like thissomething with no story or conventional filmic technique that dares to be as horrible as we are there it gets a 10  or does itby the same logic all pornography is equally brilliant for being willing to show us how graphic and lusty we are  now i have nothing against pornography but there is quite a bit of it and by my own argument there can be only one 10  how do we pick which one  not only that but what if someone comes along and actually makes a sicker movie than this  does that then get the 10 or do we call it unoriginal for failing to be sick soon enough  that is the problem with film criticism  we never really know what we should look for  and i dont know the answer but i have figured out what to give this film0if we are to praise extreme cinema we have to do so with a different set of rules  when reality is all around you and there is no escapeeven though the limits of cinema are being stretchedthe value of cinema is being lost  because what is the magic of a movie  the ability to shock us by showing us what is all around and scary and shocking and sadly true  or is it that more refined and useful ability to play off that reality and give us something in which to escape and then something in which to find ourselves again  as soon as someone figures out how to make a movie that is completely realistic and completely cinematic then we must revise our views  but for now it is enough to give this film a 0 and condemn it for failing to redeem itself after it made its point,cruel
tortured to death in the same way these poor animals were lethal injection my rear end im 15 years old and only heard about the movie i havent actually viewed it myself but my 20 year old cosine and his girlfriend saw it and then tolled me about it they werent entertained or fascinated or even grossed out they were violently angry now im no member of peta and neither are they although i am against the killing of critters for fur i eat meat and having read the peta site for myself i know what cows go through to make that hamburger but meat is an essential part of the human diet without it wed probably suffer some bad side effects i do know a small child who is a vegetarian and she is a very unhealthy little girl however torture and violence is not an essential part of a human diet and thats exactly what this movie wasanybody who had a part in making this movie should have their face cut off by a machete and be cut apart limb from limb and then be eaten by anybody who enjoys this film before they are kicked and then shot in the head so they can talk about animal torture in the darkest circle of satans domain because thats where the turds who kill animals go,cruel
as far as grindhouse goes this is one considered the best of what exploitation has to offer i truly do love grindhouse cinema but the first time i watched this movie i was 16 and this film shocked the absolute crap out of me it was really one of those curiosity viewings and before you say why the hell were you watching it at that age this is kind of tame considering what the internet has to offer nowadays its also funny considering that when i was 21 i went to thailand for a month on holiday and ended up discussing the movie at length with a 26 year old scottish girlthe actual killing of animals in the way they did on this film just really bugs me to no end the endless raping and abuse to the natives ultimately leads to the group getting what they deserve for as much as the film makes social commentary of sorts throughout this movie personally it comes off tame and laughable like old schoolyard bullying and it never really left that much of an impression on mei can respect that ruggero deodato got to make the film he wanted to make and i can also respect the cult following it has gained over the years im glad it exists and is heralded as much as it is condemned but unfortunately it remains nothing more than a curiosity of the past and the morals if any of the story havent aged well its straight up shock value and the imagery is pushed way beyond the term reconstructed ive realised in writing all this ive probably also promoted this movie in some strange wayfinal verdict im glad i finally watched it and saw what the fuss was all about but i hope to never watch it again anytime soon just for the fact that it really isnt all that great 510,cruel
the most scandalous of the italian cannibal movies subgenre isnt the most disgusting that would probably be cannibal ferox aka make them die slowly but it has picked up the most press over the years following the tremendous controversy over its initial release one of the original video nasties the film features graphic depictions of staged snuff reallife executions courtesy of newsreel footage from wartorn africa and  most upsettingly  mondostyle images of reallife animal killing including the dismemberment of a live sea turtle by an amazonian tribehowever one of the biggest reasons why this one made such a stir is for a neat trick that the makers of the the blair witch project reemployed two decades later is a film within a film staged as a documentary with the original actors in prearranged hiding after release director ruggero deodato was even arrested and accused of having murdered his cast for real before convincing the authorities otherwisethis is one film thats had its longpig cake and eaten it being widely interpreted as a comment on developing world exploitation by the media bafflingly its theme tune also resembles a cross between queens too much love will kill you and something composed by the simon may orchestra for a 1980s uk soap,cruel
split in 2 is both accurate and ironic accurate in what cannibals do and ironic as i have 2 very different opinions on this film on the bad side this film does contain scenes of animal cruelty in italy film s made around this time which used animal cruelty resulted in prosecutions secondly this is a low budget film and the quality of production shows thisthis film however is fascinating you can see where blair witch and countless other movies got their ideas and influences from the director had the problem of working with a low budget and turned it to his advantage by making a documentary style now the imitators are using as a film method the film is nowhere near as horrible as its fame and banning suggests once the animal cruelty is omitted,cruel
make no mistake ruggero deodatos is one of those rare films that is exactly as remarkable and brutally effective as everyone says it is and as unbearable as many more say yes it made me feel sick but it was impossible to turn away at the same time this is not a film to be taken lightly is difficult to dismiss and should leave you a changed person after witnessing it for the first time if it doesnt then you need helpthe term witnessing is very fitting since the movie isnt watched in the same way youd watch an episode of star trek or whatever the film happens to you and you cant do anything to stop it sure you can switch it off but then you wont be able to remark upon the experience ill let others describe the plot or detail out events what impressed me the most about the film was the way it approached its subject matter which can only be phrased as national geographic on very bad but potent acid sometimes bad trips are important though you tend to learn more from them and they stick with you longer the film is like a train wreck choreographed for maximum shock value and none of it comes across as faked or phony even the very unconvincing parts of the documentary movie within a movie in spite of the lousy acting and atrocious overlapping sic misenscene approach to staging the documentary footage it still rings true no wonder people were stupid enough to think this might be a snuff movie  it hammers away at your brain senses taste and stomach until all you can do is reactthe violence against animals and women alike shown in the film will  should disgust some viewers its always strange to me that people make a clamor for uncensored versions with all of the rape and gore scenes but then blanch over at the sight of a giant turtle being split open like an egg i think deodato suckerpunched everyone with the animal scenes tantalizing vicarious sexual psychopaths with murmurings of savage carnal rape and then shoving their faces into a barf bucket filled with turtle guts that was his way of giving rape freaks the finger for getting off on his movie it should all be sickening get it the narrative is so powerful and compelling and believable to anyone who used to be an overachieving graduate student type willing to go the lengths to take a shot at the history books even if it costs you your life i really was impressed by how the film crew fell to pieces as their legacy of horror caught up with them i can remember hanging painting shows that led to just as much hysteria vomiting and scumbags feeding off the slow agonizing metaphoric deaths of others they should be working with then perishing themselves as the nature of the beast paid them back good riddance another one gone that no one much missesone area of credit that deodato deserves some actual genuine cinematic praise for is how he depicts the native tribes people that figure into the mle of the story not only do they appear to be accurately costumed but their behavior  not as noble savages but as people who just happen to have a totally different culture  is perhaps the most thoughtful out of all the italian cannibal thrillers he is never condescending to the natives even when the team of filmmakers is aping vietnam era soldiers burning down native huts for kicks part of me wonders if this isnt some ultimate example of an anticapitalist liberal fantasy run amok white people invade the sanctum of nature rape and murder their way across the jungle and are torn to pieces  eaten for their arrogance if deodato was responding to vietnam or cambodia in part it will be interesting to see how he responds to iraq afghanistan new york madrid washington london pennsylvania and bali with his cannibal metropolitan sequel in preproduction as of this date if he needs a story editor have someone message me there are some ideas here  only please no turtles910 im sorry its a masterpiece live with it,cruel
i bought this film over ebay after hearing and reading about it i got hold of an uncut version and had high expectations although i wasnt quite sure what to expecti have seen numerous infamous horrorfilms such as bunman the untold story men behind the sun etc but always seems to get most onlineattention and last night i watched it what an absolute mess this film is a joke the acting is dismal i cant believe some reviewers on here speak of realistic acting i have seen better in kindergarten christmas plays  the horrorscenes are unspectacular the axes with which most killing takes place look pathetic and the special effects are poor  the nakedness and rape scenes are simple crowdpleasers as this film as nothing special to offer deodato throws in as many nude scenes as possible which is typical for early 80s italian bmovies  the animal killings are sad in all senses of the word sad deodato realises that these are the only truly gruesome scenes and he milks it by spending too much time on it the turtleslaughter takes nearly 5 minutesthere is so much more to criticise about this film but i wont waste any more time on it dont be mislead by the mediaattention this film is truly terrifying terrifyingly bad,cruel
an elite us and columbian military team go into the jungles of south america to search for lost filmmakers who are making a documentary they battle cannibal tribes including making friends with one so they can get the filmmakers lost films but find the filmmakers dead in new york city television producers want to view the reels so they can see if its suitable enough for television as a documentary special as they view we also see the filmmakers adventure into the south american jungles as they find what horrors lie beyond the green infernosadistic extremely violent realistic immoral and disturbing as well italian made horror adventure classic from ruggero deoato that has became a landmark in foreign horror and one of the most infamous movies of all time the movie is 2 parts in one being the first half being a predatorstyle action adventure and the second half the viewer sees through the eyes of the filmmakers within the movie reels documentarystyle yes the acting is awkward but the movie is very original with a haunting music score and has been known as the source for the blair witch project with the same concept of moviemaking with a home camera to make it as a fake documentary and similar plot about people looking for something legendary then a year later their footage is foundthe movie is filled with realistic graphic violence unpleasant rape scenes  the one in the beginning makes the one in clockwork orange look tame cannibalism nudity gore smarmy sex scenes and the most talked about thing in this movie is the horrifying scenes of actual animals getting killed on screen such as a large turtle getting hacked and ripped apart even from its shell but the animals in the movie were killed for food supply when the movie originally came out in italy it caused quiet a controversy as people thought the filmmakers in the movie were actually murdered as they were arrested but ruggero deoato proved in court that no one was actually killed as it was all faked in the movie except for the animals since then the movie was banned for 4 years then in 1984 it was reissued again then became a hit worldwide including being one of japans highest grossing boxoffice hitsthis film is truly powerful stuff as its difficult to watch but a very unique movie that assaults the viewers senses if you thought a clockwork orange blue velvet and passion of the christ were pretty button pushing then you aint seen nothing yet as this movie ranks as a nasty treat besides caligula and men behind the sun its an important movie in the genre,cruel
what shall we say this were a movie ive heard a lot of different things about some has said that its one of the best horror films out there some has said the direct opposite i is with the second this movie has almost no story it just wants to show up as much cannibal and animal violence as possible sure there is a story which is that a group of documentary makers is set to make a movie about cannibals the film makers disappear so make their video cassettes and soon a group of people is set out to look after the films and the filmmakers they succeed and finds the films but the film makers is dead and after this a group of people looks trough the videotapes and its an oddesey of violence and sex the violence is just unnecessary and everything is just sick and disgusting and then its all the violence against animals ohh they kill a turtle a pig and much more it made me sad and grossed outbut if we shall lock at some good parts which are few the foto is sometimes real nice the acting is not half that bad most of the time but that doesnt help when the rest is so bad i couldnt honestly recommend this to anyone its not really a horror movie its just 90 minutes of the sickest stuff ive seen to date i could say buy this movie if you want to see something unusual but not for entertainment value which there is almost none of,cruel
this film is sick sick i tell you apart from the animal cruelty the worst being when they dissect a tortoise and pull out its intestines and crap bag and start to eat it and numerous other things too sick to mention it is work of art for the first half we follow a group of journalists who investigate and successfully blend in with the natives who treat them with respect do things very gross things to become part of there culture including eating raw meat covered in blood and eating a tribes womans white puke which looks like marshmallow fluff but im sure doesnt taste like itwhen he gets back we see the footage of the other journalists who got separated from him who are basically a bunch of pyschos and who actually got deeper into the tribes peoples culture the film then essentially becomes blair witch but with some truly horrible moments of gore all filmed with realism and we then become the voyeurs of violence the same way as the investigators do as they view the footage and try to make a sensational tabloid story out ofthis is a genius structure for a horror film of this sort works much better than blair witch comments on many themes such as violence voyeurism disrupting ones territory trying to resculpture those in society who have there own lifestyle the tribes the arrogance of white middle class societys desire to change those who are happy with their lifestyle and dont need it changing the journalistsvery gross and hard to stomach but if you can and can get hold of the uncut version do so the violence in this actually makes sense unlike mels passion of the christ,cruel
not withstanding the gratuitous animal cruelty this film is utterly insulting and i am amazed that people cant see through the masquerade as art this film is  shocking for the sake of being shocking and that is the laziest form of film making the film is utterly racist with every one of the natives portrayed as violent rapists it is also utterly misogynistic in fact has me worried about the film maker considering that every single woman in the film is viciously raped and that the rapes are seen as titillating utterly disgusting,cruel
i stopped long ago using scatological metaphors about movies but this one sorely tried meits simply the worst movie ive ever seen the first half alone is an overstretched patchwork of delaying dodges badly acted poorly directed and execrably edited cant imagine there was a script before this mess and lets forget the blatantly fartee soundtrackthe worse is yet to come in the rushes of the first expedition charitable spoilers ahead as theres very little plot to be shot some animals are slaughtered along the way the whole slaughter is morbidly shown in extenso its a documentary you know then you get to know the guys of the expedition really bad guys they rape they wreck havoc just for fun o in the end they get what they deserve they are slaughtered one after the other until theres no one left to shoot the marvelous show the old pretence for morbid voyeurism look what some weirdos are able to do incredible aint it positive side disclaimer let me tell you i am not proud of finding positive things in it the exploitative premise was good an anthropologist gets his hands on cans of reels shot by an illfated expedition as they did later with the blairwitch project largely cashed in on the marketing buzz there was snuff stuff in itanyone who admires or simply finds this interesting should go and see a psychologist moreover i hate to say so but anyone who wants to watch this another time should be filed for the sake of inland security,cruel
i watched this film for 2 reasons 1 i love gore 2like lots of other people i am tempted by the fact that it was bannedi have to say that as far as the basics of the film gothe rape and murderthe cannibalism and the tortureits all pretty much mundane and you can actually find far worse in a lot of filmsthe only thing that really got to me was what was done to the animalsthere are scenes of real brutality towards a lot of animals in this film and frankly it appalled mei love films with buckets of blood and gore and rape murder death etc etc etc but animals should never be killed for enjoymentif you like gory filmsit aint bad but if you have a sense of decency and like animals to be given a chance to live without being needlessly killed avoid like the plague,cruel
rarely have i seen such a tremendous amount of stupidity the cannibals are shown in a grotesque way that kills all the credibility of the project moreover the young documentary team is composed of characters that are totally unrealistic either they or the director had never seen a documentary in their life before the purpose of the film is to simulate in the mind of the audience the impact and the crudity of a snuff movie however the film is made in a way that annihilates this idea the situations are totally unreal  we are oftenly given to see sequences in which four points of view at the least are involved when the crew possess supposedly two cameras countains a number of clichs as rarely seen before and after including a touch of poor pornography the psychology of the characters is pathetically plain the pseudoehtnologists that are shown in the film behave like the young brainless postteenagers that they probably are in real life we are thus given to see a succession of rape scenes murder scenes animal slaughter each one more aberrant than the other in other words is an hallucinating piece of junk which i wouldnt advise my worst ennemy to watch,cruel
this movie could have easily been a 9 or a 10 because it is truly a disturbing masterpiece and really makes you think about what we consider civilized the reason im rating it so low is that it is ridiculous that the animal slaughters were done using live animals 7 animals were killed in the making of this video though only 6 are shown which was completely unnecessary as they clearly had the skills to depict realistic murderslaughterrapegore scenes as shown by all the gruesome events featuring humans the only good thing to come out of this is that very few movies afterwards ever used real animals becausr of all the backlash this one received,cruel
why has the modern society created a label horror as if to separate it when in truth any type of danger death or threat could be horror in any genre to our senses to me deodato has never made any horror he made films to awake you to life itself which includes both realms of light and dark equally feel the music in so heavenly exactly during times of great darkness at the same time that is deodatos theme constantly hiding underneath most of his films from waves of lust to ballad in blood the latter one even features the famous opening scene where a guy is vomitting onto his girlfriend right at the moment of making love to her speaks on a very intellectual level driven by visceral content not about some people but most of the society unaware of its hypocrisy it juxtaposes the nature and the falseness of man colliding with the nature always winning at the endamong other things i see the killing of animals killing is not animal cruelty as one of the most beautiful things about this film and truly genious in the way of testing audiences own triggers insecurity and disconnection from life life tests us all the time when our wife is raped or our child killed for instance how many men have enough emotional maturity not to feel the need for revenge or feel stable during times of emotional darkness this is what spiritual masters have always overcome not to get swallowed by darkness but embrace it by embodying enough light within ourselveshas been among the most relevant films for the mankind in these last few decades for its reactions from the public and until most of the society transcends the limitations that can get people even offended or insecure it will still have a lot to say subconsciously people are drawn to films like this without fully knowing whythis film shows a picture of what most of this world has yet to overcome,cruel
bloody disgusting but a remarkable achievement this movie had a lot of controversy surrounding the kills in it just remember its just a movie,cruel
cannibal holocost is a special film it pulls no punches and spares no feelings its positively disgusting but written well enough that it still has a cohesive compelling story between the grossout moments which is something far too many extreme films lack the characters are wellacted and compelling and though you know that the film crew will ultimately meet their demise you find yourself feeling a warped sense of justice seeing it unfold in all its grisly glorythis is the only movie that has managed to make my stomach churn i could talk about the animal cruelty as so many have but i feel that since the animals were all later eaten or so ive heard its just a fact of life that we firstworld moviegoers arent used to seeing portrayed in such graphic visceral fashion the soundtrack only helped it along heightening the anxiety that came along with these scenes and helping to truly cement the film into the back of your mind foreverin the end the message is very clear and one that i think most of us can stand by humans are buttholes especially firstworld humans,cruel
made in 1980 is considered to be the most controversial movie ever made one of the many italian cannibal films of the time the story is about a professor searching for a missing documentary crew when he finds the footage and brings it home he realizes how the film crew really acted after the film was released the director ruggero deodato was arrested on obscenity and murder charges but prooved he didnt kill his actors overall the film is entertaining and enjoyable but may be hard to watch it has many scenes that are very graphic including scenes of real animals being killed but one scene stands out from the rest and that would be the ritualistic punishment scene its so hard to watch and so graphic the score for the film is great from the main theme to savage rite its definitely one to save on spotify i do perfer man from deep river and cannibal ferox over this though,cruel
as is often the case with horror movies one of the weakest aspects of this film is the acting which is serviceable at best with the exception of robert kerman as the lead monroe it helps that the character he plays is a very likeable one who leads this expedition in search of the missing filmmakers with the best intentions  he immediately sympathises with his yacumo guide and respects the yanomam enough to strip naked and wash in front of them and even to share human meat with them when he returns home to view the footage he becomes both literally and symbolically the audience and the filmmaker at the same timeseeing the story from monroes perspective means we see the aftermath of the missing filmmakers expedition during the first half of the film and the footage of the expedition itself during the second it was a neat touch to show monroe in between his reviews of the footage  at first hes eagerly trying to interview the deceaseds families but by the end hes advocating the tapes destruction one thing that doesnt add up however is why the filmmakers would have recorded themselves committing these awful acts if they were trying to stage everything  why film themselves raping a womanin addition to some great gore and cadaver effects there are lots of haunting visuals including the shrine made from human bones wrapped in recording equipment the raped girl impaled on a wooden pole and the numerous animal killings which were genuine and are very hard to watch these contrast effectively with the more beautiful shots of nature and wildlife the sound design is gritty with the volcanic gunshots being most noteworthy and the score is just amazing  from the beautiful yet subtly eerie opening theme to the quiet foreboding ambience of tribal drums to the track adulteress punishment which is beyond wordstheres some great albeit onthenose dialogue throughout that puts the films lofty message across nicely  that perhaps were worse than the savages this is a film about children of the space age being consumed by a primitive world they thought they could conquer as well as about the ethics of journalists that exploit the less fortunate for entertainmenti wasnt disappointed when i first watched this film its as shocking graphic and hardtowatch as youd expect but its far more intelligent than people give it credit for910,cruel
its tough to really talk about not because its a high art cinema masterpiece more because its a gut wrenching crawl through the pits of depravity even today 30 years after its release its still a film that brings out intense disgust and revolt a film so controversial it still remains banned and heavily censored in numerous countries a film so gruesomely realistic the director was charged with obscenity and was accused of making a snuff film yet without the world wouldnt have found footage movies a low budget genre of horror which presents itself as a real event captured through a home camera which was popularised by films like the blair witch project and paranormal activity this film birthed a genre and for that its cemented itself into film historyis ripe with numerous cliches for the genre the typical group of film makers go missing and their footage is discovered later interestingly the film itself spends a large amount of time focusing on the discovery of the footage professor harold monroe portrayed by famous porn star robert kerman ventures into the depths of the amazon in search of a missing documentary team consisting of alan the director gabriel yates his girlfriend faye francesca ciardi and their two cameramen mark luca barbareschi and jack perry pirkanen who were shooting a film on the yanomam and shamatari tribes upon discovering their footage he takes it back to new york and clashes with tv executives who desire to use the footage in a guaranteed ratings success documentary upon viewing the footage the true nature of the crew shows itself in one of most testing stomaching churning films ever mademainly consists of two things one incredibly realistic and graphic violence and two surprisingly effective commentary on journalism ethics and western modernisation dont get me wrong is muddled in its message in its attempts to portray the ill effects of sensationalism the film itself devolves into it beneath the commentary on journalistic ethics and treatment of indigenous peoples is a horror film and a brutally violent one at that yet surprisingly it manages to get its warped message across beneath the buckets of gore and horror the crew making the documentary are cons staging murders and causing terror in the search for the perfect shot in a notable scene the group stumbles into a yacumo village where they hoard the villages up in a hut and set it a light filming the resulting panic and chaos another notorious scene involves the male members of the crew violently rape a native girl knowing full well she will be executed by the tribe they discover her impaled corpse on the shore later and gleefully film the sight the executives are aware of alans habit of committing murder with his crew yet they turn aw blind eye because as one of the executives puts it today people want sensationalism the more you rape there senses the happier they are in a way shes right paints a horrific picture that isnt afraid to use some of the darkest stuff ever set to tape to get its message across yet there are times where it gets a bit out of handtheres another thing about that tends to get people upset the animal violence uses genuine animal gore why it does this i have no idea but the nearly 5 minute scene of a turtle being bisected and disembowelled is where i started to get angry indeed six animals are slaughtered on camera the last five in a space of 30 minutes snakes and spiders are sliced in half a pig is beaten and shot and in probably the worst scene of the film a coatimundi is stabbed through the neck and dies a slow painful death while screeching in agony its rancid exploitive and most importantly cruel yet if you can look past such a thing the actual meat and bones pardon the pun of is surprisingly effective yes its overly gruesome yes its hypocritical but ill be damned if it didnt make me think the films harrowing conclusion is where things really descend into hell as the crew are all violently massacred and eaten by the tribe yet still even while their crew mate is gang raped and beheaded the remaining crew insist on filming even until theyre torn to shreds the footage stops and monroe ponders to himself i wonder who the real cannibals are is disgusting its a vile wretched piece of cinema that never ceases in offending and revelling in its own degeneracy but still its a surprisingly effective and well thought out critique on the western world seeking to reach out its grasp into what remains of ancient tribes and to crush them on the corrupted journalism scene which warps the truth and commits heinous acts to get the perfect story on the dangers of not respecting cultures alien to us its a long road to hell and paints it perfectly dripping with blood realism and most of all truth710,cruel
ive now shown this movie to people five times after id watched it it is one of the only movies that has ever made me sick and it really made me think about who we are as peopleis outrageous solely because of the fact that its supposed to question our morals as a society weve all taken world history and literature at some point atrocities are committed all the time in history but we dont think about it as much because we cant relate to history if we werent therewell this makes sure you knowhotel rwanda and the boy in the striped pajamas are the only movies ive seen that have a similar theme we think you are evil but in reality we are more savage than youyes the incessant animal cruelty was unnecessary but cruelty in general is unnecessary and this was based on a true storyif only deodato could have made more gems like this to make us fear and thinkgratzie for this wonderful opportunity to scare people into the light,cruel
this movie does what most horror films do featuring real life killings of animals and burning down a tribal village just for fun shows how this movie is extremely unapologetic,cruel

there i was eating a couple of bland rich tea biscuits when all of a sudden an innocent monkey is decapitated with a tribesman devouring its tiny skull safe to say i did not eat anymore rich tea biscuits often regarded as the most controversial film of alltime naturally i prepped my mind and body for the worst although i do not condone various practices during its filming surprised me there is textual substance to be found beneath the excessive gore and sexual violence a professor travels to the amazon to locate missing filmmakers who were creating a documentary on the green inferno when he finds their skeletal remains and the films he returns back to civilisation to watch the footage a fundamental question is raised as the documentary reveals its true nature are the civilised just as savage as the primitive are we the true cannibals of humanity by pioneering the found footage technique this film was widely regarded for its shocking realism so much so that the director was accused of murder and with this technique the exploration into societal savagery is a thorough bloody presentation the bloodsoaked actions of the tribal individuals are reactions from the filmmakers who cause destruction to their village sexually assaulting their women and unnecessarily murdering the inhabitants their monstrous actions are exaggerated to absurd levels that whilst frequently feels derivative does highlight the violence ensued by white colonials the acting was mediocre and the editing often haphazard but the amateur style offers a contagious charm that makes the whole scenario feel even more realhowever despite the bbfc cutting these scenes out i do take issue with the obscene amount of animal cruelty no creature should be slaughtered for the sake of art so slicing tarantulas and snakes with a machete is a no from me dragging a turtle onto shore and removing its insides is a no from me authenticity has its limits the first thirty minutes were particularly slow as you patiently wait for the controversy to ensue a disadvantage of acquiring such a title however the pace picks up as soon as the professor interacts with the tribe its also worth mentioning that the act of sexual violence was completely unnecessary and seems like its sole purpose is just to justify the damnation of these documentarians theyve already done enough to be viewed as the antagonists therefore proving this scene to be nothing more than obscenity so whilst i condemn certain excessive segments and filmmaking techniques there is a surprising amount of substance just make sure you dont eat anything as you watch it,cruel
i dont have a problem with the excessive violence if its acted but the cruelty to animals is entirely unnecessary and the filmmakers were clearly ignorant to the irony of their white people are bad arent we good to point that out message any value that was here perhaps in being one of the first films to use found footage is made null and void  though it must be said there was almost no value here to begin with its a dull film with stupid writing and bad acting dont bother,cruel
ill admit it i watched this movie because its notorious but was surprised to find the cannibalism was minor what it really is is a movie about exploitation that is a lot more than skin deep and mixes a fictional movie with reality in ways that are quite disorientating  i found that i couldnt easily compartmentalize the violence rape and gore into this is just a movie as easily as usual the reason is simple  the animal deaths are real the guts that are portrayed as human are probably real animal guts the director exploits the real natives they were real and none of them get credits the main characters exploit the natives the natives exploit each other the studio execs exploit everyone i as a watcher am exploiting the natives and the animalsvery interesting to ponder in the days after youve watched it dont get me wrong though the finale is pretty gruesome and looks very very real partly because it maintains the handicamlost film idea right to the endi guess i didnt give it a 10 because the it doesnt really age well  but most certainly this is a one of a kind movie that cant be easily repeated  certainly not by hollywood,cruel
is an obscenity but its an obscenity with purpose the film is heavily censored in many countries and banned in even more countries due to the excessive amounts of violence nudity and gore its hard to criticize this aspect of the movie though because its so relevant to the plot and very well madeshoti dont want to be that guy that likes to talk about messages in movies but does a fantastic job taking a look at western culture i dont want to spoil the unraveling of the message over the course of the film but by the end it may really make you think about some things in life a little differently including this moviethe biggest criticism i hear from people who resent this movie is that several animals were killed in the making of which i think is truly horrible but i think its more important to look at the film its self and not the production behind it i think some of the weaker aspects of the movie are some of the subpar acting shaky cam moments and use of music at certain momentsi really dont know if i can outright recommend just because of how extreme it is but it is still a very well made film that has a lot to offer in terms of horror and message as well as being the first found footage film,cruel
thats all i have to say just thought id share it is a good film obviously a classic i saw it at a midnight showing recently but once i watched the gore and the unsettling imagery in its entirety i decided i never wanted to eat meat again,cruel
watched this movie quite a few years back and at first i was a bit disturbed there are a lot of scenes in the movie which i thibk will disturb a lot of people however after thinking over it i found out that the director of the movie has actually shown the reality the group that went into the amazon to search for the missing three persons actually exploited the tribe and their traditions in various ways as a result the tribe revolted against them and then followed rape and murder of these people a good movie i would say,cruel
lets get the obvious out of the way this is a very disturbing movie and as someone who can watch abbatoir footage completely stonefaced this is somehow worse watching it at times i honestly felt sick and finishing it i vowed i would never watch it again this is a very uncomfortable film approach with cautionnow thats out of the way while i dont like this movie for a few reasons im not even going to attempt to say why i do have to admit it is pretty clever in spite of its hypocritical production again im not getting into it the basic idea is about sensationalism and how the media chooses to spin things so to be completely fair it is pretty cleverat first like i said this movie is very disturbing and veeeeery uncomfortable it is admittedly very well acted though inevitably some of the adr is kinda flaky the idea is quite clever and i hate to admit it but its directed and shot very well especially by 70s80s exploitation standards but none of this justifies anything that happens on screen my five out of ten grade was very begrudging make of that what you will but dont say i didnt warn you,cruel
this film only warrants to be used as toilet paper during the day after 1983 tv from the real killings of a turtle to that of a spider monkey this film is about an nyu professor who goes to south america to salvage the film recordings and find the crew who were sent to investigate a cannibalistic tribe soon he returns to new york to view the tapes with his peers they discover the crews heinous intent in south america  which seems to be bent on destruction and violence along with the poor portrayal of the native tribes filled with offensive and graphic scenes such as rape murder and the killing of numerous live animals the story speaks on a very shallow level about violence in the media the footage from the crew is filmed in a very gritty cinema verit documentary style somewhat convincing the viewer that what they are seeing is in fact real although this is somewhat intriguing the film fails to produce anything but a ultraviolent pseudosnuff film which makes you want to get into a delorean kick in up to 88 and drive into a brick wall this review is a warning do not watch this film not even for those with a strong stomach the crews footage will most likely shock and disgust you and not in a good way no wonder the director spent some time in jail due to this  above all else  loathesome piece of celluloid s,cruel
it works to an extent in showing who are the real savages but then it doesnt work when it becomes what exactly it is criticizing but then the director has contradicted himself at different occasions about meaning to include a message and not however the level of animal cruelty and racism is quite apparent the film is quite brilliant and shocking at times but in the end its disgusting not just because of what is shown but how they chose to show it,cruel
seducing the wild side of every humansthe only unwatchable thing is the killing of innocent animals they are real not graphics,cruel
has always been a movie that by reputation that ive avoided its been tagged as the one that goes all the way and has been banned in over fifty countries and it isnt every movie that gets confiscated ten days after its premiere with the director arrested and charged with obscenityhow much of this film was inspired by gualtiero jacopetti and his cycle of mondo films like mondo cane africa addio and goodbye uncle tom i think deodato tips his hand toward this influence by using the music of italian composer riz ortolani whose song more was featured in mondo cane it was nominated for an academy award for best original song in 1963 ortolanis soundtrack is well the best part of the film the opening song is gorgeous and lush with only a subtle hint that all will not be wellits hard to truly believe in the who are the real animals narrative when it seems like deodato learned none of those lessons for himself still i feel that films should challenge you and push you and make you think i wouldnt recommend this film im not upset that i watched it but i know how people are about having their sensibilities threatened and this is a film that will bleed puke and piss all over them before eating the remains,cruel
blair witch project came out in 1999 as paranormal activity did in 2007 originally 2005 was the beginning of found footagemore than just shaky cameras and a blessing of no digital effects is controversial practical and risqu as a found footage film should be the journey of who the real cannibals are makes you consider the definition of cannibal once more considering how cannibals can be hungry enough even for another human being to be degraded and belittled of a stoneage culture with those film cameras in grip like a pistol it adds more the journey of these lost americans and their intentions of recording footage as a trophy and eradication more than an observation of stoneage culturesclearly this was a big deal in 1980 for how realistic it looks and even makes cgi in todays technological standards look like a couple of steps behind but once youve seen it again it is obvious with the practical effects and if you research the controversy that surrounded this film they literally had to take this film to court blair witch project was good but jittery and shaky if the lack of dialogue makes you impatient paranormal activity set the digital standard of found footage however was shattered in my belief over the 2007 ending over the 2005 endingits pacy its edgy and it makes you cringe and clinch no other found footage films done especially when it comes to controversy a serbian film counterargued in 2011 and succeeded,cruel
at the time most hollywood movies allowed animals to die in a film from horses to dogs which were strays plus the few nocturnal bats was also the first movie to introduce found footage sequences to make it seem more real than it actually is a story about a group of anthropologist thrill seekers who wanted to make a documentary about a hidden tribe not seen by any white man in history tales of past cannibalistic people started to surface in the mid to late seventies as borders in the amazon forest became public after much heated debates in the unsoon countless documentaries were told about reclusive and often remote tribal people on camera some that became violent resulted in either internal executions or from an outside source such as the military regimes who thwarted the indigenous people as punishment yet to give this film a broader scope the realistic viewpoints of the troupe landed them in deep trouble as their idealistic way through uses of unneeded violence such as gang raping one of the women or killing animals as a means to eat the effects bordered both realism and daunting horror as each trekker became victim to their own debauchery and unconfined judgment to get that one perfect shot even in the face of deathafter this film was shown in theatres most went to the humane society and vetoed from the public eye because it was so honestly raw and horrific to stomach censors from all over the us banned it from being shown because of the extremities and wanton chaos that the story had displayed in fact it was vaulted until an appeal was issued some twenty years later via the freedom of speech act was brought up in the shortest court case in history since then this film had been the pinnacle of later films such as the blair witch project and countless other movies that uses found footage techniquesexcept with this film not all could still stomach some of the gratuitous gore or unneeded sequences of killing animals such as the turtle or boar and even the muskrat the cruelty displayed in still lingers to those viewers who saw it the first time and has never adapted well to other such films perhaps the desensitization dug deeper than it would allow but for newer audience members it has a cult following for me i do not like this film it uses too much grotesque misogynistic scenes that displays at how thoughtless and ridiculous a human can bealthough it was supposed to be an anthropology study it soon became a mindless crazed romp in the jungle with a group of students who only wanted to be famous no matter the cost yet in the end their only means of remembrance got burned in the cellar incinerator along with all of their notes and collected archived footage an ironic result that stated to the outside world that the amazon forest should remain a mystery and for those who trespass onto sacred ground knowing or not knowing the rules could get them killed either way the people have been ongoing since the stone age and does not need to be disturbed by any interferences not recommended to anyone under the age of eighteen this a very volatile film and must not be watched alone,cruel
is a very good movie but its also a gruesome movie i am a person who can handle blood guts and gore very good but this was totally insane i was so offended at some points in this movie that i almost threw up the other thing i didnt like about this movie is that the acts they did to the animals ive never liked to see animals die or being tortured in movies but i can handle it okay in this movie though i did not believe what i saw at times they cut off the legs of a turtle while it was alive and ripped of the shell of the turtle as well but other than this i would call this movie a fantastic movie the shots in this movie is fantastic and we get a look at what humanity can do to the jungle absolutely a must watch for a horror fan but not if youre easily offended i think it will be a long long time to the next time i will see this movie since even though it is a masterpiece i do not wish to be so offended as i was when i watched this movie again,cruel
tells the story of a film crew that was lost in the amazon while filming a documentary on life in the jungle their camera reveals the a horrifying truth about what really happens away from civilized society from start to finish the movie is filled with shocking and graphic moments so if you get squeamish at the thought of cannibalism i would recommend steering clear of this moviewhen people tell you not to watch this movie they mean it i saw this when i was 15 after i was told by several people it was too intense for anyone i thought i would be able to handle it since i watch a lot of scary intense and gory movies but too it to a whole new leveleven though this movie is extremely well made and delivers its message well the one major thing i dont like about this movie it its real animal cruelty scenes yes actual animals were killed while this movie was being filmed and it was all caught on camera i could have gone my whole life without seeing those scenes and i would have died a happy man but not anymore,cruel
prior to my viewing of ruggero deadatos i had of course the knowledge of the films controversy and notorious reputation as being one of the most disturbing movies ever made hence this was my reason for viewing it and boy was i underwhelmed first of all there is very little gore in this movie when compared against modern horror movies in addition to such the scenes of sexual violence and rape were also fairly lower in impact than what is around nowadays now for me to consider something to be disturbing requires it to be realistic and believable is often neither thus why it did not disturb me the acting is poor and often amateur at best but then again i dont go into viewing a film called with the expectation of topnotch acting and brilliant dialogue but this was worse than i expected summary little violence  poor acting  no reason to be disturbingthe film also features several scenes of genuine animal killings and as ive been thinking now i thought to myself why were they even in the film for example at one point the documentarians participate in the decapitation and mutilation of a turtle which they then eat how did this act further the plot themes or ideas of the film in any way what are we meant to interpret that documentarians have a taste for turtle meat this is just one of numerous pointless animal killings in the filmand im also not a fan of the found footage genre which seems to often be an excuse to put less effort and money into filming a movie in addition to poor acting handheld camera footage only further establishes a bgrade feel that no viewer likes not that there arent good found footage films but you get what i meanso at this point youre probably wondering to yourself about why ive rated this film a 7 considering that i have so many negative criticisms well i want it be noted that i do enjoy the ideas and themes of the film that are conveyed such as documentarians being more savage than the treedwelling jungle inhabitants which leaves the viewer wondering who the real cannibals are this comparison of different peoples attempts to redefine our definition of the word civilised it is the intelligence behind these ideas that i enjoy in conjunction with this the film has a good plotto summarise i would like to say that this film is not disturbing in its time of the early 80s it wouldve been the most repulsive film available yet graphic violence in film is much more common now the film also has a good plot and conveys good ideas yet these wouldve been more effective should the film have had better acting and been filmed differently overallhence my rating is 710 its good not great not something that im likely to watch again,cruel
if the dude who made this movie had never been born would that mean we would never have been exposed to these garbage found footage films ah if only wishes could come truesometimes movies are heralded as classics just because theyre old this is one of those films its not a classic horror like the shining a clockwork orange the amityville horror or even the entity its just an old overly hyped torture porn flick if youre into that watch it i watched it for free so im not fussed about the hour and thirty plus minutes i lost on it spoiler alert it only starts to get disturbing or even interesting after about an hour into the movie and frankly the most disturbing part of the film is the apparently needless slaughtering of the animals and the savage on a stick for a low budget film those special effects looked pretty dmn real far surpassing most present day films of the same caliber that hadheave a much bigger budget i hope they at least fed the dead animals to the villagers poor turtledidnt feel the least bit sorry for the environmentalists their deaths were well deserved dont fck around with the tree people live like a savage die like a savageoverall the movie was meh i give it a six because its fairly watchable the effects are excellent and it is thought provoking provided youve got more than two brain cells rubbing togetherwho are the real savagesim going to say the human race as a whole,cruel
dear ruggero deodato a day after 911 somebody should have sent a copy of your film to the bush administration they would never have invaded iraqlet me just say that is a tremendous achievement what can you say about a 35 year old horror film that puts most modern horror films to shame there is just so much to appreciate in your filmlet me start with the structure now i am no horror movie geek but i think yours must be one of the first found footage films only a third of the movie is found footage unlike recent found footage films your film involves characters reflecting on the found footage i think this was a great idea as it provides contextyour fearless daring also needs to be appreciated i heard you got arrested for some of the stuff you put on film but i read that sergio leone congratulated your personally so it did pay off in the end i admit that i had to take my eyes off the screen during some of the animal violence but i dont get all the outrage i am on the side of the people who argue that animals get murdered everyday to feed families anyway the scenes of violence between the tribal s and the civilized were also gruesome and disturbing i can only imagine what went on during the shoot i guess the crew must have had great fun the sex scene was almost pornographic i seriously doubt whether they were actingand that score by riz ortolani and the way you used it ortolanis score which conveys a sense of nostalgia and doom at the same time elevated this movie to another level i cannot imagine this movie without the background score or this background score being used for another movie the tune called adulteress punishment played during the scenes of primitive violence is just art the warm and summery main theme provides a great start to the film with the overhead shot of the forestlast but not the least the social commentary i couldnt help but feel that the whole film is a critique of western intervention in the affairs of third world nations the two fighting tribes and the civilized western man playing them against each other is almost certainly you having a go at american foreign policy the civilized western man and woman making love out in the open as the tribal s look on could be an allegory for the spread of debauched western culture across the world and the repeated shots of the tall skyscrapers in the western cities were you implying that in the face of mans primitive urges all the skyscrapers would amount to nothing  i wonder if the 911 terrorists watched once again your film is a tremendous achievement i am not rating it a 1010 due to the bad acting but that is a minor complaint in a film like thisi hope to watch this in blu ray and i will be watching more of your moviesbest regards pimpin910,cruel
have seen it this despite it combines two of my not so favorite elements being gore and found footage its pretty weird because found footage stands for me for what the x is going on or to quote one of those annoying blair witch characters what the x is that while no one could see anything and there might have been nothing and probably was nothing but its not about the blair witch project if did one thing right despite its disturbing content was not to shy away from what was happening and make it clear what actually was filmed not his overly shaky drunk camerawork which makes me dizzy but the found footage is only in the second half approximately 40 minutes and interrupted by reactions of shock from those who are in discussion whether to broadcast it or notnow about the gore well almost exclusively in the found footage stuff and no i didnt really come only from the cannibals actually the things the white documentary makers were doing were way more disturbing to me they actually were the ones acting like savages uncivilized beasts i think it answered the professors question at the end very well there who are actually the cannibals obviously not the nativesi liked the buildup the professor visiting the native tribes and he sees they are actually not those savages that outsiders believe them to be but it could have been shortened in my opinion maybe some more time could have been given to those nasty documentary shooters yeah its hard to get much character development if only excerpts from their documentary are shown and i doubt however i would have felt more sympathy for them in the end i knew the film would not want to make me feel sorry for them they deserved their fate as cruel as it was but what they did to the natives and the animals was much more cruel they obviously wanted to abuse their power to get sensational shots yes even if faye the only female among the 4 adventurers didnt really actively participate in harassing the natives she did nothing to prevent her colleagues committing these crimes she did approve of them the only time she intervenes is when the guys rape a native girl not because she feels pity for the girl but because she doesnt want them to waste film and she particularly doesnt like it when her sleazy boyfriend has a go at the girl too while it might sound clich yeah the guys are pigs in it the girl is again the decent one well that stood for me until faye allowed herself to be banged by her boyfriend for all the natives to see and went totally down the drain when she did nothing to save that poor native girl from the white rapistsnow i have been hesitating to talk about the animal killings and abuse again i think the white men where the ones who did it for their pleasure not the natives with the turtle scene the most obvious example but to say that the movie needs to rely on these scenes to shock the audience clearly didnt get the point the movie makers wanted to make again the cruelties are shown not always overly detailed which isnt necessary we know here exactly what cruelties are and who does them we dont need to guess not that feeling i have with other found footage what did happen did there happen actually anything now is this a good movie i think in its genre yes very much i really like how it panned out and i liked the point the makers tried to get across it has happened before so many times white men forcing their civilization onto tribes in africa america even wiping out whole tribes of them of course they would fight back to keep their land their culture thats what every race would do to protect their own kind im not saying i am a fan of found footage now but it actually redeemed my view on the genre at least if it would actually be filmed in the way it was done in i guess when they go supernatural as since blair witch and so on i would lose my interest again,cruel
how eduardo sanchez found this film inspiring whilst creating and producing the blair witch project i have no earthly idea after watching this film i have to comment that this film is the most disturbing horror film i have ever had the misfortune to watch  and this is coming from a person who personally loves horror films it was too disturbing that i cant even give this film a rating i was originally intrigued about this film after i glanced at the supposedly banned film i spit on your grave and assumed that the movie was banned during a time where gruesome horror was taboo in our once civilised society compared to the usual macabre we see in horror movies today however when i sat down to watch this movie i could not believe what i had seen on my laptop screen of course the word cannibal kind of gives the main plot of the movie away automatically because we relate the ideas of killings and eating flesh to this word but this movie takes the idea of cannibalism way too far we as an audience simply wished to see nothing but 1980s horror however deodato shocked us with at least six different examples of animal cruelty the scene where the squirrel monkey is decapitated and defaced will never leave my thoughts many scenes of rape honestly the gangrape scene makes us as civilised humans look like sexstarved degenerates and of course the infamous scenes of tortures and unnecessary killings the impalement scene being one of them i apologise deodato but we did not ask to see such horror and macabre and what inspired you to create such a film is beyond me completely what happened to the simple yet excellent horror we once saw in films such as the 1984 version of a nightmare on elm street or the shining whatever is wrong with sticking to this simple genre of horror im sure that way deodato you will gain a much eager audience than what you did with this monstrosity therefore is not for the faint of heart indeed you might be tempted to watch this film again and again but be warned you will never think about horror films the same way again after watching ,cruel
when i think of horror truly genuine horror not the cheap stuff that teenage girls screamgigglegiggle at its almost always something hyperrealistic do not misunderstand me im not contradicting hp lovecraft when he stated that horror and fantasy are only separated by a stream of black water but i am saying its a narrowminded view fantasy worlds that we do not understand will always scare some of us but there will also always be a group of people who find all unrealistic horror completely laughable in the exact opposite sense ive never once heard a person say that the premises behind truly realistic horror films were laughable ironically realistic horror is scarce perhaps its because we live in a time where modern directors saw the omen when they were 2yearsold their underdeveloped minds mistook cheese for terror and now they live and breathe to pump the horror genre full of crappy unoriginal movies like the unborn or a tale of two sisters thus whenever i see a truly realistic horror film regardless of its quality i cant help but take it at least twice as seriously as i would yet another oh theres a cheesy demon lets get naked then do some insanely stupid thing and get killed film in other words is far from a great film in terms of quality but the fact its actually realistic gives it weight and makes it worth watchingthe first time i attempted to watch ill admit i was bored to the point of tears it just seemed like a toneddown less entertaining version of the temple of doom i turned it off 15 minutes in the next day came and i reluctantly decided to force myself to sit through the other 70 minutes of the film this time it caught my attention immediately the boring fauxdocumentary setup blended into an infinitely more interesting study of human naturewhile most films that study human nature really just end up repeating elementary facts that we knew before we were old enough to get into pgrated movies there is quite a bit more intelligence here instead of typically displaying the entire modern society or just the american society as evil accurately depicts the mental breakdown of the young liveforthemoment mind in 2009 thats something ive rarely seen in 1980 im pretty sure it was an original concept to display on film also what makes infinitely more realistic to battle royale or lord of the flies is that it never uses extremes while the former two works that i listed lump the entire human race together into a single idealistic gobbledygook character type does the opposite and presents good bad and everything in between through diverse realistic character traits this is why is so intelligent in presenting the whole clich human nature is to kill conceptas for the quality    well people have accurately said that the acting from the older people isnt great the four young central characters all act realistically and are portrayed realistically however i didnt find the acting bad enough to be distracting at any point in the film some of the gore effects are outdated but again i didnt feel it took away from the story unless you allow it tothe gore is minimal at best some would go as far as to say it isnt there at all there are a few generic nongraphic hollywood rape scenes a few infamous animal killings and a few human lacerations but thats about it its nothing you havent seen hundreds of times before a lot like a clockwork orange and natural born killers i have absolutely no idea how this film was labeled as insanely violent much less violentgory at all the small amount of gore that was there was simply generic and done in a nongraphic way im someone who is very sensitive to graphic gore and i found everything in this movie below the level of violence in the average rrated movie compared to any given saw film just looks bloodless i am not complaining about this however just stating the fact the movie did not need more gore for any reason and i blame the lack of it only on the silly infamous hypeoverall i found a very entertaining and thoughtprovoking experience i watched it with low expectations and had an absolute blast one of the most fun movies ive ever watched alone regardless of my tastes however it is impossible to deny the territory and importance of this film on the horror genre it forces you out of your face fantasy world and rubs your face in the filth of the real world    even if that filth isnt really that disturbing610,cruel
i think you have to see this film very much a product of its time the 1970s as every one knows were a time of filmmaking excess or boundary pushing whatever you want to call it and is probably the most notorious horrorexploitation film from that period gritty unflinching looks at the cruelties men are capable of like the films of michael winner with somewhat confused moral messages often involving the intrusion of evil white men into the territory of natives who prove to be just as brutal in retaliating to the atrocities committed by said white men its often unclear just how we are meant to take all of this and while such uncertainty accounts for the films unprecedented power their deeply unpleasant impure feel it seems somehow reprehensible if no less reprehensible than hollywoods increasingly overt glorification of violence if its to save cute little kiddies and is done by your favourite action heroesso to even more than winners more mainstream work its a misanthropic film but like winners its targets appear a little confused as another review ive read has noted it sets up its crew of filmmakers pretty much as straw men while it may be true that newscrews exaggerate manipulate distort etc i find it unlikely that theyd go as far as to massacre pretty much a whole village and thus muddies the message furthermore while the anthropologist proff monroe becomes the jaded voice of reason later in the film earlier hes not exactly a pillar of virtue shooting several members of one tribe in cold blood so as to gain the trust of another tribe the idea that holocaust is attacking the mondo films some of which actually did stage shocking events is rendered unlikely by the fact that with its attempt at veriterealism it comes across as a mondo film itself at least in the final documentary sectionin making this film it seems deodato deliberately plays up and questions his own role as exploitation filmmaker though by doing so he unwittingly undermines himself as well when in the penultimate scene the tv executive orders the footage to be burned one wonders if this was not the very same attitude held by those who tried to censor deodatos work for a film that exists seemingly to confront and arguably to exploit the depths of human depravity cruelty and violence the professors stance wanting to suppress the footage seems protectionist censorial surely it would make more sense to expose the filmmakers for who they were as is deodato and the scripts intention after all their earlier documentary the road to hell has been shown to have been faked to some extent yet people will believe it be real  would it not make more sense to expose the filmmakers and by extension the culture of exploitative reporting that they embody furthermore deodatos attitude to the native tribes is confused were supposed to sympathise or at least to understand the actions they take towards the filmcrew to see them as justified while they react with initial suspicion towards monroe it never looks like theyre actually going to eat him but the massacre in a hut pushes them over the edge yet what to make of the native savagery in one infamous scene the crew come across a naked woman impaled on a pole alan smirks seems to be enjoying the spectacle but is then told youre on camera and immediately changes to a face of concern pronouncing that this is the result of some barbaric sexual ritual from a people who hold virginity as almost sacred earlier on in the films first truly shocking scene weve seen a native murder an adulterous woman by sexually mutilating her obviously this is supposed to be yet another example of the thrillseeking filmmakers callousness and exploitativeness but at the same time its unclear what moral attitude is being taken visavis the natives uncivilised practices true the girl may have been killed in this way because she has been raped by the filmmakers in the preceding scene although its unclear whether its the same girl and the tribes attitude to sexual impurity demands such a grisly response but that doesnt make the actual act of execution any easier to stomachand of course there are the scenes of animal cruelty we see a muskrat have its throat slit and hear its screams of agony is this supposed to be just a fact of life  look meateaters this is the suffering animals go through to get you your meat  or just another cheap trick monroe shows a little distaste but doesnt seem too concerned the disembowelling of the turtle is shocking you see its legs move even as its insides are being cut out an effect enhanced by the score but would it be appear any more palatable excuse the pun if it was done with care rather than lipsmacking relish at one point a tv executive tells monroe today people want sensationalism the more you rape their senses the happier they are of course she hasnt seen the actual footage yet i dont think anyone could come away from holocaust feeling happy although they might well feel that their sense have been raped by pushing things just that little bit further the film does succeed to some extent in exposing and challenging our attitudes towards extreme violence it is strange how we find something like holocaust shocking and deserving of censorship but have become immune to the horrors and deprivations we see daily on our news screens of course deodato is exploiting his violence just as his fictional filmmakers are and i suppose one could argue that the films value lies as much in the issues that he didnt intend to raise as the ones that he did,cruel
why was this film banned seen worse at the cinema most of these film with a bad reputations are rubbish just seen this film not as gory as cannibal ferox but a better film still not greatacting not up to much strange how people get upset by these films because thats all they are films with actors not many banned films are any goodmost of these films dont age well you see more gore at the cinema of today films like hostel and saw better acted and better films anything banned from the seventies or there abouts is usually rubbishthere are a few that that are still good today films like straw dogs the exorcist 2 films that caused problems both great films,cruel
contains lots of skin racks n racks of gore a group of missing filmmakers footage is discovered in the depths of a violent jungle and once its viewed reveals more about them than any of their colleagues would wish to know including their fate    this isnt so much a movie as its an ordeal theres nothing enjoyable about this movie and at times it flies right off the edge of moral repugnance the catalog of atrocities in this movie and the cold way theyre portrayed is more disturbing than any other before of since the movie is well made good direction writing photography and exceptional acting the atmosphere is gritty and imbues with a few moments of genuine terror where this movie slips up is that it never invests any emotion in the story even if its supposed to be a documentary the events should be arresting which is not the case here ultimately there isnt any reason to continue watching because there isnt a protagonist or a place for sympathy technically this may be the best movie ive ever seen but i confess that its hard to care about anything that actually happens in the movie 12 out of 4,cruel
okay i know there are already too many comments on this film but i havent read a review i fully agree with at least as far as ive readif youve heard anything about this film you should already know about how graphic and disturbing it can be it actually wasnt as bad as i expected but i think that depends on how much you let the film affect youas a film goes this is very impressive and should not be banned or cutmy problems with the film humans and animals are not the only ones who get bludgeoned you will be too by the message its trying to send there is no subtlety a factor that takes away from an otherwise highquality filmbesides that the actual message is taught by the director creating unlikely characters hes wanting to teach us that we are as barbaric as those savages we deride yet does so by creating farfetched scenarios sure its possible that these documentarians could have committed these heinous acts but its also a stretch in actual value this film falls short,cruel
this is one of the most intense movies i have ever seen right up there with tcm and definitely deserves its super sick reputation its graphic showing of well everything leads ch to be an extremely hard watchmost people will watch this for one reason the gore and sex well it definitely delivers in that department did you ever want to see a native abortion or cannibals raping and then eating a women then you are a sicko but its all in this movie one thing i must question is the real life animal deaths such as the three minute turtle slaughtering scene or the deaths of coatamundi snakes pigs or monkeys it was really unnecessary to do that but if you really dont like that type of thing there is an animal cruelty free dvd out there somewherethe plot is actually interesting for an exploitation movie and lends a great deal of added horror to the movie as it makes it seem for real also strange for an exploitation movie is just how well shot ch is the visuals are crisp and clear and the reels found in the amazon jungle are well shot to add every bit of realism that they can there isnt too much that can be said about the acting it wasnt over the top or fake lookingso why the reasonably low score considering how much i have been praising the movie mainly because i personally didnt enjoy the second half of the movie with the found footage but it is real easy to decide whether or not to see if you want to see all the gore and sex you can handle in what is probably one of the best exploitation films ever made watch it if you dont dont watch it simple as that,cruel
i just saw this flick and i still feel disgusted and uneasy as i write these lines one word gosh believe me im not one crying out often read never about scenes being frightening and disgusting nor do i rant at flicks exposing raw violence with a dose of blood and horror but friends this one really pulled me to the edge of things and then pushed me over the very cliff of realism i just wasnt prepared for this a classic horror flick was what i had pictured but this was just far beyond all thatsince its still disgusting me i have to admit that on the very point of realism this flick does the trick its a great shot for anyone who has an interest in classic horror movies but an advice is to view it on an empty stomach if you see where im getting at,cruel
having been aware that this was the most notorious of the video nasties i watched this with trepidation i was expected the usual low budget exploitation rubbish after the hoopla surrounding the release of last house on the left which i hated i was reluctant to be stung again i was wrong this is an intelligent film with a surprising plot twist yes it is gory and i realise that this is a heavily edited version but it was no worse than the hills have eyes sadly it has gained a bad reputation which is undeserved  man bites dog  is much much worse but is classed as art its filmed in black and white so it must be art if you have a chance to see it please do,cruel
a new york anthropologist travels to the jungles of south america with two local guides to find out what happened to a documentary film crew which disappeared nearly a year earlier after a long search and encountering a few primitive tribes they find the remains of the crew and several reels of their undeveloped film while in the us the anthropologist views the material on the filmsso this is the film that they did not want you to see after seeing it i can see why here is a film that has hundreds of people who love it and just as many who hate it mostly because of the violent content within the film its too raw and horrific for some but for others they love every minute of it myself im in that one percent whos indifferentthis is a grind house picture where its basically two stories into one movie the first half of the movie is the search party who goes into the jungle looking for the film crew the second half of the movie is the actual film footage from the documentary crew which portion of the film i liked more is hard to decide because what we see in the first half is shocking to us we have not seen this before its new and its brutal but happens in the second half of the movie is more brutal but not as shocking because you are expecting the uncomfortably of the film to grow and it doesthis movie influenced the likes of films like the blair witch project here is a movie that goes down in history as one of the most shocking movies of all time does it deserve that title well lets see during the 90 some odd minutes of the film be ready for 3 different rape scenes fullfrontal nudity both male and female decapitations reallife animal killings guts ripping people burning torture the most disturbing abortion scenes ever limbs being chopped off people getting impaled bodies being hacked to bits and guts being ripped out and what makes it worse is that its not that kind of deadalive tongue in cheek gore its so realistic and disturbingthe music is beautiful the theme song that plays throughout it amazing and a high point in this film dont pick it up for acting or dialougebut then again i wouldnt imagine someone doing that this is a horror movie for those disturbed horror fans those who want to see this movie to see what all the talk is about brace yourself youre in for some pretty horrific stuff im not going to go into the whole political aspect of animal killings but those were some of the hardest scenes to watch in this filmpeople are put off by the violence so they fail to see what its about how we today are more curious about whats bad in the world then what is good how the journalist focus more on violent issues was it overdone but then again maybe it was just the right amount it also shows how we as a culture are insensitive and ignorant to others even if it is a cannibal tribei did dig this film for its unique style that did come out before bwp faze i love all kinds of horror movies and this is one not to miss of course if you can handle this type of stuff the dvd is limited to about 10000 copies so if you want a copy pick it up fast oh and did i forget to mention that during its release it was banned in almost 60 countries,cruel
id heard a lot about this film and being a big horror fan i was itching to see it i rented it out settled back and let myself in for the most gruesome horror film i have ever witnessed to begin with i found it quite slow and within the first hour was beginning to feel myself getting bored whens the horror going to start i thought to myself i stayed with it though and was glad i did i think the film contains the most gruesome scenes i think ever featured in a horror film even though the main characters the film makers are portrayed in a very bad light and it is very hard to sympathise with them i think you would have to be a monster not to feel for them with the torture they face to watch a man having his testicles removed before being quite literally ripped apart is not a pretty sight at times i nearly had to look away from the screen as i just could not stand the relentless horror of the situation anymore i felt sick for ages afterwards and it really played on my mind because that sort of thing can and has happened beforethe film seemed to try and justify itself by having a moral thread running through it the film makers blatant disregard for the cannibals and the rape and torture they put them through is hard to stomach the film seems to be asking us to consider who the real monsters are the cannibals or the film makers and i would have to say its a bit of both im unsure however if the makers of the film simply put this in to cover up for the fact that they were making a horrible film which would sicken anyone who saw it they were trying to say hey this isnt just mindless violence you know we actually have something to say overall i wouldnt go so far as to say i actually liked the film but it did have its good points it has its audience and will always be renowned for its subject matter,cruel
first off i would have preferred that the actors in the movie actually have eaten the meat from the animals that they killed past that this movie was pretty shocking but not the worst i have seen i would reccomend that if you can find this movie for about 10 including shipping you should get it i have the unedited version and it is really messed up to say the least i think that the script for this movie had a point to it but lost that point in the interpretation to film if you are someone who likes to watch shocking movies then this one is for you let me say that even with the violence this movie was less shocking to me than requiem for a dream,cruel
another great inhuman cannibal film from the great ruggero deodato he was imprisoned after making this movie this film is ultraviolent and very realistic it also contains weird and eerie music after watching it the horrible content of this film can remain in your memories for a very long time for those who are distressed to see such inhumanity do not watch this film,cruel
i have to say first off that i am not particularly a horror fan however i also have to say that this is a much better film than i expected it to be  and in fact i would go so far as to say that this is a good film full stop it looks datedit was made in 1979 so it should do  but not in its use of special effects which remain good even by present day standards  see example later  the story was well told and kept the viewer with it all the way it kept a good pace and the acting all by unknown actors and actresses  atleast in the ukwas very good if this didnt influence blair witch  which is what the producers of blair witch claim  then this is without doubt a precursor to it i watched this twice the second time much more carefully  i have three main  comments  firstly francesca ciardi who plays the female lead was excellent  how on earth did she not become more well known  secondly how did they manage to produce such excellent performances from the tribe indians both individually and as a whole  there were times you forgot that this was a film and not a documentary the final point is regarding the spec effects  overall very very good considering both the budget and era  one particular effect has stuck with me over the last day or so and has witheld closer examination  how did they skewer the indian girl on the stake   that looks almost too realistic at both first glance and on a frame by frame basis if you are a film enthusiast and havent seen this film then you are missing out get it sorted,cruel
i cant say i disliked this movie however it lacked tempo and you didnt really got any scary stuff it was mostly gross and a lot of violence i enjoyed some parts of it especially when they are viewing the documentary filmings which was retrieved by the professor what really annoyed me though was that the blair witch project was considered to be sort of a genr chaning film when it was obvious that the directors had got their idea from this filmif you like blood and really mean humans watch this film,cruel
a movie which disturbs and sickens is thankfully rare but here is a film which does bothis the story of three documeantry film makers which get lost in the amazon jungle later there film footage is the only thing left and is found by a team in search for them sounds like blair witchthe film contains genuinne animal killings which are extremely graphic performed just for the camars this is what disturbs most about the film although without this unnesary killing would now be forgotten it is there simply for shock value and to give the movie a much more real tone this is the reason i believe people 20 years ago thought the actors were also killed of course untrue although there is a scene which a native girl is seen impaled on a pole which looks pretty real it was done with a bicycle seat  and a couple of poles very simple but the effect looks realspecial mention however goes to ritz ortolonis haunting score which belongs in a much better movie he also did the score for house at the edge of the park also for deodato so to sum up it is a movie which disturbs for all the wrong reasons not a bad flick just unnesary 510,cruel
i consider myself a true horror collector seeing as how i have of some 300 horror movies some rare others not i was looking around for something new something i had never seen and heard about well after doing some research on the web and of course checking out the reviews herei got my hopes up high thinking to myself cool a movie that was banned and is said to be this horrid violent movie i found it on ebay for a reasonable price and bought it welli have somethings to say about this film first i fail to really see why is was banned to begin withi mean compared to movies like cannibal ferox or bad taste this movie really wasnt as evil or for that matter as bad as most said it was you already know the story line as you may have red in others reviews so i wont waste your time with a storyline there were a few parts in the movie that were somewhat gpry but nothing i havent seen in others movies i give this movie 6 out 10 stars because in all fairness it wasnt a bad movie just overhyped i acuatally think cannibal ferox aka make them die slowly was more disturbing and violent then this,cruel
this movie grabbed my attention much the way it grabbed many others i was lured in with promises of extreme gore violence and other shocking images i read all the warnings and with careful consideration decided to be brave and veiw it ok this was some nasty stuff here definately one you need to work your way up to but the actual shock value was less than i expected thats not to say i didnt enjoy it because quite frankly i did i sat through the whole thing twice actually taking it all in sure there are some brutal scenes involving animals that of course were real i was not that repulsed though animals die everyday but people only seem to object to it when they actually have to see it i myself am a vegetarian so why am i not outraged for one the animals died quickly and second after that its only meat to me its dead what bothered me most about this film was the eerie melancholy music that accompanies these atrocious scenes the acting was superb and this is by no means a b movie this was well thought out executed and presented material i do not recommend this movie to most people though it simply is a little too much to watch but for those who think they can manage and stomach well have at it youll never forget it,cruel
this name alone strikes many disgusting thoughts into most peoples heads and it should the movie itself is repulsive vile and totally uncalled forthough there is a message within the movie a very important one too it is the message of media involvement in current events how much does the camera affect what we see it is only a lens that captures what it sees though it is the evil hand of humanity that controls the device,cruel
ok this is the 3rd cannibal flick ive seen i gave it a 6 mind you it would have received more except for the animal cruelty throughout  i found myself fast forwarding through each killing what is it with the italian directors eaten alive and slave of the cannibal god are just as bad ok so how was it as a movie great maybe i am too desensitised to be affected nowdays which is a little worrying by the gore one thing though  that woman impaled sure looks realistic if you are reading these comments you have probably already seen it or are curious to see it if you havent yet  just make sure you are in an ok state of mind keep your finger poised on the fast forward and settle back for a pretty strange ride,cruel
a small group of filmmakers vanish in the wilderness while in the midst of making a documentary and the only evidence of what happened to them is seen through their recovered film footage sound familiar the blair witch project may have been a welldeserving smash hit but what few people failed to realize was that its socalled revolutionary story device of terrorthroughrecoveredfilmfootage had been utilized twenty years before in a notorious italian cannibal film directed by ruggero deodato is arguably the king of its subgenre and may well be the most disturbing film ever made while blair witch left such an unsettling effect by showing nothing holocaust does so by showing everything there is no act of depravity that it is not displayed at some point in this film however direct comparison to the blair witch project is unfair as these are both drastically different films holocaust actually contains a sizable back story about the search for the film crew with the actual recovered footage taking up less than half the running time deodato uses this story as a catalyst for a commentary on the medias manipulation of the truth for the purposes of sensationalism and while some would argue that the final result is nothing but pure exploitation theres no denying the films powerformer porn star robert kerman plays the films protagonist professor monroe who leads the expedition to recover the missing footage and is actually quite good in the role his performance is vital to providing at least some comfort within the audience since the character provides the sole voice of reason in the film when ratingshungry tv producers try to use the footage as the basis for a prime time special he declares that it would be inhumane since the actions that the film crew have pulled to get that footage are nothing short of heinous indeed when all the footage is finally shown the foursome does nothing to inspire any sympathy for what has happened to them when the natives prove to be less interesting than they had hoped for their documentary the crew decides to destroy their village and burn some of them alive in hopes of inspiring a war with a rival tribe which in turn would provide them with some much better footage eventually they go too far and the natives end up resorting to cannibalism only as a response to the barbaric actions of the white man professor monroe sums it all up at the end when he states i wonder who the real cannibals are one of the main criticisms of the blair witch project was that it seemed very unlikely that the characters would still keep the camera rolling in the midst of their terrifying plight in holocaust the film crew is so obsessed with gaining fame and notoriety that we can believe it when they stand by in the background and film their friends being raped and butchered they may not make it out of the jungle alive but at least theyll leave some very memorable footage behindwith all this talk about the story i have yet to even get into what the film is long remembered for and thats the extreme violence and gore and they are indeed quite shocking and horrifying granted the recovered footage gimmick provides the filmmakers with the opportunity for some shaky camera work and an excuse to cover up the fact that many of their effects may not be technically proficient yet the viewer is still provided with plenty of moments that are sure to make one squirm such as rape with a sharp rock a foetus being prematurely ripped from a native womans womb and buried in mud amputation and dismemberment and the only direct oncamera castration that i can ever recall seeing the most controversial element of the movie however is undoubtedly its abundant amount of violence to animals  which is 100  unfaked while the early scenes of humans butchering live animals provide a very interesting parallel to the climactic footage of the cannibals butchering the humans the fact that deodato actually murdered some real wildlife in order to get this footage cannot be justified however despite holocausts rather exploitive elements one cannot overlook how truly effective the final result is the films direction and storytelling are simply topnotch and ive never seen a movie convey the tension and uneasy atmosphere of the jungle better than this one holocaust is also blessed with a truly haunting and memorable musical score which will stay with you long after the film is over while i wouldnt urge casual viewers to run out and find a copy of this nearmasterpiece id highly recommend it to all horror and exploitation fans to see it as this film will surely test their limits like never before if nothing else it makes me relieved that the camera got turned off before we could see what the blair witch did to those kids,cruel
the amazon to shoot a documentary they were never seen againa few months later their footage was foundsounds familiar you bet since i already made my point in the blair witch comment section and noticed in the meantime that someone else did too  salut pierrebenoit i will focus on why this is a much better effort to produce fakedocumentary material first of all the camerawork in the 2nd half is exceptionally well done it just really feels like a documentary in the late seventies when i was still living in paris france not texas i remember reading a huge article written by a female newspaper columnist who was trying to figure out if the socalled documentary footage was real or not  the distributor advertised the material as real and got away with it for quite a while  no www chat rooms back then to tell people about the movie beforehand  so this journalist went to see the movie over and over again in one day the cashier reportedly looked at her as if she was insane until she found proof it was fake tough girl but the point is she had to look really hard in ch the crew shoots a lot of themselves walking through the jungle  a fact that i criticized about blair witch  but this is the jungle not some boring maryland woods theres a terra incognita feel about it well for us industrialized people therefore it works why do you think josh heather and mike keep shooting all the time even if there is really nothing exciting to look at in burkittsville eh because they know they are gonna disappear and the directors toldem they need a certain amount of footage to get their movie done  thats whyoh while i mention directors  i always thought and i still do that ruggero deodato was really a boring untalented director  i just wonder how he managed to put such a convincing movie together well the 2nd half  the first is closer to his usual stuff but still not as badon a closing note i would like to mention how much i hate the animal snuff footage in ch i never understood why its in there  because the movie just doesnt need it  it would have worked just as well and better for me if deodato had not included it the fact that he did just confirms my original opinion and deodatos lack of self confidence  this guy is a moron who had an unexpected stroke of genius for a short period of timethats it arrividerci,cruel
i had heard so much about this film before seeing it  having read countless reviews and raves about ruggero deadatos film in fangoria and gorezone i was very anxious to see it for myself  i must admit that i was disappointed  while the film is shocking and sickening it does not use this as part of the storyline  it instead used its gore and sickness as mere tools for exploitation  the story itself is a great ideait really has promise for some great horror and shock value  but what happened was the director chose to disgust rather than terrify the audience  while there are some truly gruesome moments in the film nothing really shocked me upon seeeing it  had deadato chosen better actors and a better way to take the story then he would have made a great film  instead the fillmmakers in get no pity or remorse from the audiencethey deserve what they get from the cannibal tribeand then some not all is bad however  as i mentioned the story is basically goodjust not taken in the right direction  this film reveals the need of this culture for exploitation and sensationalism ie jerry springer and all those reallife video shows in the media  this fillmmaers in ch are merely giving the public what it wants  on a another level it also reveals the results of outside cilvilization and its disasterous effects on the uncivilized world of the cannibal tribe  like the anthropologist says at the end  i wonder who the real cannibals arenot for the squeamish  but if youre looking for good italian exploitation and gore with a bit of a story linethen watch personnaly id rather stay with dario argentos body of work,cruel
the premise simple the dialogue simple the music scores simple the aftermath wonderful  this is a movie that like it or not sticks with you this is why i love this film it is so rare that you actually watch a film and are actually inclined to talk about it  this is a movie that i had to share with friends just because i could not get it out of my head  albeit they look at me rather strangely now i love a movie that stays with you  i still can see vividly the scenes of the animal massacres rape lovemaking on the ashes of the newly cooked tribespeople etc  do yourself a great favor and buy this video,cruel
with all the hubbub surrounding the blair witchlast broadcast controversy was the former influenced by the latter i decided to track down the film that both were influenced byit was not what i was expecting the degree of cannibalism is not what the title would lead you to believe nor are the atrocities that have gotten the film banned in several countries even committed by the cannibals  but to say more than that would give away the main surprise of the film it starts out innocuous enough with a wellintentioned college professor trying to find out what happened to four ambitious documentary filmmakers in the depths of the amazon the film has a very national geographic look to it  to a point there is even a nice scene where the professor manages to reach the yamamama cannibals the tree people by recording the shamans voice  they felt that if he could capture their voices he could capture their spirits as wellif you have a strong stomach i recommend this film if only for the ingenuity behind the story not necessarily all the details in the film you can even get a laser disc copy that has an interview with the director ruggero deodato  he has some interesting comments as a footnote italian director producer writer and dop lamberto bava was an assistant director and the professor in a surprisingly good performance is former porn star r bolla billed as robert kerman,cruel
i read the reviews for this movie before watching it i kept saying to myself this movie is sick why are you watching it  those horrible disgusting scenes were making my stomach churn but i couldnt stop the movie i wanted to see how bad can it get after this  and the thing is it kept getting worse and worse heheheh brilliant work poor monkey poor tortoiseturtle  poor cannibals poor reporters but a mustsee movie for anyone who can stomach blood and gore,cruel
this sure is the sickest and most brutal movie ever made in the history of videos if you wanna see the most brutal movie made see this it shocked the he outta me violence5010 nudity510 profanity310,cruel
this film is really something else i would recommend only those with a strong stomach watch it though the acting is not up to much but it is still a must see for all horrorgore fans the animal mutilations are a little unnecessary and do not add much to the film overall but it is the rest of the special effects and some truly sickening scenes which make one of the most disturbing films ever made the fact that deodato was taken to court in his native italy to prove that he had not killed his actors is a testament to what you can do with a limited filming budget,cruel
i saw the sistermovie cannibal ferox about half a year ago and its brutal violence and almost nonexisting acting except for the indians in the jungle shocked me reflecting on it though when i had calmed down enough to be able to think about the film in any kind of objective perspective which took a while i became interested to see what one could get out of such a film when i heard from a friend of mine that was supposed to include better acting than ferox i decided it might be worth a look this time i was prepared for anything though and i must say i found it surprisingly goodthe first half of the film is in kind of slow pace we follow a search team in the jungle following the trace of a dissappeared film crew as they come deeper into the jungle they finally find the rotten corpses or whats left of them of the film crew they also find the films of they shot before ending up in the hands of the cannibals with this the rescue team heads home to new york and the second half of the movie is a tale told from those films as they are reviewedas i said up untill now we have yet to see any real disturbing scene at all but what the footage shows is a tale of violence on the films you see how brutal the film crew acted towards the inhabitans in the jungle before they were eatenthe movie ends with a thought on who the real cannibals are which brings me to an essential aspect of the movie this movie is despite all senseless violence not without a point i see it as a lame attempt to show in a strange way that those film people really didnt deserve anything better than what they got the real cannibals are the white man who have been acting cruel to the original inhabitants in all timesthere were a few scenes that i would rather not have seen however the killing of animals in a movie for example should not be allowed this film like many other like it uses real animals whos killed for the screen in a most brutal way another scene that touched me deeply was a rape scene when two white men raped a very young indian girlthough i have a lot against this film i do recommend anyone who have the stomach to stand this kind of violence to see it the acting is quite good though the acting in the new york city scenes are not as good the music fits in well with the plot and generally without the disturbing scenes this would have been a very good filmi rate it a 510,cruel
i saw this film as a midnight movie it was shown entirely uncut and all i can say is that the censored version must be about ten minutes longhowever it was an interesting film i did not expect a brain or a heart with a title like the plot is kind of a mix between the blair witch project and the emerald forest it works very well as an allegory on how civilized man rapes the land and destroys all of its resources the film also deals with the who is more civilized concept this is done a bit heavyhandedly but i think that the director was probably more comfortable dealing with socalled lowbrow audiences so this is forgettable he doesnt exactly have a flair for subtlety as it is anyway the performances were surprisingly good there are numerous scenes in which the actors are extremely natural when they dont have dialogue to deliver they actors can be quite extraordinary there are a quite a few real animal killings in this film that are quite disturbing granted this is how my food gets to my table but it can be a bit extreme if unnecessary the rest of the violence is actually quite impressive especially considering when it was made and the budget constraints im sure a film like this had the gore is still disturbing of course in the end the viewer is left to make their own judgement on what they have seen the filmmaker makes no attempt to soften the blow,cruel
watching this clumsy hamhanded attempt at moviemaking was a vile and regrettable experience anyone who claims a shred of cinematic merit for this bucket of swill needs his or her head quite thoroughly examined every reel every cell of this firm should be incinerated  an irony considering a comment made during one scene the making of this movie affirms every base and cruel value which the film attempts to portray watching it has made me complicit in something truly disgusting the only good thing about watching this abomination is that i downloaded it illegally paying for it would have been money better spent on a diuretic i feel like i need a shower to be cleansed of this film plus forgiveness for having ever let it touch my retinas wiring these comments may assuage the guilt,cruel
i remember watching when i was a kid 14 yrs old and being shocked by the violence when youre a teenager its easy to think something as bizarre and brutal as this has an underlying message to it 16 years later i find that it bears no message its just a bunch of poorly done shots complemented by the unnecessary killing of animals thats about it i am a big horror and gore lover braindead day of the dead reanimator the original texas chain saw massacre and i easily fall in love with depressing and disturbing flicks irreversible dancer in the dark funny games the score which is always applauded on reviews ive seen is lame and mediocre and the violent scenes are done so poorly you cant help but laugh at them animal deaths have no dramatic point whatsoever this is not apocalypse now and it is no oldboy when you see oldboys octopus sequence theres a true dramatic impact to the death of the octopus this one is totally stupid pointless and has no true impact on you other than feeling sorry for those creatures the acting is horrible and cartoonish how can you feel disturbed by something this amateurish thats beyond me the one that goes all the way hahaha guys if you can take r budd dwyers oncamera suicide then you can take any gory film regards,cruel
one other person on here thought the same as me small animal in agony makes you feel so cheap for looking at this awful filmbelieve it or not the death of the turtle that is seen in this is not worth the entertainment it has give others with at best the poor judgment to give it 2 hours of there valuable timedont look you will feel saddened by the end of it and feel ashamed you didthe death of those small lives will haunt youif you want to see horror watch real movies that are made to entertainr,cruel
i am a huge movie fan and i like to watch many different kinds of movieshowever when i got my hands on this movie i was dubious if i really wanted to see it hearing lots of nasty things about iti start it up and the first 5 minutes or so seems ok but then the movie starts getting so nasty that i cant almost watch it anymore i go on tho but after a scene where they kill a small monkey alive and believe me this is no fake i start to skip thru the movie when i have skipped thru the movie i dont regret i did not watch it completelythis movie is so horribly that the only good thing about it when you have watched it you never want to watch such movies again and in the next two weeks i simply had to watch comedies because the chock i got from watching it hurt me really bad and i needed a solid dose of humour to regain my composurewhat i sat left with after watching this movie is what kind of people can actually make such a movie and if you find any part of this movie entertaining i would strongly advice you to visit a shrink because no one in their right mind would find this movie amusing at allkeep distance from this one i am serious this movie might have stirred your curiosity and you might find it highly interesting from all the people who says to keep distance from it but i mean it i wanted to see it for the same reason but now i regret it,cruel
now considering myself a serious film buff i make it a point to not limit myself from any genre of filmmaking also being that im an aspiring film maker i tend to push the envelope as far as i can contentwise and im always fascinated to see how far other directors have gone in their films of course this cannibal film had me interested not only because of its notorious publicity as a serious gorehound movie and as the most violent movie ever made but also because it was supposed to have an engrossing morality story to it so i rented it and while i realized the influence it had on the overrated yet effective film the blair witch project that was the only noteworthy aspect of it the real animal killings as mentioned by many here were completely unnecessary and only served to disgust the viewer now i have an ultra strong stomach so i wasnt shocked by it just angry that a filmmaker would stoop so low as to purposely kill a form of life just to hammer home the point that advanced society can produce people who are no more moral and civilized than the cannibal tribe we are introduced to in the story  there are ways to do things  the animal scenes just brought about a doublestandard and a sign of hypocrisy from the filmmaker  of course i would have had no problems if those scenes were staged and if deodato actually delivered on other gore scenes concerning cannibalism and human killings obviously those would have to be fake as well  however the film wasnt nearly as gory as others made it out to be as a lot of violent acts occured offscreen  it was mostly sleazy especially with all the nudity the rape scene by the male reporters was realistically disturbing but not convincing in its motivation worst of all though its moral message was delivered unintelligently and i wasnt compelled by the story at all it didnt help matters that the acting was atrocious and that the dubbing was awful the cinematography was simplistic although that was the intention to capture the feeling of a documentary what i got was a trashy brutally awful film to sit through without any redeeming or thoughtprovoking story behind it sure ive seen plenty of graphic movies that actually entertained me but that wasnt the intention for this film  i wasnt expecting to be entertained by the movie but i was expecting its socalled important message to be convincingly portrayed still i recommend people to watchespecially film students  maybe theyll get something out of it definitely not enjoyment,cruel
i heard about this movie through a friend and a few of us rented it a couple of weeks ago  the only reason we got it was because of the excessive gore it supposedly contains and the fact that it was the film the blair witch project is based on  i hated it  not only was it not very graphic i think i saw an edited down version but it was really boring for the first 45 minutes or so and even when the gory footage was shown i was still bored it was obviously fake as the camera got really shaky every time something graphic occurred so you cant tell whats happening  the characters were completely dislikeable and deserved what they got  the only parts that were hard to watch were the scenes of real animal torture and killing  dont listen to what you hear about this movie  its not worth it  210,cruel
one of those bad video nasties appears its ugly head is a completely dated film  horror films can be cleverly made on a low budget just check out texas chainsaw but ch is a poor film in many ways the horror is placed rather sickly in front of you more disgusting rather than fright and the few scenes that use this are more like a comedy with bloodquite laughable the acting is not very good the main actor is from such films as debbie does dallas iii so theres your pedigree and the script could of worked if the actors didnt look so serious about it allthe editing although quite good in the footage viewing room sceneis half baked  the director at time looks like he wanted to make a wildlife film rather than a full on horror flick opening shots every time we see a cannibal then a monkeythen cannibalmonkeyohh a tiger must film thatoh pleasewhy is there a one theme uptempo soundtrack that pops up when a death scene is taking place why is there unjustified nude scenes that make the actors look so unconvincing and unerotic i laughed out loudin closing holocaust is a bad piece of filmakinga film that harks back to the early 80s horror genre but were they ever this bad,cruel
anybody who liked ch must be really sick when you enjoy looking at animals being tortured for realand women being raped without any motivation for the story its not horror movies that you want to seehorror movies should stimulate your imagination scare you or give you a chock with gore so that you admire the special fx ch only scares me because there are people in this world that like this movie  i bought the video when i didnt know what it was went back with it the next day and made a small riot at the store when i loudly told them what it was about for all the costumers to hear i got my money back and two costumers left the store with me,cruel
what in the hell was the writerdirector thinking how did filth like this ever get produced why do people watch sick garbage like this its nothing more than foul putrid filth i swear the guy who made this film should have been put away a long time ago im sorry i ever watched it i enjoy a violent horror movie as much as anyone else but this just goes too far by a long way if you want to watch it be my guest each to his own eh but there are some things that just take violence and gore way too far and this is one and to top it all off theres a right way to show some things and a wrong way and by this i refer to freaking rape scenes in my mind there is nothing sicker than rape if you include that sort of things in a movie take a page out of clockwork oranges book that is the right way to use such a theme dont glorify it dont try and pass it off as porn dont show it grapically what sane person wants to see that and dont try and make it funny somehow its just not and never will be this film should be destroyed like the filthy sickfest it is,cruel
this is one of the most vile and disgusting films ive ever seen geek show violence coupled with an infuriatingly half baked sense of self righteousness the film lingers on acts of violence and cruelty and then has the nerve to step back and try to tack on morals and social commentary so not only is the film reprehensible it is also extremely hypocritical a truly thought provoking film could have been made with similarly taboo subject matter apocalypse now and aguire the wrath of god spring to mind both of those films featured shocking acts of violence and real animal killings but they had a purpose other than simply shocking the viewer they had moments of true beauty and introspection great acting and cinematography and they didnt exploit their subject matter and then add some phony morals to make it all okay,cruel
this movie is awful the acting is awful the story line is awful it is not scary it just really gross i like a lot gross horror movie i like the texas chainsaw massacre 1974 and i think this is feat to gross do not see it i do not know why this got 6 i give it a 2 i like to be scared to do not like to be grossed out there most be people who like being grossed out the texas chain saw massacre was violent but it the original the texas chain saw massacre was scary this not scary if you want to see something scary see the green inferno,cruel
so i watched that title last night  my third viewing over 20odd years and the first i even half enjoyed the revelatory restoration currently available on region a bluray courtesy of grindhouse releasing has a lot to do with that especially when measured against the dubiously sourced pannscan vhs that introduced me to this infamous sleaze epic way back when where i once saw only a turgid and poorlyframed mass of washedout browns and yellows i now fully understand why so many praise for its visual qualities sergio doffizis lush yet gritty cinematography gives ruggero deodatos film a sweat soaked junglevibrant eye candy appeal that i was never before able to properly appreciateand the gore is spectacular lets get that out of the way right up front as its undoubtedly a huge part of this films lasting cult appeal even with thirtysome years of horror fandom beneath my belt the unforgettable and muchreproduced image of the impaled native woman remains one of the most astonishing practical effects shots ive ever seen its as brilliantly simple as it is brutally effective that said ill probably never become comfortable with the films ghoulish displays of reallife animal abuse while even its most upsetting moments do have thematic relevance in context id have been far happier to go through life without ever having seen a living monkeys tiny face chopped off in moments such as this grindhouses otherwise glorious highdefinition restoration is no blessing at allis often celebrated for its social criticism with all due respect to the films many erudite admirers i personally feel that its too obvious and hypocritical to make a truly meaningful statement while deodato clearly condemns the ignorance and exploitative cruelty of the civilized interlopers who view brazilian rainforest tribespeople and their customs as savage he milks a shockingly ignorant flatly racist cartoon of the latters culture for cheap shock value and though he seems to implicate his audiences bloodlust in the carnage we witness on screen he uses this potentially intriguing critical vantage primarily as an excuse to wallow in lurid atrocity much like paul verhoeven in robocop and starship trooppers despite all that im not inclined to condemn the film or its makers racism aside theres nothing so terribly wrong with the sort of cinematic hypocrisy on display and though s ethical incoherence sabotages its claim to moral authority it fuels the feral leering intensity of a true exploitation classicamid the carnage its interesting to note the seldommentioned inclusion of appparently real human execution footage in an early context  characterestablishing flashback sequence this documentarystyled section of the film seems to comment if indirectly on jacopetti and prosperis africa addio and the ensuing murder trial perhaps one could describe as a what if exercise imagining a documentary crew even more monstrously cynical than jacopetti  prosperi were alleged to have been by overzealous italian prosecutors with that in mind theres a certain bitter irony in the fact that deodato and his crew were themselves brought up on and ultimately cleared of murder charges following the release of their film plus ca changewhat else wonderful music i desperately want a copy of riz ortolanis perversely beguiling score on vinyl and im glad to have finally understood  and to some extent appreciated  a celebratedreviled horror masterpiece that long eluded me,cruel
is this film really shocking it shows a lot of stuff never before transplanted to screen but without analysis that can be more suitably categorised as groundbreaking for the most part my sensibilities remained unshaken is it shocking and am i just a sociopath my rejection of the films capacity to shock centers on a few psychological tenets not when the makers themselves seemed uncomfortable enough that they kept cutting away to bystanderviewer shots every time the squeamish factor was building no when pasolini showed audiences atrocity he trained the camera on it long enough for it to be really implanted in your mind so you eventually found yourself just hoping it would end from my perspective anyway  the gore scenes in this movie can rightfully be called gruesome but most of them were over in secondsbesides when i see a film with cannibal in its name i dont go in expecting superior standards of deportment the title kind of clues a prospective viewer in these people are uncivilised so of course theyre going to be barbaric  its a fundamental component of their nature it has nothing to do with power or the intentional degradation of their fellow speciesif some people turn savage after being exposed to savage conditions that can at least be rationalised by desensitisation mans inhumanity to man in order to consolidate a position of control is a concept that i find far more disturbing and disgusting but thats just me,cruel
when i heard that a movie made in 1980 called was one of the most controversial films ever made it peeked my interest and i decided to check it out after watching the movie i was disgusted and wondered how they were able to pull off such realistic violence for its time scenes like an impalement and animals getting tortured and murdered appeared very real and while i learned how the impalement was done by sitting on a bicycle seat i was disturbed to find out the animal slaughters were not fake they were indeed real why because the director could thats whywell just because you can doesnt mean you should were all capable of doing horrible things but should we no because we know its wrongit was just as easy to fake an animals death as it was to fake everything else in the film but it was shot deep in the amazon where there were no laws against animal torture and killings so director ruggero deodato had several animals murdered for his own sick pleasurethe sad thing is people try to defend this film and say its message is about the medias love of violence for ratings either the director is a huge hypocrite condemning violence in the media while killing animals for the purpose of a film or viewers are missing the real message in this movie deodato wanted to unleash his vile fantasies in a movie and try to pass it off as meaningfuldeodato was trying to make us all sick and in that way he has succeeded so instead of a 1 i vote it a 2 but anybody who claims this is a meaningful movie has been manipulated by a disturbed hypocrite,cruel
has to be one of the most overrated films i have ever seen in my lifetime not only is it not shockingits completely boringi was not offended what was happening on the screennor was i repulsed what so ever ruggero tries so hard to disturb usthat is starts to become obvious that hes trying to do it the so called graphic gore is completely overratednot only have i seen many more shocking horror films then thisi often busted out into laughter during many of the scenes i detest animal violencebut even that is overhyped with only the turtle death making any real impact the characters completely deserved their fatei was just begging for them to get there demiseand i got what i wantednot only that the acting is atrociouswith not one believable actor in the filmbeing the big horror fan i am all my life ive had people telling me to seek out this moviewell i finally did online in all its uncut glory and it gave me 96 minutes of my life i will never get back i am not trying to garner attention i am simply stating that this movie is nothing more then an excusean attempt to shock us i am sure plenty of people will be repulsed by this filmbut i wasntruggero deserves all of his criticism for this filmhis sick perverted mind has created a film that has been overhyped for way too many years nowto make a long story short boring animal killingsexcept for oneoverhyped goredegrading characters who deserved what happened to thema laughable mockumentary type styleand you have this boring suckerbottom line im not even gonna go over the performances there not worth my timenor is wasting all my energy in my hands while typing up a review for this film is a whale of a disappointmentmaybe i didnt get itmaybe others will find it fascinating like so many others claimbut you know whatgood for themcause that means they can go through the torture and not me310,cruel
1980  12 out of 4 ruggero deodatos notorious italian shocker about four filmmakers who go missing after going to do a documentary on cannibals months later their footage is found and we get to see what happened yep the blair witch project ripped this sucker off but i still think that film is better this film here is still banned all around the world and rightfully so probably peta members are still wanting to kill the director again rightfully so probably technically speaking i think this film is pretty damn good especially the terrific cinematography and the wonderful mixture of using 35mm for the city footage and 16mm for the jungle footage the music score is one of the greatest from any euro horror film and the director certainly gets across the feel that youre actually watching all of this stuff take place the problem is that the real animal violence takes away anything the film has going for it ive seen real animal deaths in countless other films but the way the director rubs the footage in your face is imo the reason this film is still so controversial while others like it dont draw too much heat i also dont buy the message the director tries to put across because its rather impossible to believe that the filmmakers would actually do what we see them doing in their footage again i think this is a very important film which is thankfully no longer being made and i can respect the technical side of this thing but in the end i still find the director to be a scumbag who deserves all the heat hes gotten over the past 25 years,cruel
the plot  supposed morality of this film are as schizophrenic obnoxious  unintelligent as its pitiful soundtrack which is in itself an atrocity beginning with some actually decent but rather dull guitar muzak it then randomly shifts from orchestra to various other instrumentations none of these permutations seem related to each other or whats going on on screen the exception being what i call the gore theme which chimes in to let everyone know when something is about to be disemboweledthe genius of this film is supposed to be its realism yet it is not realistic in any meaningful sense the only thing that seems realistic is the depiction of violence which with the animals is real if something is real how can if be credited with realism the violent scenes involving humans dont look real at all people get shot and just fall over there isnt even blood in one scene a woman is being cut from her throat to her pelvis  it looks like all they did was rub paint on her besides the animal killings the only aspect of the film that seriously establishes any realism is that it is actually filmed in the jungle which again begs my earlier question since when do directors get called clever because they shoot on location its as if the animal killings are thrown in to shock people into not questioning the laziness or absurdity of the films other elementsthe supposed message of the film makes even less sense if the director is so passionate about showing the viciousness of modern western society then why didnt he do any research the film makes no attempt at fact checking whatsoever and will immediately be seen as a complete distortion by anybody with even a sesame street understanding of anthropology again where is the realism when the film ended i watched the interview with the director hoping to hear some sort of elucidation of the films thin attempt at social commentary but all he talked about was minutia like how much money it made how much was spent on it  where the actors are now he seemed like a blockheadaltogether the film comes across as a shameless cynical  jaded play on peoples knee jerk reactions to reap the profits of controversy,cruel
contains some spoilersitalian exploitation king ruggero deodatos genre classic holds its own against defining horror pictures such as haloween last house on the left and night of the living dead while these three films conceptualised the slasher rape and revenge and zombie picture respectively did something different  it created a trend of horrific violence in order to terrify audiences and in this respect deodatos audacious picture succeeds wholeheartedly the films surprisingly intelligent plot is quite simple  an anthropology professor harold monroeplayed with conviction by porn star robert kerman goes on a trip to the green inferno  a jungle holocaust in the midst of the roughest amazonian terrain inhabited by warring tribes of cannibals with his guide monroe sets out to investigate the fate of a group of documentarians jack faye mark and their leader yates filming footage of such tribes in their questthey encounter a number of atrocities most of which are committed by the yamamomos rival tribe the yacumo one such set piece that remains one of the films most enduring images of extreme violence is a ritualistic punishment of an adultress this is one of s most violent and disturbing scenes when monroe and his team reach the yamomomos they are given yates teams footage monroe returns to the nyu with the footage and screens it the documentary is truly vile  yates team are shown killing animals real footage subject that laid the film in solid disrepute the most controversial being the turtle scene raping tribal women and committing a mass homicide of yamomomo tribespeople finally the yates team receive their just desserts from the natives they tormentedis an undeniably powerful film with some solid performances and great direction the score is also a highlight with riz ortolani utilising some of the skills that had nominated him for an oscar over a decade before is undeniably intense in its violence however none of it is gratuitous  it perfectly encapsulates the atmosphere of helplessness that deodato succeeds in conveying the fact that the film is titled arguably leads to its ultimate downfall gorehounds wanting deodatos classic slice of exploitation to live up to its title will be disappointed  cannibal action only really appears in the last fifteen minutes likewise those wanting an intelligent film will overlook because of its title overall is a solid film that has lost little of its power in some twentysix years,cruel
a masterpiece on its own probably the most infamous horror movie of the past 30 years every horror fan talks about it even if heshe has not watched it you may love or hate but you cant deny that it deserves some credit for many reasons first this one started the lost shocking footage idea it also created the myth that its events were real of course everything was a publicity trick that didnt have enough success back in the 80s but it has awaken the curiosity of many generations of horror fansis more than a famous exploitation movie the fact that it is banned in 250 countries is just a fact once you watch it you will understand the greatness of it its a powerful piece of cinema that displays the horrors of humanity in society and in the wilderness as many people have written on their reviews this movie makes you think who are the real savages you cant change natures way and when you irrumpt it with violence and no respect things can get really awful the first expedition group humiliated the savages most important traditions and their way of living just for fortune fame and for morbid purposes their ambition went too far and that is why they found cruel fates but they asked for it without knowing it that happens when you do not show respect for humanityabout the animal real killings i must admit that it can be justified as part of deodatos experiment the killings were not for a shocking purpose but for understand the nature of the message he is sending to the audience we learn more about how these animals are useful for humans who live in the wilderness there have been many heated debates towards this topic but there isnt an uniform opinion for it deodatos social message is very clear humans are savages by nature but the question is again who are the real savages after watching the lost footage of the first group we can feel repulsion for the so called civilized humans the savages didnt do harm to anyone before the civilized humiliated them after the tv executives watched the footage the movie ends in a silent way that will always leave you shocked that is a perfect ending there is nothing more to say after understanding why they found cruel fates to spoil how they were killed and what they saw which is the strong point of the movie would be unfair for those who havent seen the movie because the shock factor is very high and its very impressive to the point that a first time view is a great experience the truth is that is more than a cult horror movie its more of a myth this movie is among the best horror movies of all time and it deserves to be watched by any horror fan well maybe not for those who are easily grossed or for the fainted of the heartthis is truly a horror experience because it shocks disgusts and makes you think,cruel
ive recently heard that the average human life lasts about 650000 hours this breaks down to  74 years that being said when the moment of my death comes my last thought will be damn i wish i had back those 2 hours i wasted on grantedch was made with a modicum skill but this masterpiece talk is excessive the score sounds like elevator music every performance is onenote nevermind that the characters are unsympathetic  thats actually minutely cool  they are most of the time boring and stupid you have a sound girl who in the beginning is chiding her boyfrienddirector about not being ready to marry her days later she screams at him while he participates in a gangrape  but wait  shes not screaming cause he and their other 2 pals are raping a woman shes screaming cause the camera is still on good filmmaking and good art in general should be about some attempt at truth not fact but some revelation or expression of a point of view for all the credit ch is being given in these pages for the who are the real savages debate moments like the one i just described strip away any of those points  i do not believe these characters  i feel like i am being lied to when i am asked to believe that these people would act this way therefore the movie is a lie  and worse its a boring lie apart from some horrific treatment of animals which has already been given tons of lipservice here so let me only say that it is tragic that these poor animals died for such a weak movie the rest of ch is extremely tedious ya sit there waiting for the next shock  and then waiting and waiting smore and listening to that beautiful monotonous scorepoints have been given to ch for being gritty like this was some artistic choice this was not a choice this was a buncha hacks working so onthecheap that they couldnt pring for anything better than handheld the score sounds like elevator music  i know i awready said that but i need to reiterate it in response to how many people said it was beautiful  it sucked did it make for an unusual juxtaposition on a few occasions sure it still sounds like ross geller plunking away on his casio in central perk von trier ending dogville and manderlay with bowies young americans after 150 minutes of handel and vivaldi  now thats a friggin juxtapositionis not scary it is repulsive but not shocking shock would require some element of surprise ch ploddingly meanders way too often for any suspense to build to the point were a shock may happen the only thing surprising about this movie is how many people seem eager to play yesman and be next in line to kneel down pucker up and blow glorious praise over a towering mediocrity,cruel
is pretty much everything youve heard about gory disturbing disgusting etc ill keep this review short and sweet  cuz if you are reading this youve either already seen it or have read a lot about it even thought this film does have some seriously brutal moments  its still relatively lighter on poundforpound gore than more contemporary films i found that the most disturbing thing about this film was the socialcommentary angle that the film took towards the end at first the characters go into the jungle seeking to film the cannibals but end up terrorizing them to get better footage it really brings home the message of who is really the bigger savage is it the jungle dwellers and their seemingly savage practices  or the socalled civilized europeans who will terrorize and kill for their own gain strong movie not for everyone by any means  but is definitely a mustsee among hardcore horror fans even though i find this film to be more of a commentary on the depravity of humans as a whole than as a horror film 1010,cruel
amen brotheris hailed by gore fans and despised by the casual viewer and for good reasonthis is one of the most grueling relentless exercises in human savagery ever lensed  but is it any good  being a fan of italian horror i have to say yes but just barely  it delivers unflincing scenes of rape dismemberment real animal slaughter and other generally deviant behavior but the angle its presented in simply doesnt workrobert kerman the emerald jungle plays a college professor in search of a film crew in a south american jungle  he witnesses several atrocities committed by the natives mild compared to the rest of the film dines on human flesh and eventually is led to a macabre shrine where he finds the footage the crew shot  back in the states a bunch of stuffy tv executives want to broadcast the film for a slice of sensationalist reality but kerman refuses and we settle into the centerpiece of the movie  we watch with growing horror as the film crew indulges in rape torture and murder all for their art with the camera picking up every second the characters are hateful cretins who are obviously desensitized to human suffering butwhen all the ammo in their guns runs out the reality of the situation strikes them and their atrocities are avenged and then someis a repulsive nihilistic film with a silly angle that presents it as social commentary a bad idea this is pulpy dreck at best  it acutally reminded me of 15 minutes in that it goes about its business in a mindlessly savage manner  however i appreciated robert kermans character obviously designed to not just speak out for his personal disgust but for the disgust of the audience as wellhes the moral backbone of this film  also the violence is very effective and welldone and ruggero deodato directs the repulsive proceedings with style the use of handheld camera is effective  overall though i cant bring myself to rate this anywhere above average so 25 stars out of 5,cruel
lets face it those 19yearold eberts in the making who consider this an art film are without a clue the only reason people seek this movie out is because of the total depravity contained therein so for the total gore hounds looking for fun ill summarize this flick for youthe real stuff naturally all the animal torture in the film is sickeningly real1 muskrat getting stabbed in the neck blood pours out2 monkey getting its skull split open by a machete3 pig being kicked then shot in the head with a shotgun while the actor gleefully smiles4 giant and probably endangered sea turtle gets decapitated and then totally ripped apartthe fake stuff1 two separate scenes of gang rape2 a guy getting his weewee sliced off3 a bound woman gets raped with a stone phallus then she gets beaten to death4 a primitive abortion is performed on a very pregnant tribeswoman5 women and children are forced into a grass shack which is set on fire then they are shot while trying to escape 6 a tribeswoman is impaled through her vaginal opening all the way until it exits her mouth 7 and of course there are countless scenes of naked people getting mutilated left and right for any person to have the absolute gall to call this film social commentary should just take a look at any of deodatos other films the man is a mondo hack nothing more whatever sensationally offensive subject matter will offend most he will include probably the only deodato film readily available to the general public would be his the house on the edge of the park watch that little gem then tell me if you think hes a concerned humanist,cruel
as far as i can tell this movie has only one real point to see how much it can make the audience sick the gore is so overthetop that is ceases to be shocking and just starts looking ridiculous the graphic rape scenes were unpleasant and unnecessary as well but what really made me want to take a shower was finding out that the animals in this movie were actually killed im no animal rights activist but killing animals just because youre a dumb filmmaker without a decent makeup effects budget is just plain wrongthe acting in this movie was only slightly better than your average porn film the score only seemed to have two compositions which got played over and over again particularly that dumb synthesiser music the characters left a lot to be desired as well the four doomed student filmmakers were so obnoxious i found myself rooting for the cannibalsas far as the blair witch comparisons go i consider them pretty superficial at best the documentary footage is mostly reserved for the last half hour of the movie also blair witch relied on psychological terror and the power of suggestion seems to have only one goal to gross the audience out if the makers of blair witch actually did see this movie i would imaging that they used it as a blueprint of what not to do with their film,cruel
having finally managed to get hold of a copy of this movie i was thoroughly disappointed after viewing it the uk censors did it a big favour by banning it for so long because it isnt worth any of the hype surrounding it the animal killings in the movie are completely pointless and seriously detract from the overall quality of the film and the human death sequences are contrary to most opinions very unrealistic i mean how many corpses have cornyellow skin and organs the size of footballs maybe its because i saw it for the first time 20 years after it was made that i find it unrealistic and dull  or maybe its because it is  ,cruel
let me say from the beginning that i have absolutely no problem with scenes of brutality or extremity in films it might not be my personal taste usually but i think that every film should be watched for what it is without creating subjective expectationshaving made this clear let me take the next step into something even more controversial  the infamous scenes of real animal killings i will be honest i dont want to judge the film for its animal cruelty depiction  for many reasons most of all because it would be unfair why because then if we wanted to be fair we would have to take the same fact into account when speaking about tarkovsky  andrei rublyov  coppola  apocalypse now  jodorowsky  el topo  and the list goes on all of these are filmmakers that tortured or killed animals for the camera in the films i mentioned all of them genuine masterpieces in my opinion and after all can we really define with accuracy whats allowed in art and whats over the top of course the answer is nobut the problem is that the film doesnt stay there its supposed to be a social commentary and it is indeed a social commentary that only a lobotomized would appreciate and im not even talking about the message that the movie is supposed to have i could even say that the film was quite a strong experience for the first 40 minutes or so and when the real subject came up and the real face of the teenage documentarists starts becoming clear you simply cant resist thinking that if this was the ending of the film it could even be considered as a great film but no ruggero deodato apparently has very little respect for his audience thinking that the viewer is probably a retard unable to understand the deep meaning of the movie so he simply forces it with such naivety that after some point you really want to start banging your head against the wall and scream that even michael moore is an intellectual compared to this guy the ultimate peak of stupidity comes in the last sequence where one of the producers of the documentary  who by the way was a profithunting scum that didnt give a st about human pain so far  gets so shocked by the violence of the footage that he commands for all the reels of the film to be burned and in case any viewer with an iq of 5 didnt get it yet dont worry at all because then you have the last scene where the anthropologistmain character walks out of the building with a confused face and his consciousness wondering in voiceover who are the real cannibals simply outrageousi think the problem is that the director took himself too seriously and had an ambition that he wasnt able to execute without becoming ridiculous and he probably got a bit confused along the way because the real cannibals of the film are obviously the ones behind the cameras,cruel
ill stick my neck out and say it one of the best films ever madethis uncompromising horror film employs original bravado technique and aesthetic brilliance to corrupt our perceptionsthe second half a found film in which a party of doco makers suffers the consequences of their morally reprehensible actions in a cannibal inferno in brazil features mountains of raw horror imagery cut to a soundtrack that renders everything beyond surrealdeodatos strength is in his singular takenoprisoners vision the special effects are so good theyre invisible and the performances are so vivid we never doubt their authenticityto some the film is marred by several scenes in which real animals  are mistreated though im no fun of obnoxious cinematic tactics in the context of this extraordinary document these sequences simply add to both the accrued horror on screen abd the films hardearned notorietya masterpiece,cruel
this is i can safely say the worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life i am not stranger to gratuitous gore and violence i have an evil deadmeet the feeblesleprechan etc sense of humourand i have spent probably thousands of hours watching and loving spatteringly obscene and supposedly shocking asian and italian horror films but this was different this was every kind of inappropriately uncinematic disgustingness imaginable including what is likely the most disturbing rape scene ever filmed it was not so much gore because there really isnt all that much but the absolute ugliness of human behaviorand the anthropologists are the most uncivilized tribe of people in the whole film before i watched this movie i had never seen a film that made me feel physically dirty before do not watch this,cruel
i reluctantly decided to watch the infamous and i found it to be every bit as shocking as people make out it was by far the most uncomfortable experience ive ever had watching a film from the sickening violence and killings to the torturing of animals and graphic rape scenes this film is as morally low as they comeis not art  its not even entertainment how can anybody enjoy watching a coati being repeatedly stabbed as it screams in pain or a turtle being decapitated and then pulled to pieces it makes for an extremely unpleasant and uncomfortable viewing experience unfortunately its also an unforgettable one so watch at your peril,cruel
no i did not see this film nor will i spoiler nor do i watch old western movies or foreign films showing real animal cruelty suffering and death such as texas chain saw massacre actors paid to simulate being tortured injured killed are one thing animals actually harmed because they are weaker than their killers and because someone wants to make money off their pain are quite another inhumanity is fostered with the acceptance of this kind of cruelty and it is the true horror of films like ,cruel
for his work on the film the director was arrested by italian authorities on suspicion of murder charges and faced life in prison following its 1980 milan premiere he endured a trial when italian authorities were unconvinced that the footage was indeed staged deodato lost the original trial and all prints were to be destroyed but he managed to have the ruling overturned in the early 80s when the actors finally appeared on tv to prove otherwisesome five years passed before the film saw release in deodatos home country this movie was banned for twenty years in many countriesonly for fans of disgusting footage,cruel
i cant understand why this movie has just the six average maybe people just seen the violence and not the social criticism that this movie want pass down the movie use the violence itself for criticize the violence suffered by the indigenous people due to consumerism that along the years destroy their lifestyle in order to replace it with ours its a sad story that began with the colonialism and carry on today at the end of the movie the audience should sympathize with the cannibal that are more honest and less savage than the white people nevertheless people ignore this message and just focus on the violence over the animals,cruel
i think people who make films like are real visionaries how did ruggero deodato know in the 1970s itself that the scenario he created then would come true 23 decades after that scenario was released this film is a prescient exploration done in the 1970s of the age of exploitation and voyeurism that we are living in now yes has its shortcomings at times the film seems amateurish but that is maybe because the film required that raw look as for the violence shown in the film yes its graphic but that perhaps compares nothing to the age we are living in now i wonder if would create any ripple now when videos of public beheadings are easily available on the internet and circulated via whatsapp for being such a prescient and gutsy work i rate 1010 i think am lucky i got to see this film,cruel
having avoided this title for much of my horror viewing life i decided to give it a try being one of the better reviewed cannibal films all in all i found it to be a pretty decent movie yes it has some graphic images but sadly this is tame compared to some of todays slasher movies it also has a pretty engaging story which kept me interested all the way to the end i really enjoyed how our victims demeanors transform throughout the movie we go from our initial impression of the film makers as being victim too learning that it was they who were the violent sadists and that the cannibals were in fact punishing and executing them for their atrocities a neat note clearly eli roth took note of this movie in making the green inferno which i am now very eager to see makes numerous mention of the green inferno region of the amazon and the cannibal tribes there,cruel
can sick movies be good movies yes as in quality and merit this one came off better off then i thought it would be is it exploitation for the sake of exploitation maybe but what comes with it is a story ch is quite intriguing as from the tribe peoples point of view it kind of asks that question where does tribal rituals stop and murder begin third time unlucky i guess sees another young crew of filmmakers out to make a documentary about these cannibalistic tribes people some scenes i warn you are sickly graphic where even some of the characters retch on a few occasions such graphic images challenge the viewer one involving the disemboweling of a turtle which in my opinion went a little bit too far the latest crew before ending up all victims encounter their share of bites etc a big shot new york journalist his guide and assistant head to the amazon to recover the young film crew who of course now have become skeletons and bone retrieving a camera with tonnes of footage of their exploits from a shrine of death you could say what unfolds are some shocking and evidential truths at the selfish and indecent hands of the film crew where except for the young girl me myself are glad her friends got what they deserved i have heard this title mentioned a few times where such a itching curiosity got the better of me the voice of the journalist i have heard in many other luici fucci flicks most ostensibly night of the zombies if youre into sick films and want to test your senses again go for this one a beautiful and memorable music score accompanied that will stay with you for a while,cruel
what to say about this terrifying ordeal its too horrifying for words and yet imdb has a minimum of 1000 words so here goesstep by step you are brought to a place where you hate the film crew more than usual i think that the nigerian executions are disturbing and upsetting and it plants this terrible seed in your mind is this real footage going in to this movie you know that its staged and that the cannibals do not actually kill the actors even if deodato was prosecuted for murder on the basis of the film  but you still have a little voice in your head asking how did they do that this looks like stock footage of nigerian shooting squads then the atrocious film crew they are smokers and in 2014 smokers are always evil the 2014 audience would probably want to see people torn to shreds simply for smoking but no they are murderers and rapists too and they make you want to kill them yourselfall things said there is something wrong with the whole project something morally objectionable this is totally inappropriate said my roommate as we watched it and i laughed a little at the prim and proper analysis  while we watched cannibals slaughtering people with rocks and eating their viscera yes totally inappropriate and disturbing and sick truly sicki highly recommend,cruel
ruggero deodato masterpiece have been name the most controversial film ever made and many people dont see beneath that i have been a fan of this movies for a long time and this is the way that i see this movie is one of the best horror movie of all time robert kerman delivers an amazing performance making a sympathetic and down to earth character the rest of the cast are all secondary characters all important to the movie story linethe camera shoot are absolutely brilliant from the beginning of the movie with those great wide shoots of the amazon to the shaky camera shots of the cannibals killing the makeup is absolutely breathtaking after more than 20 years the movies make up is still one of the most memorable of all films historybut is something deeper in this movie that many people may not have seen if you see the cruelty and of the film in some way didnt you find the same premise of avatar you can see this movie as a safe the earth kind of movie this people do harm to this tribe and they got what the deserve the got kill because they didnt respect the way of the people that live there that are one with the nature that surround themmy last words one this movie is that is a masterpiece and i think it dont have the respect deserved,cruel
is a film approached by viewers with a variety of attitudes ranging from reverence to utter disgust i will attempt to add my two cents to the pile without retreading too much or delving into cinematic history too far is a 1980 film directed by ruggero deodato chronicling the journey of an nyu professor into the south american jungle to recover the films of his four associates who have mysteriously disappeared whilst on assignment with help from some equally experienced and jaded guides he navigates through the lands of the yacumo tribe to the yanomamo tribe who with some coaxing and a peace offering relinquish the films of the crew with some other associates in the television business he reviews the films and learns the horrible truth behind the film crew and their expedition which ultimately forces the viewer to question who is the civilized and who is the savagethe professors journey serves as a lesson wherein we learn about the intricacies of the two tribes and how despite the typically western view of such cultures and their inherent brutality there is indeed a sense of justice and a harmony among these people but make no mistake the jungle is still a dangerous place and the justice itself is both harsh and swiftwhat we learn from the footage of the crew is that while the outside world views the tribes as a primitive and backward people it is ultimately the conduct of the outsiders in the film crew that disrupt the balance of life in the tribes and the result is captured in all its gory glory on the filmthis film contains not only gore in the conventional horror sense but a certain amount of real life animal killing i will not run down the list of animals but the most famousinfamous scene which features a large turtle is one of the most sobering things i have seen in any movie ever even as a jaded horror fan this scene still induces a chilling silence in the room in both mixed company and my own solo viewings from a historical perspective this movie is extremely important as the culmination of the entire mondo genre and a prediction of things to come in human experience and entertainment the film mondo cane represented a bleeding edge of film where human experience sometimes sublime sometimes frightening was captured in real time on film only after some time and investigation did we learn that some of jacopetti and prosperis classic footage was embellished or in some cases outright fabricated flash forward a few years to and we are forced to ask ourselves the question that arises from this phenomenon if we can take cinema verite and make it realer than real then what limits are there to impose we can not only capture the truthful horrors of the world but make an even more repugnant reality by manipulating the brush with our own hands and to what end before it was to outline a certain line against which reality and human morality bristled now we use the line for our own ends to create outrage and the resulting titillation is entertainment so by nature this film is the climax of a wave of italian cinema that predicted our current forms of entertainment like reality tv and other selfreferential products by a good amount of timebut the judgment is yours is it right wrong were these the only films or even artistic movement to predict this concept maybe it was the inevitable result as bloodsport is not unique to humanity but comes and goes in waves so art trash you be the judge but i implore you to definitely watch itan interesting note some people have seen this and thought it was a snuff film which gives me a laugh but one thing does sit oddly with me if this was an italian crew in the middle of colombia how did they get all that meat and blood to shoot those gore scenes maybe reality is a little more blurred than i once thought,cruel
ill never forget the first time i watched this film at the alarmingly young age of just 13 years old i was exploring the more lurid areas of cinema i had seen the hysteria and infamy surrounding this film the list of countries that had banned it the various warnings such as if in doubt do not watch this film which of course was an invitation rather than a deterrence due to my age i would have been hard pressed to walk in to a shop and buy a film titled and i didnt want to waste my time watching a version that had been slaughtered by the bbfc so i broke the law and found it on the now extinct limewire id never downloaded anything before i was sure it wouldnt work somehow however when the download finished i opened the file and was presented with the opening scene a shot of the vast perpetual amazon rain forest accompanied by riz ortolanis beautiful score the realisation that i was now able to watch this film of unprecedented horror was so terrifying that i instantly closed windows media player in a wave of fright eventually i mustered up the courage to watch it it was a joyfully intense experience i never knew what ghastliness was around the corner only sheer masochistic curiosity kept me watching it this curious thrill being the essence of exploitation cinema in order to clear my name i must add that i have since bought a fully uncut version on the internet is the father of the found footage genre the film follows harold monroe a professor of anthropology at a new york university who endeavours to discover what has happened to a young group of documentary makers who ventured into an area known as the green inferno in south america eventually he finds their reels and takes them back to new york witnessing their fate in a projection room according to director ruggero deodato the film serves as a diatribe against the sensational violent nature of the media which is quite obviously dubious and hypocritical considering the exploitative nature of the film it is a very powerful piece of filmmaking it leaves a lasting impression on you the film batters you with its biting visceral force which is both visual and aural in many respects this film has high production values for an exploitation film for example riz ortolanis score features both beautiful acoustic tracks and relentless aural assaults it works with the strong visuals to wear you down until youre imploring for it to stop its violence is jarringly realistic and notoriously on several occasions completely real im somewhat torn on the issue of animal slaughter all animals killed in the film were reportedly eaten afterwards and the animals were killed humanely apart from the coatimundi whose fate is the hardest to watch i feel is unfairly maligned look atapocalypse now the brutal slaying of the water buffalo is ignored because of the massively high esteem its held in if it was a lowbudget exploitation film it would have probably been steeped in criticism the acting is tolerable if slightly toecurling in places however generally its good enough for it not to detract from how horribly effective the film iswwwhawkensiancom,cruel
considered to be one of the most controversial films in recent years holocaust repulsed audiences with its ultra realistic violence and its real animal cruelty on screen the footage was so realistic that the director was charged with murder until he proved the cast were alive and wellbeneath this gruesome facade lays the narrow divide between what is considered to be civilised and what is deemed barbaric the first half of the film picks up the pieces of the final and most hard hitting half which is the lost doco footage is it here where holocaust really shines in its desired context by the end of the film we are cheering for the amazonian tribespeople lost in a forgotten time and leering at the sensationalist western filmmakers who substitute their moral conscience for the most depraved acts of murder and pillage possible towards these villagers if you watch this do not view it through a shallow lens of depravity and abhorrent cruelty rather view it as a social commentary on the savagery that still exists in this so called civilised society of ours,cruel
this film while somewhat over the top and overly gritty and violent does make you think at the end of the day who are the real savages a question posed by the main character towards the end of this film now i did have a few problems with this filmproblems okay so the movie was great but way too nasty and violent and i saw the us edit here are some examples the rape scene which leads to the raped girl being murdered by her people and hung from a stick from her anus to her mouth the birth scene baby is born then buried alive in thick sludge and left to suffocate then the mother is killed the castration scene self explanatory but while all these scenes were hard to watch just a little hard to watch not as graphic as you would think or maybe thats because i saw the us edit while these scenes are graphic they are amazingly well shot and in a morbid and odd way beautiful im not crazy and i hate violence i simply am saying for a film done in 1980 the effects are beyond the effects of many of todays films hands downas far as the animal killing scenes  done with real animals i do not approve   but as far as they go they are cut from the us edit so watch that version to be safe although in the us version it is not shown like the sea turtle is not shown being killed but is shown being eaten and the pig is not shown being killed or eaten so yeahif you watch this movie please remember it is just a film just a movie this is the first movie ever where i can accept and appreciate the directors vision and see the art side of it so remember its just a movie and try to appreciate it not for violence killings castration mutilations or anything of that sort but try to appreciate the moral question and artdrenched shots in this film thank you for reading my review,cruel
wow i literally just finished watching this bloodsplattered masterpiece and i dont know who to acclaim the director ruggero deodato or the writer gianfranco clerici the things that stand out most are for sure the special effects and plot but mostly the morality of the tale in whole at first it seems like your average tale of woe as you wait for the build up and once it gets going you find yourself relating to the film crew as normal folk seeking answers to the primitive unknown you feel sorrow for there plight once professor harold monroe robert kerman finds theyve been dismembered and possibly eaten although at the same time you begin to think of them as child like almost in the way that they play fear and communicate in a way that makes you forget about the doc crew and then we see the found footage personally i found myself more disgusted by the behavior of alan mark jack and faye the way that they raped and pillaged even shooting that poor piglet made me quite frankly hate them in the end the footage was burned and we all got a nice life lesson here we are at the edge of the world of human history things like this happen all the time in the jungle its survival of the fittest in the jungle the world in general its the daily violence of the strong overcoming the weak,cruel
arguably the most infamous controversial and shocking of the video nasties ruggero deodato managed to infuse a horror subgenre flagging from over exposure into a powerful piece of pseudodocumentary cinema that still horrifies traumatises and disgusts modern audiences italian genre cinema has always had a tendency towards imitation and the cannibal subgenre was one that was specific to the country and by the mid 1970s was already dying a death deodato had made one previously last cannibal world 1977 and he was pushed into making a sequel which he was reticent to do however after some time he agreed and seems to have taken the opportunity to actually comment on some very interesting observations on popular culture at the timeanother subgenre exploded and created a huge batch of imitators the mondo cycle started in the 1960s with paulo cavara and gualtiero jacopettis mondo cane 1962 with its use of documentary techniques they delighted audiences with graphic depictions of exotic bizarre and archaic practises and incidents however as the market became flooded with imitation the practices used to get the increasingly shocking images became questionable  these aggressive techniques even infiltrated newsmedia in the decade what this means is that the creation of sensationalist stories within the media and this cycle of pseudodocumentaryethnographic expose were often manipulated by the filmmakers who would exploit the situation to make the story more interesting  exploitation which culminated in often horrific violence towards other humans it is this element of pugnacious and hostile form of reportage that inspired deodatos new cannibal moviethe film could be said to be a two part structure in the first we follow harold monroe robert kerman a new york professor is lead into the amazon jungles in search of a group of filmmakers who had disappeared some time previously here the group encounter a primitive cannibal tribe and discover film cans left behind the second half of the film focuses mainly upon the screenings of the shocking footage captured by the illfated documentary makers from this found footage the professor television producers and us film spectators are shown the increasingly hostile tactics used to get shocking and scandalous images of an apparent primordial tribe of viscous people but what it fundamentally highlights is the possibly more horrific nature of modernity as it uses violence for the purpose of entertainment and procurement of profit and it is this barbarism that becomes the four person teams demise and catastrophic deathsa contentious issue with the film is the very real killings of animals on the screen and this coupled with the special effects of human death creates a disjointing juxtaposition making it appear entirely realistic the woman who has been placed onto a stake which protrudes through her mouth appears very real these juxtapositions also created much of the controversy surrounding the project and even lead to the director being accused of killing the cast even in its native italy the film was accused of being a genuine snuff film it is no mistake that deodato was able to use realist film vocabulary techniques to offer a complete experience  he had worked as assistant director on several of roberto rossellinis films the master of italian neorealism the film was inevitably banned in almost every country and vilified as grotesque exploitation but this claim is to completely miss the point of the filmthe impact of this film still can be seen today whilst it is now belatedly getting the kind of critical acclaim that it deserves it still has the power to agitate and appal anyone who watches it  it even manages to horrify some more fanatical gorehounds besides this the influence of the film can still be seen to this day in 1999 the blair witch project arguably lifted s main premise and the found footage concept is being exhaustively used to this day cloverfield 2008 trollhunter 2010 and chronicle 2012 to name just three at last in the uk we are able to view the film in its entirety and whilst the film is genuinely horrific the importance of the uncut version will suggest that the meaning can be fully explored it is an incredible achievement of horror cinema and should be seen by everyone well i wouldnt show it to a child  even though i saw a version at a young age powerful important cinema with an incredible amount to say about the savagery of our modern timeswwwthewrathofblogblogspotcom,cruel
notorious hardcore horror film hits you right in the gut for over an hour and a half to say that its not for everybody is an understatement its impossible to walk away from it and not be affected in fact to say that this viewer enjoyed it may not be entirely accurate but everything that it does it does extremely well its that kind of a movie ultimately its not exactly subtle about the messages it espouses and its exceedingly grim for much of its running time it works as a prototype for the modern popular found footage genre almost two decades before the blair witch project had its great successthe story chronicles the journey of an nyc university professor harold monroe robert kerman to discover the fate of a documentary film crew who had disappeared after venturing into the amazon at first when we find out that they indeed met a horrible fate thats not the real twist the real twist is what motivated the local tribe to treat them this way these filmmakers were no saints  in fact they were just the oppositedirector ruggero deodato here creates a movie that you dont just watch but experience its all too believable throughout with its many scenes of violence against animals understandably too much for some viewers to take gorgeous cinematography and convincing performances are heavy assets when one sees just how depraved the supposed civilized individuals were they may feel sick to their stomachs contrasting all of this is a main musical theme by riz ortolani so utterly lovely it doesnt seem to belong in a horror film at all but thats why it works as well as it doesthe film spends a fair amount of time in the jungle until at a climactic point back in nyc monroe and dubious tv executives view the footage that the documentarians shot for a while these executives are eager to exploit the sensational content until they realize just how ugly things gotthe overall effect of is very sobering but unless some of the elements of its presentation are a turn off for the individual viewer it does rank as something well worth a look as was already said its nothing if not memorableeight out of 10,cruel
oh where do i begin okay if youve ever seen yu yu hakusho theres this video tape called the chapter black tape the villain shinobu uses to brainwashing people into thinking all humans are evil and deserve to be massacred by demons this movie would be on that tape in fact the music from the chapter black tape during the show is a mimic of the melody in this movie almost like a porno a times this movie is extremely graphic that doesnt even do it justice if you ever wanted to see a turtle and some rodent dissected and eaten this movie has it yeah the gore in this movie is more disturbing than any modern day horror movie id ever seen alsotheres been some debate about whether some the sex scenes in this movie were real honestly i think some of them might have been real after watching them dissect a turtle which was still partially alive with its head cut off i didnt think they were acting any more they couldnt get away with nearly as much stuff in a modern day horror movie which is why i like 80s horror movies so much no computer generated crap there were times even i cringed but to be honest i enjoyed it and if you think you can stomach a movie with ridiculously amounts of gore go ahead and watch it too,cruel
ahhh the infamous first off its pertinent not to mention obvious to note that this film is not for everyone those friends you have who cite halloween or texas chainsaw massacre as the goriest most effed up films theyve ever seen do not expose them to this movie they will likely never speak to you again that being said i loved this movie but have some glaring problems with it i felt that the animal slaughter scenes were perfectly fine and can respect the realism of them given that these animals were supposedly fed to the actual natives as happens everyday in the rain forest so the acts themselves i do not consider gratuitous however i do feel that the way in which these killings were filmed and focused on bordered a bit on the verge of disaster porn the muskrat killing though somewhat benign compared to the others seemed particularly egregious closeup of squirming animal with a knife through its throat squealing and convulsing wait for it to die scene over it was just unnecessary in my opinion and couldve been portrayed with a bit more tact however this is modern man trekking into the wilds to essentially reconnect us all with what we come from and this is beyond commonplace in nature the acting was not as bad as i expected though some scenes truly were awkwardly performed the viewer i assume is to believe that these film makers after being exposed to harshness of the jungle descended into barbarism which was magnified by their programing from growing up in the calloused society of western civilization unfortunately the acting just was not there i found myself scratching my head as the atrocities became greater and greater while the actors conversed as if they were walking in the park on a rather mundane day and not in an eerie sociopathic sort of way more of a we dont have much of a range as actors sort of way that being said this is a brilliant film if taking into account what they had to work with the juxtapositions of commentary about the green inferno paired with shots of nyc the by and large convincing gore the iconic impalement scene the very convincing look of the found footage and the overall message of civilized man being just as barbaric but in less overt ways were nothing short of very impressive in my opinion i finished this movie much more impressed than i expected thinking it would be nothing more than a fake snuff film that relied on animal cruelty for shock value i will certainly share this film but only with my very most open minded and lets face it at least somewhat screwed up friends,cruel
i first saw nearly three years ago i borrowed it from a friend of mine who was borrowing it from his friend he kept asking me if i was sure i wanted to borrow it to the point where he was just getting on my nerves and he told me how disturbing it was i finally said just lend me the film already later that night i went home watched the movie and i was like oh my god he was right this probably the most disturbing film i have ever scene i also found out the guy who directed this movie was arrested after it was released he was accused of making a snuff film for anybody not familiar with what a snuff is it is a film showing the actual murder of a person but he was cleared of the charges truth be told the killings of the characters do look real however 7 animals were actually killed when this movie was being made six of them onscreena rat being stabbed in the neck and then gutteda turtle drowned and decapitated and limbs shell and entrails removeda spider killed with a machetea snake decapitated with a machetea spider monkey with the top of its head cut off with a macheteand a pig kicked twice and shot in the head with a shotgun at close rangethis is a very disturbing movie warning this movie should not be viewed by anybody younger than 19,cruel
when i ordered this movie on dvd i thought to myself can i handle this surprisingly i did the stone in vagina scene i could have done without as well as the turtle disembowelment but overall this movie didnt bother me in the same way that tinto brasss caligula did robert kerman an actor once known for porn movies does a good job as professor monroe and so does the rest of the cast including the actor who plays jack anders although he bears a striking resemblance to chuck norris theres also a louis gossett jr lookalike playing one of the colombian soldiers i wonder if chuck and louis ever get asked what was it like filming even though they werent in itworth watching but only if you have a strong stomachits not rated but is worthy of an nc17,cruel
this film is not easy to watch but the statement made and the way it was done make this a big moment in film the various scenes of animals that get shot chopped up stabbed ripped apart and eaten will upset most if not all viewers to some extent but it is these scenes of real violence that make the violence involving humans so believable apart from the animals scenes there are still plenty of other horrific moments the rape scene or rather death by brick scene one of thembut the statement of who is civilised and who isnt is well made and evolves throughout the film and as far as i know this is where the handheld camera viewpoint started the craze blair witch would later ignite hard to watch but a big talking point in film,cruel

is structurally comparable to a threeact play with a brief epilogue the three central characters are briony the younger daughter of the wealthy tallis family her older sister cecilia and robbie turner cecilias childhood friend robbie is from a humble social background his mother is one of the familys servants but academically brilliant and mr tallis has paid for him to be educated through grammar school and cambridge where he has obtained a first a brilliant future seemingly awaits him in whatever profession he chooses and he wants to pursue a career in medicine act i begins like an upperclass comedy of manners the setting is the tallis familys stately home on a hot summers day in 1935 briony a precocious thirteenyearold with ambitions to be a writer has written a play to be performed by herself and her three cousins but this project proves abortive due to disagreements between them robbie has fallen in love with cecilia and accidentally sends her a sexually explicit loveletter in other circumstances this might have resulted in disgrace but as cecilia returns his passion the accident seems to have been a happy one the tone of the film changes abruptly however when brionys cousin lola is sexually assaulted lola cannot identify her assailant but briony who was a witness falsely accuses robbie as a result he is convicted of attempted rape and sent to prison in act ii set in 1940 robbie released from jail is now a soldier with the british army in france he is desperately trying to reach dunkirk ahead of the advancing germans kept going not by fighting spirit or patriotism but by the hope of returning to cecilia who has stood by him throughout his trial and imprisonment becoming estranged from her family as a result in act iii we see briony now eighteen as a volunteer nurse in a london hospital it is in this act that the theme of comes to the fore briony is starting to have doubts about her identification of robbie as lolas attacker so much so that she offers to withdraw her previous testimony and help him clear his name her decision to work as a nurse rather than go to university and to devote herself to caring for the wounded can also be seen as an attempt to atone for the part she played in blighting the life of an innocent man and in tearing her family apartafter the last king of scotland and becoming jane james mcevoy is the rising male star of the british cinema and his performance here is the best yet that i have seen whereas dr garrigan in the last king was morally flawed and lefroy in becoming jane hid his better nature beneath a roguish exterior robbie is unambiguously heroic mcevoy succeeds in conveying his characters basic decency achieving the difficult task of making him good without making him seem dull keira knightley is another rising british star and this is her second film with director joe wright after pride and prejudice although she was good in the comedy bend it like beckham i think that her films with wright are her best suggesting that her future lies with serious drama rather than popcorn epics like pirates of the caribbean in which she seemed miscast her cecilia was not only the loveliest but also the liveliest and most spirited heroine of any film i have seen recently special mentions must also go to saoirse ronan as the young briony and to vanessa redgrave who plays the nowelderly briony in the epilogue set in 1999 i felt however that romola garai at 25 was too old as the eighteenyearold briony this was only wrights second feature film and he has already established himself as an accomplished director pride and prejudice is a good film but is better ian mcewans book is among the best novels of recent years and i doubt if any cinematic treatment could capture all its nuances one of its themes in particular the debate between literary traditionalism and modernism seems beyond the scope of any visual medium and wright and the scriptwriter christopher hampton wisely steer clear of it hampton who has turned the book into a very good screenplay keeps mcewans final twist although it is here presented in a different way with briony revealing the truth in an tv interview if however the film does not capture all the literary nuances of the novel wright makes up for this with his extraordinary visual imagination something sometimes lacking in films based upon novels joins that list of films far from heaven and girl with a pearl earring are other examples that come to mind where almost every scene seems composed like a painting this is true not only of act i set in that beautiful stately home actually stokesay court in shropshire but also of act ii where wright can find a terrible beauty even in war especially in the scenes of the burning town and that long shot of the dunkirk beaches in the grey morning light particularly moving was the scene where the british soldiers sing dear lord and father of mankind the second line of john greenleaf whittiers hymn is of course forgive our foolish ways a particularly apt comment on war and perhaps on the behaviour of some of the charactersalso very good was dario marianellis musical score which appropriately for a film in which writing plays an important part incorporated the sound of typewriter keys tapping altogether an excellent film i can only hope that its british origins and late summer traditionally blockbuster season release date will not prejudice the academy against it when it comes to next years oscars 910,sad
i saw a preview of this film yesterday and felt privileged to be one of the first people to see the film it was also a pleasure to see a film before reading any other critical review or opinion i am a great fan of ian mcewan and was concerned that it would not be possible to capture the subtleties and nuances of mcewans writing but i neednt have had any worries the director joe wright and screenplay writer christopher hampton have done a superb job and the complexities of the novel are superbly captured with real imagination the story is set in three main areas an english country house in 1935 war torn france 1940 and london 1940 the atmosphere in of all three are wonderfully captured by the director cinematographer costume design and score and i am sure that there are going to be some oscar nominations for these james mcavoy as lead man gives a tremendous performance of a restrained but passionate man i was not as convinced by keira knightleys performance and am not sure that her acting has the mature edge to capture the social nuances of the times that mcavoy did so successfully do not see this film if you like fast paced films and rapid plot development this is not a film for the pop video generation if however you like character development and a plot that unravels at a pace that allows you to be immersed in the atmosphere of the film then i can highly recommend as one of the best films that i have seen this year,sad
13yearold briony tallis is a girl with a huge imagination who loves to write the film starts at her completion of a play the trials of arabella a morality tale on love and the dangers of being too hasty with ones emotions from her opening line in the prologue various multisyllabic words that i didnt understand were employed and the audience giggles at her pretension evidently this is a girl whose world is shaped with words regardless of whether or not she understands them witnessing her sister cecilia dive into a pool as their housekeepers son robbie watches after her briony pictures as scene she has no understanding of and by the end of the day she will have changed lives for the worse and she will spend the rest of her life regretting and trying to atone this mistakethe first act of the film set in the picturesque country house effectively conveys the sweltering heat of the british summer and the mental unrest that comes with it the camera never stays still and cinematographer seamus mcgarvey even used christian dior stockings over the lenses to portray the heat and its effects on the residents as briony starts thinking about what she doesnt understand trying to write a play of it dario marianellis haunting score which features the rhythmic tapping of typewriter keys reverberates in the background to continually remind the audience that something bad is about to happen the dramatic quality of the film is heightened with different events are replayed from different perspectives to show what something has the appearance of being and what it really is this device though not new works excellently forthe second act of the film set 4 years later is much grittier and less pretty to watch robbie is now a soldier in france and pines to get back to cecelia the horrors of war are not underplayed and in one excellentlyfilmed tracking shot the camera meanders through a chaotic mess of soldiers robbie who had turned out so well before has not lost practically all of his beauty and retains only his accent similarly back at home soldiers with all sorts of disturbing injuries are shown it is refreshing to see a film that rather than portraying the war as some sort of patriotic honour instead shows the horror and suffering that it causesin what could only be a nod to david lean with his country houses upper middle classes and epic romances joe wright chose for his actors to give performances of the prelee strasburg era and the cast rise up to the challenge admirably as the young briony saoirse ronan is pitchperfect conveying her youthful innocence as well as whiny nosiness her sense of knowing about things she clearly doesnt is infuriating but ronan prevents us from denouncing her entirely reminding us that she is after all just a child keira knightley who will be keen to forget her performance in her other 2007 venture pirates of the caribbean iii doesnt do anything majorly wrong here and at times even earns the audiences respect and sympathies as the loyal lover romola garai plays the older more wise briony with conviction and a touch of sadnessbut the star of the show is the one the only james mcavoy in the qa that followed the screening of the film director joe wright described robbie as the highest form of a human being and he is even after he is put in the war to avoid staying in prison for longer he does not whinge about it but instead gets through the day with the hope of seeing cecelia guiding him through james mcavoy plays this special individual with compassion and understanding he has the accent and physicality of robbie down to a t but more importantly conveys his goodness without ever having to resort to histrionics mcavoys performance is a masterclass in subtle acting in some pivotal scenes it is actually his beautiful blue eyes that do the acting more than anything and they speak more words than brionys ostentatious prose ever couldthere is more than a little similarity between and the gobetween both tell of love between different classes and an intruding message carrier between the two furthermore sarah greenwoods sensuous set design in the first act and accurate war holes in the second along with the sound design which features buzzing bees works cleverly on a subconscious level to add to the tension indeed is a technically and visually stunning film the hues in the first act are almost overly saturated with richness and this contrasts starkly to the second act where cold hospital wards and mucky brown war dugouts fill the screen the costumes are all realistic and accurate though i personally favour the glamorous designs of the first half which include a mesmerizing green dress that cecelia wears the cinematography which encompasses long takes tracking shots lingering pans all attribute to the visual flair of the movie but the key stylistic element that stood out for me was the score the piano theme is elegiac and melancholy and the cello and violins also add to the sadness of the romance also the use of a typewriter as an instrument though started oddly soon becomes infectious and it even forces its way into viewers minds making robbies note and the consequences unforgettablejoe wright and working title have made a film to be proud of amidst some incredible scenes such as an extremely erotic library nonreading session between robbie and cecelia the quality and calibre of films that working title have turned out recently have been brilliant pride  prejudice hot fuzz etc and ranks up there along with my personal favourites dead man walking and the hudsucker proxy it is a wonderfully crafted beautifully lush and immensely moving film that shows above all how storytelling can both destroy and heal,sad
i usually dont like watching novels turned into movies specially when i liked the novel as much as i liked mcewans but this was a really pleasant surprise the plot is extraordinarily well adapted leaving out what cannot possibly be included in a twohour film changing very few details to translate literary language to cinematographic language but sticking to the essence and the spirit of the noveli really believe that if you enjoyed mcewans novel you will fall for this beautiful film if you have never read mcewan you will fall for the intriguing and thrilling story written by this wonderful english novelistplease dont miss this one,sad
the first third of is superb we are introduced to a group of affluent english aristocrats whiling away their summer hours at a massive estate one of them cecilia keira knightley is nursing a raging case of sexual attraction to her childhood friend and now family gardener robbie turner james mcavoy while another cecilias young sister briony saoirse ronan spends her day writing a play which she plans to perform for a family gathering later that evening everyone is bored and listless in the summer heat briony prey to an overactive imagination keeps witnessing a series of increasingly serious moments of intimacy between cecilia and robbie that she isnt old enough to fully understand and finally a false accusation by her is responsible for sending robbie away from the estate in handcuffs everything about this part of the film is brilliant the director joe wright ratchets the sexual tension to an almost unbearable pitch and i was on the edge of my seat waiting to see what would happenbut then the story and movie switched gears and it lost some of that narrative momentum it had been so wonderfully building the second and third acts of the film while accomplished do not deliver on the promise set up in the films first part and the movie never really succeeded in sucking me back in when we next see robbie hes wandering through the desolate battlefields of wwii france pining for cecilia and nursing a chest wound wright shows off mightily in this part of the film theres an astounding tenminute tracking shot that depicts the allied forces on the beach of dunkirk that will have cineastes slobbering but like robbies mind this part of the film starts to wander aimlessly and even while i was admiring the sheer planning that went into this amazing shot i couldnt help but wish that wright would just get on with it alreadyfinally the film circles back to briony four years older and working as a nurse tending to the wounded shes suffering a tremendous amount of guilt for the wrongs shes only now beginning to understand and wants to reach out to cecilia from whom shes now estranged and robbie to offer her apologies ive not read the iam mcewan novel on which this film is based but even i could tell that this is where the screenwriter christopher hampton had the most trouble adapting the novel to the screen much of what is about becomes clear in this last act as briony ages into vanessa redgrave a successful novelist who has finally written a novel that works as an outlet for her devastating feelings of guilt we begin to realize here that isnt as much about the love affair between cecilia and robbie as it is about the act of writing and the power of words briony learns as a little girl how difficult words are to take back once theyve been said as an adult she learns the ability of words to help us deal with regret one particular scene that takes place between cecilia robbie and briony is a fiction inserted into their story by briony the novelist its the story as she wishes it had been rather than as it actually was briony the woman cant change the past but briony the novelist canthis is a wonderful idea but unfortunately the screenplay doesnt quite know how to communicate this in cinematic terms so its told directly to the audience by redgrave in a monologue at the films conclusion redgrave is a luminous actress but her soliloquy feels awkwardly inserted into the film as for the other actors they all do fine work the young actress saoirse ronan is especially good and james mcavoy proves further that hes becoming one of the finest young actors working today but the screenplay sort of abandons him and knightley after its first half hour or so to a warmed over version of the english patient and the strong impact they both make early on dissipates graduallyi admired for how it looked and the ideas it had to express but i think its an uneven film that doesnt entirely workgrade b,sad
my wife and i went to see the movie last night and were totally blown away by the whole experience so brilliantly directed and acted the movie time just flew by and we were drawn in and captivated by each dramatic moment never having read the book or been an expert on ww2 i had a truly open mind on what to expect and im not one of those who count every rivet or go looking for technical inaccuracies however small this was truly a masterpiece of cinematography we were treated to wonderful performances lavish sets shocking and thoughtprovoking moments and haunting themes i had the privilege of being an extra in the redcar dunkirk scene and once seen in its full glory and effect on the big screen i was simply in awe and glad to have been a part of it walking along redcar beach from now on will never quite be the same again i am quite sure that the movie will win a number of awards within the next 12 months but that is not what really matters movies are there to entertain tell a story and affect you emotionally and by god this did it in spades if you have not seen it yet you must,sad
my brain tends to turn to mush in the presence of greatness this makes it difficult when i want to write about something that i thought was truly great it is so much easier to write about something that is rubbishoh well here goesi thought that was terrific it is a really great movie obviously it is early days yet and there are a lot of contenders still to appear but might just be the winnerinwaiting of the best film oscar in 2008 put your money on it nowis pure poetry on film from the hazy dreamy hopeful days of 1935 a destructive act of spite the horrors of dunkirk with one of the most fantastic long takes i have seen in a cinema for a very long to the aftermath and a devastating happy ending it is a magnificent and moving film beautifully directed by joe wrighti have never really rated keira knightley or understood her popularity except for her role in pride  prejudice for which she was perfectly cast i have tended to refer to her as girlwhowouldbewinslet as i thought that she had not played a single role that kate winslet could not have done better maybe i wont say that anymore is easily the best thing keira knightley has donekeira knightley has had a lot of the press over here but we should not forget to mention the pitch perfect performances from james mcavoy and romola garai they share as much screen time as la knightley and are as impressivewonderful filmgushing over,sad
its very rare that a movie like comes along and leaves me completely speechless and in complete and utter awe for hours after i have seen it you see isnt just the best movie i have seen all year its one of the best movies i have seen in a very very long time and by that i include pans labyrinth yes this movie is better than my favourite movie of 2006 and i never imagined would ever come close to that level of greatness until fifteen minutes into the movie last night is an unusual movie in fact its fair to say that i have never seen anything quite like it its a rare movie that actually i adored so much that i am going to hunt down a copy of the book tomorrow just to see the comparisons its not an easy movie ill be honest if you go in expecting something light hearted and easy to digest then you will leave the cinema feeling very cheated this is a movie that deals with very dark things at times no matter how much i desire to write in depth about every aspect of the movie i just cant the movies greatest triumph is the fact that its plot is so intricately woven that if you ruin one part of the storyline to anyone then the movies impact is slightly lessened the storyline is just brilliant but its the climax that leaves you in store for the biggest shocker and its this shocker that leaves you reeling long after you have left the cinema the performances here are all spectacular i think its fair to say that the two leads james mcavoy and keira knightly shall be receiving at the very least nominations for best actorbest actress the score is beautiful whoever came up with the idea of using a typewriter as a musical instrument deserves to be praised heavily its rare a score leaves me feeling moved the score in this movie did that for me thats yet another oscar that this movie deserves to win all in all is just perfection i doubt youll find a better movie this year or even for the next three years in a time when blockbusters get all the attention it is nice to see a small but intelligent movie leave me in aweas i previously mentioned the performances in this movie is simply amazing keira knightly is an odd actress while she proved herself in pride and prejudice yes i have unfortunately seen that movie she comes across as a wooden actress in films like pirates of the caribbean really sees her at her best yet her character is different from what weve seen knightly play before usually she goes for the spunky females this time she seems more like a proper lady albeit one that smokes constantly and is a bit stuck up for her own good keira knightly excels in the earlier more laid back sequences but its in the later stuff the more powerful stuff that we see just how talented an actress she truly is despite all my praise for knightly she still plays second fiddle to james mcavoy the former actor of shameless and narnia is on a roll lately his excellent although sadly overlooked performance in the last king of scotland still sticks firmly in memory but his performance here is simple breathtaking one sequence in particular where we see his acting talent come to light has to be the sequence in dunkirk more on that later no words but the performance says everything knightly might not be certain to win an oscar but mcavoy surely is its also refreshing to see a young actress saoirse ronan not be eye gougingly irritating but rather a superb actress her character briony is a vital character in the movie and for such a young actress she delivers her performance so chillingly brilliant unfortunately next to this brilliant performance romola garai who plays an older briony pales in comparison her performance is still brilliant but not as effective nor as memorable as the younger actress the storyline of is where the film holds most of its impact essentialy the film is about a lie that briony tells and how it affects the lives of her cecilia and most importantly of all robbie thats pretty much all i can and will say of the storyline a lot more happens over the course of the movie and a lot of stuff that you think will happen doesnt and things you think wont happen will the ending is a prime example of this and to be honest i didnt see it coming the way the movie is directed is also something note the beautiful colours of the summer house are amazing but the way the camera moves around the house makes it even better but the direction will be remembered for one scene in this movie and its in dunkirk i mentioned this previously for the performance in that scene what i failed to mention is that the shot is a continuous shot that lasts five minutes as we see the chaos of dunkirk from horses being shot to a man hanging from a ferris wheel the sequence is shown in all its glory it really is a powerful moment and probably the one scene that got me closest to tears purely because of the singing in the background it is shocking just how amazing this sequence truly isoverall is a perfect movie in actual fact its a movie with pretty much no flaws whatsoever superb performances beautiful direction a script and storyline to die for it is unlikely any film will top this for a very long time this is something that will go down in cinema history as being a classic and it highly deserves it inevitable status,sad
i was completely stunned when i watched yesterday from the funny lines to the sad moments this movie does not fail to amaze me james mcavoy is by far the shining star in this movie endowed with unfailing charisma and absolutely adoring accent the score was impeccable especially the sound of the typewriter i loved the scenes from dunkirk the hospital and of course the mansion its truly an amazing movie that i consider to be the best of 2007s the ending was rather sad but it fits perfectly keira knightley was ineffably wonderful with her charming beauty and brilliant performance one should really go and watch it because its a fulfilling experience i personally give it 1010,sad
a budding young writer named briony witnesses an innocent act she doesnt fully understand between her older sister cecilia keira knightley and longtime family servant robbie james mcavoy one restless summer day on her familys lavish country estate in 1935 england that leads to scandal in joe wrights dreadfully sumptuous adaptation of ian mcewans international bestselling novel four years later all three characters try to find their own personal sense of peace or redemption during wwiithis brief synopsis does nothing to explain the intricate complexities of the plot and actions that take place although keira knightleys performance is slightly offputting due to the fact she appears like she just escaped from a concentration camp surely young british socialites did not look like this in the 1930s the stunning cast shows full range here racing through curious emotions spite lust recklessness and selfish wanton abandon the facial expressions especially from the children in the early scenes on the estate are priceless none of the characters are particularly sympathetic as they are often vain selfabsorbed and quite silly in their drama but they are fascinating to watch the first third of the film is played like a masterpiece theater production of the great gatsby as seen through the eyes of nancy drewhowever what makes soar is the impeccable direction of joe wright he makes the most audacious comingofage as an auteur since anthony minghella delivered the english patient back in 1996 wright displays a near kubrickian mastery of sound effects notice the strikes of the typewriter keys that transition from scene to scene and often bleed into the amazing score from dario marianelli wright also crafts a finely textured miseenscene that visually translates mcewans richly composed story onto the screen with near note perfect fashion nothing can really prepare you for how well directed this film is until you see it and the scene of the three soldiers arriving on the beach at the dunkirk evacuation is one of the greatest stand alone unedited panning long shots ever captured on film it left me gaspingthat scene leads to the heart of the film the often clichd romance at the core is trumped by wrights depiction of robbie a single man forlorn and obsessed his dizzying inner turmoil reflected against the grand canvas of a chaotic world at war likewise brionys redemption comes not in the tooclever conclusion at the end of the film but in the intimate and symbolic confessional at the bedside of a dying french soldier these moments leave lasting impressions and left me imagining that if joe wright were to ever adapt irene nemiorovskys suite francaise onto the silver screen he would knock it so far out of the park it would leave gone with wind spinning in its gilded hollywood grave,sad
the superb ian mcewan book translated into cold beautiful images by the startling joe wright and scriptwriter christopher hampton the result is a series of powerful rushes and abrupt stops a pacing that perhaps is a bit too self conscious for its own good doesnt help us to connect the emotional dots i had the feeling i had lost something in the love story of the protagonists  something that didnt happen to me reading the book by the time the injustice takes place i was taken by the pain of the injustice but not by knightley and mcavoys liaison their love story is left to its own devices the beauty of the images is overwhelming and the assuredness of joe wright at his second feature after the much better pride and prejudice keeps you going the score tends to be monotonous and irritating but in spite of all that i intend to see again and i would recommend it with just the above mentioned reservations,sad
based on ian mcewans award wining novel of the same name tells the story of a british romance that spans several decades fledgling writer briony tallis as a 13yearold irrevocably changes the course of several lives when she accuses her older sisters lover of a crime he did not commitive waited several months to see joe wrights second feature film and it did not disappoint for an only second feature film by 35 old joe wright its absolutely astonishing directed superbly on all levels from the stunning dunkirk visuals to several point of view shots empathising each characters need and feelings at that point you cant help but feel intertwined in the story and with the characters i havent seen such an epic of a film since the english patient i hope it continues to do well at the box office and worldwide as it deserved to i havent read the novel so i will do soonthere are many sensational tracking shots in this which i loved for instance in the dunkirk scene we walk with robbie and see the devastation through his eyes just amazing at the beginning brionys view of robbie and celia is done through two perspectives one being what briony believe has happened and two the real truth this creates a dilemma for the audience as you dont really know who to believe at that point one shot i loved was of brionys eye an extreme closeup almost giving a clue to the viewer as i mentioned before i can not believe that wright has produced such a masterpiece of a film in only his second featurethe dunkirk scene is something to be remembered watching it at the cinema i was so taken aback by the extraordinary beauty of the scene the cinematography is sensational it captures the mood of that time so well that you can put yourself in there what works is that you think what youre seeing is real and everything in every frame of that scene i cant really describe the words as it wont really doesnt do justice to what i thought of the scene but lets just say im still thinking about it now and will always subsequently that scene has to be up there with some of the best war scenes ever created for the silver screen and i dont often say that unless its seriously something that has left me speechless beyond any recognition that hasnt happened some other scenes to mention are celia and brionys estate like house and the scenery and the wartime london are also sensational plus there done in such a way you wouldnt expect a 21st century film to makeas for the acting that was wonderful from every actor in the picture keira knightly does brilliantly as she did in pride and prejudice which she deservedly got an oscar nomination for that however doing crap films like the pirates franchise doesnt do her acting talents any justice these are the films she should be making as she has the ability to become one of the best british actresses of recent years she just needs to keep well away from blockbusters im sure shell gain her 2nd nomination at next years oscars however the real sensation n this film is james macavoy for me he outshone knightly on all levels playing robbie turner so so well that you believed in the character more that knightlys i dont quite know how to explain but im sure youll know what i mean when you see it macavoys performance was so exquisitely done that i almost cried for the first time in a cinema im hopeful macavoy will gain his first nomination at the academy awards i hope he is in chance of winning one this year i will jump for joy if he does as he deserves it more than anyone in this film i must not forget the incredibly supporting cast from young saoirse ronan who brilliantly played briony aged 13 romola garai who played briony aged 18 and the great vanessa redgraveolder briony who moved me to tears with her final speech at the end i hope the academy recognises at least one of those actresses because they all deserve some recognitionthat soundtrack is stunning beyond words it brilliantly blends in the mood of that period with every scene that you understand whats going on and the scene becomes visually engaging im sure this score will be oscar nominated finally im sure antonement will be nominated in several categorys at the 2008 academy awards as it should and deserved to i havent seen such an outstanding british film as his for a while now although the queen came close last year is the one for me this is a modern masterpiece and will become an instant classic as did the english patient did back in 1996 i hope you will all go out and see it when it reaches your local cinema as you all should the best film ive seen this year,sad
well from the trailers i could tell this would be an epic film before i was even able to see it i managed to attend a gala screening of the film last night and i thought it was amazing despite my constant dislike to keira knightly i was unable to disapprove of her acting in this film she has improved massively since the first pirates film the film itself has an intriguing plot line which keeps you hooked throughout the film includes humour at the start and fascination by the end i loved watching this film and i enjoyed the smartness of the story the film is cleverly done with jumps in time and different perspectives of events throughout which will leave you understanding the motives of each character more the music is composed beautifully the orchestral tunes accompanied with the clatter that a typewriter makes creates a beautiful piece of music that fits perfectly with the film itself i have since begun to read the book the only thing that the film lacks is the character depth that a book can write about but a film simply cant explain i feel that the film shows what happened but the book is able to explain a little more as to why the events occurred overall the film was beautiful brilliant and emotional,sad
i finished filming as an extra in the blockbuster movie on august 22nd 2006 i didnt realise id have to wait a full 12 months and 1 day to see the end result on screenwell was it worth the wait the answer is yes the movie has the meticulous detail you would expect from a director of joe wrights calibrerichard brooks writing in the sunday times said he would be amazed if the jury finds a better film than to take first place at the venice film festival on august 29thhe said i cannot think of a better british movie in years unlike most of our homegrown efforts it is big scale yet intimate when it needs to be i would agree the story unfolds and the audience is drawn into the plot from the start it begins in prewar england in a large country house with james mcavoys character robbie turner being wrongly accused of rape and being imprisoned and thus separated from keira knightley he is released from prison on condition he joins the armythis is a love story and more with the back drop of the second world war although it is not a war film as such the scenes of the dunkirk evacuation are some of the best of their type ever executed in cinema historythe scene that i was waiting to see was towards the end of the film joe wright shot the dunkirk scene in redcar in one complete take with no edits it looks amazing maybe being part of it made me slightly biased but the human tableau that mcavoys character walks through engulfs your senses and i cant wait to see it again my only regret is that it wasnt longerapart from this doesnt disappoint in any department the acting is first class and the story is engaging and i certainly didnt guess the ending i will definitely see it again this time at the regent cinema in redcar where the building is one of the cornerstones of the great setand finally did i see myself well possibly the jurys still out until i get my hands on the dvd next year enjoy it,sad
when was released in 2007 i made a point not seeing it due to the hype  critics were falling over themselves to judge the film a  masterpiece  and its interesting that all these critics were british  when it comes to harmless shallow jingoism the british film critics are unique  while some countries have an obscene tradition of murdering people because  theyre not one of us  the british lovers of art fawn sycophantically over the slightest piece of mediocrity if theres some anglosaxon celtic connection and since is set in a pre war 1930s britain with posh folk we have the archetypal class driven british movie that appeals to jealous egalitarian americans  it was interesting that the film didnt do very well at the american box office and that despite receiving an avalanche of prestigious nominations it had a very small award from nomination ratio  this tells you something after seeing it after the hype has been dead for several years my impression of it is that on a technical level it is a very impressive film  from the opening scene which involves both sound editing and imaginative camera work theres a lot to impress cinephiles  perhaps the most impressive aspect is the cinematography by seamus mcgarvey  the way the colours contrast and seduce the audience with an on screen beauty is worthy of the best works of the great roger deakins  theres also a scene set on the beaches of dunkirk where the camera floats around for ten minutes never cutting once which has entered in to legend  one wonders why director joe wright wasnt oscar nominated for this scene alone  perhaps he was trying too hard to impress unfortunately perhaps it was down to some very clumsy errors on the part of the director that he didnt receive more  as was pointed out at the time the story takes place in 1935 then jumps forward with a caption saying  four years later  with the evacuation of dunkirk which in fact took place in may june 1940 which every schoolboy of the 1970s would know  this caption cant be defended down to the early segment taking place at the end of 1935 because its obvious the way people are dressed that its summer 1935  other irritants involve a lancaster bomber flying around the skies of 1935 england and a black cockney corporal in the bef  its not impossible to have a black cockney in the british army of that time  just unlikely  what would be impossible would be corporal mace to be overweight as seen here  rationing had been introduced and there was little fat in the british diet in those days  hands up anyone who has seen a photo of a fat person circa 1940  thought not these irritants might be forgivable but one thing that is fundamentally flawed comes from ian mcewans source novel  robbie is found guilty of child rape and sentenced to several years in prison  when he is in northern france he states that he was given a choice to either serve in the army or complete his sentence  in reality this wouldnt have happened in real life since conscription didnt extend to prisoners serving sentences  this becames even more unlikely when were shown a segment set  six months earlier  which would place that event round about novdec 1939 when robbie has completed basic training  the truth is for robbie to have completed basic training hed have needed to join the army before conscription was introduced in the autumn of 1939  before that the british army was an all voluntarily professional army  this fact makes it doubly implausible for a convicted child rapist to be given a choice between serving a sentence and serving in the military as the title suggests is a redemption plot but seems poorly translated to screen  the film ends with briony tallis on contemporary tv plugging her latest book called  oh metafiction  how wonderfully clever  not  and stating that the scenes she wrote where she finds a reconcilation between herself on one side and robbie and cecillia on the other is total fiction since robbie died on the beaches of france and cecillia died in an air raid a few months later  this might have worked on the printed page but comes across as problematic on screen put it like this if robbie was having a death dream that wouldnt be as confusing as what is seen here and you feel somewhat cheated by the way events happen  its not helped by the fact briony is a compulsive liar who ruined someones life  the fact she grew up to be a major successful novelist who will die of old age is another factor that will alienate some people are beyond redemption and in its literal ecclesiastical meaning is nonsense to any humanist in all you can understand to a large degree the number of plaudits and prestigious nominations this film received on its release  it is a visual delight for those of us who understand the language of cinema  conversely youre also to understand why it wasnt able to convert the acclaim in to actual awards  it is very problematic from a narrative point of view and for a film to achieve true greatness you must find some empathy for the protagonists and empathy is in short supply for this film with its clumsy storytelling and characters,sad
bottom line about this movie who cares none of the characters are particularly sympathetic  since when does a couple who have a 60 second fling in the library then dont see each other for 4 more years qualify as a great love story oh pleasethe whole war footage was utterly confusing and especially in the part of the cockney soldier which is oddly funny was that on purpose if so how very strange if not how very unfortunate the ending which just sort of suddenly lurches forward into present day lord why did that poor briony never change her hairstyle is a huge bait  switch which cannot help but make you think that youve wasted two hours essentially by being lied to how on earth this film was nominated for so many academy awards i do not know the nicest thing i can say about this movie is that ms knightlys green dress was truly stunning seriously thats it,sad
with so many people raving about how incredible this film was i went to see it with high expectations i wish i had not bothered to call it over rated would be an understatementto start with why are we so obsessed with class war in this country not every single person from the aristocracy was a bigoted upper class twit we won two world war with a military led by people from those classes so they could not all have been bad and no they were not all poetry writing closet homosexuals either  see most first world war offerings yes there were some snotty idiots but to brand everyone as such would be like labelling every working class person as a foul mouthed yobfootball hooligan this whole subject is getting so utterly boringfrom a historical perspective leaves a lot to be desired about halfway through the film we see a lancaster fly overhead the prototype of this aircraft did not fly until 1941 not the mid 1930snext we move to dunkirk where they got the date wrong dunkirk was 1940 at one point during the retreat to dunkirk james mcavoy and some fellow soldiers are seen spending the night in an abandoned building this is over a lit candle on a dry wooden floor covered with combustible materialnice one guys these men are alarmed by the arrival of some french civilians bringing food as they initially thought they were germans if james mcavoy and friends were that worried about germans why did they not post a sentry and blanket out the windows as a soldier let alone an infantryman one of the first things you are taught in training is the importance of posting sentries and basic noise and light discipline the scenes of dunkirk beach were for me the final straw whoever designed the set not only tried to cram far too much in but has clearly never served in the armed forces amongst the biggest howlers were the anti aircraft guns that were too close together with no attempt made to protect them or their crews this is at a time when the dunkirk beaches were being hammered daily by german aircraft especially the dreaded stuka dive bomber secondly the soldier siting the vickers machine gun has not only made no attempt to conceal his position why not use one of the buildings but if he had ever fired the weapon from that position he would have only hit his own menfinally where on earth did the black guy come from people may argue symbolism which can go quite well with accuracy but in reality there were no british african regiments at dunkirk the kings african rifles the nigeria regiment and other african units did fight with distinction in wwii but this was later on and in africa the middle east and burma not dunkirk in 1940if there was an award for most overrated film of the year would be a clear winner if you like historically inaccurate drippy yarns about injustice and class war you will love it if you do know something about history or have served in the military you will be biting a large hole in your lip how this film won the baftas best film of the year over other films such as the lives of others is a mystery,sad
unreasonable this movie lost me when the entire dinner party went out to look for the two little boys and all but one robbie continued the search after their sister lola was found and allegedly assaulted come on people sure lola was in bad shape and needed help but a houseful of people standing around asking a 13yearold what she saw shouldnt their priority be to find the missing boys first they can ask all the questions and point the fingers later cannot believe this scene its one of the earlier death knells for this otherwise hohum movie the awards people must have watched a different movie than the one i rented thumbs way down,sad
i cannot adequately sum up into words the disappointment i felt after watching this filmengland 1935 and 13 year old briony tallis thinks theres something funny going on between her older sister cecilia keira knightly and their strapping gardener robbie james mcavoy she totally misinterprets several events that take place over the course of a day and as a result robbie is sent to prison five years later with britain at war robbie is in the army fighting at dunkirk will he return to cecelia will briony put things right unfortunately at this point i was past caring so what was wrong for a start the performances were awful  the idea seems to have been why act when you can overact the direction was slow and ponderous the characters were vacuous and twodimensionali counted halfadozen or so scenes that could and should have been left on the cutting room floor they seemed to have no point at all werent explained properly nor did they lead anywhere i suspect they were only left in to bring the film up to a twohour running timethen there were the continuity errors a lancaster bomber flying in 1935 six years before they were invented robbie losing his boots in one scene only to be wearing them again in the next briony seeing robbie and cecilia through the open library door when they clearly closed it behind them when they went in briony saying that these events happened when she was 10 or 11 then later in the film saying they happened when she was 13 robbies letters appearing and disappearing on his desk depending on the camera angleand how deep was the water supposed to be in that garden fountain worst of all though was the clumsy and contrived way the misunderstandings were set up im no dramatist but i could see every one of them coming a mile offim sure the filmmakers would say their film was poetic in its nature not meant to be taken literally but that is no excuse ed wood and david winters said the same about their movies it also makes no sense for briony to state at the end that she was telling whole truth without embellishment when the story is filled with embellishment from the very first sceneon a personal note id like to hear mike nelson bill corbett and kevin murphy do a riff on this movie perhaps ill email them,sad
the tragedy and poignancy of this wartime love story shouldve torn my sentimental heart out but i found i was checking my watch repeatedly during the last hour since i figured out by then that nothing much of great cinematic significance was going to happena privileged and obnoxious precocious rich girl makes a false allegation regarding a decent and mildly likable working class man and she is believed by virtue of her station in life effectively ruining his life this may make some deep statement about the entrenched class system in britain but this interesting point is never developed in favour of shallow harlequin romance sappinessi just didnt given a damn about anyone in this movie keira knightley despite her striking physical beauty remains just as aloof and unlikeable here as in her incarnations of elizabeth swan and elizabeth bennett and i expected i would identify more with mcavoys character as many if not most men hugely fear being misunderstood in relationships and thus vulnerable to vexatious allegations of sexual impropriety but i found so little endearing in himhe by no means impressed me as the quintessential romantic hero who i wanted to get the girl despite ostensibly insurmountable obstaclesthe vanessaredgraveasbriony revelation at the end of the film was a mildly entertaining twist but still the fact that robbie and cecilia were casualties of the war before they could be reunited did not move me much at allin short it aint casablanca the starcrossedloversinwartime thing has been done before and it has been done betterdespite the invective of another review i am very attentive to film music and i really liked the score the incorporation of an old typewriter as a percussion instrument at points was striking and original and i really enjoyed itthe film really deserves a 6 mildly entertaining and not a complete waste of time but i give it a 1 in my attempts to offset the abundance of pathetically misguided reviews that are claiming to find cinematic genius here,sad
i will not say that this is a really bad movie because a lot of people think it is really good and unlike some others i am not arrogant enough to think that my taste should set the standard for everyone else there is no accounting for taste even bad tastehowever i thought it was a painfully bad movie and i will tell you very specifically whyfirst some specific things that prevented a knowledgeable viewer from sympathizing with the characters1 in the promo they say that a young girl sees something she doesnt understand and mistakenly tells a story that that has tragic consequences that entire sentence isnt a quote but something she doesnt understand is in fact she sees several things and she does understand enough to know what is going on the specific event that tops off the sequence of events that ruin lives is one she knowingly lies about whether or not she fully understands it and she clearly has set out to destroy a mans life apparently motivated by jealousy even before the main event she says that he should be put away where he can hurt no one 2 it is said in one of the promo trailers no spoiler here that robbie had the choice between prison and going to war well this was a part of wwii that most americans dont know about because america hadnt entered it at that time but all ablebodied men in the uk went to war 3 the scene in the library was absurd to disrespect ones family by doing something like that in a library with a horde of people wandering around would have been the height of disrespect and stupidity 4 in the 1930s in britain or america for that matter if a father caught his daughter engaged in or learned of the acts that actually did occur the boy would find going to prison to be one of the nicer things that might happen to himnow about the structure of the moviethe story has a beginning and an end most of the story should have taken place in a middle that does not exist in the movie there are events with major consequences for all involved the girl briony cecelia robbie the tallis quincy and turner families as well as others these events take place in the beginning of the story and the consequences we learn nothing of what happened except a little of briony that robbie chose war and that cecelia stayed around possibly waiting for robbie  or possibly not as we learn near the end of the film the middle of the story is related in a few sentencesthe end of the film is supposed to show the presumably this is brionys for ruining a few lives  we dont know how many because that would have occurred in the middle of the story is satisfaction given for wrongdoing unless one includes satisfaction obtained by the wrongdoer which i dont think counts there is noso what does one have some very unlikable characters some of whom have bad things happen to them because of bad things done by other unlikable characters the few likable characters disappear during the nonexistent middle of the storyif you choose to see this movie you may very well find something to like but i dont think it will be anything that is a part of the story,sad
i taught ian mcewans novel as part of university courses in contemporary british fiction so i felt differently about the film than my husband did  my husband saw the movie without having read the book i think is a valid and admirable attempt at filming a novel about writing the use of the sounds of typewriter keys strongly conveyed brionys development as a writer and the power of her testimony to destroy the power of robbies passion to move cecilia and shock briony and her familys world and the power of the mature briony to enable robbie and cecilia to have in fiction the happiness that they could not have in life my husband debated with me whether brionys fiction can really give her sister and friend the life that her testimony took away from them or whether the is only in brionys mind the cinematography is excellent and the acting is superb until i saw the credits i believed the 18 year old briony was played by the same actress as the 13 year old briony however the ending and the mature brionys admission that she invented scenes in her supposed true account are unconvincing brionys interior life and her realization that other people are as alive and important as herself are not shown on screen the shifts in time may be confusing for those who are unfamiliar with the novel both my husband and i found the movie slow and some of the scenes overlong especially the scenes of dunkirk i wondered if the director lingered on them to show off the expensive shots of the thousands of extras ultimately it may be impossible to portray in a film many of the aspects of mcewans novel especially brionys stories suggesting not only her own moral and professional growth but the growth of fiction throughout the last century keeps most of the spirit of mcewans novel until the closing scenes aside from the hurried coda we both thought it was too sentimental and clichd not only to close with a sequence of robbie and cecilia frolicking on the beach in front of the cottage they never shared in true life but to set the cottage in front of the white cliffs of dover,sad
i went to see this film last night i had high expectations because it has received an extremely high vote average on the imdb coupled to that i have read a couple of ian mcewan novels the cement garden and the comfort of strangers both novels are exquisite and mcewan is a total master of fiction the comfort of strangers was a bruising read and the cement garden was incredibly trenchant and reminded me of my own upbringing so i had some doubts about whether his intensity could be brought to screen although the film of cement garden is rather good i did actually groan when i saw in the first credits that the film was a working title production because although i know they have a good reputation generally speaking i hate their stuff far too glossy and blandthe first shot was very promising a dolls house trompe a loeil and exquisitely arranged toys the camera pans from the house to the troupe of toy soldiers and plastic bestiary which taper towards a desk where we see the precocious stripling briony typing out the last words of her first play the uncanny organisation of the toys is a powerful indication of the girls state of mind both fanciful and controlling a coup de maitre worthy of mcewan then there is a soundtrack where the main instrument is a typewriter a very bold strategem indeed as in my opinion cinema needs to distance itself from literature but entirely successfulfrom there the level of directorial virtuosity declines rather rapidly we see that a vat of money is used to substitute for creativity and the audience is meant to be wowed by painstaking and yet quite besidethepoint recreations of scenes from the war weve had all this with gangs of new york saving private ryan and other tepid masterpieces ad infinitum having said that there is actually a continuous shot of dunkirk in this film which lasts five minutes that i know will have even the most cynical of film watchers drooling it is as a character says like a scene from the bible i have seen a similar looking breughel print however the film is meant to be a love story and by god it does not convince me as one the love between cecilia and robbie is not properly established and most of the other characters are cardboard cutouts i felt the film could have been a lot longer to enable some character development the only fully fledged character is briony how i long for the days of billy wilder who established the journalistic character of chuck tatum in ace in the hole simply by having him strike a match on a typewriter in a very practised mannersome of the scenes in france during the fighting i am sure would work better in the novel in the film they are really a bit devoid of context finally the end of the film is a conceit that really failed to impress me and i wont give it away but the strikes me as very hollow i think this movie tries very hard to be an epic after the fashion of the english patient unfortunately it becomes rather tired and generic having said that the source material is of such a quality and the amount of money spent seemingly so vast that the film is very enjoyable but nowhere near a masterpiece,sad
this movie was an incredible waste of time money and gas i went in expecting a beautiful profound movie and left angry and disappointed the film began with great potential but after about 45 minutes it plummets into an unbelievable superficial and contrived story how could briony think that writing a happy ending for cecilia and robbie is any kind of i would have liked the film better if briony finally killed herself it was so much like titanic technically amazing with an awfully clich storyim shocked and annoyed that it was nominated for anything and that it won a golden globe if it wins the oscar i will never trust the academy again,sad
i had been so excited to see since the first time i saw it advertised now that tonight i have finally been able to see it i have been left stunned and now it is all i can think about the romance between cecelia and robbieis amazing the chemistry that the two actors have together is captivating and every time they were together i felt pangs in my heart the two younger actresses who play as briony are amazing as i live in grimsby and i knew that one of the scenes is played in grimsby i wanted to look out for it but i was so captivated by the film that i completely forgot to look out for grimsby though i would be glad to see it again and this time i will try to tear my eyes away from the beauty of the scenery and acting and look out for grimsby though this film is a 15 certificate i begged my mum to buy me tickets as i am only 14 all i can say is this film is beautiful and will have you crying im sure of it,sad
this movie is simply god awful this is exactly what is wrong with cinema and many of the films that are recognized to be worthy of movie award consideration there is absolutely no subtlety whatsoever and instead the viewer is pummeled by sappy dialogue a pomposity of music and of course the carefully crafted yet oft used torrid love scene in a library as books collapse and the walls of passion come crumbling down there are very few original perspectives on a love story in this movie instead we are subjected to keira knightly pouting her lips in the mirror in the beginning of the movie calling on her wealth of acting experience from designer makeup adsits the same formula that seems to always garner attention from both the viewing public and the people that vote for awards a woman falls in love with a man of virtue from a different caste of society then her feels guilty for doing so and therefore dismisses the man then admits to her love and confirms at physically whilst being made love to against a bookcase gets separated by a war and living for the chance to see her man again and having more library sex oh yeah and throw in the tragedy of keira knightly drifting to the bottom of the sea and you almost have the making of titanic part ii once again the viewing public is duped into succumbing to the carefully crafted yet completely inauthentic hollywood love story,sad
every scene seemed to be set up with an eye to gaining an award for cinematography and all failed miserably whereas a film like hero really delivers the dunkirk scene was the most stylized unreal and boringly looooong part of the film and all the london street scenes looked like inaccurate sets so many pregnant pauses it could have had sextuplets a waste of great actresses like brenda blethyn and harriet walter unfortunately this film has got the critics eye and will no doubt clean up at the awards another travesty interestingly nearly half the people who commented on this film hated it despite its high score,sad
the main thing i need to enjoy a movie is to like one or more of the characters i disliked every single person portrayed in this useless and empty film none of them had anything redeeming about their personalities or purpose in life a good story helps too which sadly lacked my wife and i suffered through hoping somehow a good ending would make up for a depressing bummer of a movie we were sorely let downtherethats my 10 lines for imdb this movie doesnt deserve any more description than this wish id read the other comments many of which are scholarly in their depiction of inaccuracies about the historical era oh yeah did i remember to say never trust the academy,sad
when i see the trailer i expect it to be something like very long engagement after i see it only thing i want to say is what a ridiculous story at the end the old lady said i want to give them their happiness what a nonsense is it the so called the war and the sacrifice seems mean nothing compare to her the only purpose is ripping her chance of saying sorry the title should be hypocrisy instead of the way of telling story is also stupid the repeating of go back and forward trick did the director think it is clever it is just annoying i feel sorry for the 3 house i wasted,sad
answer ablebodied robbie would doubtless have found himself in the army anyway and at the front even sooner and that is what makes this contrived story ring so false that and even worse stupiditythe fact is far from causing robbies death the false testimony of young briony would actually have saved his life if hed opted to stay safely in prison where he could have fought his conviction perhaps even persuading her to recant after she had apparently matured into an empathic adult shes a war nurse instead he enlists in the army only to croak at dunkirk exactly one one day before the evacuation because god forbid this overreaching melodrama leaves any tears unjerkedoh and by the way since brionys sister cecilia dies in the blitz it isnt as if sis and robbie were going to be reunited anywayand another thing i loathed this movie are you getting that maybe i missed it but at any point does briony attempt to clear robbies name her book doesntits fiction not memoir to her way of thinking of course its probably a question of why bother since robbie is so conveniently dead and id be the only one who suffersselfish and vain as a child briony is guilty of causing robbies imprisonment but as bad as that misdeed was it was the act of a juvenile and the tragedies that ensue have more to do with poor adult responses and a little thing called world war ii than with a selfcentered little girl her real sins the chronic faults she takes into adulthood are egocentricity and opportunism she capitalizes on her juvenile lie by exploiting the story as a novel yet again falsifying facts this time to give the lovers a happy ending its so much easier after all to apologize in fiction rather than in reality she manages to keep the spotlight on herself throughout of course and eventually turns into vanessa redgrave on a book tour the end thank godtheres none in this movie but plenty is owed by director wright screenwriter hampton and especially by the phenomenally overrated novelist ian mcewan,sad
i think if i hear one more comment about being an outstanding movie i might just hurl considering i saw comments before the movie saying things like one of the greatest love stories of all time and heartwrenching or a true masterpiece ill admit i was expecting something wonderful my expectations were high and i was very excited as i sat in the theater before the movie began i had been told that it would be as good as the notebook and it would make me cry repeatedly this just added to my anticipation the movie started off slow it was okay though movies that i love have started off slow so i was not going to be quick to judge however the movie continued for the next 45 minutes to be boring and quick frankly about nothing as i looked around the theater i saw many people looking calmly at the screen or glancing around a few even text messaging on their phones it was an hour into the movie i decided i could not handle anymore and went to get a refill of popcorn when i came back and asked what i had missed after being gone for about 10 minutes i decided i needed to use the bathroom and make a phone call while i was out there my friend stated uh wellnothing actually wow i thought that is so surprising since so much has been happening this entire movie when they movie finally and thankfully ended i sat there a little confused i thought it was supposed to be a story about love the love in saw iv was greater no looked sad as they walked out of the theater no one looked thrilled after seeing such a marvelous movie everyone just walked out and no one spoke i finally reached my car and asked what everyone thought the responses were all the same well it was okay i supposei mean it wasnt really about love or really about anything except war so i would rather go and see norbit 10 times in a row before i saw this movie again if wins anymore awards or praise i am going to scream i would recommend seeing anything but this movie if you have the choice,sad
reminds me of scorceses gangs of new york in that the director felt compelled to insert a second story into the main narrative in gangs theres a whole sequence about the new york draft riots which is completely superfluous tacked on at the end simply because the director was enamored with a particular interesting piece of history similarly in were treated to a glimpse of the british army retreat at dunkirk which is brilliantly photographed and reminds one of a scene from hell in a hieronymus bosch painting despite the dunkirk scenes artfulness its all padding and it needs to be there because without it would be little more than a specious melodrama about the evils of the british aristocracy the first hour of is interminably long the viewer soon discovers theres very little intellectual substance to this tawdry tale in a nutshell briony a 13 year old girl in an upper class family becomes jealous of her sister who has suddenly become intimate with robbie the housekeepers son who lives on their estate briony is the brit version of the bad seed but we never really find out what motivates her except for a schoolgirl crush and some unexplained revulsion toward adult sexuality oh my upper crust 13 year old snob is just so incredibly repulsed by witnessing her older sister and the housekeepers son having sex in the library speaking of that library scene do you really believe that cecilia and robbie would have sex in the library where anyone could just walk in on them and what about the crude note robbie gives to briony to give to her sister if he loved her so much why did he even think of writing that note in the first place and why would he entrust it to briony who he could have easily guessed would have looked at itworse than these plot contrivances is the accusation of rape that lands robbie in jail notice how cecilia hardly sticks up for robbie at all as hes hauled away by the police wouldnt she have put up a bigger fight or was the whole point that she was cowed by her snobby family the investigation into the rape lasts about 3 minutes on screen in real life many people would have been questioned and various suspects and angles would have been pursued theres none of that here since must fit the classic melodramatic moldan innocent lover victim robbie is broken by bad seed victimizer briony at least there is an antagonistfor awhilebut briony then disappears until the end of the movie only to reappear in the imagination of a now elderly briony who is working on her 21st and last novel the now reinvented briony is a nurse who opts not to go to cambridge and attempts to atone for her sins by throwing herself into the war effort and the elderly briony somehow atones for her indiscretion by creating a fictional denouement the 18 year old briony apologizes to robbie and allows the starcrossed lovers to live out their lives in a picture postcard world at the seashore this clashes with the not so surprising true ending revealed to us by briony the novelist that robbie died at dunkirk and her sister was killed during the blitzgets high marks for atmosphere and mood it has some very nifty cinematography and the music enhances the dramatic encounters the characters here are onedimensional in that the upperclass brits are petty despots the children reflect the parents hostility and the working class are hapless victims exemplified by robbie and his mother becomes another movie in the second half and overall sports two antagonists the bad seed is replaced by the horrors of war is an empty vessel dont be fooled by all the bells and whistles,sad
as a thirteen year old girl briony tallis has a passion and creativity that sees her channel her energy into writing novels and plays her upper class family live is happy and privileged however a late night search for two of her young cousins who have gone off by themselves sees briony stumble across her other young cousin being raped briony identifies the attacker as robbie turner the young working class man taken in by her family who is also the new lover of elder sister cecilia in one night this accusation rips the family apart shattering lives perhaps irreparablyi wasnt sure what to expect from never having read the book or really knowing much about the story as a result i found the film to be a rather sumptuous and engaging watch but yet at the same time to be quite unsatisfying in regards the emotional content which i imagine the book must do much better i imagine this for the simple reason that the film alludes to it and that the book has significantly more time to deliver in this regard the thing for me is and ill jump right into the spoilers here the film didnt develop and engage me enough for the story to hurt and the ending to crush i didnt long for robbie and cecilia as much as i should have done and as a result i found myself watching the story rather than feeling it the emotional impact of the ending is undercut by this as well without the hurt or anger in the viewer at the news that any happiness in their lives was a complete fantasy comes as a twist more than a punch the presentation of this twist is also not perfect because for me it came over like it was giving briony a way of finding her own forgiveness it is a false though and one given to her by herself to the benefit of nobody else this sense of pointlessness and loss is not followed through on though and instead we get another false scene of happiness that seems to be suggesting that briony has ultimately done the right thing whereas i felt that she could never have for what she did whether i wanted her to or noti might be reading too much into it but that was what i thought and i didnt think that the film delivered that well enough that said the story is still engaging and solid the jumping around within time structure worked surprisingly well and it did hold my interest easily what makes the film though is the delivery which is classy and professional in almost all regards the sets and costumes hit you first because it is very well located and framed you can feel the heat and relaxed air of the meadow the stiffness of the dining room and so on it looks and feels perfect for period and place some will feel that that the typically english stiffness is a barrier to the film but i did not the soundtrack is worth noting as well as it builds in the typewriter sound so well that it is present but yet unobtrusive wrights direction is excellent and the many touches he employs makes this stand out from being another english period piece i liked the fades to black in the backgrounds and some other character framing shots that did keep the literary feel of course the money shot is the onetake around the crowded beach  an impressive shot from a technical point of view and a real pleasure to watchthe cast is the final area of delivery and of course the running time of the film and the requirements to hook the audience put a lot of pressure on them i felt that mcavoy stood up to this pressure well and delivers a convincing and heartfelt performance throughout making me care for his character knightley is not as good but she is not pirates of the caribbean either i never felt for her or the pain she carries but yet at other times she is good  the love scene being the most convincing and another really well delivered scene as well ronan is the best of the briony actresses i thought that garai didnt give much away partly because she is having to play a character as written by that character and redgrave although a strong presence was treated too well by the film in my opinionoverall though this is a really well made film that has class dripping from the stylish direction the score the set and the performances to name a few the emotional impact is surprisingly not what it should have been and i thought that the ending was disappointingly touched with hope and forgiveness that i thought was illfitting,sad
unnecessarily confusing and poorly structured even though it had to have flashbacks for its rashomonlike storytelling this decades trend away from the chronological seems designed to hide flaws the films plot is really fairly simple so the director and editor had to give far too much screentime to certain scenes in an attempt to gloss over this fact cinematography over substance for example the scene when mcavoys character is struggling to find the right words while typing his apology which is interspersed with knightleys endless smoking is excruciatingly slow instead of spending so much time with this point how about letting us in on how his character received the wound to his chest also while the dunkirk sequence is an impressive technical accomplishment it drags on almost dizzyingly and seems as if it were designed to lend a more serious subtext to the otherwise flimsy story along these lines the filmmakers felt it necessary to add gratuitous hospital shots of the war wounded and earlier used that most horrible word in the world of course you have to credit them for using vanessa redgrave in the titaniclike gloria stuart denouement which wraps the whole thing in a prettier package than its contents,sad
at the outset i will state that i did not like the novel on which this movie is based its not that i dont like the work of ian macewan  i loved saturday  but to my dread the novel which i thought shallow to begin with was made into an even shallower moviei wasnt going to bother seeing it at all but did on the recommendations of many friends who literally raved about it particularly the scenes of the war and old londonthere was literally no chemistry between the two leads and the direction of lunge and thrust in a key love scene repels rather than engages i find keira knightly affected in the extreme her pouty lips and chopped off sentences did not engage sympathy she seemed alienated from everyonei was in a small mature audience at the screening and there was a lot of laughter at what should have been emotional scenes which again detracted from any investment in the film itselfthe story is clich ridden and i thought several times it would have done better in more sensitive hands i found the direction choppy and frantic the timeline moves back and forth with no valid reasoning behind it apart from fooling the audiencethe war scenes are well done and would have worked better in another movie entirely i found them ghostly and surreal particularly the singing the shooting of the horses etci beg the question why are so many nominated movies so dismally awful this year i found completely overrated there was literally no sublety in a movie that begged for it and the characters were all distant not one of them got my sympathy possibly it might have worked a lot better as a miniseries the time frame of the film itself was too short to explore the back story of each key character and particularly the key feature of the love between ce and robbie was it simply lust the basic story revolved around briony saoirse ronan who is that beloved child of british movies  a precocious pretentious selfabsorbed writer she reads a letter sent by the medical student son robby james mcavoy of the family housekeeper to brionys older sister cecilia keira knightley subsequently she witnesses scenes between them and a scene between a houseguest and a young girl and invents a story that puts the kybosh on the blossoming romance and sends our hero to jail and then off to warsome of the more mawkish scenes involve his attempts to reunite with cecilia cecilia meanwhile keeps her passion intact by abandoning her family to work as a waitress and waiting patiently for robbythere it is i wont spoil the rest suffice to say it is a melodrama of a type of movie that were best done in the 1920s but best left alone in the twenty first century2 out of 10,sad
despite excellent casting and powerful acting by lead actors knightly and mcavoy this movie is held back by bad direction and screenplaymany scenes drag on seemingly without purpose at the expense of detail and backstory we get too little of the dreadful confectionery king marshall the perfect villain if ever there was one we get nothing of robbies time in prison we get almost nothing of robbies background and the class strugglethe musical score with the exception of a few golden moments like the grandfather clock ticking in the background during the library scene is overbearing and poorly directed and after a while becomes frankly annoyingthe films critical flaw however is that briony is profoundly uninteresting her feelings are ersatz and officious making her gestures meaningless during brionys confrontation with cecile and bobbie the film almost redeems itself by exposing brionys childishness and the inadequacy of her remorse which could have been followed by an unadventurous but serviceable fade to black and drinks for the weary audience  many many drinkssadly that is not what happens instead in a final outrageous act of betrayal after what feels like hours and hours of agonizingly smeared out long shots the viewer is summarily informed that the precious few scenes of dramatic interest were in fact figments of brionys guilty imaginationthen the movie wraps up with an embarrassing scene showing robbie and cecilia at the beach this is brionys fanciful way of saying sorry a beautifully rendered crocodile tear,sad
i am truly baffled at the media salivating over this movie sure it is well shot the dunkirk continuous shot at magic hour was amazing and conveyed a great sense of madness well acted and well designed and scored it had a nice old fashioned almost leanesque feel to it however for a movie it is not well written taking forever to get going it requires a bit of patience at the start however my main gripe with the film is something else when the one character that goes through the greatest amount of change remains off screen for most of the movie it doesnt leave room for engaging character development in addition to this to have the only actions on the part of that character turn out to be false results in us feeling that no change occurred whatsoever but that is the point  she never had the courage i dont buy that and am certainly not impressed by the fact that i was told a lie i felt cheated and let down as a viewer i imagine this overrated film will be forgotten about in a year or so it is certainly no classic,sad
dont make the mistake of thinking that this movie is a twistycurvy tightly plotted suspense thriller on the order of notes on a scandal instead of a plot that takes plausible but largely unforeseeable left turnss story is obvious too blunt and crackling with clich everything from the haphazard direction and editing to the numb acting is a bit of an embarrassment to all involvedwildly overrated is closer in style and scope to a merchantivory film so if thats your cup of tea you might like this one a little more than i did but its more like the dimwitted heldbackinschool bastard child of such films because although it contains all the proper hoitytoity attitude and pretty costumery it has none of the subtlety or charm  in short the characters are all largely unsympathetic giving the audience no one to root for this isnt always a deal breaker for me but when the characters are dull vapid vacuous space takers it does sort of put a damper on thingsat age 13 briony saoirse ronan is a pretentious selfpossessed newbie writer shes supposed to be a child prodigy of sorts but she seems more perfunctory than imaginative to be sure we dont get much of a glimpse of her writing efforts at that age its merely implied how great she is she harbors a crush on the handsome strapping son james mcavoy of her wealthy familys housekeeper who has long had eyes for brionys older sister cecilia keira knightley on a hot summer day briony illicitly reads a note from robbie mcavoy intended for cecilia gasp and then later sees something she shouldnt have subsequently the girl swears to seeing something she definitely didnt see her perspective colored by her feelings for robbie and her interception of the note this irrevocably alters the lives of all three of coursethe movie jumps around quite a bit timewise which at one point was an interesting approach to filmmaking but more often than not nowadays seems sort of played out and unnecessary here its done to confuse the audience a little bit some trickery thrown in to distract from the fact that the plot itself is fairly bland and melodramatic because of brionys misinterpretation robbie winds up in prison and later in the military fighting in ww ii much of the film describes his attempts to get back to london to be with cecilia cecilia meanwhile works as a waitress  a job thats a bit lower than her familys station should allow briony forgoes attending an exclusive writing academy and becomes a nurse all owing to her guilt not to mention her obstinacybut what does it all mean that one persons sworn testimony can screw up the lives of somewhatinnocent people oh theres news in the end it all feels like much ado about nothing has briony truly atoned for her sin of course not she didnt have the guts to say anything when she had the power to do so to make herself feel better she writes a novel over the course of the rest of her life so no real just a general sense of comfort and insincere assuaging of guilti think thats the crux of the issue here  the movie feels insincere are robbie and cecilia madly in love or do they just want to have hot sex all the time little in the early half of the movie indicates the former and plenty of evidence is shown for the latter but even if they are in love well here is where the issue of what the movie is crops up this is not a psychological thriller its a dopey romance movie its a chick flick even with some truly garish and probably unnecessary war scenes do we really need to see burn victims how does this further the plot the script is even based on a romance novel by ian mcewan if pining for lost loves sounds like a grand old time to you by all means dive into this murky tortured movieas for the casting its not terrible knightley who has said she wants to play more mature roles continues to look like a tall bugeyed boy with her shapeless bony figure shes not a bad actress but she might have been a little in over her depth here at no point did i feel sympathy toward cecilia although shes supposed to be a victim here mcavoy the last king of scotland looks a little more girlish here than knightley does what with his impossibly red lips even in the war scenesso if youre expecting a thickplotted twisty thriller about what happens when a lie spirals out of control this is not the movie for you if you like costume dramas with actors rising to their material this is also not the movie for you if you like love stories with no apparent happy ending and actors sinking to melodramatic depths this is a winner,sad
the whole story evolves around a freakish petty little lie of a jealous cowardly and spoiled 13 year old girl that costed 2 peoples happiness the end im not sure if im watching the same movie that got everybody praising about theres no bigger meaning no redemption no resolution no moral high ground and certainly no instead it made me feel rather cheap and ridiculous the character is rather spiteful and cowardly as she eventually admitted in the endi really dont mind watching a movie that reveals the ugly side of humanity as long as its done in a honest and proper way the problem with this movie is that the story and character is so petty but the music score and cinemaphotography makes you feel like you are watching an epic tale it ended up rather strange and disconnectedit is the epitome of english hypocrisy petty dishonest self indulgent and meaningless the whole thing has nothing to do with the second world war it was thrown in there in a desperate attempt to rub a little bit meaningfulness off the war but since the premise is so petty ugly meaningless and unnecessary it appears rather awkward everything is cheapened incuding the war i would rather go to the extend that it perverted the sacrifice of those who died fighthing the war remember the whole story centers around a jealous 13 year old girl who try to destroy the man she couldnt get because he loves her sister it is eventually a rather perverted little drama that built off such petty intention it never reached any moral high ground,sad
well i guess you have to be catholic to get anything out of this complete pile of rubbish the whole premise of the story and presumably the book is absolute cow dung child of 13 misreads what she sees witnesses two couples having sex and rather than reveal the truth about her purportedly innocent under age friend implicates her real love interest akajealous obsessionin a crime in which her aforementioned innocent friend is a willing player who are we supposed to be empathising with the now old woman who tells us she is dying oh yeah  shes a story tellerso shes written a novel based on her real life experience  except that shes incorporated a little tidy up where the two victims in this story get something they never even got close to experiencing  ie a time of true intimacy so its a novel not an autobiography on this basis is it if youve read this far and think im being too harsh  well i havent started on the stupid errors in the filming yet if you want to waste some of your life watching this tripe watch out for the empty war time buses unbelievable the crepe bandage stuck straight onto the head wound of a soldier in the hospital and all the other over drawn out and idiotic cinematic effects this is complete and utter tripe and should be consigned to obscurity as soon as possible,sad
i have rarely complained about specific reviews  however through utter astonishment at reading empires helen oharas recent verdict of as being a masterpiece is she on the books of british film incorporated   including comments such as near faultless performances  complex devastating and best picture  her credibility as a quality reviewer of film has been severely damaged by this overtly patriotic analysis  i was expecting to see something between lawrence of arabia and the english patient and was given a beautifully shot lynda la plante tv drama  was so disappointed  and like most of the cinemas whispers on the verge of walking out this snobbish middle brow drama  basically all dramatic tension is lost in the second act when the action moves to the bigger canvas of the war in france  james mcevoys accent failed and his presence weakened any scene and where does one start with ikea knightley  shocking is it possible empire can ask helen to take off her  english rose tinted spectacles and read a proper and accurate review of this tosh by cosmo landesmans cutting and on the ball review in the sunday times ,sad
this was the worst waste of my time i have experienced in many years theres just one thing to say boring boring boring boringtotally meaningless waste of time and to make it a 2 hours movie is torture on a new level whoever is responsible for this trash   and after enduring the horrific experience it even has a sad ending whats the point wtf is that all about and now this page tells me i have to write 10 lines to be able to express my disgust for this so called movie on these pages the torture never ends shere is a fool explaining his thoughts well from the trailers i could tell this would be an epic film before i was even able to see it what a crock,sad
i dont believe it indeed im amazed this movie is actually good a hollywood romance movie that is actually watchable amazing shocking refreshing i was expecting the usual hollywood potboiler garbage  inane love story major historical events being reduced to mere cinematic footnotes laughable acting ludicrous miscasting etc in other words i was expecting a piece of junk but thankfully my expectations were not met this is a powerful movie with a compelling story and excellent acting if i cant bring myself to rag this movie then this movie has to be good as a movie buff who has critiqued scores of movies ive watched some major cinematic clunkers stuff that doesnt even merit a dvd cinematic flotsam that are a joke this movie however is a work of art and warrants whatever commendations it gets from the public,sad
the absolute proof that movie awards are just another form of commercials for movies that would otherwise leave the distributors with a loss i was so bored i tended to fast forward through all the filler my wife who loves sappy movies would encourage me to fast forward faster the real story was only about 15 minutes long this is the worst movie ever made slow boring and had a dumb ending i rented it on the reviews of other posted here so i thought i would worn the rest of you to stay away from this ridiculous mockery of a love story if you are interested in this movie just read any synopsis written about this movie it will leave you more content and happy then to actually rent and watch this crap i am completely angry that i had to spend 99 cents to rent this horrible attempt at a movie,sad
from the beginning of this film to the end there is no consistencyi would love to make millions of comments about how bad this film is and why it is so using words like narrative cliche  heavyhanded badlycast fanservice but i dont need to use any of them this movie is a misery to watch the music is awful and inappropriate there are only two reasons that make the sheep in all of us enjoy this film 1 they have read the book and actually know the story beforehand turning the film into a series of visually pleasing memories from the novel they already know the characters and the relationships and bring them to the film because the film certainly does not bring them to the viewer 2 they enjoy feeling miserable because their lives are so easy that any kind of struggle including watching horrible bad films adds some variety and difference to their life however most people cant tell the difference between an emotionally sad story and an emotionally sad filmwatching experience i was sad during this film because it is a bad film so if you liked babel and hard candy then you should enjoy this film if you dont like rubbish then avoid this piece of trash with all of your powers,sad
i was looking forward to this given the splendid reviews and having read ian mcewans book not my favourite mcewan but he is one of my favourite authors however i found the reality largely tedious maybe this was because it dealt with unfamiliar emotions and unsympathetic characters the big house atmosphere was dealt with competently but the dunkirk beach and town scenes just didnt flow in the latter one bit part actor after another was clearly waiting just off shot to do his bit which was funny but didnt do anything for the credibility of the moviein factthe clichs and cockney accents and the turgid nature of the scene setting were all ingredients for a poor comedy  a whitehall farce perhaps maybe thats what it was meant to be  on reflection it was probably too true to the original novel which as i said isnt one of my favourites a rare example of where tweaking could have improved the original story to enhance the watchers enjoyment,sad
i decided to see when i saw its trailer nice shots life in england just before ww2 an interesting human drama etc i began to worry a little bit when i heard a critic say that it is in the english patient territory  a film i deeply disliked  and worried even more when i read comments saying that would be a strong candidate for an oscar since oscars are awards given on the basis of the commercial success of films instead of their artistic meritsmy worst fears were confirmed is a pretentious but ultimately vacuous film it reminded me of that famous line he didnt say anything but he said it so beautifully it is very well shot the actors are decent  if a little bit wooden  the locations magnificent and its basic plot is fine but it never involves you i found myself yawning making shopping lists in my head and wondering what time it wasthe plot without giving away anything important not that there is anything much to give away the film turns around a13year old girl who through a mixture of naivet and jealousy ruins the life of a young man and many years later tries to make amends for it it takes place in the late 30s and the 13year old girl is one of the daughters of an upper middle class wealthy family beautiful country house gardens servants the whole british clich the boy whose life is ruined is the son of one of the caretakers but hes been taken under the wing of the family has gone to good schools and is planning to study medicine at cambridge which means he knows how to wear a dinner jacket when hes not carrying suitcases for weekend visitorsthe problem is that the movie tries to be arty while having mass appeal it uses quite a few fashionable tricks such as an unorthodox sound track lots of typing noises high volume sound effects and long artistic tracking shots it never manages to involve spectators in the events that it describes and ultimately its but a pretentious and shallow attempt to describe the way some people lived in england at the time uninteresting boring and fake or to quote the classics much ado about nothing,sad
the trailer for had me giddy with excitement i thought i was going to be in for a truly epic love story that spanned time distance war betrayal but what i got was this anemic pretentious nonepic slop the movies final nail in the coffin comes from the incredibly bad ending where the producers couldnt figure out if they wanted to give the audience a sad ending not even bittersweet or a happy one so they decide to give us both i just simply hated this film i place at the top of my worst films of 2007 list when the end credits rolled i stood up  shouted that was crap i still cant believe that this film got any award recognition i hated this film the trailer showed one thing then when you see the film it goes into a whole different direction this wasnt a love story by any means this was a story about people who lie that was it norhting more nothing less i love when critics have been calling this a romance film there wasnt any romance to be found i really really hated the main character of briony tallis come to think about it none of the characters in were really memorable or had any redeeming qualities im still trying to figure out how such great actors like christian bale can be bypassed for a golden globe or any other type of recognition but a piece of crap like gets wide spread acclaim none of the acting performances were wow im blown away by this it was like masterpiece theater on really bad drugs,sad
the movie portrayed far too much evil without so much as a hint of redemption it was hard enough to watch from the beginning but the ending left me feeling as if i had been crapped on the story line was monstrously sick and completely devoid of moral value giving it the title was deceptive a horrible attempt to pretend that evil can be given some other face that what it has there was nothing atoning about it and the viewer is violated almost as much as the characters in the movie i am appalled at the actors who agreed to do this and shocked that people think it worthy of awards it may well be the worst experience i have ever had in a theater no one should see this unless doing research on how stories can distort the meaning of important concepts,sad
you know what something must be very rotten in hollywood these days when the likes of michael clayton no country for old man and are getting nominations and awards unless there will be blood which i havent seen yet is the intelligent well directed epic i expect it to be i sure hope that the above mentioned averageatbest flicks will be deservingly dwarfed at this years oscars by the unlikely hero juno turned out to be now dont get me wrong i just love epic melodrama and im also a sucker for merchantivory and well anything that contains a halfdecent love story beautiful photography british and french landscapes and sexy british upper crust accents and yes i can even tolerate a bit of shallowness if the listedabove compensates in sufficient amounts but what really annoys me in any genre is blatant pretentiousness this film oozes egomania the direction is snobbish in a way that the director seems to be more interested in proving his ingenuity than in telling the story and truth be told theres not much story to tell after the interesting yet not less annoying first 45 minutes comes the stupidest waste of money i have seen in a long while the complicated 5 minute shot that everybodys heard about even before the movie came out  huge disappointment and you know what  hitchcocks been there spielbergs been there de palmas been there now if you have nothing new or interesting to say about it  get out or you can surely expect to be humiliated by your incompetence compared to the masters but no this director known only for the single stupider period piece than this one  the lousiest adaptation of pride and prejudice ever had huge appetites to satisfy and hence  we are served with a boring pretentious overly stylized shot of what a coast in wwii france never looked like and the disillusioning effect created by mcaavoy leaving the shot from time to time that should never happen if you expect your audience to be drawn in the movie and sympathize with the hero mccavoy is a great actor and we can surely expect great things from him in the future but hello will the industry get over keira knightly already that woman is no actress all she can do is pout her lips and strike a pose the supporting cast is better than the leads the photography is great music is just fine but at the end of the day who cares if you do a love story and fail to engage the audience fail to make them root for the couple in trouble you failed period we shouldnt reward movies for their redeeming qualities but as accomplishments as a whole go juno,sad
this film is possibly the worst film ive seen that reason is i had huge expectations and i almost fell asleep through the entire bloody thing europe has got to be kidding me when it says this movies a masterpiece throughout the entire film i was attempting to not fall asleep but hey people think this movie is real the war scene is totally staged and everyone seems to just stand around the main male lead james mcavoy has one facial expression its like hes keauna reeves except british keira knightley goes from hating him to fing in the library the little girl is annoying the war scene was supposed to be cool yet it was just them walking it ends with both leads dying this movie better not win a single acadamy award because of its ridiculous attempt to make a love story england has made some really good romance movies such as the english patient my recommendation see another movie this one sucks arse,sad
what is wrong with hollywood the oscars and the film festivals these days ill tell you politics won an oscar  for what its a film whose story leaves you angry and dissatisfied briony did in no way atone for her crime lie in fact she was rewarded by having her novels published and no doubt getting rich her punishment should have been abject poverty the rest of her life to be followed by deathanyone who liked this film has rocks in hisher head periodyou know i came out to la like so many other hopefuls to look for my chance in hollywood with my stories and scripts why bother this town is mostly blind to quality and good stories sure there are exceptions magnolia corny but very very well executed story american beauty amazing  kevin spacey what a performer legends of the fall beautifully shot acted story  everything about schmidt look people these are films with powerful messages that give us hope that are entertaining and not boring that shed light on our difficult human conditioni wouldnt waste my precious spittle on yuch get the point peace,sad
what a disappointment  what was the point of it all the characters were weak  and the choice of actors playing the parts did not help neither keira knightly nor james mcevoy had the stature to carry off their parts and neither could evoke any sympathy from the viewer briony came over as a spoilt brat  why did anyone believe her at all  and why was the aftermath of the accusation just glossed over the gap between the incident and the next time you saw the heroes only served to confuse one part of the film was a total farce  the scenes of the retreating soldiers in dunkirt with the fair rides singing soldiers in the bandstand drunkenness and scenes of apparent total confusion are contrary to any historical fact  what point was the film trying to make here  was it some antiwar message  if so it was in bad taste,sad
when the book was getting so much buzz i read it expecting great things what i was left with was a feeling of is that all it was an okay book even intriguing at times with a nice use of language and description but i felt it was a rather bloated overlong way to make what is essentially a simple point dont liethats probably why i didnt rush out to see the movie but with all the oscar buzz it was getting i figured why not what works well as slow in a novel doesnt necessarily translate well to screen at the same slow pacing a movie needs to have pacing character development something to hold attention this just didnt do it i thought the performances were just humdrum even keira knightley who has the ability to be so much better the actresses playing briony didnt accomplish much other than looking vaguely alike and we never really get an opportunity to understand the romance between cee and robbie it begins with a crude letter peaks with one hasty sexual encounter and then drops off into oblivionthe direction cinematography and musical score are all excellent and i could spend all day watching the beautiful costumes and scenery but i really found this movie merely mediocre overall i can usually tell after exiting a movie theatre whether a movie will be one that ill want to rewatch again and again i could instantly tell would be a oneshot deal,sad
the film is also technically superb the cinematography is outstanding with beautiful shot compositions on a hot summers day to a war torn france the most forefront achievement though is a scene that displays the english armys evacuation to dunkirk the scene which lasts close to ten minutes follows robbie through an entire beach front filled with hundreds of soldiers all of which is captured in a single shot it is truly an achievement as the scene is both harrowing and mesmerizing the musical score also deserves merits for its originality composed by dario marianelli the music incorporates key sound effects notably the type writer of brionys into musical themes it really is rather clever works very welleven with all of its technical mastery writing music editing cinematography the films strongest assets are from its performers the character of briony played by three actresses at different ages saoirse ronan romola garai and vanessa redgrave is acted to near perfection all three actresses especially 13 year old ronan bring their agame in represented a very complicated character keira knightley though really finds a role to sink her teeth into as this is by far her best performance cecilia who on paper may just seem like a supporting character is taken to the level of leading lady by miss knightley however the films strongest performance goes to james mcavoy as robbie most film fans will recognize him as mr tumnus from the chronicles of narnia but here he gets to show how good he really is his character of robbie represents the best in human nature and will draw the strongest connection with audiences mcavoy brings to him a sincerity that makes one of the strongest performances of the year mr mcavoy is quickly on his way to stardom and right sothis is a film that really works on every level the first act of the film is arguably the strongest the scenes at the country house have a great sense of realism and honesty to them you feel like you are there with the characters very hard to do in a period piece joe wrights masterful direction gives the sweep of an epic but the scope of a deep and personal character drama it is a brilliant and moving story that will pull at your heartstrings and leave you shaken by its ending dont be surprised to hear its name a lot come oscar time it is the best of the year,sad
i was deeply disappointed having forced myself through the whole length of this movie i should have left after the first boringtodeath 45 minutes the bitter lesson to be learned for me an excellent team joe wright as director and keira knightley as leading actress in pride and prejudice gives you no guarantee that their next movie is anything alike in qualitythere was no chemistry between keira knightley and james mcavoy worth mentioning like they were two strangers who are supposed to appear at the same scene to achieve this no acting required as robert mitchum used to say the narration of the whole story was erratic and the motives of the figures remained nebulous it is hard to find out what the whole story is about what the meaning of the figures action were hopefully the novel is better but i havent read it yet and in my opinion a movie shouldnt require the knowledge of the book in order to be understoodlast but not least i found it extremely embarrassing how the movie failed to connect its narration with the cruelties of the world war i couldnt help feeling that the war background was just abused as a picturesque stage to let james mcavoy stumble around,sad
i have to admit that it was hype and hype alone which encouraged me to go and see this movie for weeks every newspaper and tv show had reports and clips of how great the movie was also it was directed by the same man who did charles ii the power and the passion for bbc television and that is one of the best period dramas to be made in the last twenty years so off i went to the cinema with high expectations then reality set in there are three distinct parts to this movie the beginning which is too long the middle which is too abstract and the end which is too predictable and makes huge sections of the middle obsolete yes there is some fabulous cinematography and the performances are mannered and well directed but the story gets lost somewhere perhaps it just got buried beneath the mounds of pretentious camera work and overthetop attempts to create upper class british characters from the 1930s ive not read the novel so i cant comment on how good or bad an adaptation it is but as a piece of cinema it disappoints,sad
fails to deliver a compelling story it is plodding lacks direction and when it gathers momentum and manages to build tension it fritters it away the style gets in the way of storytelling theres no real antagonist and its not even a romance the romantic link between the robbie  cecilia is tenuous and their supposed attachment and subsequent angst feels since its left to the imagination contrivedit drags at the outset but eventually the characters become interesting and the relationships between them show promise though its still unclear what the movie is about the films jumping around in time and replaying of a scene from a second perspective largely feels like an imposition of style at the expense of story despite this through the first act of the movie there was enough potential that i still thought it might deliver a compelling dramaafter the first big turning point all the characters save the main three disappear cecilia is essentially abandoned as well as her experiences in the intervening four years are barely given lip service robbies story hints that he suffered in prison but we are never sure why since all we get is the last few days of his attempt to return home why do they want each other so badly how much have they been in touch why is robbie in such a hurry and what happens if he is late we are not told instead we are treated to an interminable montage on the beach at dunkirque pointlessly piling on the ambiance just in time for that storyline to endwhen the film finally rejoins the protagonist briany it is the most potentially poignant part of the film she has abandoned her personal ambitions and immersed herself in a life of service to try to atone for her lie and the damage it caused at least this is interesting since she is the least sympathetic of the three and even though we want her to earn redemption she only makes it part way but even this feels belabored and without direction she is remorseful and feels she cant ever suffer enough to atone yet there is no further interplay of the characters or deepening of their conflict the final chance for this is squandered when the three characters finally come together near the end and instead the story abruptly jumps 65 years into the future and the movie endsthis movie fails to convey what the characters lost as a result of brianys betrayal never gives us enough to understand how their three lives were ruined and hints at but never develops the potential for conflict between the three and tension surrounding brianys possible redemption of the three only brianys suffering is really captured i wanted to like it but ultimately it fails to tell the story in a compelling way and so it fails as a film,sad
atonment is once of my favourite novels and i was awaiting with anticipation to see the movie versioni did however have some reservations regarding the casting of kiera knightly as cecila and i have to say as always with knightleyshe looks pretty pouts a lot and doesnt really do very much apart from looking pensive and whispering in james mcnavoys earjames mcnavoy he portrays a moving and sensitive robbie and the audience can see the agony of war etched on his face as always he never fails to deliverthe film looks stunning the 4min scene of the utter devasation of dunkirk was moving the summer shots were also fantastic as well as london in the blitz however the plot just did not gell for methere were too many unnecessary long scenes which looked stunning but did not add anything to the film itself there were a number of scenes set in france which seemed to add nothing to the film and also some of brionys scenes in the hospital  am thinking of her scene with a dying french soldier just seemed to go on forever i wanted to see more of brionys guilt and the how the relationship between robbie and cecila affected the families and those around the threei found the first half of the film goodhowever for me it seemed to lose its way once the war starteddont get me wrong its a good film but i did look at my watch after the first hour i just did not seem to care about the characters all that muchit pains me to say it as i loved the booka beautifully shot filmnot a great film,sad
the first 45 minutes of this movie were quite good and after that it went downhill fast i loved the premise of a young girls lie bringing people to ruin so our movie starts with a young precocious girl named briony tallis spying on and envying her sister cecelia when cecelia takes up with the housekeepers son robbie briony catches them in the act which fuels her jealousy and sets the scene for briony to later accuse robbie of raping a young house guest what a web is spun driving these two lovers apart but you could see the cracks early on i did not altogether buy that these two love each other the only testimony to it was their speaking the words as they copulate against a bookcase not exactly the stuff of love no mention was ever made about the young girl who was raped until much later in the film she was an interesting character wise beyond her years but still just a girl i found her rape disturbing and it was completely swept under the rug our hero robbie is quickly carted off to jail and from there the story turns into a messonce robbie trades jail for war and the sisters tallis become nurses the whole plot is fantastical the dunkirk scene for me was a token war scene that allowed the director to paint a surreal portrait of war that makes no sense i couldnt decide what the hell i was watchingwas it the directors love for his waytoolong money shot or was it robbies hallucinations from his septicemia shooting horses soldiers riding a ferris wheel singing in a gazebo  utter nonsense and where on earth did the black british soldier come from at the end we learn through an elderly briony who has finished writing her novel that she has put her own spin on events because her sister and robbie both died during the war i realized the last hour and a half was a complete waste of time save the performance of vanessa redgrave which was superbdid robbie and cecilia really meet at the caf after he was released from jail who knows was there a house by the sea who knows did the lovers really keep in touch who knows did robbie wander the war torn french countryside with a cockney and a black man who knows how much of it was brionys version of events and how much of it happened who knows the pseudoartsy plot hopping was distracting and the lack of character development made it impossible to care what happened to any of these people the director opted for gruesome imagery to symbolize the potential outcome of lying  murdered school girls burned bodies shell shocked soldiers missing limbs and most interesting of all a two room flat next to a pig sty the ultimate depiction of how far an upper middle class girl has fallenthe director spends a good deal of time on the war when it would have been far more interesting to see how brionys lie changed her through the years did she testify against robbie at trial what were the parting words between her and her sister what did she do before she became a nurse how did she learn of her sisters death did she ever confront lola and paul the finest scene in the movie was briony sitting with the dying french soldier and this alone is why we should have seen more of brionys personal i hope the book is better,sad
crafted in britain by director joe wright tells the story of young author briony tallis who becomes jealous of her older sisters illicit love affair with a servant and with this she finds a love letter meant for cecilia her sister written by the servant robbie turner and misconstrues it as a letter written with sadisticperverted undertones when in reality it was a second draft that robbie deemed to silly to use briony assumes that robbie is a nymphomaniac and it is with this notion that she accuses robbie with the rape of her younger sister upon hearing this the tallis family has him arrested and he ends up in world war ii whilst cecilia winds ups being a nurse the rest of the movie revolves around robbie trying to find his way back to cecilia and also displays the cathartic process that briony faces upon reaching adolescence and realizing the lifechanging mistakes that she made is sort of stuck in the middle in regards to whether it renders primarily on emotion or story it is based on an ian mcewen novel so it does use some story elements in the latter segment of the film such as when the story falls into the warromancetype category the first half however feels highly easternoriented with wellplaced shots around staircases and through windows that draw us into the secret love affair that cecilia and robbie have undertaken the first part of the movie feels almost like a different film altogether it feels quite artsy in spots and a lot of shots do not help to push the story forward having only seen two of wrights films pride and prejudice being the other its hard to lump his style into being specifically east or west pride and prejudice had a lot of eastern elements in its use of detailed steady cam shots that follow its main characters around the sprawling english countryside also has this with an amazing 10minute long steady cam shot that follows robbie on a beach through the after effects of war the shot is so magnificent that you forget about the lack of cutting and you start to feel as if you can taste the acrid flavor of rusted steel on a battleship or the stolid stench of soldiers breath and spent bombs the shot is very well choreographed as well as we see literally hundreds of extras that weave in and out of frame each doing their own duty joe wright uses background action nicely to tell different stories of different people without even giving them lines just watch the steady shot as it follows robbie past a somberlooking band play a waltz or as he shoves into another soldier a very well executed shot indeed this shot does have an easternfeel to it as it does not push the story forward but focuses on allowing the audience to see through the eyes of the main character editor paul tohill does a great job as well his editing is never too fast paced but doesnt lag behind either when he splices he makes sure that we have enough time to fully incorporate ourselves within the basis of a shot again his lack of editing in the steady camera scene helps to reinforce this this can also be seen by assessing the scene that takes place near the end when briony has come back to apologize to cecilia and robbie his edits are now quick and slightly robust and help move the story along as we feel and see the tensionfilled apartment room the medium shot of robbie when he almost decks briony is tremendously powerful,sad
i felt compelled to write a review of this movie due its critical acclaim and raving reviews i disliked this movie in many ways not one of which was the ending the ending i felt was satisfying even beautiful in its own way what bothered me was the beginning i dont hate slow movies but i often felt this movie needed to have a little nudge and an okay get on with it besides the first hour being slow it left a horrible distaste in my mouth all it delivered was a typical smut story wrapped up in an elegant package a story that replaces love with lust and hopes it tricks the audience into believing its amore when i saw the vulgar letter i was shocked surely a man would not write such things about a woman he loved i saw her reaction and was absolutely disgusted i hate the word and believe me i dont hold back on expletives im no prude love scenes can be beautiful if the love story makes sense but this love scene was intensely awkward and unemotional sure they say i love you right before they start but that did little to appease the situation then it lasted for about thirty seconds too long making me want to return the popcorn id eaten back into the bag its not that it was grotesque they didnt show nudity or thrusting for that matter it was the situation that kept this from working while this was clearly supposed to be more it came off as a mere hookup in a fashion many porno movies have taken rich girl gets gardenerpool boy after gardener says something dirty love i think not you cant just have it in the script they are deeply in love this has to be shown and the movie does show it it just comes later on but the first instance of their relationship looks so loveless and trite that its hard to accept it after the factthe second half had some redeeming qualities and the cinematography was spectacular though keira knightley needs to put on about fifteen pounds lest her bones break through her skin if one forgets the first half and just starts the story where two young lovers are separated and neglects their the awkward beginning it helps but thats hard to do the story of brioney the aspiring author who sees the dangerous mistakes she made is a nice one and her attempt at redeeming herself is admirable and moving but it all gets to the root of the love story which didnt convince me of love at all turning what could have been a good movie into an overrated lust story that tried to make up for itself a little too late,sad
the trailers were interesting the star cast was stunning the reviews were fantastic the photography seemed perfect this all lead me to see the movie  despite the fact that my boss  when asked how is  after a 5 second pause  said ummeaning  not so goodthe story is set around the decade of world war ii briony tallis saoirse ronan jealous of her sister cecilia tallis keira knightley love affair with robbie turner james mcavoy accuses robbie of being a sexual perverse and raping her friend robbie is sent to prison and after 5 years sent to serve the army in wwii grown up briony romola garai serving as a nurse despairs her lies and as part of apologies to robbie and sister cecilia but it is too late for cecilia and robbie to unitethe movie is based on the popular novel written by ian mcewan by the same name the adaptation is synched in four parts  the first part of summer where briony falsely accuses robbie the second part of wwii  robbie serving the army the third part of nursing  and of briony and the fourth and final part of brionys interview of the autobiographical novelthe first part winds up slowly  as slowly as the british rural summers it is wonderfully shot and as audience one gets the feel of the real summer this part is the most interesting because of the romance between robbie and cecilia the army part of heavily funded and created but is loose and does not build up the interest while the nursing part is slowly unwinding of the mind of briony who recognizes and waits for heri liked the first part the most james mcavoy is the best thing in the movie he brings to himself  so easily the boyish charm and the vulnerability of an accused man that his performance is worth noticing one more cap after the last king of scotland keira knightley has acted very well but what on earth she has become like a walking stick  just bone and sticking flesh uhwhat the world has come to be defining her as the most sexiest and beautiful women people must be really mad and out of their mindsthe role of briony was the strongest and is the 13 year old saoirse ronan renders with great punch and epoch while the grown up role by romola garai  even though having depth does not touch you or does not even leave an impression a lot remained in the part three of the moviethe best parts of the movie were the cinematography by seamus greenwood and the musical score by dario marianelli which was near to brilliant  especially the type writers strokes and that turning into music with a slight synch with the characters tap of fingers or crossing of door brilliant but overall movie experience it leaves a lot more to be desired director jeo wright could have made it a much better movie with the amount of talent and money available to him jeo was too detailed in dwelling into the era of three parts and missed out on the gripping narrationa chance of good movie lost but not that badstars 55 out of 10,sad
after being one of the privileged few that got to see the movie at its gala performance last night 23rd aug  being an extra i can recommend going to see this film when its out on general release both keira knightley  james mcevoy seem to bring the film to life both playing excellent roles well directed by joe wright as would be expected although the local scenes redcar are only a few minutes it really brought out the spirit of dunkirk it takes some following but if youve read the book by ian mcewan it makes it much easier to follow the 3 brionys all play wonderful parts  the difference between the 2 younger actresses is difficult to spot vanessa redgrave as usual finishes off the film wonderfully with a twist which isnt expected unless youve read the book hope you all enjoy it as much as i did,sad
spoilersthe movie takes place just before wwii breaks out wwii was horrible hitler the holocaust lots of innocent people died my god we can all agree that it was a really bad thing so y in the hell would these idiots write another sad story on top of all the horribleness going on around them if cecilia  robbie had a happy as happy as u can get during this time ending the movie would have been actually good but when they both die it just makes the whole thing pointlessthe movie starts in a confusing way we r following a little girl we have no set up who is she why should i care i hate movies that keep facts from us 2 build mystery its only a mystery if u already told us all the facts and we have not figured it outthis little girl misinterprets events as sinister her sister cecelia was having an argument with this robbie guy she jumped in a fountain  robbie stared at her okay how can this b sinister the lovemaking scene in the library how can this girl think this was rape cecelia was not fighting him screaming nothing these nonsense making scenes r shown 2 ways in order 2 explain y this little girl thinks something bad happened i wish ricky ricardo was present 2 say uve got some splaning 2 doalso the library scene drove me crazy this house is shown 2 us at the start of the movie with briony running though it from this we know that it has many rooms rooms with beds in them rooms with locks on the doors but what room do they choose the library a place where ppl converge frequently  they left the door ajar what the  these 2 ppl know that there r small children in this house so ud think they would think what if they walked in no no they just seem 2 b complete idiots when watching this particular scene i thought y did they not choose another room when u have wild crazy b00m b00m time  leave the door open someone will c u duhso then this little girl thinks she saw robbie rpe the other little girl  robbie gets shipped off 2 war cecelia does little 2 save him ok this is supposed 2 b a romance movie hmm cecelia does not seem 2 care much when all she says in defense of robbie is i would not put much stock in what she says she has a wild imagination something like that not even hysterically she says it not even halfheartedly but with indifference indifference sarcasmwow it must b lovesarcasm cecelia seems 2 half believe what briony is saying how can u 3 someone  even think that they r capable of such evil or how little do u know themi believe what the other reviewers said that this was not a romance movie but just an excuse 2 get certain shots the backdrop was pretty the outfits were very beautiful especially cecelias green dress the point is is that its an empty movieits so pointless cuz its just senseless there is no lesson 2 b learned  most importantly no u ruined 2 peoples lives  u became a best selling author thats writing a fictional happy ending wtf its like saying i shot a bunch of innocent people but i made a painting of them all happy  smiling that should make it alright wow just wow i did not know that u could cram this much ignorance in2 1 movieanyway u slice it its just pointless what if briony had not been jealous cuz how can briony even 3 robbie if she is ok with him suffering  did not say robbie raped that little girl war would have still broken out would robbie b in medical school would that have saved him from fighting not sure on british law at the time but if there was a draft then he would have been screwed either way what about cecelia would she not have bcome a nurse 2 help out  b evacuated 2 the place where she drowned whats the point of it all at the end briony said that she gave them the time they so desperately wanted how much time was that cecelia  robbie both admit that they wasted a lot of time 2 so what they could of had a couple of years of good times  then die horrible deaths is that all time thats all these 2 could have at best wow how depressing,sad
i too had the misfortune of wasting what could have been perfectly lovely sunday afternoon doing anything other than sitting in a darkened room with another 100 odd poor souls  wash the car weed the bbq worm the cat but id suggest you do anything but watch this movie and boys even if youre on a promise id avoid accompanying herthis film was dull to the point of clock watching  the mid 50s couple next to me actually did the sensible thing and walked out which given the most impressive cast list was such a waste the performers bless them acted their socks off and did as much justice as was possible to a truly dreadful script whilst the cinematography and locations were impressive enough sympathetically chosen and splendid in their period feel but what really let the whole thing down was the disjointed direction and the constant leaping back and forth along the timeline the whole dunkirk scene was overly long and was vastly exaggerated than in the original book it was almost as if it had been left in there because they had already spent the money so it would have been a shame to leave it on the cutting room flooras i mentioned before it was such a let down after having had all the ingredients to make it into yet another fantastic brit flick a cast to die for how wasteful to only include brenda blethyn for 23 very short scenes a magnificent story and stunning locations  working title you wasted a glorious opportunity,sad
at a gathering in a country house a jealous little girl intervenes in her sisters love life and things will never be the same from an interesting novel that had an engrossing first half but for me trailed off in the second so i had a different experience with the film adaptation where the country house scenes are not quite satisfying but the following war story is brilliantly told the narrator is a fascinating little character but looking back i think her motivation needed to be colder and her more problematic in the end the story is wrapped up with a talking head which i guess was unavoidable but not the mark of a great moviethe long tracking shot on the beach at dunkirk is amazing  not only a technical marvel the amount of ground covered the multiple interactions but it creates a great sense of chaos and despairperformances are good and its no wonder people raved about ronan the music is excellent and plays about with the rhythm of a tapping type writer photography too although i didnt get the sense of oppressive heat in the first actoverall interesting and impressive but some big flaws,sad
is a movie evolving around a young girl who falsely accuses her sisters brother of rape and thus ruins and influences the life and relationship of both of themthe production is of high value delivers beautiful pictures and a very earnest and atmospheric setup unfortunately at times it is a bit hard to follow the story because at several points the flashbacks and time shifts include such great deals of time that the coherence is suffering the ending on the contrary is pretty strong and achieves to weaken the negative impact of the questionable storytelling i like how parts of the movie are proved wrong and how the audience is surprised by that however it would have been of benefit to tell one story consequently and not different stories of false accusations war and loveall in all it is a very wellproduced and serious movie but in my eyes it is not superb on the other hand i have to admit that im not a great fan of historical movies anyway so i can guess that many people will like the film a lot better than i do and it is definitely worth a watch,sad
i was thoroughly unimpressed with this movie full disclaimer i have not read the book so this review is based entirely on my experience with the film my rating of this film may be a bit on the harsh side as this film has many merits to it i believe however that it failed overall as a film it did not entertain it did not entice it did not pull on my emotions and it did not hold me in suspense it did have me throwing my hands up in frustration at the constant oscarbegging and pseudobohemian attempts to impress the viewerfirstly the merits the acting was superb kiera knightly was impeccable as the melancholy disinterested and later downright morose older sister a young saoirse ronan showed us all that she does indeed have acting chops despite later less impressive performances in her career of course james mcavoy was wonderful as the victim particularly in the sequence in which he writes and then hands the letter to briony the cinematography was also excellent the use of color to convey the change in mood throughout the film was well done and of course there was what may very well be one of the most expensive shots in cinema which i will come back to later despite these wonderful aspects the film just had far too many problems to merit a positive or even average score first off the extraneous scenes this movie had so many useless scenes the aforementioned expensive shot of the dunkirk evacuation was for the most part pointless in fact a very large portion of the notinsignificant time spent on robbie in the war was useless as far as the story being told it conveyed the horrors of war yes but why was it in this film this was not a war movie this was a story about a woman and her struggle with the guilt of a lie she told that reverberated throughout the subsequent decades robbie never even mentions the war during his albeit ultimately fictional rant against briony he does however mention his time in jail which we never see would his time in jail not have sufficed could he not have died in jail or could it not have taken five minutes instead of a half hour to show his death at war so we could get some more briony character progressionwhile i am on the topic of extraneous material lets talk about the constant duplication of scenes we see brionys point of view and then we see robbies aside from the vase breaking what did we glean from these drawn out scenes particularly the scene in which we watch the film in reverse for a prolonged amount of time i am all for unconventional or slowmoving film styles as long as they have a point as long as they contribute more to the film than another more captivating style i did not feel as though these scenes meshed with the plot or the mood the film was going for all of these extraneous scenes are the cause of the largest problem this film suffers from for the subject of the film brionys character gets a paltry amount of screen time i wanted to see her development her struggle with the tremendous guilt she felt i did not get this unfortunately i got quick excerpts from her life enough to see her current state but not enough to relate to the character and empathize with her the plot had some unfortunate hiccups as well i cannot help but feel as though all of this could have been prevented if someone had just talked to briony seriously there were so many opportunities sorry that i dont love you briony but youre twelve also this is totally consensual between your sister and i i couldnt help but feel as though the people in the story had to act out of character just so that the plot could move forward which to me signals poor screen writing another note about the plot  if a man is in a movie that is even remotely linked to wwii and he goes to war and there is a girl waiting for him he is almost certainly going to die this is a frustrating trope i know that wwii was horrendous and many lost their lives but when you can see it a mile away it just takes something away from the emotional devastation that is intended all in all suffered from a poor script and a director who spent too much time patting himself on the back and not enough time focusing on the subject  and the point  of the story he was tasked to recount,sad
plot1935 and 13 yearold briony ronan changes the course of several lives when she misreads the relationship between her sister cecilia knightley and housekeepers son robbie mcavoy later as world war ii rages she tries to atone for her mistake my review this is briony saoirse ronan forged by her family and aspiring to be an accomplished writer and playwright and pedantic knowitall who uses that same enthusiasm to run riot with her advocated mind full of plethoras that seem to lie down like a silverplatter full of misconstrued actionsher lucid creativity and lack of selfawareness all too common with some kids these days as she verges on the precipice of all too well known adolescence adding a twisted sense of her judgement in effect creating a series of shocking revelationsromola garai plays the elder counterpart of briony gets the more difficult less pungent role a character that lives an almost entirely introvert life some screen mannerisms shows this gamut shes overshadowed by saoirse ronan as her 13 yearold self who seems more aware of herself and her surroundingsher sister on the other hand cecilia keira knightley with her sharp tones are exactly posh enough to fit cecilia lounges by the pool smoking with brother leon patrick kennedy all the while keeping her distance from nonentity robbie james mcavoy a scholarship boy with little to recommend him than himself the elder cast actors barely get a look in or even a second look  nearcameos from brenda blethyn and vanessa redgrave aside the three are in the centre stage mcavoy astoundingly impresses while knightley who finally stakes her claim in a grownup part and does more without a pirates rusty blade fantasy refined with a pragmatist sense of underwater scenes make the stately home feel like a home heat tension sexual and or otherwise cracking from under the marble floors all leading to an erotic sex scene audiences will not expect but be stunned despite the fact that both parties remain almost fully dressed all seems too well time seems to be against them1940 as world war ii rages around them we see the central three characters  cecilia robbie and briony now played by romola garai a few years later cecilia and briony are working as nurses in london briony giving the indication of following her sisters footsteps to atone while robbie is part of the illfated british expeditionary force trying desperately to reach the boat for home at dunkirk in the last and darkest days of britains war effort innocence of youth has faded to something chilling a world thats covered in veils and old faded photographs with impiety and an everpresent paucity of light the second act sees briony turn from selfrighteous to stricken in the turn of a page we have the chance to wallow in the mess she has left and realise the full extent of the crime for which she must atonesome very neat and summertinged french countryside through which robbie and his comrades tramp is already warweary provides some beautiful and some brutal detours that make the surroundings more of a shock than welcoming some have and have not seen clips and small sneak peeks about whats going to make wrights reputation in a gobsmacking literally fiveminute tracking shot on the beach at dunkirk as robbies exhausted troopers stagger in to find not refuge but chaos to incessantly babble of it would not give its full constructive meaning this is as effective a world war ii beach scene matching to spielbergs saving private ryans openingthe quality of the production as a whole removes any indication in flaws in the narrative which are almost immediately overshadowed by the next esteemed scene when on some level you are left with a crescendo volleyed ending you are left reeling and wanting more the end plays as a shock is there ever a happy ending verdictdelicately handled goes from pure heavenly fantasy to brutal wartime drama well contrasted with gorgeous cinematography a picturesque score and unquestionable performances 810,sad
in answer to the question as to whether could be adapted successfully for the screen the answer has to bealmost but not quite mcewans brilliant novel with its themes of redemption and morality could never transfer perfectly but writer christopher hampton and director joe wright give it a damn good trystarting in 1935 the film follows a doomed romance and how an overimaginative girls actions affect the lives of those around her the film is stylish and intriguing but ultimately the novels emotional gutpunch cant be delivered as successfully on film and its up to an uneasy coda to clarify everything for those who havent read the noveldespite its limitations this is a very enjoyable film with some remarkable setpieces and an intelligence that raises it above the runof themill period romance film,sad
ive just seen and im still stunned i cannot believe how fantastic that film was i wanted it to go on and on even though it was two hours long when it got to the final scene and the twist was revealed i felt like id just got to know these characters that id barely scratched the surface with them and all too abruptly the film had endedthe story focuses on three inhabitants of an opulent 1930s home the housekeepers son robbie his lover cecilia and cecilias young sister briony when briony reads a sexually explicit letter sent by robbie to cecilia the words lick wet and the c word are used she labels robbie a sex maniac and when a young girl is raped on brionys family estate it is only too easy for briony to convince herself that it was robbie who forced himself upon her the police believe her and robbie and cecilia who are deeply in love with one another are torn apart the course of their lives dramatically altering cecilia moves to london to become a nurse vowing never to see briony again and robbie is sent to fight in world war two with only the hope of seeing cecilia again sustaining him briony realising her mistake must spend the rest of her life atoning for itquite simply if this film does not pick up the best film director actor actress supporting actress editing cinematography soundtrackthe whole shebang theres no justice in the world i had such high hopes for this film and they were all realised it was so exquisitely beautiful but with an edge shots of verdant french countryside overshadowed by planes forests full of dead schoolgirls bloodred poppies swaying in the wind as soldiers stride through them and in one of the most stunning pieces of film ive ever witnessed a five minute tracking shot through dunkirk bypassing soldiers singing on a veranda horses being killed so germans may have no use of them and fires springing from forlorn buildings destroyed by relentless bombing its an incredible scenejames mcavoy is stunning his performance is so powerful and moving he seems to convey everything through a glance a movement of his hand a tremble in his voice there are so many standout scenes with him at its heart but my personal favourite would be the one where tears slide silently down his face as the camera pans back revealing children whose bodies bare the unmistakable marks of gunfire he gives a tour de force and while every actor delivers a near faultless performance his weary face and tortured eyes are as powerfully moving as anything you will see this yearkeira knightley is brilliant as the upperclass stiff whose devoted love for james mcavoys robbie makes her abandon her family and romola garai and saoirse ronan who play the same characters are remarkable especially 13 year old ronan shes a revelation as briony playing her with snotty pretentious relishi cannot recommend this film enough to you every single frame is fantastic and if i were to attempt to list my favourite scenes id ended up writing the whole movie as i cant do that however i will pick two the scene towards the end where robbie confronts briony about what shed done his anger reverberating around the room as she cowers in the corner terrified he will strike her i loved the emotions were superbly played particularly by mcavoy the death scene at the end was heartbreaking my mother never cries in fact ive seen her cry just once in fifteen years but even she was weeping the cinema was absolutely packed and i couldnt express my grief so i stuffed my fist into my mouth to stop myself from howling my face was soaked with tears and i couldnt stop shaking with the weight of them i never even cried that much at titanic or green mile in fact the whole of my row and the row behind and in front were crying too from what i could hear there were loud sniffles and choking sounds from all over the theatre the person next to me swore when the twist was revealed and then burst into tears the way they did it was so moving how the picture of the cottage that robbie and cecilia had promised to stay at when the war ended was clutched in robbies hand when he died how cecilia was seen floating beneath the underground drowned when a bomb exploded the waterworks when you realise that every scene postdunkirk including robbie and cecilia never happened because they were both dead there are huge pangs in my stomach now just thinking about it and the tears are rolling down my face i knew robbie was dead anyway or dying at least there are hints dropped throughout the film like when he opens his jacket and reveals an infected shrapnel wound when he sees his mother in a hazy sequence that is clearly him becoming feverish when his friend lies him down tucks cecilias letters next to him and hushes him because his shoutings waking everyone up  and how robbie promises to be quiet im remembering little bits now like cecilias letters floating in the sea and robbie dying several hours before the british were rescued and evacuated out of dunkirk i also loved 13 year old briony in the pool asking robbie if he would save her if she fell in and then proceeding to do just that to see if he would and the older briony comforting a delirious dying french soldier at a hospitalthis film is absolutely brilliant i loved everything about it apart from the fact its not longer theres a wonderful dreamy quality to it but the performances are earthshatteringly real joe wrights served up another triumph in only his second foray into film directing,sad
i an not one to usually jump out of my seat in hate for a movie but i have for this crapthings that are bad 1 too many useless flashbacks at some point there is a flashback flashfoward flashback in rewind and then a jump to the end 2 ending no spoilers though if i did id prolly save you 2 hours of your life ending leaves you to think that pedofiles get away with crime the ending to last action hero was more fulfilling than this movie 3 portrayed in ww2 and not a single action scene to make you think the main character is worthy of your pity that he is in the situation he is in 4 little girl should die that is true for the crimes she did,sad
is a major achievement of the year as it transforms the complex words of ian mcewans psychological novel into esthetic cinematic greatness making us feel different feelings and ultimately creating three intriguing atmospheres the first being an intricate portrait of the lives of a family the second being an intense yet realistic look at war and the third showing us a flawed selfish woman full of regret for the actions that she once committed and the causes that they committed in the lives of others whether these three atmospheres can differ in experimental styles they are parallel to each other allowing a certain rhythm to the story without being incoherentbegins with briony tallis writing the trials of arabella on her typingmachine when she finishes writing it she goes up and looks for her mom while an intriguing score plays in the background it is a mix of a haunting music with the sounds of her typingmachine marking the rhythm this is how the tragic story begins as this story advances briony witnesses the mysterious actions of robbie turner she sees him making love with her confused and disorganized sister cecilia she then becomes witness of a horrible crime which she doesnt understand but she thinks she does and falsely accuses robbie turner because of what he did earlier because of her interpretation of mature things she separates robbie and cecilia robbie goes to war and cecilia leaves the tallis house and becomes a nurse as she waits for her lover to be with herchristopher hampton portrays a faithful adaptation of the pictures source material with his exquisite screenplay the book has many segments of descriptions mainly of the characters thoughts and feelings it is a challenge to transform these thoughts and feelings into the cinematic language but hampton managed to stay original by transforming them into images rather than going safe by making an omniscient narration the book also shows the perspective of the three principal characters and hampton stayed true to this he individually shows these perspectives instead of making an obvious omniscient view some scenes are repeated so that the audience can observe the perception of every characterjoe wright the director of the amusing though simple pride  prejudice outdoes himself with this motion picture the directing is pretty much the most valuable aspect of this picture as it conveys extraordinary executions of diverse feelings and of mood there are many essential scenes were the directing is key such as the smart sex scene the shots are very detailed showing the lips and body parts of the two principal characters and leaving us seduced another exhaustive scene is the long shot that follows robbie turner this long shot creates a slow rhythm as slow and tiresome as what robbie is feeling he is full of desperation hunger and he is tired because of the war this shot conveys these aspects without having to use dialogue to explain the situation of this characterthis picture also possesses some visually stunning images because of the complex cinematography and the detailed art direction the set decoration of the aristocratic tallis mansion is impeccable as it is full of diverse colors and breathtaking british antiques which contrast with the pale colors of the french beach and the burned houses during the war the cinematography is also impeccable in the previously mentioned sex scene the cinematography has to capture some very close shots of the different body parts of the characters and with very little light to maintain true to the mood that the scene must have the scene is able to show us the impact that it was supposed to perceivethe performances of the film are restrained but powerful james mcavoy simply shines as robbie turner he has a tough character development as he has to bring a transformation to the screen from being a seductive gardener whos finishing his studies to feeling physical pain because of war he brings his character to life and his rage scenes portray the emotion that they were supposed to keira knightley also plays a complex role while some of her dialogue can be a little typical such as the lines of i love you i will wait for you she is still able to convey a confused character experiencing for the first time her sexuality and how this event becomes a true passion vanessa redgrave was extraordinary in her final scene playing the old and flawed briony tallis with remorse and full of demons during her last days of life she is the weight of the final scene and her revelation watered my eyes in the endwhile some persons usually complain because films arent why they used to be simply shows that true masterpieces with character development and extraordinary directing can still be made it is a motion picture that touches many different aspects from emotions to class from passion to war it shows literature with images and not with words and it conveys irresistible scenes with amazing execution,sad
it isnt often that a film comes along and sweeps me away into a trance of beauty that lingers hours later like a delicate but potent perfumethat was the brilliant epic filmwe arrived at the theatre quite early as we usually do to claim our favorite seats near the top and right on the aisle i have to have an aisle seat because i have the bladder of a newborn baby being an independent movie i was somewhat surprised to see how full the place was filling up i know that it has been critically acclaimed and has been nominated for a piles of awards but i still expected the theatre to be sparse do to the attraction of the national treasure sequel so i was surprised and happy to see so many people interested in an independent flick but they kept piling in all the way until and into the previews i havent seen a theatre house that full since titanic when we literally sat in the aisle to see itso enough of my blatheringlets talk a bit about this visual masterpiece shall we where to begin well ive been thinking about what to say about a movie that blew my mind it has taken me about 4 hours to put my brain back together again enough to write about this piece of artthis film is really a like a three part play that grabs your attention in a shocking way and leads you down a tantalizing path of wonder surprise fear anger sadness and relief all the way to the credits the dialog is minimal so much of the story is told through body language cinematography and music the cinematography is sweeping in capturing the grandeur of the scenes while maintaining focus on the main characters and important elements of the movie the visuals were stunningly vivid and very memorable even now as im typing im still going over these amazing images in my mind the sets were meticulous in their authenticity and style yes this movie was nothing less then poetry on film watch for the dunkirk scene in particular it is no understatement to say that the visuals in this film swept you away and made you feel as if you were living the story with the characters each scene was a masterpiece in and of itself so that at the end of every one of them you feel the anticipation of reading the book and quickly turning the page to see what happens next there were some very artsy longshots in this film and they worked because of the detailed and awesome size of the setsthe body language was intense expressive and utterly human ascending star james mcavoy who played robbie was brilliant in his body language you could really feel his restrained yet passionate nature i didnt feel that keira kightley matched his energy but she gives a better performance here in this film then her dreadful performances in the pirates franchise this leads me to the young starlet saoirse ronan who played a very complex deeply dysfunctional character who felt more mature and intelligent then she actually was and learns a powerful lesson for it her facial expressions and intense eyes left an imprint on the memories of this movie that im recallingthis brings us to the score which stuck to a select few songs but it worked quite well as it kept with the films focused intense mood one song in particular acted like another character a storyteller which arrived now and then to sweep us along to the next grandiose scene it was subtle in its elegance but then not all that glitters is gold sometimes the most beautiful thing is the one most overlooked by the majoritythe clich diamond in the rough as you can tell i am wacko over this movie and give it a 10 out of 10 seriously if this one doesnt win the oscar for best picture then it will be a tragedy i cant recommend this one enough unless you arent into intense subtle artsy fartsy complex love storiesi think the thing that is sticking with me the most is that this movie reflects the strange reality that we as humans are fated to experience and perhaps that is why i related to it so much unlike most movies life is full of unexpected twists and turns and this movie captures that essence like no other that ive seen in a long long time,sad
i havent read this book but i went to the movie hoping it would live up to its imdb rating and critics reviews it didnt i found it very long and slow in parts and it took some time to get over the use of vulgarity in the early letter scene  i was there with two younger 18 24 nieces and didnt find this to be a pleasant scene in fact i was mortified some people left the audience after this and the library scenewhile the cinematography was beautiful in parts there remain aspects of the movie i have yet to understand the french soldier speaking to briony in the hospital the beach scene with the soldiers and others i just dont understand how they contributed to the movie except to add to its length it was gory in the hospital scenes toooverall i wish i hadnt wasted my time seeing this movie it left me with bad feelings overall,sad
is being acclaimed now as one of the best films of the year a surefire contender for the best picture prize at the oscars at least apparently as a proper film as opposed to the crime classic no country for old men its not hard to understand it for a good lot of the running time joe wright the director has taken what is an apparently beautiful book unread by me and transformed it into the stuff of true existential crises its about a young girl briony who witnesses what she thought she saw as a crime this might seem unclear at first but it isnt its a clear move on the part of immediate revenge for a tryst she witnessed between her sister and a worker kiera knightley and james mcavoy hes sent to prison then to war where unforeseen circumstances may change everyones livesdoesnt sound like a bad premise with a good dosage of romance in the mix and for the first half hour forty minutes it is great filmmaking of a tense nature focusing on the young girl who just wants to be the center of attention with her first play and is cutoff by family and other matters that flock away all of this is filmed by wright and acted by the case quite absorbingly and by the end you really care what will happen to poor robbie but then the story takes a turn that only slightly recovers in the last ten or so minutes suddenly the point of view changes which i suppose is also true to the book albeit from what ive heard lopping off some bits and pieces that would have made it a longer but richer film to robbie fighting in the war though not exactly fighting he walks around a lot comes across a beachfront of soldiers in a startling 5 minute long take no less indulgent but effective and yet this coupled later with the emergence of the briony as a nurse doesnt really click for meyes it should be compelling cinema to see robbie suffering along with all the other british in the midst of the early rough days of ww2 but what wright shows us isnt much more compelling or for that matter as well done as any given number of war pictures of the period done in the present even a harsh hospital scene with wounded only works so much until its overkill when the point of view changes it suffers and when it finally returns to brialy it takes some time to get adjusted back in it all not helped by a nearly too restrained performance by romola garai particularly in dramatic scenes where whether or not they actually happened should be believable i may be in the minority here from the masses who are praising to the sky but only when vanessa redgrave appears does the film finally offer a satisfying catharsisits a sad thing too because when is at its best its what many dramas particularly those of this kind of period setting seem to lack in dealing the old loveandwar story this time real danger caused by complete human error in youth and judgment is in the mix and it provides a level of interest in what will happen to the characters that knightly and mcavoy work so well speaks to the directors gifts i just wished that wright either made the film longer to make it even more of an epic feat or knew how to deal with the change in perspective of narrative for a film as opposed to in a novel,sad
wright shows us a beautiful intriguing and dark painting called based on ian mcewans novel is based on three principal characters and how a lie told by one of them changes all three of their lives forever the character briony is one of the most interesting characters in recent cinema while the story is impactful is also marvelous to look at the frames the amazing cinematography especially long shots eg set in dunkirk closeups and underwater shots the music and the sets and locations are more than impressive and highly add to the poetry of the storythe complex characters in demand strong performances sadly keira knightley does not impress ive never thought of her as a great actress here she just lacks the nuances of a woman of that time the film is set in the 30s and she seriously needs to eat james mcavoy is great child actress saoirse ronan is brilliant certainly not the irritating child performances we so often see in films she underplays her part with a certain dignity romola garai is phenomenal in a briefer role supporting cast that includes gina mckee brenda blethyn and vanessa redgrave is good as the aforementioned actresses have hardly ever disappointedis cleverly told from two different perspectives that of what really happened and what briony thinksimagined at times it the films sudden shift of gear eg switching to the war scenes feels odd but it comes to an almost full circle towards the end i found the smoking habit of the characters which was sort of in your face annoying also at times the pacing was very slow the ending is quite profound and it is left for the viewers to interpret and to seek an answer to a question that will definitely stay in mind long after the films ended in one word id describe this film as a brilliant piece of work,sad
i bet this was a great novel sadly though it didnt translate the director wastes a lot of time on plot that has nothing to do with anything the play that briony writes what a waste and as a result doesnt have the time to give us the character development and blossoming love that make the actual underpinnings of a love storyi still have no idea why the two characters loved each other we werent even given a montage to let us know they had spent time together in ways that would show their lovesimilarly we never get to understand brionys growth by the end i dont know why she soughtfor all the romancenovel weepies out there im sure they can just take all that as writ and have themselves a good hearttugging cry i myself expect a director to reveal characters to me and engender emotion in me rather than just expect me to make it up out of nothingon the level of craft though this movie was splendid beautiful shots gorgeous scenery nicelooking stars and crisp sound and a nicely understated soundtrack that didnt insist on telling you how to feel ever moment the two leads probably are quite talented but here they had almost nothing to do except mug a bitits too bad all of that was wasted because if the director didnt force us to assume so much of the important events in the story i seem to recall that love stories should actually have scenes that show you the people falling and being in love this could have been powerful and movingas it was i was yelling at the screen and feeling nothing toward any of them i was cheated,sad
as opens with stunning images of the tranquil english countryside where everything is a picture of perfection and everyone appears content you cannot help but feel the atmospheric foreboding as nothing perfect lasts forever in this tarnished world based on the bestselling novel by ian mcewan it is an unforgettable beautifully haunting love story that slowly slips into a devastating flood of such raw overwhelming tragedy that you can feel the emotional journey of the characters and its thoughtprovoking themes of forgiveness atoning betrayal and love stay with you for days afterwards when briony tallis played three different ages by by saoirse ronan romola garai and vanessa redgrave misinterprets an encounter between robbie turner played by james mcavoy and her sister cecillia tallis played keira knightley she tells a lie that carries such shocking consequences that it completely ruins their lives briony spends the rest of her life seeking forgiveness for her appalling act the story is told against the backdrop of wwii from the three points of view along with beautifully rendered and perfectly timed flashbacks and forwards director joe wright does a splendid job contrasting the two worlds the beginning is filled with whimsical pastel colors of the exquisite english countryside drenched in glowing sunshine where everything has the sense of a timeless perfection only to be followed by the dark ominous gritty images of a war torn france the acting from the entire cast is topnotch james mcavoy gives a strong emotionfilled performance of great depth keira knightley effortless glides into her role as the highclass daughter and as only she can do speaks each line with such eloquence that it is a treat to just listen saoirse ronan is truly one of the best child actresses of late as she acts with such a profound maturity and intensity and vanessa redgrave is so perfect in her small role as briony in her older years that she still manages to make an impression and is able to convey such emotion solely through her expressions every level of production is so perfect it is an absolute triumph notably the cinematography which was dazzling containing one of the most epic and complex singletake in movie history yes it even toped children of men as well as dario marianellis magnificent sweeping score filled with an original theme of simple yet exquisite beauty truly is the best film of 2007,sad
i knew from the first few moments of pride and prejudice that we were in the hands of someone who understood literature cinematically austen is virtually impossible to film because typical of many books it requires some ambiguity about internal ruminations and the observed events he mapped this into shifting layers and insideoutside in the very first scene i moved forward in my seathere he is much much better because he is filming a book written with cinematic values i cannot say if it is a wellwritten book the basic story itself is ordinary sort of a reverse lolita with the young girl as the writer and untrusted narrator there is one key shot everything else up until the visit is witnessed by others except the corpses of schoolgirls this is the only scene that is staged in a stylistically unrealistic way and it should be a tipoff that brionys story is folded into the outer wrapper as well as the events we seethe most notable trick he does is use the typewriter in a pervasive way in the story in the writing of the story in the score and even in the eye toward the endhe uses camera movement in wonderful ways for instance he has briony move on the upper corridor and stairs of her home in precisely the same movement the older brony does through the hospital beds except this time we know it is her eye we are using and her memory we are plumbing theres the amazing onetake sequence at dunkirk its not like the p t anderson ripoff of urusevsky where he just touches characters instead it is derived from soy cuba and touch of evil in the sense that both deep and contextual narrative is conveyed again we learn that this is coherently constructed by the writer and not witnessedthe business of our hero being folded into port of shadows about a deserter  we never learn why robbie was separated from his company isnt unique but its apt and deep movies books pictures stories about stories about liesi dont know juno temple from elsewhere  though i know she was in notes on a scandal which i saw but she is the real villain here and she pulls it off well as does her counterpart the young brionyin preparation for this i saw soy cuba because i knew this would have the soviet eye and the 75 great gatsby with which this shares quite a few values including some of the story im glad i didit works its intelligent its cinematic and literary keira is tolerable theres a great speech about letting the germans have france you should see itteds evaluation  3 of 3 worth watching,sad
beautifully and lovingly reconstructs the high life of the british aristocracy between the wars and the early dark days of world war ii unfortunately there is much less to it than meets the eye while the filmmaker clearly wishes us to feel a profound sense of horror and injustice at the false accusation laid against an innocent man which rests at the heart of the film i couldnt help but feel that somehow the real horror was that this charge was laid against someone who was model handsome and welleducated and that the punishment he suffered was relatively light by contemporary american standards nor could i feel anything at all for the girl whose efforts to atone for these accusation give the film its name in large part because her initially interesting and lively character is replaced mid film by a zombielike creature whose sole expression is a vacant stare the film is redeemed from near triviality by a rather ingenious deus ex machina still for me at least it worked only as lavishly illustrated historical fiction and not as drama,sad
in 1935 in england the upper class cecilia tallis keira knightley is in love with robbie turner james mcavoy the gentle son of the caretakers of their real state that will be sent to the medical school by the tallis after witnessing an incident between cecilia and robbie in the fountain of their property snoop a letter that robbie asked her to deliver to cecilia and see her sister making love with robbie in the library the thirteen yearold aspirant writer briony tallis saoirse ronan misinterprets the events and believes that robbie is a sex maniac when her cousin lola quincey juno temple is raped in a hot summer night in the garden of the tallis real estate briony falsely accuses the innocent robbie and he is sent to prison affecting the lives of robbie cecilia and their familiesthe awesome is one of the best movies i have ever seen and a sad example of how unfair the oscar is since it is better and better than the awarded no country for old men the wonderful screenplay based on the british romance novel by ian mcewan discloses a magnificent story of of a character that seeks redemption for her unthinkable attitude on the age of thirteen and is supported by a stunning cast fantastic cinematography art direction costume design and music score the outstanding performance of the unknown saoirse ronan is impressive and her nomination to best performance by an actress in a supporting role is more than deserved in my opinion the performance of this young actress was superior to the winner and great actress tilda swinton in michael clayton my vote is ninetitle brazil desejo e reparao desire and,sad
yet another stupid tale of a 12 year old privileged girl who thinks she is going on 30 but is actually about 6 when it comes to how much she knows about things like sex so being her selfish self and because classconscious england actually would believe a stupid 12 year old girl over a 19 year old medical student she is able to completely wreck 2 persons lives oh and then she writes a book about what would have happened if she was not such a pesky nosy unlikeable brat like that isyet another stupid tale of a 12 year old privileged girl who thinks she is going on 30 but is actually about 6 when it comes to how much she knows about things like sex so being her selfish self and because classconscious england actually would believe a stupid 12 year old girl over a 19 year old medical student she is able to completely wreck 2 persons lives oh and then she writes a book about what would have happened if she was not such a pesky nosy unlikeable brat like that is,sad
i dont understand what the hype is all about i was awfully disappointed with the movie you had such great material to deal with a good book the war setting good actors excellent locations great technical talent but the screenplaythe writing is poor it does not hold the attention of the viewer the events described to be extremely influential hardly seem to be the characterization seems to have major flaws oh i can go foreverthe entire movie seems to dwell on the premise of how you would like things to be and how they actually are but all you see is a big smudgy mixture of bothi kept waiting for something important and significant to happen all along the length of the movie butnothing did it just ended thank god for thatin the end do not get fooled by the positive reviews some one said  the best war romance since the english patient youve got to be kidding save your money your time and your effortwhat an utter waste of great locations and good actors like keira knightley and james mcavoy,sad
as a huge fan of ian mcewans novel i was originally anxious as to how any film could accurately portray it and not a little jealous as i had decided it my destiny to write the screenplay however joe wright exceeded my already reasonably high expectations he did well on pride and prejudice and delivered a masterpiece briony a 13year old girl has an extremely fertile imagination and has been writing stories from a very young age at the beginning of the film she has just completed her first play and is learning the difficulties that follow this ie actor trouble and worries about rehearsals it is clear early on that briony has slightly egocentric tendencies for one all her toy animals face her writing desk where she is usually to be found so when her older cecelia and her friend robbie finally start their long anticipated relationship briony has misinterpreted the signals that led to it and believes cecelia to be the victim of a predator and so she tells a lie that will ruin the couples chance of happiness years later robbie has been sent off to war cecelia is a nurse and briony a trainee nurse trying to atone for what she did four years ago we have star acting from all of the main cast and to be honest i really loved robbies army buddy whose final line finally brought out my long held back tears keira knightly looked lovely and has finally moved on from comingofage roles to woman and may i say she does it beautifully all three actresses who played briony did so just right for her age especially vanessa redgrave james mcavoy however delivered a stunning performance from quite comic humour as he realises a rather embarrassing letter mixup to seething with anger as he shouts at a humbled briony has already been predicted as a huge oscar winner and i can definitely back thati would definitely recommend this film and give it ten stars,sad
whats a pedophile daddy well son lets go watch and you can see for yourselfcoming into i was expecting a sort of jane austin wartime romance with a slight twinge of sadness not what is widely considered to be the dirtiest word in the english language typed in eightfoot letters across the screen followed by chester molester in all his creeptacular gloryto briefly flesh out why is so dissatisfying imagine if titanic had some sort of malnourished lovechild with romeo and juliet he would be the tragic kid no one understands receiving pitylaughs aplenty due to his darklyawkward socially fauxpas behaviour while constantly make everyone uncomfortable and confused his name would be all this being said upon leaving the theatre i caught myself wondering if it would be morally wrong to ask the manager for a refund or if he could possibly compensate me for the portion of my life i lost amidst awkwardly laughing and searching through the quagmire that had played out before me for a plot i decided against this seeing as no one coerced me into paying for the film coupled with the fact that i didnt want to waste anymore time that eveningso if you want to see eight foot profanities flashed repeatedly across the screen dashed with a hefty dose of molestation and misunderstanding while leaving feeling confused and vacuous or if you really dont value your money and time then is the movie for you,sad
some of the best elements of wuthering heights and the childrens hour are combined in to make a really fine romantic film its been nominated for several oscars and is certain to take home something from this years academy awards ceremonyjames mcavoy and keira knightley are a pair of fateful lovers who novelist ian mcewen no doubt was inspired by charlotte bronte mcavoy is the son of the housekeeper and knightley is to the manor born they do so look like heathcliff and cathy as performed so many years ago by laurence olivier and merle oberon but theyve got a young mary telford in their midst from the childrens hour class distinction robbed olivier and oberon of earthly happiness but in its a terrible and vicious lie told by a young girl with too vivid an imagination saiorse ronan plays knightleys younger sister who tells the vicious tale i cant recall another instance where a juvenile performer has been up for a best actress award usually those are confined to the supporting categories but young ms ronan may just pull it off at this years oscarthe main parts of the story take place in the united kingdom from the late stanley baldwin years to the beginning years of world war ii of dunkirk and the blitz romola garai does a fine job in portraying a slightly old version of ronans character the sets and the cinematography showing the period have gotten deserved nominationsthe coda to the story is provided at the very end by vanessa redgrave in todays times shes become a very successful novelist now and she brings the audience through a television interview the rest of the story her portrayal of a dying woman who now wants to make some amends is so moving i am mystified why the academy voters overlooked her in the supporting actress category there is no way anyone will leave the theater with a dry eyewhile its still in theaters dont miss,sad
its not often that you can go to the cinema and use the word beautiful to describe a film but in this case the word beautiful does not do justicethe story follows a young teen named briony played very well by saoise ronan who witnesses her older sister cecilia kiera knightly and gardener robbie whom she has a crush on james mcavoy as close as he will ever get to an oscar making love in the library after this she sees her cousin lola being attacked in the garden and as a childish act of revenge not fully realising the seriousness of her actions lies to the police and frames robbiethe story jumps on a few years and we see robbie conscripted to the army and cecilia who has now left her family working as a nurse in london and a now grown up briony training as a nurse trying to atone for the damage that she has causedi had not read the book before going to see the film and for the first time ever i am glad that i did not there is an unexpected twist at the end of the movie that is absolutely devastating as we do not get the ending that we are accustomed to and if you become as engrossed as i was there will in all likelihood be tearsthe film is shot to perfection by joe wright who now will be officially known as the director that made kiera knightly grow up and shake of the awful pirates moviesevery shot is just gorgeous to look atthere is one long scene showing the evacuation at dunkirk which on its own deserves an oscar it was not like usual war time scenes all patriotic and noisy i was very quiet apart from a group of soldiers singing in an old band stand it is a very poignant scene and will be remembered for a long time to comethis film is a shoe in for at least a couple of oscars and for once a film in the oscar hunt has managed to quietly show its worth without any desperate will smith give me a oscar please performances james mcavoy and especially the young saoise ronan deserve at least a nominationi would honestly give this film a 1010 it is hard to pick a fault in one of the best films of the year,sad
there are no words that can describe my anger over this films win at the golden globes for best picture in a year filled with phenomenal films like into the wild 310 yuma sweeny todd etc this movie is subpar overrated and was personally painful for me to sit throughi give credit to the cinematographer and kiera knightly who both did exceptional jobs i also give credit to the screenwriter and director for the first 15 minutes of the movie everything after that amounts to one of the biggest piles of rubbish i have ever seen celebrated on screenthe problem is the story itself its obvious that neither the writer director or james macavoy have any clue what its like to go to war or be in love the film is entirely selfabsorbed and completely unaware of the catastrophic historical events that surround it james mcavoy also cries in every scene of the movie that hes in including the fountain scene and the scene where they make lovethis is just horrific acting and directing its also disrespectful to make a movie that unrealistic and soppy on issues that are real and darki wanted to vomit after leaving the theater if it wins the oscar i will boycott the awards ceremony for the rest of my life do yourself a favor and go see one of the other wonderful 20 films that are out this year and spare yourself the pain of sitting through this movie,sad
i was so excited to go and see friends told me to bring a box of kleenex that it was a tragic love story that it was just fantastic so i went and found here wasnt any love in this story no reasons for crying and no real what on earth makes people think that lust and love are the same thing and even lust was sparse in this film the sets and costumes were lush and nice but the method of presenting the story was so jumbled it was pathetic i couldnt get to know or care about anyone except for the really mentally sick little girl who needed treatment what a disappointment i wanted to love it i hated it the director went overboard trying to be artsy fartsy so people who didnt know better thought it was real art where have all the wonderful types of movies that were made in the late 30s 40s and 50s movies that make you feel something about the characters make you laugh make you cry and make you understand what the heck they are all about there are just two movies nominated that are worthy of an oscar this certainly isnt one of them,sad
this movie fails because of 1 slow pacing there were many unnecessary shots and some of the more beautiful shots that were meant to give objective correlatives to the emotion the actors and audience are supposed to feel were overlong by seconds the slow zoom from inside a door frame to james mcavoy outside to to minutes the painfully long dunkirk beach scene 2 weak narrative structure almost every scene we see given to us en media res in the middle of things forcing the audience to patiently wait for explanation of circumstance and without such explanation these circumstances hold no apparent significance if these explanations were not so slow in coming and if every scene didnt feel so excruciatingly overshot and protracted then perhaps the narrative structure would have given me a sense of movement instead i often felt like the story was going nowhere holding me down in a tepid bath of inconsequential detail 3 the replacement of story with objects scenes vistas while slow coming the beginning of the movie does have a story to tellthere is both action and consequence and characters we start to care about after robbie is arrested and sent to fight in the war the story is incredibly insipid the english are retreating and robbie misses his lover in order to pad thisthe worst part of the filmwe are given utterly unnecessary scenes of robbies fellow soldiers delaying the story with inconsequential dialog these are meant to give the story character color and realism but they fail ultimately because we could care less about these other soldiersthey are flat in fact everything in the film from arrest to imaginary return to england is flat in terms of the storyit is all visuals these images instead of being a succession of pictures each worth a thousand words become a tedious one note melodrama war is ugly and boy does it suck that robbie and cee were unjustly separated ugh boringwith some judicious editing and the inclusion of an engaging subplot in france this could have been a much better film,sad
a testament of the power of word this movie has a poetic aura that makes it impressivea kid briony mistaking her older sisters love for a house servant for abuse against her makes a terrible revelation that will haunt the three peoples lives foreverwhat impressed me mostly about this picture was its flowexpanding over six years this movie has no gaps and the story proceeds nicelyi have not read the book but here everything is put in a magnificent orderthe flashbacks that initially follow after briony watches something disturbing work amazingly we always believe that she has watched something bad only to be wronged when we observe the whole picturethere is no timekillingeither everything here has a reason and all the moments of the film contribute to its climax contrary to modern blockbusters that tend to spend time over trivial scenes almost nothing can be omitted here the passage from the manors scenes to dunkerke and is set down nicely and the story maintains its focus the ending of the film is strong and ties the whole movieit is after all a story praising the power of the expression and it begins as it ended with a tribute to the written wordthe actors are also phenomenal knightley shines in the role of cecilia a bold albeit rough woman saoirse ronan the 13 year old talis is also stellar with a clear expression and attitude so rarely seen in kids roles today james mcavoy is also pretty good vanessa redgraves minor part also has a great significance to the story serving as the emotional climaxin all this is an excellent film maybe one of the greatest this decade has to offer,sad
this movie starts out with great promise but is very disappointing they seem to have put a lot of effort into setting up the story and the beginning draws you in but some of the scenes in the middle are needlessly long and drawn out and do nothing to contribute to the telling of the story then suddenly realize that they have to end the thing because it is getting too long and quickly jump to an ending that is completely disjointed from the rest of the filmif you must see it wait for the dvd its a waste of money i cant imagine why it is getting so much positive attention from the critics they must have paid someone off,sad
after loving keira knightley in pride and prejudice i knew not to expect the same type of movie nor of the same quality however i still hoped it would be entertaining and moving but i honestly ended up contemplating walking out i should have just fallen asleepcritics love the movie but they are so far in the woods they cant see any green let alone trees the movie constantly and abruptly jumps around nothing is ever explained and the characters lose all and any hold with the audience that they may have had the beginning was edgy and sexy but from there on out i wanted to raise my hand and ask anybody in the theater to please explain what i am watching i dont understand what anyone likes about this movie and again ill be left wondering how it won any awards desperately wishing to understand,sad
at this point i have seen too many great films to be enchanted by long and beautiful shots accompanied by moving music and i agree was visually beautiful but many scenes dragged on long after it conveyed both the plot and emotions the final scene was a painfully abrupt change of tone the acting of both the bryonys was excellent and mcavoy was great as expected but last king of scotland topped the manipulation of time with young bryony was well done in that it conveyed the childhood innocence and juvenile misinterpretations a movie i would recommend with similar setting is a very long engagement overall entertaining very emotional and well acted,sad
after reading nothing but fine reviews of this movie i went to it expecting a grand romantic saga with a historic backdrop ala dr zhivago the english patient etcboy was i surprised and not in a good wayfirst the story was plodding there were several dull spots and a couple of excessively long scenessecond the acting from at least one of the main actors was less than convincing third the ending bordered on ridiculousthis story was not told well i was not convinced i should care about the characterseven with lessthanhigh expectations i would have been disappointed by this movie,sad
while the ending of the movie was interesting i thought in general this was a much overhyped movie and at times very very dull the acting was annoyingly melodramatic and unnecessarily intense at times the use of flashforwards and flash backs was confusing and apparently used to keep the audience awake characters move in and out of the story so quickly it is difficult to keep everyone straight on the positive side the costumes were lovely and the setting of the movie was gorgeous the aging of the 13 year old writer to the older author was also well done on the whole however i was very disappointed by this movie and would not recommend seeing it,sad
has everything drama romance stunning visuals tragedy compelling storylineits all hereacting everyone was on top of their game but the real scene stealer here is james mcavoy he deserves every ounce of praise he will inevitably receive for this performanceno kidding keira knightley pulls off a riveting performance but nothing as eye popping as mcavoystory it simply has to be experienced to be understood you wont know the whole story or feel the full impact until the credits roll its that solidvisuals more proof that you can have a deep story and lush rich visuals not to mention some truly stellar cinematography theres one really long shot in particular that is just overwhelmingly beautiful but incredibly tragic at the same timethe more i think about this movie the more i love it i will definitely be seeing this again is a serious contender for every best picture award out there and rightfully so the only negative things i have to say about it is that the music is a little too much in a couple of spots it drags a little in one particular spot and they make a time jump a little too quickly so its a bit jarring but those problems are nit picks and hardly worth mentioningthis could very well be another movie where its okay for men to cry too,sad
there are so many glaring flaws in this film it is hard to know where to begin it is disjointed and lacks any sense of organic development it fails because it tries to cram an expansive novel into a twohour film the romantic connection between the lead characters seems to be based on little more than a tacky and frankly uncomfortable looking shag against a bookcase there is not enough time to flesh out their relationship and we are left with james mcevoys cheeky but lovable scottish lad shtick and keira knightleys flawless skin and merchant ivory method acting routinethe action lurches to france for an inexplicably drawn out scene showing that war really isnt very nice laughably robbie ruefully explains that he couldnt be an officer because he has been in prison so let me get this right war is horrible but only so far as it imperils a cheeky but lovable scottish lad who deserves better than those hundreds of thousands of unwashed grunts dying in the service of their country for the pice de rsistance they wheel out the trusty vanessa redgrave for another dialacameo performance sorry but even the great vr needs more time to create suspension of disbelief before you can say look its whats er name vanessa redgrave shes blasted her way through the clipon denouement and were into the credits and not before time,sad
tells the story of briony tallis saoirse ronan a 13yearold fledging writer and member to a family of wealthy british socialites in the 1930s she has a crush on the hired help in the much older robbie turner james mcavoy but she notices that her older sister cecilia keira knightley seems to have similar feelings but after reading a letter by chance and witnessing some rather disturbing events briony changes the course of life for more than just a few peoplei was not quite sure what i was expecting going into but the movie i saw was not it i do not necessarily think this is a bad thing but i do think it helps to know very little about it yes it is very romantic in a handful of scenes but it so much more darkly mysterious than the ad material lets on just the sheer notion of the course of events that leads up to brionys irrevocable change is quite disturbing all in itselfhas a rather enigmatic method of sequencing falling quite distinctly beside the likes of akira kurosawas rashmon and zhang yimous obvious homage hero tells its story from a few points of view showcasing a few events through multiple angles what is great is that we actually get to see these angles from the very pointofview of the character almost to the point of being a voyeur much like briony herself it makes for an intriguing of watching the film and it leads to a greater of understanding of the motivations of each of the main characters it may not be easy for casual filmmakers to understand the use of seeing these angles used more than few times early on but it does truly make sense as the film goes on and is not simply a british upper class nod to those asian filmmakersthe story itself while being heavily convoluted in part thanks to the really well done multiple angles is a bit off i liked where it went and i like how it explored what happened to the characters since the first half is almost entirely comprised of the day of brionys big moment but its focus seemed a bit wonky i realize and understand what screenwriter ian mcewan and in turn novelist christopher hampton was trying to capture and achieve in the writing but it works half of the time i found myself more baffled at the lengths some of these scenes rather ridiculous and just disliked how it was so careless with its moments of exploration and development the characters do develop over the course of the film but just not to the point that the film lends itself to thinking they dowhat i also did not like was the length the first half goes by fairly quickly but the second half just drags endlessly a lot of the strongest scenes in the film and the ones i liked the most are in the second half but the filmmakers just seem to have less of a idea as to what they wanted to do with them they know how to make them look great but making them play off just as good seems to be a bit of a problem it is disappointing to think so much effort was put into the early moments but not enough was given to the later ones it does not help that the first half does not jump around nearly as much as the second but the film does not seem balanced once the ending hits the film practically flies but getting there is almost a test of endurance in itselfthe beautiful imagery stays consistent throughout the film even at its darkest both literally and figuratively moments director joe wright and company have composed a gorgeous looking film with minute details at every corner and just the right amount of authenticity some of the scenes they compose are simply breathtaking as well one long take late in the film in war torn france is simply fantastic and speaks volumes of the level of effort put into making the film it reminded me a lot of the amazingly captured scenes in children of men and i think it qualifies as some of the best sequencing of the year i was very impressed with the visuals and i think they helped keep my eyes peeled to the screen and not faltering into the boredom that sets in because of the story the typewriter infused score is also very well done and quite riveting at timesthe acting from the cast is uniformly good with some standouts after being disappointed with his work in the last king of scotland mcavoy really knocked my socks off here his wounded character is very well conveyed and truly proves his worth as an up and coming actor no it is nowhere near as good as the likes of daniel daylewis viggo mortensen johnny depp or even denzel washington but it is great all in its own i can only hope he continues on this streak knightley on the other hand is not all that great she does fairly well for herself but she does not seem to be giving it her all i am not going to say that her acting is bad here it just does not seem to be up to the calibre the film is trying to projectronan is the true marvel here and miles ahead of brionys older forms in romola garai and vanessa redgrave and outshines everyone in the cast her naivety and amazing style speaks of being a more seasoned veteran and i hope she can continue on this wave length for the lovely bones and beyondin the end is a good film that could have been a whole lot better if for anything see it for the astonishing visuals and the even better ronan7510,sad
i would like to start of by saying that generally period dramas arent my thing i get very quickly bored with them and tend to switch of within the first minutes of watching much the same with i had low expectations from the start luckily for me my brother convinced me to carry on watching the film i saw then has changed the way i see such films never again will i write off a film because it looks boringit is hard to know where to start with a film such as this as nothing really stands out instead it is all perfect the logical way to start would be to describe the story line yet it is also hard to do that as it is hard to know how without ruining the film or making it seem boring instead i will say that it is something that needs to be seenthe acting is excellent with keira knightley and james mcavoy giving what only can be described as the performances of their respective careers in addition saoirse ronan who plays the 13 year old briony is the most promising child actor since dakota fanninghowever it was not only saoirse ronan who showed true promise in this film has also brought to my attention the promising talents of director david wright who up until now was unknown to me having only made pride and prejudice and undeservedly so his direction was amazing especially in the scenes in france which somehow managed to portray the true horror of war without showing the slightest of conflicttheir is one problem with this film however and that is that their is nothing bad about it this may sound a bit strange but i always like to have a rant about something that annoyed me about a filmsuch as plot holes or bad characterisation but for their is nothing i could say i feel cheated by the ending which does make you question the film slightly but that would not be true because it is so well done that they could have all turned out to be aliens in the end and i would still have enjoyed itfinally i have only one thing to say to people who havent seen this film yetwatch it now,sad
is clearly a fine work of art on screen thats greatly influenced by literature it has all the classic elements of literature and classic prose from lust love war and in the end the central character writer briony tallis feeling guilt and remorse for a false accusation the film will clearly bring out emotions especially if your genre of choice is romance and passionate love yet you will have wished for more proved truth and justice to have happened earlier in the film even though its revealed in the endset in the mid 1930s in england the film has a classy and elegant setting like all british films you feel the grace of the family you quickly become swept up by the beginning and desire for dreams as little young darling briony tallissaoirse ronanis caught up in a world of plays imagination and stories she wants to happen ranging from joy to love her older sister is looked upon from her as an inspiration cecilia talliskeira knightleya young lady whos eager for love and romance escape by desire and pleasure only young briony sees an unpleasant and uneasy sight from cecilias new love interest as dashing robbie turners ambition for lust will soon send him on an unpleasant and long journey that will make him struggle for love and happinessas spans thru time into war of the gruesome blood and death that robbie sees while fighting as a solider brionys story unfolds as the time changes with her sister growing up and moving on to nurse school and briony herself with take the same job path all along the flashbacks of love and joy are presented so well only like a classic work of literature it reveals the painful truth of justice and honesty in the end as we see an old and aging briony who has it all wrapped up in her last and greatest and most soul truth searching novel piece you the viewer should finally feel the truth and justiceoverall is a good film i will not call it great because the war and romance genre isnt my favorite yet it still has enough classic literary elements like lust love and the search for truthful justice to make it interesting and enjoyable to watch,sad
my main problem with the film adaptation of like the novel is the ending here we have a character briony tallis who as a thirteenyearold girl splits up a young couple and sends a young man robbie turner james mcavoy to jail by falsifying evidence years later she realises what she did was wrong and tries to atone for her mistakes but the way that she tries to do it seems wrong to meyou see briony is a writer and as a precocious thirteenyearold girl she attempts to put on a play called the trials of arabella full of selfimportance it promises to be a ridiculous piece but then as a successful writer and diagnosed with a terminal disease she writes a novel about her experiences  about the way she destroyed a burgeoning love affair she claims its entirely autobiographical and before this we have a powerful scene where an eighteenyearold briony now a nurse in the second world war confronts the couple she attempted to split up the woman in the relationship played by keira knightley is her sister full of anger and regret it shows how briony is trying to make things up she wants to right the wrongs she madebut then as the older briony talks at the end we find out even though she said the entire book was autobiographical that this scene is a fiction briony never really met her sister during the war she never met robbie indeed robbie never even made it back from dunkirk he died of septicaemia and cecilia knightley died in an underground station during the blitz what kind of is this its meant to be some kind of offering to the world to show how glorious their love could be and its also meant to be a way of immortalising their love to allow them to live on but personally i think it suggests that briony hasnt learnt a single thing shes still the silly little girl living in her dream world she still cant accept reality in fact the old briony explains her reasons for not including the actual events by saying it wouldnt be satisfactory for her readers well maybe it wouldnt but at least for once it would be the truth  a novel concept for the rather wretched briony tallisaside from this though i enjoyed the film and i even have to say that the ending moved me somewhat but it didnt move me because of brionys it moved me because robbie and cecilias love was never fulfilled theres something touching about the banality of robbies death that such a strong will to survive and that such a determined desire to return home can be extinguished so easilyanother moving scene is the one where an eighteenyearold briony has to comfort a dying french soldier i can remember it being the most powerful scene in the novel and its equally powerful here i think its the first time that briony ever realises what love really is that it isnt a selfish need to possess another human being her betrayal of robbie is entirely motivated by feelings of rejection but a simple desire to make another person happy therefore when she talks to this dying soldier a man whos delirious and who seems to think that he knows her from the past you get a proper sense that shes atoning for her mistakes i really think its near impossible for her to untangle the mess she made with robbie and cecilia but the simple way she says yes when the young soldier asks her whether she loves him is so sweet and kind and unselfish that you feel that shes finally beginning to act selflesslyhowever my favourite scene in the film occurs when robbie enters dunkirk theres a wonderfully cinematic sequence where the camera floats through the beach and into the town around you soldiers lie down to sleep others fight and some even congregate to sing and then in the background you have drunk soldiers staggering about and others destroying machinery and vehicles so that the germans cant use them its done in such a simple elegant way plus it economically communicates the despair and desperation of the situation these men can almost see home  they can almost see it on the horizon  but it still seems so far awayits curious though that while in the novel i wasnt particularly inspired by the dunkirk sequence i loved the opening but in the film i feel its the weakest section for me it just didnt have the claustrophobia the passion and the intensity it has in the book but maybe the film was always going to struggle with this section  in writing you can kind of tolerate the young briony but brought to life shes rather wretched and annoying plus keira knightley is never totally convincing she doesnt embarrass herself but she does lack charm and sex appeal and she also has a habit of trying too hard  just look at her mouth when she says come back to me to robbie her lips look almost disfigured shes trying so hard to impress but when she relaxes she actually fairly capable theres a lovely little moment when she holds robbies hand theres no pouting no exaggeration  just a nice bit of warmth and feelingbut these problems aside is a decent adaptation of ian mcewans novel i certainly dont think it should be involved in the upcoming oscar race but it deserves to be kindly remembered,sad
what an amazing film for me to sob my little heart out at the end of the film must of meant it was special as most films have little effect on me i didnt have very high expectations for the film and was worried about it being perhaps a little bit dull but luckily for me a friend and the fact the the stunning james mcavoy was the lead man persuaded me to watch it james mcavoy was brilliant at his roll as alwaysand so was keira knightly who i had feared might of been a bit wooden as she has been in other films her acting just keeps improving if oscars are not awarded for this film them im afraid people have no sense the idea of using a typewriter as a musical instrument was genius it fitted perfectly with the film ive not read the book but will certainly be reading it nowid definitely recommend it to anybody,sad
this movie was an odd experience it is obviously a very expensive production with thousands of extras and for example dunkirk being acted out in front of our eyes and the same with the scenes from the london hospital and the air raid shelter in the london underground the costumes settings props and everything are perfect as a period piece this movie is excellent and you can really learn something from itanother thing i liked a lot was that the french were really speaking french and not english which is so common in war movies  even the germans usually speak english this added to the feeling of reality there is also some wonderful music in the movie that gets your pulses goingbut the problem is that the story in itself does not come up to the expectations you get from all the above one believes that one is watching a movie that shall turn out to be great but that does never happen and as one gets to expect so much the disappointment is bigger the story is after all the most important thing in a movie  it cannot live only on perfect settings at the same time the subject matter is not that uninteresting it made me remember when i was about the same age and something similar happened to two girls i knew they both had an infatuation for a riding master and in a diary they wrote down their sexual fantasies about him this diary was found by the mother of one of the girls who phoned the police the girls were so embarrassed about the sexual fantasies that they rather let on that it had all happened in reality the poor riding master went through hell for several months before he was acquitted  and he could not work at the riding school anymore because some parents were still thinking no smoke without fire so  i found briannas actions psychologically correcti think that the plot in might have been enough if it had been done in another way something is lacking but i cannot really put my finger on what it is but for one thing it was very confusing that the scenes did not come in chronological order there were too many flashbacks and sometimes one got to see the same scene twice at various stages in the movie but from different peoples perspectives also in the beginning of the movie i had difficulties keeping two  or even three  of the younger men apart because the actors were too alike that is very confusing indeed and then in the end the plot became even more confusing when it turned out that some of the events had not happened at all but were taken out of a novel about the whole thing ,sad
i watched this on dvd last night expecting great things i should have known better at the root of the problem is the rather weak and implausible plot then we have characters that are verging on stereotypes the effing squaddie was one of the worst add in some confusing jumbling of the time sequence  presumably an attempt at originality  and dreary portentous music that a drowns out dialogue b tries but fails to inject some emotion into the events being portrayed on the screen sprinkle with historical inaccuracies a pretentious conclusion are we supposed to buy the idea that the novelist can literally write off his or her appalling actions by making up happy endings and clunking references to scenes far better done elsewhere murky goings on in ponds  dont look now beach warfare tableaux saving private ryan in front of the blackandwhite cinema screen brief encounter etc and the result is a terrible mess joe wrights acknowledged admiration of celia johnson and brief encounter seems to have encouraged him to believe he can be the new david lean on this showing he isnt no more than ian mcewan is todays noel coward liked the colour photography though,sad
a huge production of ian mcewans great novel this is like a cheese omelette without the cheesea beef stroganoff without the beefa big macwithout the patties this is a movie that simplydoes not satisfyone feels one has ate a huge mealyet still feels empty the two leads james mcavoy and keira knightly are very good the direction is also well above average it is one of those annoying stiff upper lip british flicks that doesnt cut the mustard whats that old boy  yes ok life is full of personal tragedies but the complexity of the mistake that a 13 year old child makes in extreme circumstances is sadsure but not a sin somehow it is she who i feel sorry for she was a girl becoming sexually aware who also had a crush on her big sisters lover what she did had huge ramifications but i dont see how a girl of her age in a 1935 english country setting could know anything about adult emotions and that is the problemin the book it is all made very clear some novels should not be made into moviesthis is one,sad
2007  12 out of 4 keira knightley and james mcavoy play lovers whos lives are ruined when her younger sister sees them making love but not being able to understand whats going on the girl tells a lie which leads to the downfall of all three i went into this film not knowing a single thing about the story so it took me quite a while to understand what was going on but from that point on the movie had me hooked unlike any love story in recent times this is a very depressing and at times brutal story that unfolds in a very poetic way and in the end the film works wonders and contains some of the greatest moments ive seen in a movie in quite sometime one of these scenes is an incredible beautiful shot set on a beach were thousands of soldiers are waiting to be picked up im not sure how long this scene lasts but it plays out as if there are no edits and the epic scale of this scene is quite incredible the other great scene is the sexlove scene that the little girl mistakes as something else this is certainly one of the greatest love scenes ive witness from any movie as the true beauty of love comes pouring out in this scene making it very erotic mystic and emotional the performances are all wonderful and that includes knightley who captures the mood and heartbreak of her character mcavoy steals the film with his tremendous performance the emotion he brings to the role is something truly great to watch i think the film will work even better for me on a second viewing since it took me a while to figure out what was going on but leaving the theater i certainly felt as if i had seen something special,sad
i think this is a very good movie which starts out very strong and then weakens as soon as macovoy character is sent to war the movie is about a two people who are in love but are in different social classes and were a girl makes a mistake and sends an innocent man to war ok lets start with the performances by the actors keria knightlys performance is ok its not great i think she performs better in the first half of the movie she is not a great actor i think she overacts and sometimes its not believable james mcavoy does the most consistent acting and he has talent especially in the scene were he confronts the girl who send him to war in which he breaks downi think the movie is very original in the first half of the movie were there is like a flashback style which i really liked and also the background score was good with the typewriter music the plot and story are good in the first half it goes at a nice pace and you get to know the characters i kind of lost interest after the macvoy character is sent to war because it was very predictable in a sense that hes either gonna find his love or hes gonna die in war it has been done better before and the keira knightly character was not really convincingall in all i though this movie was strong in the first half and did some original things good but then it lost it in the second half as if they lost the passion they had in the first half of the movie the performances were all around good especially by the little girl and james macvoy but kera knhighty fails to be consistent good movie not great,sad
2007top 10  2007 has garnered considerable critical acclaim 7 academy award nominations 14 bafta nominations and won the best picture drama at this years golden globes the film will go on to win a number of accolades some fully deserved however this is not the best picture of the year although this film had unlimited potential and it is beautifully translated onto the screen i do not believe it extracted all the power and destructiveness of the love relationship present somehow at the end i did not feel as sorry as hurt and as saddened with the characters ultimate fate as i could have been however heavily criticising this film which is a remarkable achievement in storytelling direction editing cinematography and even acting is highly unfair during the course of a few summer days at a mansion in the plush countryside of england a tragic event occurs that causes irrevocable damage to the gardener of the estate james mcavoy and one of the daughters of the wealthy family who has fallen in love with him keira knightley after the rape of one of the little cousins during one night cecilias little sister claims that it was robbie mcavoy who had raped her cousins her decisions having been fuelled by a coarse letter that robbie accidentally sent to cecilia and seeing her sister having sex with robbie in the library of course it wasnt robbie who raped cecilias little cousin it was in fact her brothers wealthy friend an owner of a chocolate factory this event unsettles everything when robbie is sent to prison and later given the choice of entering the army to fight in france at the beginning of wwii and so the ultimately tragic course of the film beginsis not a bad film it deserves all its nominations and almost all its praise however this beautiful semimelodramatic film is not this years best film not in a year with the coens no country for old men and paul thomas andersons there will be bloodthis film could have potentially been unsurpassed by any film this year however in my opinion the character relationships were not magnetic and compelling enough and at times i thought the film wondered slightly just to fill the time for the expected but still powerful ending some will undeniably feel more respect towards joe wright fine film and some will definitely consider it this years best film all i have to say is that this is definitely a film that deserves to be watched even if you are not fond of period epics will not disappoint710,sad
that one shot seems to be the theme of the movie here as the young girl briony accused robbie of a crime he didnt commit she had one shot to get it right but she was so jealous of her her sister cecilia and robbie as they had a secret relationship robbie was taken away from cecilia and was off to the warthe movie is shot from brionys eyes as well as what really happened and it doesnt rely on twist to keep our attention even though the end did catch me off guard it deserves its best picture nomination even though i cant believe james mcavoy didnt receive a best actor nomination oscar as he daniel day lewis and viggo mortensen were the ones that stand out to me so far this year of course keira knightly shined once again as so she did for joe wrights previous film pride and prejudice this film was absolutely beautiful with a rich score and very good direction by wright who i will be following for now onnow for the most beautiful part of the film the cinematography do you remember the incredible shots that children of men brought you how they would stand out as four minute shots with no edits this film has a five minute shot that i believe had no edits that just hurt with emotion it was the most incredible shot ive seen this year and it completely caught me off guard that one shot will haunt me this film should win best cinematography and i will say it is easily one of my top three favorites so far of 2007 dont miss this movie it wont be forgotten oh and youll only have one shot to see it in the theaters,sad
with 7 golden globe nominations is one of those movies for which the script is important it is adapted from a novel by ian mcewan same as enduring love an impressive performance from daniel craig who incidentally was a relatively unknown at the time at least on a global basis starting with an innovative use of the sound from a typewriter for percussion with a pulsating urgency the movie plays out like a concerto with 3 movementsthe first part takes place in an ultra plush english country house set in the 1930s while the backdrop is a typical upstairsdownstairs classdominated environment the mood is one of a dark psychological thriller all the characters are presented here while 13year old briony tallis saoirse ronan aspires to be a writer her sister cecilia kiera knightley and gardeners son robbie turner james mcavoy discover their deep mutual passion that had been bottled up in the last few years the match is not as unlikely as it appears because robbie supported by cecilias generous father is at least her academic if not social equal without getting into all the details of the other characters and plot it suffices to say that briony driven by an adolescent passion for robbie and a vicious jealousy that she is probably not fully aware of herself accuses him falsely of a rape which she claims to have witnessedthe middle movement sees a torturous journey of three english soldiers in france a few years later winding up at dunkirk robbie has been given a choice of staying in prison or going to the front what we see is essentially his agonizing experience waiting for the dunkirk retreat with flashbacks of scenes with cecilia as well as brionythe final movement is told from brionys pov when at 18 romola garai she has given up university to be a wartime nurse this is the most intriguing part that is not unlike a coda on a theme of realty verses imagination brought out in the first movement the last 10 minutes of the movie with vanessa redgrave playing briony in the final days is a tv interview in which she appears mostly is a facial closeupthe movie is beautifully filmed with an exquisite arthouse flavour from the dreamlike elegance of the british country house to the brutal inferno of the dunkirk beaches both james mcavoy and keira knightley got golden globe best acting nominations but they are unlikely to win because the real limelight is on briony  this is the story of her saoirse ronan got a golden globe best supporting nomination and is good enough to win romola garai has taken her career one step forward from scoop amazing grace and angel but it is vanessa redgraves performance that takes the movie to a new height no one else today is able to in those 10 minutes we a privileged to a lifetime of excellence,sad
overall this is a great movie solid story good acting amazing cinematography but oh how it drags for once kiera knightly is in a role she can play but again she needs some food james mcavoy is absolutely brilliant the girl who plays the young bryione is top notch and with the supporting roles an excellent wellrounded cast the cinematography is excellent especially the dunkirk beach scenes the music is a refreshing look at contemporary music but not all movies are perfect this is no exception i found some parts especially in the middle and end dragged a little too much when the end came it was half an hour too long also the plot is slightly confusing with flashbacks and whatnot but if you are a melodrama fan this is your movie,sad
tells the story of a series of unfortunate events misinterpretations and consequences as 13 year old briony tallis saoirse ronan accuses her childhood friend robbie turner james mcavoy of a terrible crime he did not commit opening in 1935 the story moves forward five years to show the repercussions of brionys mistake on both robbie and brionys sister cecilia keira knightley who abandons her family to stick by robbie and wait for him first to return from prison and then from war is an adaptation of ian mcewans hugely successful 2001 novel of the same name adapted by christopher hampton the quiet american and directed by joe wright pride and prejudice it is a sweeping saga of love and war class consciousness guilt and redemption having read and thoroughly enjoyed mcewans novel i had highhopes for this film  further fueled by my reading only the most glowing reviews after it premiered at the cannes film festival this year but after watching the film ive got to say i dont really see what all the fuss is aboutthe buzz is that keira knightley will receive another oscar nod for her performance as the loyal lady in waiting cecilia tallis as will james mcavoy for his role as the wronglyaccused robbie turner i am a big fan of both knightley and mcavoy knightley for her kudosearning role as elizabeth bennett and mcavoy because he is just lovely scottish and has been on my radar since the british tv show shameless however both actors deliver fairly stoic performances by my reckoning its not entirely their fault they are playing very class conscious british characters who have to remember their social standing and it is hard to play characters who have to say a lot without saying anything at all with regards to burgeoning romantic feelings neither are bad but i wouldnt have said oscarworthy the rumormill is also predicting a best director gong for joe wright and best picture for the film well i cant really wrong the preemptive best director for wright perhaps its because sees him coupled with his muse ms knightley  but its more likely that wright is just a very talented director with an eye for atmosphere and understated beauty a particularly breathtaking scene shows a panoramic view of desolate dunkirk overrun by soldiers waiting to go home it is grandiose detailed and absolutely magnificent the film as a whole however will be a lovehate affair for many i personally enjoyed the film partly because it was a worthy adaptation of a beloved book  but i can admit that it was a little slow true outer turmoil is portrayed quite clearly by the war that wright impressively recreates in london in 1940 and dunkirk not through battle scenes however but so much of the story has to do with internal turmoil that it is sometimes hard to hold interest however wright has to be applauded again for his managing to create suspense in certain scenes i thought would be very tricky to communicate to the audience  in particular a certain letter writing scene the fallbacks of the film may lie in the fact that mcewans novel is not adaptation friendly thats not to say it isnt a good book  it is brilliant even however the novel is narrated by an omniscient third person who is able to explain the innerworkings of each character their motivations and interpretations of events the narration is an important element to the book since the entire plot revolves around young briony misinterpreting moments between robbie and cecilia in the film however wright tries to position the audience in different frames of mind by showing the same scenes twice one particular scene is first shown from brionys perspective  through a window silently seeing the tailend of a seemingly heated exchange between her sister and childhood friend robbie which she perceives as malicious on robbies part we then see the same scene more intimately and in its entirety between cecilia and robbie and realize the sexual undertones and frustration of feelings unspoken between the characters i think my slight disappointment in the film comes from the fact that i did get my hopes up it is a good film oscarworthy only time will tell i think it will be appreciated more as an artistic endeavor than a drama or love story and will no doubt earn joe wright more critical acclaim and cachets as a director to watch and rightly so,sad
is a film exploring the consequences of love and the guilt one carries when attempting to destroy it starting in the hot british summer 1935 we join a courtship between robbie turner and cecilia tallis told through the eyes of cecilias 13yearold sister briony peeking from inside a house window she views her sister stripping off in front of robbie and then plunging herself into the fountain in the garden of their country house by the end of the day their lives will have changed forever as the scheming imagination of briony will have run its rage over the lives of the two loverscecilia keira knightley has travelled down from cambridge robbie james mcavoy her university contemporary and son of her parents housekeeper is dabbling with landscape gardening and her brother leon patrick kennedy is coming to dinner with a friend the arrogant industrialist paul marshall benedict cumberbatch the performances are enjoyable and spoton cecilias brittle beauty robbies educated but tempered confidence the wily camaraderie between leon and marshallcecilia clearly harbours an attraction to her university contemporary but her inherent snobbishness towards his attachment to the more servile classes stilt her feelings somewhat the class divide is tested even further when her younger sibling briony a fantastic turn from saoirse ronan who herself is dabbling in the arts of playwriting and novels envelops her own imagination with a warped perception of their relationship robbie is branded a sex maniac and accused of raping brionys friend and cousin lola juno temple the accusations and stigma will haunt briony cecilia and robbie for the rest of their lives the next chapter of which follows them through world war ii briony staring at her deathbed in the contemporary era attempts to atone for her guilt by writing what she really saw and what really happened during the summer of 1935joe wright at the age of 35 clearly has a interesting future ahead of him there are times during when the style and flourish of the films movement is elevated through its direction he sees his films intricately and along with cinematographer seamus mcgarvey paints them vastly and beautifully when he made pride  prejudice the popular call was that he had made jane austen muddy despite the fact it was as pastorally arresting as any of austens novels should be is the same it switches from the beauty of the tallis country home to the grotty urbanism of wartime london with equal aplomb he is clearly a director with an interesting style of filmmaking but it is questionable whether he is utilises his gifts appropriately during the film one sequence a breathtaking longtake following robbies wornout soldier walking along one of the french beaches is both visually arresting and technically marvellous but all it accumulates to is visual swaggery on wrights part what lacks in buckets is the kind of emotional attachment any loves story desperately relies wright attempting to make up for the general lack of involvement in these latter sequences resorts to showing off his technical hands maybe hoping we havent noticed how engaging the story is getting it is a darn shame far too much of one unfortunately since the ambition and weight of make a movie you will want to love some people do and it leads me to question my own interpretation of the film that they something out of it to treasure but in my opinion there are far too many problems that match the movies huge ambition keira knightly for all her hard work doesnt possess the dramatic weight to make us feel for her character far too often is the pain lacking when it is clear we are meant to be heartbroken at both hers and her lovers fate i wanted to feel the sorrow of her character and the closest you come to that is through the guilt and anguish displayed through romola garais performance as the wartime brionywhen the end reveals itself it is genuinely moving but a part of me felt as though the film had not earned the right to take me to that place i still feel there is a great movie to be made on this subject one that overcomes the literary trappings of the novel and doesnt give distance to the audience through its more dramatic scenes i still think people should see it there is enough worth discussing and much to be admired it is a beautiful ambitious and weighty failure one that will stay with you after youve seen it,sad
i went to see this at the local multiplex yesterdaythere were only about 20 others in the cinema with mewe should have found a better way to spend the afternoonit was a dreadful bore with startling inattention to detailfor example we were told that the film started in the summer of 1935then we were told after an hour that it was 4 years later and we were with the bef in francebit of a mistake there since it should have been 5 yearsdunkirk was then shown to be a cross between dantes inferno and the battle of stalingradno organisation and soldiers going to see jean gabin and arletty in a film in a cinema on the beachgiven the fact that this film could not even outdraw run fatboy run at the box office it looks as if there is little chance that this film will make back its moneyso my advice is save your money and time unless you are in need of 2 hours sleep,sad
unrequited love how torturous your feelings for another are never returned at best they simply ignore you at worst they mercilessly take advantage of you by accepting your gifts and attention then brandishing their new partners slowly your love painfully dies and you only wish they would atone for their behaviorthe movie grasps this process but your impression of its subject matter differs if youve seen previews luring you into witnessing a couples passionate affair ruined by a jealous lover you may also have heard about the hitchcockian ending turning everything upside downprecisely the point the plot is all in the mind and this critical element hinted at the films opening is missed both by those walking in late and by the seated ones prejudiced from the trailers you see it immediately becomes clear that the entire movie will be the product of the central character briony who initially is 13 years old a different actress plays her at age 18 then shes portrayed at 77 by the superb vanessa redgrave briony writes fiction and thus is acutely aware how reality and fantasy sometimes merge one must watch events through her eyes to properly understand the motives and consequences of the sexual gratification between older sister cecilia and the housekeepers son robbie for whom briony has a crushthough having called briony his pal robbie bluntly uses her to deliver a letter to cecilia when c  r get around to doing it its in the house library and they know full well that briony could enter at any second as in fact occurs cmon this liaison is pure lust in front of a minor and at that moment i absolved briony for whatever she subsequently did including erroneously testifying that robbie later raped her cousin also a minor the briony endures for having robbie convicted of the wrong crime is belied by the film concentrating half its length on robbie suffering in world war ii combat indeed he is the one who needed to atone for his sinleaving for duty robbie has a brief meeting with cecilia as she awaits a bus on a london street acknowledging his discomfort with their library encounter hes uncertain what he felt with her or if a loving relationship could ever develop during the war when he becomes very ill his soldier buddy tenderly strokes his forehead ironically from this man robbie receives the heartfelt love totally absent from his making love with ceciliain several places we observe a scene performed twice with different interpretations thats because of brionys alternate takes after all dont you sometimes think you were crazy for loving someone who treated you as worthless or imagine they rejected you as a lovesick fool and expected your for wasting their time of course all along they actually did whatever they pleased and as they continue to prosper you are left alone with your abject thoughtsthe bible tells us that god does not forgive the unrepentant were trying to be more than divine if we attempt to do so instead identify with a young girl briony who spends the rest of her life creatively dealing with the callousness of others perhaps all in your mind you will find from those having hurt you inpeace,sad
i have been looking forward to seeing for a while i like a lot of different period pieces and this looked like a great one then the awards have been coming to it unfortunately it didnt come to my town for a while until recently and my mom and i finally saw today and we both loved it it has such a beautiful love story lovely costumes incredible scenery and wonderful actors keira knightly has just come such a long way these past few years and shes becoming a wonderful actress she was the perfect choice for cecille james mcavoy this is the first film i have seen him in i know hes a rising star and from this movie i can see why he has the perfect charm that lights up a screen these two actors clicked so well together and were lovely romola garai as the older briony was the perfect choice as well she brought almost a sense of sympathy for her character an understanding the entire cast brought this wonderful story to lifebriony is a thirteen year old girl in the 1930s she has quite the imagination she writes plays and stories she also has an older sister cecille who is more loved in some ways especially by brionys crush robbie robbie and cecille fall in love but when robbie gives briony the wrong letter to give to cecille that has explicit sexual language cecille becomes more angry when she catches robbie and cecille together making love later that night briony sees her cousin being raped by a man and accuses robbie of it robbie goes to prison and eventually fights in wwii robbie and cecille to find each other again years later and promise each other to live happily ever after but robbie must fight in the war once again briony is now a wwii nurse and is living with the guilty conscience of accusing an innocent man of a hideous crime she riped the love of her sisters life right out of her hands and now she must tell the truth even if it is too lateis one of the best films of 2007 it was very interestingly made it has a strange time sequence but i think from what i know is that is a long book so they probably had to chop a lot of the story up into two hours but dont worry the story is easy to follow throughout the film my mom and i couldnt get over the sets and the costumes they were absolutely stunning and were hoping the awards go to for best costume is a beautiful story of love sisterhood friendship betrayal and imagination its a terrific film its a film not to be missed im in a big bind now where im not sure what film to root for best picture because is going to be a good classic in a few years910,sad
i went to see this movie today with two friends i wasnt too fussed on seeing it  i wanted to see 27 dresses  but this was the only movie that we could fit in and i am so grateful for it my friends werent extremely bothered about it but i loved this movie  in my opinion it was one of the best period dramas ever we all agreed that the best bit was how amazing the three actresses who played briony were  in the looks department and with their mannerisms i absolutely loved the typewriter music and how everything seemed to slot together much like a typewriter  fitting in with the theme of how storytelling can have both a destructive and redemptive power i also loved the fact that the scenery in the first part of the movie took me to a childlike place of fantasy stories as for the storyline  i thought it was magnificent  and i didnt expect the ending at all i would recommend it if you appreciate excellent casting countryside and above all a fantastic story,sad
when i went to the cinema i expected one solid drama with keira knightley in a leading role but instead i walked out of the cinema with that feeling when you know that you just watched one hell of movie ian mcewans novel is brought to life in this great movie about love actually about love story of robbie turner and cecilia tallis cecilias younger sister briony wrongfully accuses robbie for raping her cousin lola brionys strong imagination pulls many events in the future as robbie ends up in prison and cecilia losses her love of life brionys misunderstanding leads to a terrible crime whose consequences follow them through world war iiafter pride  prejudice director joe wright decided to make another movie that is based on a book and this one is a winner and quite possibly the winner of oscar for best picture in the next year gives us few strong performances but james mcavoy steals the show that scene in the house when briony visits cecilia and robbie is great saoirse ronan shows great potential keira knightley isnt long in this movie but shes good as usual and vanessa redgrave is excellent as older briony but what really amazed me is how wright tells us this story in beautiful simplicity with returning in the past but never leaves the viewer with questions cause he presents all the answers one scene is amazing and that is when robbie comes to the beach with his fellow soldiers really breathtaking and spectacular scene cause is one beautiful but sad story and it is really shame to miss it so go and watch one of top 10 movies in this year,sad
joe wright 2007to begin with i should start by mentioning that im firmly situated in the minority  being that i havent read ian mcewans bestselling novel upon which this film is based now that this seemingly relevant piece of information has been divulged i can commence properlythe idea of the love story is as old as time itself indeed perilfraught romances have had theaterdwellers wiping their eyes for as long as cinema has existed romantical films that attempt to pull an audience member into a given tale of quivering bosoms and parted lips sometimes successfully and sometimes not history dictates that most of these pictures focus upon a central relationship and joe wrights upholds this standard we follow the trials of cecilia and robbie  one a wealthy yet bored young heiress to a mansion in englands thirties the other a son of this mansions paid servantfamily their fate is somehow determined by 13yearold briony tallis younger sister to cecilia and as fantastical as you they come although this character is key to the plot the film itself focuses on the young couple hoping to encourage empathy for their plight  for the ultimate injustice of their lives it is however clear to me that when attempting to inspire some kind of feeling within your audience you should start at the very root of the passion  at the grassgreen shoots of love does anything but this mentioning the central relationship offhandedly before hurling itself into a tale more lustful than lovefull and one that seems to have very little foundation i simply cannot comprehend the decision to base a film upon a relationship to which you are going to spend no time rearing  or even detailing why it exists leaving this quite critical preamble up to viewer perception before throwing said relationship to the wolves and expecting your entire audience to dive in after itso begins a tale of envy jealousy bravery lust and pride we are introduced to and released from through the eyes of younger sister briony who sets the wheels in motion so spectacularly with her unfounded yet lifechanging accusations much of the events that occur in the film seem unpredictable making it even more surprising then that the plot itself comes off as rather linear an inadequacy that director wright attempts to distract from by altering the films timeline often unnecessarily the acting on show is altogether unremarkable and unabsorbing with miss knightleys wellpracticed pout as metallic as it ever was james mcavoy who shares the lead does well enough with what hes given but neither actress nor actor are aided by a plot that is somewhat transparent in places this lack of plotstrength is stunningly covered up however by some quite beautiful cinematography the entire film is confidently shot with a graceful style and without giving too much away there is a certain singular long take focusing on dunkirk beach that will make the eyes water in a good way that said it had no bearing on the story itself  neither did it convince me that the oftglaring plot holes could be ignored for more than a few pretty and technically wonderful minutes is a wellpackaged semifailure it flaunts romance that has very little foundation or means to deserve empathy yet it does so while trying to breath new life into a genre it has so utterly forgotten the fundamentals of510,sad
the bits i liked first both the leads were better than id anticipated particularly kiera who ive not had much time for as her previous attempts have been stilted and wooden in some cases shes matured into a nice actress and her part came across as very believable james mcavoy likewise did a great job although his accent was quite variable vanessa redgrave was simply stunning her role was made difficult because it was so small and so important every moment had to be convincing and it was perfectly judged i hadnt read the book which im glad about and i shall now go out and buy it the story was fabulous with a stunning ending which i think would have been spoiled if youd already read the book this needs to be a shock and id imagine its anticipation would only water its effects down what wasnt so good was the directors inconsistent handling of the script there were some nice scenes when the two leads played together but there were also too many scenes that were heavy handed and a few quite laughable the most expensive scene in the film on the dunquerk beach was horrendously camp and self aware which was a shame you could almost see the ads qing the cast horse and dog handlers and viz effects guys there was also some dodgy casting and the guy who married lola needed a quick word in his ear about his woodeness its probably not in the book but i would have liked a few more scenes of the two leads together to show their attraction to one another we needed a little more detail of their depth of feeling so their separation is more poignant overall the film was a little frustrating because with a better director it could have been a great film but his heavy handedness got in the way too many times,sad
i cant give this film a low enough vote this movie is simply a fraud entirely symptomatic of a society in which wars killing millions of people are launched for things that dont exist like weapons of mass destruction this movie is a postmodern fantasy devoid like the art movement itself of any critical moment it ransacks history for the most vivid backdrop it can find need a war well lets just throw in dunkirk and stitch the whole thing together with a five and a half minute pretentious tracking shot in which the whining love lost lead character stumbles around in a pettybourgeois tantrum context who cares much like fox news war crimes are simple reduced meaningless wallpaper nominated for seven golden globes yea sure this is what art and culture must have been like under the third reich,sad
this is an over rated movie i was bored to death watching this movie if there was an award for most overrated film of the year would be the winner many pretentious reviewer who deemed themselves to be connoisseurs of arts pretended that it was a great movie just as abstract artists pretend a painting splashed with multi colors weird strokes a great piece of work neither knowing what does the painting signify nor knowing what they painted i hated this movie and i came to a conclusion that that the movie got over rating just because we like to follow may be your friend said to you the movie was great and you are a fool if you cant understand that the movie was great then to avoid being a fool you too followed your friend and pretended the movie was great a piece of trash may the movie rest in sheet ie poop deliberate spelling mistake in the trash bin,sad
is a rarity the prestigeslathered oscar treat that far from being driven by lookatme desperation is both watchable and commendable the story is epic but joe wright moves along ian mcewans epic of childish lies the child being the radiant saoirse ronan and adult war waged both socially and on the frontlines by soldier james mcavoy and nurses keira knightley and playing an adult version of ronan romola garai with the precision and clarity of a diamond cutter the acting is all around topnotch with the performances being that of mcavoy and vanessa redgrave playing an even older version of garai both have a moment or two where there character turns the film around and they both manage to do it not only without looking ridiculous but with a simple clipped poignancy that lends the film an edge of raw emotion this movie however is driven by behind the scenes workers cinematographer seamus mcgarvey robbed come oscar time has created an incomparable visual feast of the kind not seen since the heyday of david lean or stanley kubrick and dario marinelli creates a brilliant moving score sure occasionally the movies reach exceeds its graspthe war scenes never do cut deep enough but who cares when the grasp is so bold and ingeniously constructed is a flawed but impeccable gem in the crown of a great great year for movies,sad
this is one of the most amazing movies i have ever seen in fact although im a regular on imdb ive just registered for this particular occasion this is a must see movie an incredible piece of artthe directing by joe wright is surprising outstanding love the british and northern french scenarios as well as all the filming details a truly novel transformed into a marvelous movie i must refer to keiras performance which is terrific my last words for the soundtrack as a music lover i may say its on my top5 ever dario marianelli composed a masterpiece on piano and violin to listen over and over againgreetings,sad
joe wright and keria knightly are one of those few that i will see there movies no what the film is and so this one was a no question that i had to see from the directing acting and writing this was a very well made movie and certainly want to see it again joe wright just like he does in pride  prejudice does a fantastic job and with only two films made by him had become a major influences for me i cant wait for his next motion picture james mcavoy which he caught my eye in the last king of scotland does very good job for the coming years keria knightly gives a great performance in this film but kinda falls short of her performance in pride  prejudice but not that much the new comer saoirse ronan does great job for a 13 year old and was kinda surprised with the globe nom romola garai does a fantastic job and should have got the nom and was just great but i would say that vanessa redgrave gives the best performance of the movie and should get the oscar the music score is probably the best one i have ever heard since pp and in my book the best score ever if you were a fan of pp this is no question the movie you need to see,sad
i must admit that i havent read the novel this film is based on but got a pretty good impression as to its quality judging by the film alone simply put the film tells an absolutely fantastic story that keeps us engaged enthralled and entranced from the first clicks of brionys typewriter ian mcewans ambitious tale begins with a whirlwind joyous and beautiful depiction of young romance which is so unbelievably dreadfully thrust into a continuous downward spiral of tragedy and disaster and if this hurricane of tragedy unrequited emotions and heavy guilt isnt enough the story is topped off with quite possibly the most tragic heart wrenching plot point in recent years as the old version of the briony character played by vanessa redgrave comes clean with a shocking revelation in all the storytelling structure of the film is fascinating and absolutely thrilling to witness the same events are shown from multiple reverse angles midway through the story relentlessly jumps forward to a time after what we know were years of pain and agony for our protagonists and finally the footnote at the end of the film the gutwrenching revelation which throws everything into question and shines a stark illuminating light on the true nature of the films emotional tragedywright this being his second directorial work after pride and prejudice manages to most exceptionally capture the very balance of the work the balance between broad themes of love betrayal tragedy and and between the fine simplicities and nuances such as how his characters talk act and interact the film features a stunning balance on wrights part between sequences of a thrilling epic nature and scenes of beautiful nuance and subtlety the entire film has a kind of driving energy behind it propelling the scenes forward in a relentless pace wright manages to turn brionys pressing triumphant dash through the long hallways of her home in order to show off her newly finished play into a fantastically thrilling scene of excitement and urgency utilizing all of the cinematic tools available to him utilizing all these elements wright displays an uncanny technical and cinematic virtuosity incarnated in all of the cinematic elements the film has to offerwright further guarantees his status as a directorial force to be reckoned with in the starmaking performances by his young cast kiera knightley had already proved her acting talent in her oscarnominated performance in pride and prejudice incidentally also directed by joe wright but it is in that she delivers her most wonderful mature and best performance of her career so far she carries with her an air of maturity elegance and grace and of course perpetual beauty and snaps out her high class lines with such incredible crass and rapidity one can simply see the young adventurous lust just waiting to burst out from underneath james mcavoy whose star has been on the constant rise since his starring role in last years the last king of scotland is sure to get a welldeserved kick into leading man recognition and his incredibly intense and wonderfully romantic turn in this film is also a career best both these actors essentially deliver two roles the first half depicts their beautiful adolescent blooming romance and they play the characters so charmingly we cant help but feel that nobody in the world deserves more to be together than they to but in the second half of the film after the tragedy both portray different versions of their younger selves obviously older and more mature but also skeptic heartbroken and desperately obsessively holding on to the smallest thread of hope they both have of reuniting the real stunner in the show though is young saoirse ronan who plays the 13yearold version of briony with such precise calculated intelligence that the girl is truly frightful her prepubescent impatience immaturity anger and jealousy seem dangerously harmless at first but we soon learn that she carries within her an immense destructive power the reciprocations of which show on both the 18yearold version and the older version of herselfimpressive as it is it is nothing new for a directors sophomore cinematic venture to be so skillful pulp fiction rushmore boogie nights and requiem for a dream are merely a few examples of directors sophomore frames but what makes truly extraordinary as a directors second feature is that it is not the work of a very talented and devoted film geek but rather a seminal beautiful piece of work striking in its resonant thematic prominence its maturity and also its wondrous display of cinematic aptitude joe wright has directed not one but two period works and pride and prejudice one would come to expect from an older generation of filmmakers such as james ivory michael apted or shekhar kapur  and wright is only 35 years old he is without a doubt the youngest director who has managed to capture the precise restraint and calculated technical proficiency to create a good period picture and with manages to create much more than that suffice it to say that wright is a director to watch and if pride and prejudice had me interested in his upcoming projects after i now eagerly anticipate them i hope for more of the best from him and from all of the films cast and crew who should all get welldeserved career boosts due to the films critical success,sad
a cracking piece of filmmaking thisbeautifully filmed acted and realised this has to be the movie of the year there is one scene when the soldiers arrive at dunkirk which is quite simply breathtakingthe plot is a joy and presented in a way to keep the viewer guessing and intrigued there is an ominous feel to the opening scenes as a precursor to the later scenes but many funny moments this is aided by an excellent soundtrack compare the witty use of typing in the score and how it is echoed in gunfire later onkeira knightley and james mcavoy really earn their acting stripes here  these are subtle and deeply emotional but also wonderfully repressed performanceshats off to joe wright,sad
certainly overrated as one of the highest reviewed films of the year nonetheless provides viewers with the epic scope and cinematic grandeur that some of the best british period pieces have provided in the past cinematography set design and direction seems to elevate this somewhat generic tale of illfated lovers into a stratosphere of high artit is notfirstly the film is being advertised inappropriately as an intense love story shared between two well known leads rather keira knightley and james mcavoys overworked chemistry take a back stage to a third party who in fact revolves around the entire main story instead most romance between these two characters merely comes as an afterthought inside this troubled characters mind leaving the movie with perhaps a bit more metaphysical appeal but taking away substantially from the emotional impact the plot itself at times feels shamelessly light often coming across like a classy soap opera instead of the powerful piece of fiction much hype has suggestedis certainly worth the watch if nothing more then for the scenery and a few exquisite shots the beach war tracking shot in particular was stunning and one of the most impressive takes with massive amounts of extras seen recentlyjust try to enjoy the lightness of it all instead of ending up scratching your head wondering where all the bonafide passion actually is,sad
teenage angst war love regret redemption and the power of words all these themes are beautifully tied together in which is quite simply one of the best literary adaptations of all time it is so good in fact that i feel compelled to discourage viewers from reading the book before they see the movie as ian mcewans striking audacious prose is impossible to resist but will also lessen the impact of the most shocking film epilogue ive seen this yearmuch more adult than director joe wrights previous pairing with keira knightley pride  prejudice is quite similar to capote in its analysis of the writing process and the sacrifices the author has to make the author in question is briony tallis saoirse ronan a 13year old who is going to have her cousins perform a play she has written the occasion being a dinner party at the family estate in the british countryside the year is 1935 during the preparations she notices the sexual tension between her older sister cecilia knightley and gardener robbie turner james mcavoy and misinterprets certain signals leading to a pretty big lie that ruins the evening and destroys the young lovers futurethe film then cuts to world war ii deftly moving from a merchantivory england to a ravaged france where robbie is stationed and forced to witness atrocities every day his only consolation being the hope that he will meet cecilia again some day back in london instead both of the tallis sisters work as nurses albeit completely isolated from one another leaving briony romola garai with plenty of time to think about her mistake and plan what to say should all three ever happen to be in the same room one last timealthough i said this is primarily a movie about writing another key theme that never leaves the picture is a painful reflection on lost youth evident in the casting choices almost all the roles are played by twentysomethings the more adult parts like brenda blethyns cameo are so brief they barely matter and every single scene focuses on either briony cecilia or robbie emphasizing how one little event altered three lives radically such attention to character requires good acting and the performances are all equally superb mcavoy sad and angry carries the films second half with no fatigue at all knightley is dark complex and very sensual in her first adult role and the ronangarai duo embody the young scribblers ambition and ingenuousness with impressive sincerityevery bit as seductive are the visuals further proof of the great eye wright had displayed on pride and prejudice none of the beautiful sequences however are there merely for their own sake each and every one of them even when evoking the directors previous work the fog and rain look very familiar having the purpose of setting a specific mood a task in which they succeed at all times one sequence in particular blends wrights unique visual style with the impenetrable sadness he intends to convey a fiveminute tracking shot that follows roobies walk on a french beach amongst mutilations deaths and overall suffering not since scorsese followed ray liotta and lorraine bracco through the copacabanas rear entrance has a long take stuck in my memory with the same intensity also notable is the movies only sex scene which no matter how tender leaves an omen of tragedy in the air making the tormented love story even more excruciating to watchand yet for all the great thesping editing and lensing is fundamentally a story about the impact of the written word the best writers are those who manage to trigger contrasting feelings in the reader often simultaneously which is why the bold relentlessly cruel epilogue featuring a priceless vanessa redgrave as the aged briony is so moving and infuriating in its controlled manipulation of what has just been seen a masterpiece,sad
this movie tops my list for absolutely positively the worst movie ever made i have seen cleopatra showgirls tons of adam sandler movies and all about steve which does come in a close second but with out doubt this is the worst movie of all time it is pompous and awful it is so bad that i dont know where to begin there are so many people that herald this a good movie on imdb even the professional critics reviewed it positively it was even nominated for an oscar for best picture ugh  just shows how irrelevant awards are this is where great production and a grandiose story along with some misguided critics can lead to garbage being considered good and brainwashing viewers into agreeing  must conform basically the movie has no plot which means there isnt a lot to discuss and also jumps through time awkwardly then when you learn what the main character did and how she tries to atone it just feels false and falls flat considering what she initially did was quite unforgivable and still is then the end tries to be overly sentimental and instead is moronic this movie is bad bad bad,sad
to put it bluntly this film is a virulent mess i mean who wouldve thunk it after joe wrights shimmering triumphs in pride and prejudice and charles ii the power and the passion and this cast and this ian mcewan storyline worthy of graham greene and a best picture bafta it stinks and heres how it apparently happened wrights florid cinematics worked well in his earlier two enterprises because of the strengths of the characters and the compelling story lines that held a great deal of interest via action and resulting character development in this film we find a context of greater introversion and subtlety and the hope was that wright would tone things down a little instead he goes the opposite way attempting to create a singular grafting of camera and musical themes including typewriter key sounds that defines rather than underpins the filmjoe wright is not darren aranovsky however and ultimately the result is gratingly selfconscious and infuriatingly pretentious consistently turning scenes into deflating lookatthis exercises and if this isnt enough wright attempts to turn the story into an cinematic epic apparently wishing to rival the english patient and for whom the bell tolls in scope and detail mcewans story doesnt lend itself well to this treatment so the film collapses under massively detailed expositions of wwii and other events that contribute nothing to the story the expositions themselves dont even ring true and the plots final twist almost seems anticlimactic under all of that weightultimately my distaste for the enterprise led me into the fastforwardlaugh mode  fastforwarding through the endless yawning pits of the superfluous landscape while laughing at the overall lost motivation of the film i havent done this with a major motion picture since braveheart but with braveheart i was laughing at the films unintentionally hilarious content not at its overall motivations 2 stars and hopefully the nadir of a very talented directors career,sad
2005s pride and prejudice is a work of genius 2007s however is the followup project where no one has the guts to tell the director to cut 40 minutes out of this pretentious meandering utterly contrived baitandswitch every hackneyed filmschool trick is employed in this english patientmeetsroshamonmeetsjacobs laddermeetsmanon des sources bore it even uses the have your seemingly raw ending but then make sure everyone leaves the theatre with an utterly unmotivated bittersweet smile device they topped off that abomination titanic with excellent actors and photography cannot save this fundamentally flawed storyline,sad
if you are looking for another review to tell you how is the best acted best adapted best costumed and so on movie of the year please stop reading i dont disagree with that i simply feel dutybound to tell you why it is still a bad movieis a period piece set in 1935 and onwards it follows the life of briony tallis played by three actresses in the course of her life including vanessa redgrave we see how her error of judgement destroys the lives of at least two other people she never does actually atone for her wrong although she ultimately finds a way of telling a second lie more openly to do the best she can in her own head excessively high production values superlative acting and a generally interesting story blind to us the moral bankruptcy of our tale a tale that has moral values as its focus we come out of the cinema saying how interesting it was but have accepted complicity in the same errors it purports to addresscecilia tallis kiera knightley lives a life of wealth and privilege in her familys gothic mansion she is having a tempestuous affair with robbie james mcavoy the housekeepers son cecilias younger sister briony is still a child but briony is at that cusp where hormones start to play havoc she has been raised in a typical atmosphere of sexual hypocrisy with an imagination informed more by her precocious skill as an author and playwright than any understanding of humanity she is only too ready to believe that most sex is evil sex from a commoner is probably worse it is not long before some indiscretions on the part of cecilia and robbie allow briony to form a wicked picture of the young manwhen briony witnesses a genuinely horrific sexual act she makes a false accusation against robbie the power structures of wealth and class soon close ranks with briony she spends the rest of her life not only screwed up by victorian values but by her own overarching sense of guilt for what she has done the real victim of the crime  and real perpetrator  are tidied up as mere plot loose endsi have not read the book and cannot comment on whether the original novel is as hypnotic glossy  and essentially vacuous but i am given to understand that ian mcewan is happy with the screen versionlike a modern lady macbeth there is a rather overly obvious handscrubbing reference briony is unable to assuage her guilt and like the very powerforces that gave her childish lie such strength the wealth skill and moral righteousness thrown into this movie con us into believing it is anything but superficial the acting is faultless i have been critical of knightley in her pride  prejudice oscarnominated role but here she does clipped slightly stroppy cecilia to perfection much of the lauded talent from that earlier film has been reassembled and it is almost as if they are having another shot at the oscars they narrowly missed before acting costume and art direction and a few more the middle section focussing on dunkirk has many oscar worthy moments such as when lovesick robbiemcavoy is silhouetted against a cinema screen kiss or the long panning shot of the desolate battlefield that mirrors his inner desolation but they are done selfconsciously the screen silhouette for instance is repeated in case we didnt get the significance the first time by the end of act two i was convinced that the filmmakers were not going to let a lack of anything constructive to say get in the way of a good academy attempt we are invited to marvel at the films elegiac quality indeed there is much to admire but its selfconceit goes on for a rather long time and at the end blame has been placed in all the wrong places it even hints that as a last resort stories are better than the truth,sad
unfortunately this film is unbelievable in the less charitable sense of the wordit is holed below the waterline by the same deficiencies that for me sank the novel ian mcewan seems to lead a charmed life as a booker banker but the reasons remain puzzling he can certainly write well if unexceptionally but his plot lines are full of the kind of incredible conceits that are difficult to take seriously as a result their professed moral import turns to dust on the slightest scrutinyin this case the mistakenly sent letter and more outrageously still the false accusation serve as mcguffins to generate the narrative but undermine any kind of moral consistency is it possible that a precocious and impressionable young girl could deliberately accuse another of such a crime out of a fit of jealous pique well conceivably is it possible that a family that had taken the accused under its wing educated him at great expense and sought to secure his future take that accusation without any real investigation in the book or the film not conceivably as a result of the ineptitude with which this situation is portrayed the rest of the film loses any sense of tension or interestthe final section with the fictionalised fiction which comes off much better in the book worked less well in the film while the stilted and contrived interview simply came across as a rather desperate bit of exposition and ultimately the idea that briony could atone for her behaviour by writing a happy ending to the tale of two destroyed lives bears little examination  rendering the whole novelfilm otiosei cant fault the direction which is what one would expect of a traditional approach to a traditional novel the acting of what was a pretty undemanding script was fine but hardly oscar material which leaves one pondering as to how it has garnered so many accolades,sad
the film had great potential but when you leave a theater and a mist the talk you hear that people were disappointed just like you then you know the film was not good knightley and mcavoy are only together in the movie for 10 minutes and have but a moment together the film starts off in a interesting manner but becomes confusing as the timecontinues on when compared to movies like the notebook or titanic as the commercials state is not the best since when in fact it is noteven entertaining if you have to see this movie then go when it is cheap because you will regret paying 8 dollars for something that is less quality then a movie at a rental store,sad
i loved the book so awaited joe wrights adaptation with mixed feelingswould it do the book justice or would i be forever disappointed to see the wrong interpretation i decided to go to toronto to see it at the film festival to find outbottom line i was so relieved its a beautiful story and the casting and sets and staging are wonderful almost to the point of distractionmy only complaints were a hallmark card type of scene at the end of cecelia and robbie happily cavorting on a beach very not ian mcewans styleand the decision not to include the final scene of the book where brionys very young cousins finally stage her play the trials of arabella which started the story going 60 years earlier i think that scene beautifully brought the story to a close and wished they had included it in the filmbut other than that no complaints and i cant wait to see it again,sad
such talented actorsjames mcavoy  keira knightley but what a waste of time this movie isnever ever you get a romantic feeling nor you get a kind of dramathis was more of an overacting dramajust one lie separated true from falsethat changed few livesno this is just so weak kind of love storyand in the movie you never feel any romanticismtotally lacking in emotion as well as a weak plotthis is a strange movie  i dont get it how people are saying its the best they have seensurely this is not the bestlacks terribly in emotions and i am sure many would see this oncebut you wont want to waste your time to watch it againi cant give good reviews for this oneneither it is grippingnor a kind of good storytellingthis isi feel very much boringdont repent laterafter seeing this,sad
this movie was very painful to watch robbie was the one redeemable character in this entire movie unless you count the doctor that told briany she had that horrible disease it would have been sweet to be him i gave them their happinessdirect quote from the fossilized version of briany at the end of the movie where she claims that her bile churning final novel was her way of atoning for her idiocy i guess the next time i do something awful i should just write a little story where the people i hurt get a ponyi dont care that the movie didnt have a happy ending being told in a tv interview that the previous hour and a half of my life spent watching this movie never truly happened within the story is maddening choo choo railroading at its worst for those of you that dont know what railroading is it is when the author or story teller gives no hint about the final plot twist or the big reveal and then suddenly drops it on you in the last five minutes and expects your mind to be blownto sum it up this movie sucked because 1 it took itself too seriouslyit was not that deep 2 it took way too long to tell us a little lying delilah is sorryawesome,sad
what is up with all these 1 and 2 star reviews even if the film differs from the novel by ian mcewan which i would not know as i have not read the book yet at least take this film for what it is  a beautiful  haunting story of a love torn apart by a childs mistake and stop making comparisons of how bad this film is compared to the book because it deserves to be judged on its own right too the story is gorgeous  james mcavoy and keria knightley play the lovers robbie turner and cecilia tallis who upon finally admitting their feelings for each other are torn apart as robbie is sent to prison for allegedly raping the tallis cousin lola quincey however robbie was not guilty and was only thought so because cecilias younger sister briony tallis jumped to the wrong conclusion the remainder of the film tells of what happens to robbie cecilia and tallis years after this event and ultimately whether the lovers ever managed to be together and have the happy ending they deservedthis film is achingly sad  all about lost opportunities what may have been contrasted to what was and how a single mistake can rip apart a persons entire life 3 people suffered greatly at the hands of the lie and the film is about brionys attempts to repair the wound she created because as she grew up she realised how devastatingly wrong her actions were the acting in this film is superb i have always been a fan of james mcavoy and this is probably my favourite performance by him  mcavoy acts with such subtlety and intensity in every scene you can feel his emotions exactly what the character of robbie is feeling even when he doesnt say a single word ive never been the biggest fan of keira knightley actually i believe her acting in the potc films is quite simply dreadful but she blew me away as cecilia tallis  i dont know whether she felt more at home with this type of character or whether her movie experiences since have improved her acting skills drastically but she embodied the character of cecilia perfectly playing the party very very well but my favourite performance by far has to be from saoirse ronan very unusual name as the 13 year old briony tallis  it is one of those instances where you dont even realise this is an actor playing a part  she was entirely believable and more than faultless in her performancethis is a beautiful film that i believe will be remembered in many years to come it thoroughly deserves every one of those 5 stars i have given it and probably more it is a subtle intense hauntingly beautiful film with brilliant acting phenomenal direction a very good script though how much of that came straight out of the novel i do not know and even a perfect soundtrack faultless and beautiful watch it now,sad
this movie is a greatmagnificent romance movie and also in my opinionthe best movie of 2007i personally not only hate new stupidmeaninglessheroic movies but also i called them the menace to movie industrywhilst many great directors like alfred hitchcockcbilly wildersydney lumetjohn ford and so on took a lot of perseverance to create a thoughtful framework or criteria for different genres of moviesthe othersi mean directors who just make movie to gain money and popularitymovies like supermanspidermantrespass those principle and ignore themanywaynot only is not an ordinarymeaningless moviebut an extraordinary movie which tries to convey the real meaning of lovepassion and how easily stupidity could destroy thatdirectorjoe writehas perfectly made this moviesee this moviebe sure that you wont regret it,sad
as a lifelong admirer of movies i have come to believe that everyone has a cinematic sense the way they would envision of a film of their own beautifies my own cinematic sense thus i relate so intensely to director joe wrights techniques though he admits to his beautiful emotional near logistically impossible tracking shot that entirely composes the powerful dunkirk evacuation sequence as showing off that doesnt matter because the impression with which it furnishes us is that of an uninterrupted perspective not james mcavoys but ours as we behold the juxtaposition of what he is ceaselessly seeing and his reaction to it each scene is its own selfcontained short film almost as if kurosawa had directed this film kurosawa was never as hyperkinetic or confronting as wright the visual language of has the same tautness and precision serving as genesis of an emotional response as sanjuro seven samurai or one wonderful sundaywrights meticulous stylization is thorough and consistent as it isnt simply lathered on top of the story but is essentially the storyteller enhancing and driving the story segregating itself as its own version of ian mcewans novel rather than simply a novel told on film each scene flows seamlessly into the next a tremendous credit that goes to the editing as well as the already honored cinematography creating an amalgam of each characters point of view of the same events their different reactions our own reactions the achingly longedfor fantasies the characters attempt to will into reality and of course reality itselfkeira knightley and mcavoy are airtight within the feelings and personal interpretations of an upperenglish student and the son of her parents housekeeper sharing an obstructed and undying love and animal attraction however it is saoirse ronan the young girl who plays the 13yearold version of knightleys avidly creative younger sister portraying a stage in the younger sisters life that has yet to realize the overwhelming regret she will endure its vanessa redgraves portrayal of her in the final stage of her life that almost magically reflects ronan something you cannot just plandespite recent achievements in american film that have shattered standards and transcended the capabilities of each aspect of the medium outdoes in both departments its hard to bring to mind the last time i saw a movie so alive in all departments i was even fascinated with the way people smoked in the film even the music goes beyond the expectations of even masterfully done films as it takes the form of the uniform sounds recognized in the characters lives masking itself as the manysensed rhythm of the story2007 is a tremendous year for american movies one of the best in its history it would only be right for to receive the praise recognition and accolades with which other masterpieces of 2007 are awash,sad
note i am not being a troll and bashing the movie i am simply showing that i did not like the film and would like to hear your opinions not arguments please this is a review i had to write for a school paper and i would welcome criticism on how it is written not on my opinions here goes after all the hype about joe wrights recently released new audiences undoubtedly suspect to see something amazing and forever life changing a new epic that rewrites all the rules and yet falls into place with many of the old classic love stories however this movie is devastatingly disappointing kiera knightly celia tallis and james mcavoy robbie turner star with a cast of nameless actors to create a poor representation of a classic british romance novel by ian mcewan the movie starts in england right before the outbreak of world war two soontobe lovers cecilia tallis and robbie turner are both back for the summer from cambridge and a family a mother and three children perriot jackson and lola are staying with the tallis family while they undergo a divorce through a chain of unnecessarily complicated occurrences and events all rooted in the foolishness and lies of briney celias 13yearold sister robbie is wrongfully accused and convicted of lolas rape and the pair of lovers are separated the plot drags on and on from there involving excessive and long scenes that do nothing to further the audiences perception of the era or conflictto further the disappointment the story line is butchered by a series of flashbacks and divisions used to explain the misconceptions behind opposing points of view and makes grasping the reality nearly impossible for the average moviegoer although the acting was average knightly disappointed audiences with a lack of enthusiasm and failed to fit the role in addition the screenplay was very poor and the actors talked incredibly too fast while failing to enunciate or put emphasis on any conversation the only refreshing part of the film is the fact that it differs from the average chickflick in that it does not have a fairytale ending the interestingly twisted plot and surprise ending do well to redeem the film but also serves as a let down for a hopeful audience in fact if you manage to follow the situational maze of the film you might actually enjoy the work however if you are an average person that does not want to feel like jumping off of a bridge at the end of a movie i would strongly advise you against watching the fiasco,sad
this had to be one of the slowest movies i have ever seen had i not been with two friends i would have left i do not understand what anyone sees in this film other than the character of robbie the characters were bored boring selfabsorbed rich people and i couldnt care less about any of them the relationship between cecelia and robbie can hardly be described as a love story let alone a great one poor robbie to have fallen in love or is that lust with such a spoiled and vain girl her treatment of him is crass she plays with his affections then ignores him at university makes it clear that he is beneath her and then engages in a moment of passionate and lust in the library this is not love it is not even a good imitation of lovethe only compliment i can give to this film is the cinematography the acting was fine but not stupendous and for gods sake someone feed keira knightly she is a poster child for anorexia,sad
 then im pretty sure you still got a good shot at finding something better to do that watching this movieim a big fan of epic movies with a plot that makes you think for days movies that touch you in some way and in the end makes you wonder about what really happened in the movie this movie will definitely make you wonder not what happened but why you spent that much time watching itkeira knightley plays her role as good as it can be played enough said rest of the acting is pretty good as well but that simply is not enough to carry a movie the plot simply isnt there its basically about a girl who tells a lie and puts her sisters boyfriend to prison we see incoherent scenes from his years in prison and then later on we follow him at war then he meets his old girl knightley again and they get together thats mainly the plot in this movie theres nothing epic nothing new in this moviethe only reason i could think of makes people think is that it constantly jumps in time it sees everything from two angles which is pretty annoying if you ask me first we see something through the eyes of one person then the exact same scene through another persons eyes now if you want to see shitloads of boring scenes go watch dirty dancing if you want to see just as many boring scenes  twice  then watch this movieill give it 3 stars for the good acting and well even though they failed miserably at making a good movie at least they tried,sad
incoherent plot jumpy story flow characters are all under developed this is not a first class movie experiencethe main element of the story has completed in the first 45 minutes of the prewar story the whole thing happened during war time is pretty much irrelevant characters stopped develop in those scenes and only simply walk around and day dreaming about the past some good things about this movie are cinematography costume and art direction which worked together nicely and gave you an authentic wwii period feel this is evident in that this movie is nominated in all these 3 categories for oscar this year,sad
so it seems anthony minghella has a successor two years after his feature debut a pleasant adaptation of jane austens classic novel pride  prejudice joe wright makes another good feature  a movie that shamelessly screams oscar both minghella and wright have proved their undeniable visual talent and taste for megalomania the biggest compliment i can give is that its better than minghellas the english patient although its been almost equally overrateddont get me wrong i enjoyed the movie but its not particularly memorable what really bothers me is the old formula that is so finely used here a gorgeouslooking couple of protagonists james mcavoy and pouting queen keira knightley stunning cinematography by seamus mcgarvey the hours classy music score by dario marianelli pretty costumes by jacqueline durran to tell a tragic story of love and war based of course on a bestseller by ian mcewan the cast is precise mcavoy officially the new jude law gives a good performance although not half as impressive as his turn opposite forest whitaker in the last king of scotland saoirse ronan romola garai and vanessa redgrave are all good as the antiheroine briony tallis but no one really gives that performance keira doesnt ruin the movie because she didnt have much to do except looking pretty which shes great at and sad all the time but she still needs some acting lessons  this girl is definitely one of the most overrated young actresses of our timeundoubtedly is a feast for the eyes and has elements to please romantic audiences and critics alike however its emotional sterility shows that wright can be minghellas successor but is still miles away from a master of beauty and heart like the great david lean 710,sad
briony saoirse ronan a precocious thirteen year old and young adult cecelia keira knightley are the daughters of a wealthy landowning family of britain an aspiring writer briony is highly observant of any and all activity surrounding her small world one day she happens upon her sister not once but twice in a romantic encounter with robbie james mcavoy robbie is the son of a household staff member brenda blethyn and has worked on the gardens of the estate but he has also been educated by the familys patriarch he is an intelligent and handsome man with a good heart however briony also has a crush on robbie and her jealousy sets off a tragic state of affairs when two young male cousins of the girls dropped off at the mansion by divorcing parents decide to run away the entire household searches for them in the dark of night when briony flashlight in hand stumbles across a man assaulting the young cousins sister she decides to tell the police that robbie is the rapist it is categorically untrue but alas robbie is sent to jail five years later robbie is let out of prison to become a soldier for britian in world war i and cecelia too runs away from her family to work as a military nurse the couple still greatly in love meet briefly but make plans to be together forever when the war is over briony too enlists as a nurse and tries to contact her sister to ask for forgiveness and to make amends but can anything atone for the ruination of two lives this is a movie of astonishing tragic beauty the principal actors knightley ronan blethyn mcavoy vanessa redgrave and others are all superlative giving it their all as the doomed complex characters equally beautiful are the costumes the settings and the cinematography for it would hard to find a more breathtakingly sumptuous film yet even then it is the story and the direction that should receive the most applause this is a tale of woe on an epic scale very intricate and very unsettling more importantly the direction is amazing with happenings often told twice from different perspectives with seamless and subtle integration the result is a work of art of the highest degree deserving of infinite praise in short do not miss it can send any serious film viewer into a rapturous state of mind,sad
is an intelligent scrupulously crafted film boasting lovely images and high production values it is also cold antiseptic and artificials best feature is the chemistry between the aristocratic cecilia keira knightley and her familys servant robbie james mcavoy mcavoy especially is a revelation one hopes that he will be handed many more roles and soon in which he can do what he did here play a dreamyeyed innocent and young slave to passionwarning this review will reveal the surprise ending of if you dont want to know how the movie ends dont read this reviewatonements opening scenes telegraph that its major focus is not love or even human beings rathers focus is the problems facing writers is an intellectual exercise an essay on the writers life and the role of fictionopens with a shot of an english manor house but wait  its not a manor house at all but a doll house replica in the bedroom of briony tallis saoirse ronan a 13yearold upper class english girl and playwright and so the frame the point of view and the theme of the movie is set this wont be a story about its ostensible main characters  the lovers cecilia and robbie at all  rather it is a story focused on briony telling a story that suits her needs and desiressymbolism is portentous and beats the viewer on the head  almost literally since the movie is all about the job of the fiction writer the sound of typewriter keys striking paper a ball striking a wall heels clicking down a hallway all segue into the soundtracks savage drumbeat percussion there is plenty of water symbolism including briony  pronounced brineys  name also much is made of light the opening daytime scenes at the english manor house are overexposed briony is lead to a fateful encounter thanks to a shiny pin a desk lamp blinds her and distorts what she sees with all this light and water you may want to bring your sunscreenbriony is that most clichd of characters  a straightlaced english female who superficially recoils from sex but secretly burns with passion and jealousy her selfcontrol is stereotypically destructive brionys bedroom walls are covered with wallpaper depicting pullulating foliage a bee symbol of something sweet  honey  dangerous and female  beats loudly percussively against brionys bedroom window one thinks of high wind to jamaica and other english works in which a cosseted english girl wreaks havoc once her inner savage is let outbriony believes that robbie is guilty of assaulting a child lola lola was assaulted but she and briony accuse the wrong man in short females are guilty when men violate them on brionys word alone robbie is parted from his love cecilia and sent to prison this is not presented convincingly robbie had an alibi  he had been rescuing two lost boys as the boys can attest too he is his masters prize though the son of a scullery maid his master is sending him to medical school and cecilia loves him why the courts would take the word of a 13yearold known fabulist against that of her better educated and older sister is never made cleara good movie could have explored how the courts were weighted against a working class man accused of assault and on cecilias sticking by her working class lover in spite of everything but simply cheats it skips the work of its own plot and jumps to the 1940 english retreat from the nazis at dunkirk exposition informs us that robbie had gotten out of prison by joining the army film fans have made much of the fiveandahalf minute long singletake tracking shot of the chaotic scene on the beach with english forces shooting their horses and destroying equipment in order that they might not fall into nazi handswhile watching this scene i thought to myself well weve just left the movie nothing in this dunkirk tracking shot does anything to advance previous narrative or themes its as if the author ran out of ideas and said hey wasnt there a very cinematic war going on nearby at this very time lets nip over to france for a while and exploit the wartime scenery robbie dies of war wounds while waiting to be evacuated from dunkirk cecilia dies when a tube station is flooded more water symbolismyears later briony now vanessa redgrave would that we all morphed into vanessa redgrave as we aged is a famous novelist and is telling the story on a tv talk show with one change  in her fictionalized memoir of the events briony has provided a happy ending she allows her characters robbie and cecilia to survive the war and to retire to a lovely sunny beach house more light and water where they spend their days gazing into each others eyes and smooching briony you see has been eaten up with guilt for having accused robbie of a crime he did not commit to make up for that to atone for ruining her sister and her sisters lovers lives briony writes a happy novel based on their experienceswhich is all very clever and as evidenced by reviews here for many viewers its very moving i felt this movies intellectual manipulative hand against my chest  in the heavy handed symbolism in the clichd plot devices and in the underdeveloped characters the viewer learns nothing about cecilia or robbie except that they are both young and good looking and hot for each other and that they speak with those posh british accents weve come to associate with quality entertainmentbut his must be said again  james mcavoy is brilliant and should be working right now on more and better films,sad
will touch anyone the acting is amazing from everyone kiera knightley and james mcavoy had amazing chemistry and both deserve academy award nominations at least also the young saoirse ronan was fantastic and the best of all 3 brionys although there was disturbing images the film is suited for anyone a person can find the film funny gross touching and of course sad the ending of the movie was both happy and sad certain people will find upsetting and awful and others will find it happy and good i felt both and would not recommend it to anyone who does not like feeling bad or knowing that the world is perfect but for everyone else it is perfect great film overall and deserves an 85 or 9,sad
i waited several months to see this movie after finally seeing it it was hard for me to decide whether i really enjoyed it or not my expectations as the advertisement built it up as if it were the next english patient to a degree it has some similarities with the flashbacks and romance but instead of the story being told by the lovers it is told by a third party in 1935 13yearold apprentice writer briony tallis saoirse ronan and her family live a life of wealth and luxury in their enormous mansion robbie turner james mcavoy the familys grounds keeper has feelings for brionys older sister cecilia ms knightley he hopes she has similar feelings towards him all it will take is one spark for this relationship to illuminate when it does briony who has a crush on robbie is compelled to interfere going so far as accusing robbie of a crime he did not commit cecilia and robbie declare their love for each other but he is arrested by brionys false witness the course of three lives is changed forever later on in life briony comes to her senses and realizes what she had done and seeks foran interesting aspect to the film was how well it showed different perspectives for instance there is a scene where robbie and cecelia stand and talk near a fountain it first shows a 13 year old briony looking at them through a window wondering what theyre talking about right after that the film shows the same scene through robbies and cecelias viewpoint of what they actually said and did the editing was unpredictable at times and made me somewhat confused but the more i thought about it the more interested and engrossed i felt about the movie it was like reading the original novel leaving the audience to ponder on whatll happen next and how everything would be tied together the 130 minute film was not set at quick pace but the characters different stories and viewpoints made it an enjoyable and deep thought movie the direction was absolutely breathtaking one of the most amazing scenes in the movie was when robbie entered dunkirk the camera has one aerial shot and then pulls to his viewpoint of the chaos and tragedy the cinematography was beautiful and suited the tone for the time period the score by dario marianelli really set the mood for the film when something sad happened in the film the music was sad when something suspenseful happened it was uplifting however i felt sometimes that the music may have been overdone in a few scenes the performances were wonderful keira knightley is brilliant as cecilia theres no doubt that shell get a second nomination for best actress james mcavoy whom i felt was perfect in the last king of scotland was astonishing of the many scenes he was in the movie the one scene that moved me most was when he comes upon a group of dead school children it was a very emotional scene but the tears in his eyes were even more moving he should definitely get the best actor i cant forget to mention the supporting cast either the three actresses who played briony from saoirse ronan at 13 romola garai at 18 and vanessa redgrave at old age were all amazing of the three i feel that saorise ronan did the best job unlike many child thespians she was not rehearsed i could easily understand her feelings and motives overall this was an excellent movie this has not been the best year for movies like the last few years but this is the best i have seen for this year i can see at least ten oscar nominations coming its way including best picture 1010,sad
ladies and gentlemen a hand for director joe wright he has crafted a masterpiece with resemblances to films like cold mountain and a very long engagement is just so much more visually stunning intellectually stimulating and forever heartbreaking wright has made a movie like no other this year sure i have seen perfect films this year for lack of a better word but even gone baby gone winds up far down the list when compared to all 1010 films ive seen and given that mark to this is the first film all year that i can truly say is something i will buy and share with everyone i know i can only imagine how much greater ian mcewans novel upon which this is based can be from the start right on until the end we are shown a glimpse into the lives of the tallis family and those surrounding them it is a time of social status and proper manners an era led along by its rules and prejudices for a young girltoo nave and innocent to fully grasp what it is she seesthat world is a very dangerous playgroundthe backbone of the tale lies in the fact that everyone sees events and history through their own eyes what is the truth anyway unless you are privy to every second of an occurrence from its cause to its effect you can never really comprehend if that which you saw was real and even then it is a very fine line to walk is at all times playing with this notion showing us sequences from the eyes of the viewer and than again through those of the participants whereas the two lovers are afraid to let slip their social fauxpas of a relationship outside of classes the accuser is so set in the warped truth she believes that to think about the situation objectively is not at the front of her mindit is amazing how one moment in time can so utterly devastate the lives of all involved the consequences of which can never be imagined until years later after they have already occurred between robbie having to go to jail and than join the army in wwii for a crime he did not commit it is tough to watch his return to the house with the two young twins that he had been out trying to find totally oblivious to the crime that transpired while he was gone and his love cecilia tallis losing the one thing she didnt know she even had until a couple hours before it is tough to believe the orchestrator of all that sorrow would have it even worse cecilias sister briony did what she thought was right led into a lie by the victim herself and she would have to live with that regret and guilt for the rest of her life without any means to vindicate herself or make amends i dont even know if what she did could honestly ever be forgiven her sheltered aristocratic upbringing and wild storytelling imagination can be held accountable the times are at fault too for holding the weak words of a 13yearold as fact against an inferior servant boy no matter how much a part of the family he had become or how educated he wasdespite all the support it is the lead characters that carry this film keira knightley is amazing as cecilia growing out of her groomed lifestyle to be with the man she knows she has always loved the pain she must express and the hurt her love causes herself is believable at every turn i will admit to never seeing all the hype with her as an actress but that opinion has totally been wiped away as for robbie the man at the heart of it all james mcavoy has really come into his own sure he has been great in previous work even stealing scenes from oscar winner forest whitaker in the last king of scotland but it is his portrayal here that shows his true worth knowing his place in society he accepts his fate only when he finds out a few years later that his love was not a tenuous one is he allowed to breakdown and fight to survive the scene where he meets briony again many years after that fateful night is powerful to experience as emotions run high and wild all three actors in that scene delivernot to be overshadowed director joe wright deserves a lot of praise and credit too his handling of the material is impeccable and the end result glorious to behold from the editing style showing us all viewpoints of every situation to the sweeping crane shots following characters to the brilliant performances he gets out of all involved wright has a steady hand and complete control the film would be a top ten candidate as a result of just two sequences even if the rest were trash when the war hits brionys hospital the montage of carnage grief and compassion is overwhelming however it is the arrival of robbie and his two friends at dunkirk that takes the prize this elaborate long take is absolutely astonishing it begins with their arguing to a superior about getting back home going on to the slaughter of horses and automobiles a group of men singing some men on an amusement park ride losing the three men to eventually join up with them again as they rejoin each other at the bar across the way ending on an all encompassing view of the chaos on the beach stunning to behold that scene sums up the whole film with its artistry and attention to detail complete with a startling revelation at its conclusion i cant think of a better word than perfect for when i am ever asked what i thought of the film,sad
for anyone interested in seeing on the screen you must start with reading the book it is so beautifully written and the author ian mcewan lays out for the reader what it is like to have the attention of an audience and the responsibility that entails however if you dont have time to read it you will get a very close adaptation under the clever direction of joe wright and with an intricate score by dario marianelli the book is fully realized on the screen and as a viewer you will be rewarded wonderful performances were given by all actors involved the chemistry between knightly and mcavoy is a character unto itself even the small role of brenda blethyn as housekeeper is a powerful performance that deserves much praise what a struggle to see such wonderfully written novels not given the credit they are due on the big screen it is very apparent with that everyone involved with the film understood the sentiment of the book and has done it justice hardly a stuffy period piece is a house filled with intrigue and harsh realities enjoy,sad
it is poetry and beauty made film it should be enjoyed in a movie theater not at home just sit down relax and let yourself go with this great experience of intelligent and excellent film making this is what this business should be all about great movies with a wonderful script characters well described and impossibletoimprove acting this young director has a clear mind of how to make good movies every little detail is taken care of every set it better than the previous one is just amazing how a well written story does not have to tell you the day the year the exact location this is all superfluous to what the characters are going through james mcavoy is the soul and the center of it all he is the ultimately perfect leading man may be a little slow for those impatient helicopterexploding movie fans it suits better with a mature audience,sad
when we say something is full of life we generally take it in a very lively happy sense i want to use the same term for but in a different way yes is full of life but not just with in a usual positivity it has life throbbing through every moment with all passion melting in bitterness confusion guilt rage and repentance a story set in suffocating british aristocracy has a romance brewing with cecilia the elder daughter of an aristocrat and extraordinarily talented robbie son of his servant but the confusion and misunderstanding of the younger daughter briony messes up all their lives by accusing robbie of the crime he never committed as the world is on the brink of the world war and as a prisoner robbie chooses to fight in the war on the other hand cecilia still carries her emotions for robbie intact in her heart life is tough for these two but not as much as briony who realizes the consequences of her mistakes and tries to repent by giving up normal comforts but what is undone remains so cecilia and robbie have a hope that if the war ends soon they will be able to reunite briony wishes that too as she has been the reason behind creating the mayhem however the wishes never materialize as robbie and cecilia lose their lives in the war leaving briony to find the only possible way to bring them together the fictional way as she grows old towards the end of her life she writes a semiautobiographical novel where in the end cecilia and robbie get to live happily ever after the first and the most marvelous aspect of the movie is the way it is shot the way water sinks into sand at the redcar beach freezes that frame into your cinematic memoriesthe english country side and the life in contrast to the war tapestry in the second half simply exhibits remarkable filmmaking skills the acting complements the technicalities the screenplay and the flow of story telling in this medium is flawless to an extent that i wonder ian mcewans book could have made robbies suffering and hallucinations of the night before his death more poignant being a movie buff in europe has advantages i could at least watch a just released english film even before it released in the us just like most of the world that has seen im also waiting for how many oscar nominations it gets,sad
this is oscar material best picture material to be exact thats not necessarily saying that is something special it is a beautiful film based on a very sad novel direction and stage design are solid as are the performances and thats about the most that can be said about this movie its just a classic oscar contender in the vein of the cider house rules but doesnt really have many new things to offer conceptually or visually theres one really masterful long tracking shot in the movie but actually i thought it was kind of unnecessary as if it had just been there for the director of photography to show off a biti dont want to sound too negative though as this movie is actually very good and totally worthwhile seeing still if youre looking for more original films that came out this year youd be better off seeing across the universe or into the wild,sad
this film has stayed with me since i saw it last week and i think it will for a long time it is visually and emotionally beautiful and demands your attention from the very start i have read other books by ian mcewan but not  and i am now apprehensive of reading it for fear it will not live up to the film and as someone who 1 is usually unimpressed by keira knightley and 2 really rates ian mcewans other novels that is high praise indeed keira does well all actors involved are well cast but james mcavoy utterly steals the show a stunning performance and one that should warrant an oscar nomination you cannot help but fall in love with his character and although understated he will in turn make you smile swoon laugh out loud and weep the cinematography backs up his performance wonderfully the dunkirk scene lives up to the hype and the music is great extremely impressive film,sad
with all its expensive production values this film like so many others did not insist on clear diction even in important scenes keira knightley was a particularly bad offender but there were many othersthe camera work was often arty but irritating and restless and i am sorry to say that on the whole i thought it was a meretricious film a blessed moment of clear diction and moving acting came nearly at the end in the brief scene of briony as an old woman vanessa redgrave and that was then promptly followed by the last few corny and sentimental shots on the sea shore,sad
ranks as one of the classiest love stories told in recent years boosted by some brilliant color photography a lyrical background score a well crafted script and some fine ensemble performances keira knightley sometimes falters with her too clipped way of speaking and throwing away important lines but otherwise the cast is impeccablebasically its a dreamy looking tale of a wealthy family enjoying the summer days in the english countryside and there are hints of a gentle romance going on between a rather snobbish young woman knightley and a handyman at her fathers estate james mcavoy their obvious infatuation with each other only incites jealousy in her younger sister briony amazing performance from saoirse ronan who happens to spy on them from an upper window shes a girl who once threw herself at the young man by pretending to drown so that he would jump in and rescue her he does but is annoyed when he realizes she purposely pretended to drownfrom that point on the plot moves forward and backward in a structure that never becomes clumsy even though it moves between past events and present to tell the tale of how a single lie changes the course of three lives in director joe wrights hands the tale never becomes maudlin or too complicated to follow and we see the development of strong characters and are satisfied by the conclusion that the tale has been told in a very effective wayvanessa redgrave comes in toward the end as the older version of the young woman who told a lie and she has some surprising comments to make that wind up the tale in an oddly affecting waythe standout performances are given by saoirse ronan as young briony and james mcavoy mcavoy is impressive throughout totally in command of a difficult role almost emotionally draining in the films detailed war scenes that have him wandering around in an almost shellshocked manner his confrontational moments with the eighteen yearold briony ramola garai are brilliantly played by both performersmany stories have been told where a lie at the very center plays a part in extending the whole tale this one is very powerful and yet at the core remains a tender love story of tremendous emotional depththe background score by dario marianelli  distinguished by lots of piano music is highly effective in creating the many changing moods of the multilayered story,sad
this movie although many will go against this declaration is not for every type of viewer those who enjoy ampulous movies watching the production details or gasping against fabulous skies and fields for minutes and enjoy a lenghty slowly told story will like it those most likely men who enjoy another type of movies fast movies with fulfilling characters twists and sudden changes will be disappointed bymy partial disliking of the film however comes through another lane the story and semispoiler ahead centers mainly and poses the eye on the couple of robbie mcavoy and cecilia knieghtly and its relationship yet their relationship is nothing more than a sexual attraction arising from years of close living together their is no inner travels to their feelings but to their thoughts its a cold relationship moved by some impacts and problems that do not really satisfy the romantic cravelater we realize the focus and most compromising story gathers around briony a beautiful and genius saoirse ronan and her story of through a mistake she did we will appreciate the closing her development and she will be the most endurable characterthen why did the story hesitated in showing random scenes of robbie at war showing the despair of war that nothing has to do with the spine of the movie the story of lola doesnt bring much to the story but a device to fuel the conflicts neither does the long stays at hospitalswhy did they deviate the focus so much why did they change the optic on stories not knowing who finally is the backbone of the movie is beautiful has delicious camera works and stylized production values yet it is exhausting dipped into much detail and perspective the inner struggle of characters isnt fully developedif it was a tad less cold and more explicit in their sentiments i would have liked it more yet and i dont know why i recommend you to see it at least so you can get your own conclusion,sad
beautifully shot well scored with a well acted lead role for james mccavoy is still one of the worst films of the yearthe major problem lies in the ridiculous plotwitness the great confusion the leading man has posting a sexually explicit note to the girl he loves he doesnt want to give it to her so what does he do screw it up and throw it in the bin like he does with his other drafts no he sticks it in an envelopethe amazing and touching twist ending is obnoxious and insulting its on a par with bobby ewing waking up and finding that season 5 of dallas was a dream and weve wasted our time watching it more like taking the proverbialadded to that joe wright the director travels so far up his own rear with a 10 min tracking shot that portrays dunkirk as a giant freaks carnival that theres no coming backas i have said the 2 stars given are for some nice acting and great photography but the story is insulting for all those who like intelligent cinemaby the way for all you guys buying the misses a valentines present of an dvd this aint no date movie if the missus puts out after watching this you must be george clooney,sad
fantastic cinematography but that was the slowest most pointless movie i have ever seen there was potential to go somewhere but the direction was horrible and the acting was unnatural the ending was completely disappointing and the film had no character development at all with the possible exception of brionybeautiful movie but i would never watch it again i certainly hope the book is better than thiswhile the movie may be worthy of best cinematography mcavoy and knightley do not deserve acting awards they can do betterif you read the book and loved it then i can understand but as a person whos never read the book this movie seemed like it destroyed whatever artistic merit the book had,sad
i cannot begin to express how disappointed i ended up being in this film first of the all the flashback method that it was filmed in was annoying and confusing secondly it drug and drug in spots thirdly the entire premise of blaming what is basically a child for something that spans 70 years is absurd fourthly it was one of the most depressing movies ive ever seen and i thought pretentiousit reminded me of the english patient and was just as awful so it will probably win best pictureokay i now put on my flame suiti expected a wonderful epic and as one reviewer put it got a big turd awful,sad
this movie is nominated for so many awards mostly because its a drama and thats what always gets nominated its not that great if you have seen the trailer youve seen everything there is nothing new in between all the romance and all the war we expect from it is minimal i dont mind how a movie ends it can be happy or tragic or inconclusive as long as the middle section is good but this movie you wait and wait for it to kick off and it never happens its long it drags and its a bit boring i didnt get goosebumps from the romance you know that sigh feeling you get like when watching the notebook and i didnt clench my butt cheeks from suspense during his time in war as there is none the preview really over blew that part like i said if youve seen the trailer watch it twice and theres the whole movie not worth the 10 bucks just rent it ps just because a movie has great actors doesnt mean its going to be good by the way robbie the main character is more than a good actor hes great they couldve used his talent so much more so much potential there what a waste,sad
i have mixed feeling about this movie i tend to be a sentimental person so i enjoyed the love story very much my husband the logical one did not we both agreed that character development was a bit vague and there were a variety of story lines that never really seemed wrapped up joe wright is brilliant but he does not yet know how to tell a story clearly he uses every trick in the movie directors book to dazzle just for the sake of it instead it would be interesting to see him use his talent to really drive the story forward i did have moments where i felt the director was saying look at this gorgeous scene arent i brilliant yes the 5 minute dunkirk span is unbelievable but why is it being done wright does it because he can branagh used this technique to show the actual battlefield sorrow and destruction in henry v thus he uses it with purpose anyhow i digress i give mr wright huge credit for the performances he gets out of his actors keira knightly has real acting chops and james macavoy keeps his momentum from last king of scotland going their scenes together are very strong and carry real tension ronan is very good as young briony but the real unsung hero of this film is romola garai who approaches a difficult portion of the material with real panache and emotion she is a joy to watch even the supporting roles jump out at you of course vanessa redgrave takes a small part and makes it immensely emotional and powerful i would see the movie just for the performances all in all it is worth seeing,sad
i saw this movie about 24 hours after i finished reading the novel to paraphrase someone elses metaphor to compare the novel to this movie is like comparing a swiss army knife to a spork the parts are all there but somehow it never comes together much of the enjoyment derived from ian mcewans novel comes from his masterful and poetic use of the english language though his words are used in the movie dialog the internal musings are absent for instance the scene in which harriet walters is shown languishing in her bedroom with a sleeping mask covering her eyes seems out of place unless you know that in the novel mrs tallis suffers greatly from migraine so much so in fact that she has ceded the running of the household to cecilia a third of the novel is devoted to robbies war experience and the retreat of troops to dunkirk it was hard to read because of the horrors depicted the movie unfortunately reduces the utter senseless stupidity and violence of war to a series of expensive tracking shots as for the cast i think they were fine james mcavoy and keira knightly fit their roles but the movie never explains things that would have put their love story in believable context the love story seems bizarre unless you understand that these two characters had been close childhood friends they both attended cambridge  paid by her father and while there grew apart he graduated with distinction she barely passed now that theyve graduated her father has agreed to pay for his medical studies mrs tallis does not share her husbands sentiments she doesnt think it is a good idea remarking propheticallynothing good will come of it cecilia seems to share her mothers beliefs because she snubbed him socially while they were at university together its a shame really because all the elements are there its just they sort of hang,sad
there are many problems with this movie for me to recommend it all i can say is it has a good intention to be a good movie but sometimes thats just not enough its almost trying too hard to be something but the director couldnt make his mind between making a stylish film or telling a compelling story and it turned out neither stylish nor compelling it didnt engage me emotionally till the last 20 minutes but it was a little too late the middle part of movie is boring and it drags the war segment probably the most expensive to produce but has the least to say about anything other than how awful the war is clich there are a lot of time line jump around but it adds more confusion than suspension the story is not that complicated and the jump around is unnecessary knightleys one dimension acting ability is getting tiresome to watch since her promising pride and prejudice even the somewhat clever soundtrack by incorporating the sound in the story line is too obvious and showy if this movie were up for oscar race 2007 would be a very poor year,sad
seems more natural a subject for a novel rather than a film as it concerns writing and its momentous consequences be it a note a letter or a novel moreover has a writer at its centre and is therefore at an even greater disadvantage for filmmaking as the craft of writing is laborious and involves little physical action it is essentially a solitary even obsessive occupation and so doesnt lend itself to the active demands of a film but it may be argued that a clever imaginative film would find some way round this unfortunately is not a clever film instead its makers seem to have been rather complacent and smugly thought that the film would sell on the back of the alluring parts of the novel in other words a lavish country house in high summer where there is upstairsdownstairs class antagonism and illicit sex scandals and later a shift to a harsh wartime romance the filmmakers seem to have thought that this would suffice however stretched over two hours the film seems rather thin even threadbare the characters in the novel have unusual depth and subtlety while this has been retained to an extent in this adaptation on screen they seem unreal lifeless and with the exception of the three excellent actresses who play briony at different ages the no more than competent acting complements the competent but still lacking characterisation christopher hampton who usually engages as a writer and director has written a disappointing script which loses the charged sweltering promise of its first act which would actually have made a much better short film and gives way to a staid middle act which relies on wartime sentimentality and tries far too hard to elicit pathos in the viewerjoe wright seems content to direct as a calling card to hollywood and oscar his highpoint being the long scene showing the dunkirk evacuation which is technically accomplished and stunning but also wearying and approaching banality as this kind of thing has been done as well so many times before the films denouement seems tacked on to provide a smartlooking post modern endingis a disappointing and dispiriting adaptation of a clever intriguing novel,sad
i cant remember the last time i saw a movie with as disappointing of an ending as this one this movie does not deliver on the promises made in the advertisements in fact if you have seen the ads you already know everything in the movie just when it gets to the point where you expect the story to take off it ends with a hollow thud the makers of this movie either do not understand the meaning of the word or they are purposely deceitful the best things you can say about the movie are good acting and cinematography the dunkirk scene is amazing however in the end it is the story that is most important and it leaves you with a hollow feeling save yourself some disappointment and dont see it except on dvd,sad
starts off with a rather interesting and intriguing first part even though it is a bit long at times the choice of proposing two different points of view successively for each scene also turns out to be quite heavy and not the most judiciousthen when the story moves to the wwii the movie immediately takes a really more boring turn since the initial plot is completely stuck a quarter of the film is devoted to showing us robbie on the front alternating with souvenirs and flashbacksthen comes the last part punctuated with an absurd twist that discredits the scenario not to mention the incredibly useless last scenetherefore clearly lacks coherence and the association of those three parts turns out to be extremely lopsided if the cinematography is very good the actors are very bland especially keira knightley who only seems to have one expression in her repertoire,sad
spoilers this story begins in 1935 in a british manor house where we soon meet the three main characters briony a precocious thirteen year old cecilia brionys elegant older sister and robbie the handsome son of a housemaid the main themes are set up early on cecilia and robie become romantically involved and brionys initial jealousy turns into vindictiveness based on some misinterpretations toward the end of the story in 1940 we have robbie in france waiting to be evacuated from dunkirk in the interim between 1935 and 1940 robbie has spent time in jail due to a lie put forth by brionyhe had been released in order to fight in the war in 1940 briony is a nurse who is preoccupied with atoning for her lie and cecilia also a nurse pines for robbies returnthe period details are well done the london street scenes seem realistic have a guiness when youre tired poster on a london doubledecker the costumes are sumptuous and the cinematography lavish the original score by dario marianelli is effective and plays a significant rolei could not stay involved since so many scenes did not ring true i started to have troubles when cecilia took off her dress and jumped into the fountainwould she have dared do that in plain view and how would she explain her soaked dress there is a major problem with robbies letter of apology mixup we see robbie crumpling several false starts with his letter then rather than crumpling a highly volatile one he folds it and places it on his desk he leaves his final version fully exposed on his desk while putting the salacious one in the envelope are we really to believe that if you were to commit such highly sensitive thoughts to paper a doubtful endeavor in itself would you not be damned careful that that paper never see the light of day robbie gives his letter to briony for her to deliver how convenient for the plot but how hard to believe then there are the scenes with the search for the missing boys can we be expected to believe that a prosperous businessman would attempt rape while fully aware that a search party was at large in the area would robbie and cecilia have had sex in the library in such close proximity to the others in the house they at least closed the door but then briony was able to simply push her way in to catch them would cecilia and robbies brief attachment have been able to sustain their love for five years while apart i think such love happens only in romantic movies and novelsthe recreation of the retreat from dunkirk was clearly a considerable undertaking but the main effect it had on me was to want to do some research as to what the actual historical situation was this presentation with group sings carnival rides drunken bar scenes and a largescreen cinema seemed too strange to be true and unless you have some knowledge of history the dunkirk scenes could be confusing why were soldiers killing horses and disabling vehiclessome scenes come out of nowhere without advancing the plot for example i could not see what the scene that had briony tending a wounded french soldier had to do with anything the horrors of the wounded had already been amply displayed as well as brionys empathetic reactionsat the very end there is an interview with an old briony played by vanessa redgrave i was able to appreciate redgraves outstanding performance but i have problems with dramas that lead us down a certain path only to pull the rug out from under us at the end,sad
dearest cecilia the story can resume the one i had been planning on that evening walk i can become again the man who once crossed the surrey park at dusk in my best suit swaggering on the promise of life the man who with the clarity of passion made love to you in the library the story can resume i will return find you love you marry you and live without shame joe wrights is a beautiful and imaginative film that deftly succeeds at being a perfect adaptation of ian mcewans psychologically involving book of the same name using every ounce of engaging story available wright tackles the films themes with a confidence considerably rare for such a relatively new directortowards the beginning of the film briony tallis an imaginative yet foolish 13yearold girl bares witness to robbie turner making love with her older sister and then misinterprets a horrible crime she thinks she understands due to her naivety she falsely accuses robbie of the crime because of his earlier actions through her misguided convictions of the truth she separates robbie from cecelia the tale continues as cecelia becomes a nurse and waits for robbie to return from the warchristopher hampton the screenwriter quite skillfully adapts the novel into a poignant screenplay his ability to transform the pages into moving art and transitioning perspectives without sacrificing the pace or emotion of the source material is stunningjoe wright excels even further after directing his first film the spirited yet simpler pride and prejudice his direction in is absolutely phenomenal from the insanely brilliant singletake tracking shot through dunkirk perhaps one of the most beautiful and impeccably detailed scenes in film history to the incredibly erotic and smart sex scene his ability to deftly and brilliantly portray the most thorough and complex of emotions without the slightest of words being spoken is incredibleassisting the direction suitably is the seamless cinematography the decoration and meticulous attention to detail throughout the entirety of the film wonderfully captures the feel and look of each location the visuals constantly heighten the mood and perception of the story to the point where it feels as though the characters and circumstances of the tale were anything but endearingly human and complex creations of a clever mindthe acting complements the visual prowess of the film perfectly saoirse ronan and james mcavoy are particular standouts in an already topnotch cast mcavoy instills in his character all the underlying emotions and exhaustion flawlessly ronans talent shines through as she plays a character so complex and naive the frustration and anger she makes the viewer feel towards her character defines extraordinary actingon top of everything else the score is hauntingly breathtaking from the melodic strikes of the typewriter keys to the melancholic piano and the mournful violin the music enriches the scenes with an infectious beauty and sadnessjoe wright is a master storyteller and is an unforgettably brilliant incredibly emotional film that deserves any sort of accolades it receives it is one of only a very few films i have ever seen that i am proud to say is thoroughly without fault throughout its entirety,sad
tells a story not a typical world war story the war is there no case trying to ignore it but it is only the frame for this masterpiece watching it makes us remember there were times in which upper social classes determined the destiny of those less luckythis movie portraits our innate tendency to gain control our human impulse to impose our will regardless the effects it may have on othersbriony is still a girl about to begin its journey through puberty her inner perverse thoughts seem to come out after the sleeping period which is childhood young briony is no fool and finds a way to maintain her desires dormant robbie the object of her desire is unreachable and not only that but he is also naive in believing brionys purity and rightfulnessthe conflict begins when it becomes noticeable that robbie loves and lustscecilia brionys older sister and as you may predict feelings are intense and unbearable for the younger sister just like in real life control is set by the machiavelical thinkers not by the innocent and well intendedis nothing short from being a greek tragedy in which defying destiny brings terrible consequences cecilia and robbie should have known that a love that intense would only destroyed them society warned them it was not for them to decide that the rules were pretty clear they would not be togethergreat performances transmit exactly what is meant to be transmitted love is not enough not in this world on the contrary the world conspires against those who show that which most of us do not have mutual unconditional loveduring the last couple of years the film industry has not been as appealing as before at least that is the word on the street what is the case of having 200 mediocre movies when you only get a handful of movies that are really worth reflecting on i honestly think that is part of this select group,sad
is a labor of love each frame of this film is crafted with patience and diligence you can almost see the storyboard sketches that went into creating what you see on screen there are some amazing shots which in fact the film could have done without while still retaining the quality that it has but that the makers chose to work hard even on those scenes tells about their attention to detail for instance the scene where the robbie james mcavoy is walking with his two fellow soldiers and there is a reflection of the fighter plane on the water canalthe sequence of the army basecamp at the sea shore is amazing it is the most elaborately designed and executed shot i have ever seenbesides the technical brilliance the film rides on a very strong script and good performances briony tallis guilt is the center along which the story revolves the love between cecilia keira knightley and robbie is complex the duration that their love is latent is longer than it is actually expressed even more longer is the period where it survives only in their memories and thoughts with the war and the distance separating them i guess it was the cruelties and the distress of the war and the times that makes them hold on to their love otherwise possibly they would have moved onthe film adopts a nonlinear narration style it repeats may sequences and events looked at each time from a different characters perspective this acts like a dissection of the events making the story look complex and yet opening it up threadbarethe ending i felt did not live up to the rest of the film briony opening up to an interviewer to tell the actual truth seemed unlike her i wonder if i take that ending out what would have briony made of her life would she have been consumed by her guilt completely would she have moved on with this ending i guess she did move ona brilliant film one of the best i have seen this decade,sad
i love period dramas i love a movie with a good story and good characters has this and morefirst i love the way the story is told the way its divided and the change in tonerobbie james mcavoy and cee keira knightley are characters i could identify with their love story is one of the most beautiful as well as heartbreaking ive seen the love and passion between them makes it one of the best romantic plots ive seen in a moviemy favorite character however is briony tallis saoirse ronan not only shes my favorite character from the film shes my favorite film character from 2007 altogether briony is such a complex character played amazingly by saoirse ronan who got nominated for an oscar and gets my personal winthe acting is flawless from everyone involved mcavoy and knightely have superb chemistry and portray a very realistic romance ronan is brilliant and gives my favorite performancethe direction by joe wright is impeccable i really liked his work in pride  prejudice but he truly shined in herethe score is astounding and its the only oscar the film won the cinematography is beautiful and captivating art direction and costume design are great as well the green dress being a popular itemto conclude i love this film i think its one of the best period dramas and one of the best stories ever told not only romantic stories but stories overall,sad
i have to say this film may not be for everyone the reason is because the film jumps in time a lot and the film has to be seen cautiously this film presents a lot of characters in a lot of different perspectives occurrences happen a lot from different points of view the story starts in the year of 1935 from the eyes of a young girl named briony tallisplayed by saoirse ronan briony ends up changes her sister and her sisters lovers lives forever she sees them in a close embrace that she misunderstands because of her sights she accuses the lover robbie turnerplayed by james mcavoy and he is sent away the story is then set to 5 years later where we see robbie turner in the war his forgotten lover cecilia tallisplayed by kiera knightley as a retired nurse that lives alone after five years and the mysterious and misguided briony tallis at 18 years oldplayed by romola garai who has struck away from the family and is trying to atone for her past mistakes as a nurse eventually briony tallis has to overcome what she had to face through all her life ending the film in the close of the twentieth centurythis film is spectacular because it tells about how a persons sins might change their lives forever the film also shows how a relationship one that was never really thought of one that happened so fast how it can grow stronger and stronger the acting in this film is simply very strong there is not much talking in a lot of scenes between the lovers but both knightley and mcavoy command the screen i thought that james mcavoy deserved an oscar nomination and knightley also did very well enough to get one the breakthrough performance comes from saoirse ronan who plays briony at 13 years old the reason her performance was under supporting in the academy awards is because even though briony is really the main character there are only about the first 45 minutes that she comes out in her performance as a child actor is really strong and i am glad she got the buzz the performance of briony at 18 years old played by romola garai is also effective and she really makes the film to go into the direction that briony is now sorry for her sins and her lies that she made 5 years ago the performance that was probably the most effective as a whole was vanessa redgrave playing briony tallis at 77 years old even though she only has about 5 minutes of screen time at the end of the film her revelations her forgiveness her honesty and her bravery that she conveys with emotions is just amazing some say the performance was too short to get recognized but it did get recognized vanessa redgrave was nominated for a critics choice award and other awards trust me her acting will make you deeply emotional along with the acting of course the screenplay is also very strong very dialogueless it is able to capture a lot of magic also because of the director joe wright joe wright does a lot of tricks in this film he is able to capture a 7 minute long shot that is one of the best of the century and is said to be remembered along with others the film definitely deserved a best director nomination the cinematography is amazing the sets are fantastic and realistic the costumes only help the film more the original music score which was done by dario marinelli is probably the most original piece of music i have ever heard it is a score that is haunting without being very melodramatic its oscar win was very well deservedoverall this is a pure 1010 film it is superb and it will emotionally shock you because it has one of the most clever and revealing endings in cinema history it is a film to endure and one that i will definitely remember in 10 years and one that should be classified maybe as much as other classics like citizen kane yes it is that good and it does revolve around one character briony tallis maybe more than you think,sad
is the best romantic film that cinema has seen in a long time it contains everything needed for a romance to tug at our heartstringsthe british press gave keira knightley a lot of credit and were outraged when she didnt receive an oscarnomination or a bafta award she is a brilliant actress stunning in that classical look and i believe the biggest acting sensation since meryl streep however her performance as cecilia in isnt a very large one and therefore i agree and think that the awards went to better performances the star of the film is without a doubt james mcavoy his performance reduces you to tears as he is sent to fight in the war critics should have made a fuss about him not receiving an oscarnomination hes definitely the best british acting sensation so far and is seriously underrated his performance is breathtakingthe music is beautiful and goes perfectly with the story it is original and one of the bestoverall is a must see the cast are brilliant the music is wonderfuland the story is heartbreaking,sad
you will forget pride and prejudice when you see joe wright and keira knightley in this movie this would have to be one of the most beautiful adaptations of a book ever made it kept to the storyline really well but not so much that the director was terrified of making even the slightest change the cinematography and the music score in this are beautiful and clever the flashbacks are great and less confusing than they were in the novel by ian mcewan and the acting was great i cannot stand keira knightley but she was amazing in this movie and so was james macavoy who shows he doesnt always have to be remembered as a faun however the three actors that really steel the show are the three brionys saoirse ronan was fantastic as the confused child who believes what she tells herself then romola garai who i think was the best really shoving emotion into her lines then vannessa redgrave who is on for about five seconds but still nearly brought me to tears in the way she executed her dialogue if you see this movie i promise you you will never forget it this should have won best picture,sad
an excellent film spectacular cinematography  excellent cast great acting really takes you on a journey and gets you involved in the film the story unfolds with the unexpected use of flashbacks it works very well suspenseful nervewracking tension the scenes of dunkirk may or may not have been historically accurate but it conveyed a realism that few attempts at recreating scenes from wwii could match the film is subtle and has just the right touch to make you work at it and keep you involved  nothing heavyhanded here as is the case with many other period pieces my only criticism would be that ms knightley while a fine actress needs to eat something a few more pounds would do her good shes starting to resemble an exhumed corpse,sad
ive only seen this film twice once in the theater and the second time with friends only one besides me who had read the novel the friends who hadnt read the novel were utterly confused throughout most of it especially at the beginning because there really isnt a lot of character development to honestly appreciate this film make sure you read the book it opens up so many doors to understanding it overall a brilliant adaptation however joe wright is a wonderful director and seamus mcgarveys cinematography was stunning but my absolute favorite part was the pairing of typewriter keys in the music and dario marianellis oscar was well deserved,sad
i was disappointed so much praise for a mediocre film i watched the dvd and was underwhelmed but one thing it does have  a tween villain who is vindictive manipulative and a twit god i wanted to slap her while the acting was good the film was morose gray depressing and disjointed the way they went back and forth into the past was very distractingthe scene that sets up the story is when briony jumps in the pond so robbie will have to save her and be her hero when he berates her for being such a twit and endangering them both  i think that is when she decides to get even maybe not even consciously but it is all her jealousy as smart as this girl is i dont think she was confused at all at what she saw and what she decided to do with the knowledge the older briony is still trying to use innocence as an excusethe dunkirk withdrawal is another confusing part  war is a mess  but for the audience we at least should be given a clue to what the objective is all we see is men going to and fro  to what end maybe i missed the dialog but i was using subtitles  so dont think i missed it if it was thereacting honors for me go to the older briony mcavoy and knightly were okay but nothing out of the ordinary young briony was too deadpan no expression maybe that is what the director wanted but it was not effective her only change of expression was a smile when robbie rescues heri cant imagine this film being remembered 10 years from now 510 for set decoration costume design cinematography,sad
other than the lush scenery and ingenious photography i see no specialness in this film set in preworld war ii england the story is about a girl bearing false witness and how pettiness can ruin the lives of many the plot is revealed in stages showing sequences through the eyes of one character then another divulging important facts in the second viewing at times the vignettes play out of chronological order so that the audience is deliberately in the dark as to when the events are taking place i enjoyed this technique and it does add punch to the overall piece it seems that the movie is aimed at and essentially about the inner life of immature females and their writing and rewriting of scripts in their head on every level this film feels like a chick film based on a romance novel i should add at this point that the most shining example of great acting in the film is achieved by juno temple as a supporting but pivotal character named lolai did not feel a strong reason for the two main characters cecilia kneightly and robbie mcevoy to love each other erotic thoughts are inadvertently revealed and suddenly there is lasting love it didnt work for me the ending is supposed to be bittersweet but i just thought it made the title seem silly im avoiding spoilers here but the actions taken by briony offer none of the redemptive qualities of there are no scenes where she finally grows up and drops her infatuation with her own inner drama her attempts to orchestrate lives and feelings in real life as she can on the page are never tamed no im afraid this film fell well below expectations for me both as a love story and as a film about,sad
cineastes will recognize the shadowy figure interviewing the elderly briony at the end of this sumptuously produced 2007 film as director anthony minghella who tragically passed away earlier this week one can surmise that director joe wrights use of the estimable filmmaker for a wellplaced cameo is something of a tribute to minghellas work on similarly grandiose epics like the english patient minghella would have been an ideal director for ian mcewans emotionally complex 2002 novel as would have been david lean since the film concurrently evokes the sweep of doctor zhivago and the intimacy of brief encounter especially in the wartime tearoom scene regardless wright does an admirable job in translating what is essentially an interior story into something quite cinematic much of the films measured success has to do with his and screenwriter christopher hamptons abiding fidelity to mcewans timejuggling story structurethe story is actually divided into two discrete parts the first takes place on an inauspicious summer day at a rolling english estate in 1935 as precocious 13yearold briony tallis writes a play for the children to perform at a dinner party that evening she idolizes her beautiful older sister cecilia and harbors a crush on the housekeepers impassioned son robbie turner when she sees the two together at the garden fountain she presumes a situation more provocative than what really occurred later that evening briony makes a false accusation and robbie ends up wrongly accused of a crime and sent off to prison the second part takes place five years later as europe is engulfed in wwii robbie has moved from prisoner to foot soldier in france aching over cecilia while trying to get to dunkirk in order to return to england cecilia has become a nurse as has a nowgrown briony regretfully estranged from her sister where the story goes from there is startling and moving in ways that are quite unexpectedim rather divided on the performances as the headstrong cecilia keira knightley evokes oldschool glamour with her coltish beauty in an impactful manner reminiscent of a young katharine hepburn but her character dissipates somewhat as the story progresses james mcavoy captures the boyish magnetism of robbie while gaining gravitas as his idealized character faces the fatalistic horror of war head on together though knightley and mcavoy somehow just miss creating the image of enduring passion necessary to carry the core story on the other hand briony allows three superb actresses to seamlessly show the characters evolving fate as the adolescent saoirse ronan dominates the first third of the film with searing selfpossession she makes us care about briony despite her repugnant act of selfinterest romola garai takes over as a young uncertain nurse caring for badly maimed soldiers in a london hospital finally vanessa redgrave carries the last scene by providing the denouement with her characteristic authority and giving the title its true meaningall the production values are stunning  sarah greenwoods meticulous production design especially in the dunkirk scenes jacqueline durrans simply designed period costumes dario marianellis stirring music score with an effective if somewhat excessive use of typewriter keys to punctuate key scenes and seamus mcgarveys rich cinematography pay particular attention to the uninterrupted fiveminute tracking shot at dunkirk done with a steadicam a bravura set piece along the lines of the opening scene in orson welles touch of evil the 2008 dvd has a fairly standard set of extras for such an elaborate production  an informative commentary track from wright a comprehensive halfhour makingof documentary bringing the past to life the making of a fiveminute short from novel to screen adapting a classic in which wright hampton and mcewan discuss the transition on a cursory level and seven deleted scenes about eight minutes in total with optional commentary from wright,sad
winner of the 2007 bafta and golden globe for best film has an opening 45 minutes which recalls the the gobetween  a hot english summer and lust between the lower and upper classes robbie james mcavoy is the gardener and cecilia kiera knightley is the daughter of the household a grabbed moment of lust in the library is witnessed by cecilias 13year old sister briony saorise ronan and when another young girl is molested briony falsely accuses robbie at this point the film becomes an essay on the beastliness of the english upper classes  particularly benedict cumberbatchs total cad  and there is a sadness that prevails throughout the story of robbie and cecilias ruined lives robbie goes to prison and is released in 1940 to fight with the british expeditory force in france he and cecilia have one more meeting over teain lesser hands the story could have been clunky and dated  but joe wright has a young cinematic eye and hes helped by one of the best adaptors of difficult material in the business christopher hampton theres a terrific sequence set on the beach at dunkirk with the stranded british army waiting for evacuation thats a triumph of steadicam operation music score and sarah greenwoods production design which suggests an army defeated and disorganised  theres everything from an abandoned boat to a funfair on the beach the sequence  all a single tracking shot following robbie  is astonishingly movingback in london briony now 18 and played by romola garari becomes a nurse and is haunted by her dishonesty and herein is the films only flaw the penultimate scene of briony visiting robbie and cecilia and seeking a chance to make amends for what shes done it turns out to be the invention of the adult briony vanessa redgrave a chapter in her final novel the real robbie and cecilia had died in 1940 and this is the only way she could she could gain for what shes done but its an implausible ending that sabotages the finale  like a it was all dream revelation or a false flashbacknevertheless a sterling film impeccably acted by every member of the cast and one that demands and rewards more than one viewing,sad
is an original drama that is both tragic and beautiful this being my 3rd best picture nominee to watch my thoughts were can it beat juno amazingly it did although barely the storyline is superb and strays away from many clichs in the dramas the movie is another one of those star crossed lover type stories the man is accused of a crime that he did not commit and is sent off to fight in the war the main actors james mcavoy and keira knightley drive the film in a very effective way these two actors create a story that is truly believable and proves to be very immersive you will notice the unique cinematography almost as soon as the film starts every source of light is blurry and has a sort of bloom effect this makes the film look whited out also it makes the film looks dreamy as if it is a part of a memory character progression is on the slow side but you get to know many of the character very well the score which the film won the oscar for is interesting and enjoyable the film incorporates the tapping of the typewriter with the orchestral background musicthe one problem is quite obvious the plot progression is rather confusing it jumps from one point to another and goes back and forth this is most annoying especially when it goes 2 weeks prior in a scene where youre already confused as to where in the time of the film the current scene is taking place in although it wasnt that big of a problem for me it might be a little aggravating for some viewers also some of the wounded soldier shots are quite gruesome and gritty they are very graphic although majority of these shots are concentrated into clump of scenes and it is not something that comes back oftenthe ending concludes all of the main three characters stories up very well it is a very emotional ending and is very well done it is probably something youre not expecting and i thought it was a solid ending is ultimately an extremely personal film each character has a unique quality to them and story that drives the film become very personal as long as you can put up with the jumping plot and longish run time you should find this film a treat it uses emotions effectively characters are developed well and you will care for them well maybe not that little girl personally i hated her guts i thought this film was one of the best i saw this year and it is definitely a one you dont want to miss out on,sad
judging by the trailer for as well as its reviews i had this film pegged as one of those stuffy british period pieces in the merchantivory vein those films dont usually get awards coverage but this one had something to do with world war ii and as we all know awards people love world war ii upon finally seeing the film i was greatly surprised not only is it captivating but it has all sorts of narrative tricks up its sleeve to keep the proceedings movingthe movie begins on a bourgeois estate in england on it live the sisters briony saoirse ronan and cecilia keira knightley robbie works on the farm as a hired hand he does the work while the owner of the estate pays for his education between cecilia and robbie there is a romance occurring unbeknownst to the other residents of the estate when briony sees something occur between them outside the window she assumes that something occurred which did notthis section of the film carries within it a lot of tension director joe wright fleshes out characters efficiently and makes us feel for robbie when the police take him away there are two events in particular that are shown separately from the perspectives of the different characters involved instead of crosscutting as most directors would wright shows these scenes one after another building the level of suspense in each of themwhen certain further events occur it leads to briony to tell a lie which results in robbie being sent to prison the second portion of the film follows robbie in france as he attempts to cross the english isle to get back to cecilia he is given a choice between serving in france or serving his prison sentence upon reaching the coast of france there is a magnificent long take which follows robbie walk along the beach before focusing on the chaos of the moment and returning to robbie it lasts a few minutes and is destined to be remembered for years to comeone thing i noticed about this film is that most of the reviews i have read seem to snub the involvement of joe wright as the director this is most recently seen in the oscar nominations was nominated for best picture but wright was not nominated for best director what happens in this act of the film is very director driven as are certain decisions in the first and third acts of the film regarding how the narrative develops i was not expecting this level of maturity and style going into the film considering wrights only other film was the keira knightley version of pride and prejudice that i never saw srsly i have to read jane austens persuasion in english this year and i am not looking forward to it if anything this film owes more of a debt to its director than the script or any of the actors all of which are fine but would have failed with with a less sure hand at the helmthe third act of the film follows briony now played by romola garai as she faces her guilt and realizes that she was wrong the film follows her as she tries to right about her experience and she tries to contact her sister who estranged herself from the family after robbie was arrested following this vanessa redgrave makes a heartbreaking cameo as the elderly briony now a celebrated authorthis portion of the film also features a narrative format that is unconventional i would be guilty of spoiling the surprise if i told you what it was now for now all i will say is that the film manages to have its cake and then proceed to eat it as well i would never have thought that an ending like this would work but somehow it does i highly recommend this movie even for people with penises it is much better than the coverage would let you know,sad
has received its fair share of acclaim and awards over the last few months but i am sadly not one of its fans granted the book is one of the most soughtafter reads in recent years and was bound to become a contender for the bigscreen but the result doesnt quite pan out as well as it shouldbefore i continue i must stress that keira knightley james mcavoy and joe wright are immensely talented individuals who deserve their success and should go onto more success and awards in time but on this occasion i have to be honest and say that is not one of their best workshaving not read the book but reliably informed that it is not a straightforward read and plays out a lot of information in the minds of the characters a think not tell mentality factors like this were always going to be a major concern irrespective of whether one reads a book or not when it comes to adapting it for the bigscreen the audience and their impression have to be clear in the mind of the filmmakersthe problem is that there is not enough emotional involvement with the three main characters and i increasingly as the film progressed felt that the movie was stalling cecilia and briony both come across as spoilt socialites and the actual crime is not sufficiently fleshed out to carry the story through when james mcavoys character goes off to dunkirk in an admittedly spectacular sequence that seems strangely out of place there is no realisation amongst his fellow soldiers of the crime he has been accused of bearing in mind that military folk are a bit more uncompromising than somepossibly the most galling thing for me was that just at the time when the film seems to get going the climax of the film then says that the last 20 minutes on screen didnt happen i felt robbed of its emotional core and like other films that have done that the sixth sense this is the biggest sin any filmmaker can commit,sad
there is so much to say about 2007s this is a beautiful absolutely astonishing movie directed by a soincredibly talented joe wright he unravels the warhistoryromancedrama genre with an enormous depth he breathes new fire into a worn genre  he speaks to todays teenagers and young lovers a generation who needs a motion pictures magnificence to describe their longings for their loved ones when separated by war the vision of the movie is drenched in its totally unique cinematic beauty the cinematography and production design cant be described in one word its utterly breathtaking so powerfully attached to the movies centercore that will find love just as much as audiences loves itjames mcavoy and keira knightley do electrifying performances mcavoys robbie turner cant find words to describe his feelings for the beautiful cecilia tallis the tension between the two boils and throughout the movie the cinematography leads on the dance of longing and lost love its definitely one of the strongest oscarcontenders to the 2007 awards astonishing from the hotsummer opening to the surprising climax,sad
even if i wanted to spoil the plot of i couldnt its very similar to perfect blue in that regard however the plot itself is very complicated we are presented with events from a third persons perspective then we view them from the participants perspective this gives the film the same mystic appeal that kunderas the unbearable lightness of being had we are able to know briony robbie and cecelia so much better because of this the only area with regards to the plot that i found the film did not portray was brionys crush on robbie i read a summary of the book even though as an adult briony does reveal that she had a crush on robbie this is not evident when she was a child other than the flashback however where this film succeeds is that it portrays all of its characters tragically while still allowing us to know themthe acting was also memorable in the film kiera knightly acted very dignified and responsive to her surroundings it must be because wright asked her to watch films that were released during the era the film portrays kiera is becoming my favorite actress after helena bonham carter what was also evident even from the other actors was the humanly way they acted nothing they did could be perceived as unnatural seeing briony read in the forested area was like seeing footage from a home movie because of how natural it looked if you recall from my lady in the water review i mentioned how unrealistic the film was even by fantasy standards those actors conformed to stereotypes and expectations but these actors did not also james mcavoy actually looked as if he wanted to have sex with kiera knightlys character during the library scene i must also say that the costume designer did a good job in dressing the three actresses that played briony throughout her life each of them had the mole on her face and i could imagine that each of them was briony however when briony was in her 20s the film didnt do a good job of portraying cecilias character as having aged she looked exactly the same as she did as she did in the manor however i dont fault the film much for that mistake it didnt affect the plot too muchwhile this film isnt the most impacting that ive seen this year i would heartily recommend seeing it it is a realistic portrayal of someone attempting to sympathize with the crime she committed in her life the acting is good enough to convince you that the characters struggle is worthy of your attention it isnt a film that i would necessarily own but i have enough respect for it to read the book which im doing now,sad
to say it straight away i cant remember a movie before to picture such a broad spectrum of the human soul in one single movie and yet is every aspect portrayed with such detail and beautyin this movie everything seems explained guilt love sorrow hate hope  crime war peace the direction was really impressive the cinematography just beautiful the soundtrack was perfect the sound editing thrilling i dont want to give everything away but if you see this movie is hard to look at the movie itself because there are all those perfect details in direction as for the ending  i guess some will love it as the whole movie some including me will find it inapropiate to the movie stealing a bit of its beauty,sad
wow you completely summed up the feelings i had for i completely agree with you the first third with the sweltering chemistry between robbie and cecilia along with the imaginative briony is pure cinematic brilliance the second part with the dunkirk scene is abruptly less powerfully emotional than the beginning the third act with an older briony is even less emotional and to me it was confusing and almost out of place i think you were right in stating that the screenwriter had the most difficulty adapting the book somewhere in the middle of the movie i am glad that someone besides me was somewhat disappointed with the second half of the movie,sad
like so many of the best films of 2007 does not see wide distribution until 2008 owing to the practise of holding back the socalled oscarbait movies until limited release in december to meet the academys deadlines while keeping the movies in the minds of voters and so at januarys end i finally got to see the new film adaptation of graham mcewans novel i have not read the novelthe story follows cecilia and briony tallis two sisters from an upper class family in interwar england and robbie their groundskeeper who has also been patronized by their father and gone on to some education the opening segment covering perhaps the first hour is set in 1935 and shows how cecilia and robbies burgeoning relationship becomes the victim of a lie told by briony who does not understand what she sees and how her own feelings cause her to act the next segment set in 1940 on the eve of the miracle of dunkirk depicts the fallout of this lie as briony now a young woman tries to make up for what she has done finally there is an epilogue set in the present day where the question of brionys is examined at the end of her lifebriony the central character is played by three different actresses in the course of the film first saoirse ronan as a 13yearold girl by romola garai as an 18yearold and by acting legend vanessa redgrave as an old woman all three actresses are fantastic most of the critical acclaim including an oscar nomination for best supporting actress has accrued to ronan as the young briony and she would be a worthy recipient of the award keira knightley the big name in the cast reteaming with joe wright her director on pride  prejudice one of my favourite recent films is impressive and develops good chemistry with james mcavoy as robbie also present in a minor role is the great brenda blethyn also of pride  prejudicethe most talkedabout scene in the film is the depiction of the beaches of dunkirk in the days of the evacuation the fiveminute continuous tracking shot of soldiers walking through the chaos has already become famous there is tremendous poetry in wrights visuals as the music of singing soldiers swells abandoned ferris wheels absently turn and horses are shot for lack of food and transportthe conclusion of the film is remarkably powerful aborting the expectations of a traditional hollywood period drama sins it seems cannot always be made up for like in the movies there is also the question raised of whether fiction canshould be used in the way briony ends up using it and whether she is simply continuing to deceive herself at the end of her life this is by no means a happy film and some unaware viewers expecting a companion piece to knightley and wrights pride  prejudice should look elsewhere but for an adult tragedy this production has few compeers this year,sad
joe wright has master eye for the camera he seems to like to tell the story by having characters in the most beautiful settings he can imagine or create is no different and in fact i might say a trifle more beautiful and much sadder than his previous work in pride  prejudice while not among my top tier film masterpieces of the year this comes quite close with its great story design and strong performances and in a year full of sad films it does not quite the punch of the films with the message but rather just sticks to the tale and tells is exquisitely this is a tale of misunderstanding and of coursethe tale begins of a little girl briony played fantastically by saoirse ronan who is typing a play up and is quite excited about it things do not go so well though when she wants to see the play done circumstances are bad for the visiting children and she has to make sacrifices but then she gets a doozy of an idea when she misconstrues a situation from a far of her sister and the gardener more errors are made on both sides further along as she jumps to conclusions with a creative mind the gardener writes and sends the wrong letter and of course briony can resist a read when she is entrusted with it the sins and misinterpretations of one day and one night have devastating repercussions with jail being the least of worries when war comesi will point out one of my few quirks about the situation here i do not get why the pair did not just talk over the situation with briony when she saw them in the library it just made it that much more muddled sure briony did the telling and jumped to the conclusion but they offered her no explanation and she was young impressionable and the other cousin agreed to the liewell anyways besides my reservations about how the situation arose and where the blame was cast i became enthralled in how wright broached the war and the incredible makeup that was used in the hospital scenes that was quite a spectacle and made one shudder a bit without being harsh he did much the same with the dunkirk sequence which was disgusting in the horror of the situation and beautiful with how the camera moved across it all for a guy who i heard does not like period pieces wright is a natural nay a master at it,sad
there was an awful lot of acting in that movie said my husband as we left the theatre i know what he meants the kind of movie that wins awards because the relatively simple story line and lack of explosions and car chases gives the actors a chance to string coherent words together more than 2 or 3 at a time and deliver them without simultaneously drawing a gun or jumping over roof tops not that i dont like action movies i do its just nice occasionally to watch something more cerebral there are many things i loved about yet still at the end i was surprised it didnt move me more or have a bigger emotional impact on me with such a tragic storyline i was fully prepared for a good weep but somehow it never fully engaged me emotionally im still trying to decide quite why the cast was certainly excellent keira knightley cecilia is not only gorgeous to look at for extended periods of time on screen but shes very effective portraying cecilia the eldest daughter of an upper crust family whiling away a long hot sultry summer in a country house just before world war 2 when britain was still in the grasp of an enervating class system women of her class were still required to do little at that time beyond marry well and cecilia is clearly bored to tears and frustrated on every level her clipped tones and delivery are perfect contrast this with knightleys 2002 performances in pure or bend it like beckham and you will see just how far she has come as an actor four years have taken her from gangly kid to sultry sex symbol with no pit stops for rehab and i adore her for it james mcavoy robbie seems to have come from nowhere to become a major male star in very short order although i know in actuality hes been around a while ive thought him excellent in every movie ive seen him in especially the last king of scotland all three actresses who play cecilias little sister briony as she ages are equally good and all the supporting cast are very proficient director joe wright pride and prejudice creates a languid and vaguely erotic sexually charged atmosphere between cecilia and robbie a couple who are wildly attracted to each other but separated by the artificial barrier of class he contrasts robbie  bright well educated and stifled by his humble origins  with the crass upper class twitishness of cecilias brother leon and his unpleasant friend paul cecilia and robbie cross paths repeatedly trying to ignore their obvious mutual attraction this is a classic example of how to create sexual energy and tension on screen with very little actual physical contact before the fateful library scene but when they do finally come together they sizzle positively setting the screen on fire for a few brief moments before fate in the shape of nosey briony intervenes its hard to define chemistry in a couple on screen you just know it when you see it these two have it in bucket loadswrongly accused of a sexual assault robbie is dragged off to prison and the summer idyll comes to an abrupt end not just for the protagonists but for the whole country as ww2 looms ahead four years later robbie is in the army stranded at dunkirk and cecilia has become the efficient ward sister of a london hospital briony also a nurse wants to make amends for the terrible accusations she made which put robbie in jail but the past can never be undone much has been written about the dunkirk beach scene so i wont repeat it except to say that it is cleverly filmed but looked a little too much like a graphic novel storyboard at times the cinematography of the whole movie is beautiful as it was in joe wrights pride and prejudice in 2005 he has a real feel for the beauty of old british country estates and he certainly showcases knightley at her very best yes that dress is stunning yet i felt the movie lost emotional impact by showing us the various real and fictional endings fictional as imagined by an adult briony now a novelist in that respect it reminded me of the french lieutenants woman this is almost an attempt to be too cerebral and it comes at the expense of emotional involvement which is a pity there is still a place in cinema for the unabashed representation of love whether thwarted as this is or fulfilled somehow this is just too detached i havent read the book so im willing to believe it is an accurate interpretation but personally id have simply shown the tragic ending rather than brionys fictional option and left the audience to work out the what ifs for themselves it would have left at least this audience member sad but more satisfied,sad
the fundamental problem with the film was the way it dumbed down the story eg we are shown scenes twice to show that two different people have seen what happened when there is no difference between the scenes it is almost like the director does not trust the viewer to be intelligent enough to know what is going on and so has to spoon feed you each pointcertain elements of the plot  in fact the key motif of the film are massively overlaboured and repeated again and again like some kind of advertising campaign in fact parts of the film felt like a perfume adother large segments of the film are pointless and lend nothing to the plot drama or tension in effect the story is a onetrick pony but is elongated and complicated to make a longer film but then to make up for this failure the directoreditors have overly expanded dead scenes and repeated obvious dramatic points to me this is a failed attempt to recreate the drama of the english patient but it does not work unless perhaps the audience is so used to ads they like this kind of filmmaking,sad
is based upon the novel of the same name by ian mcewan the film takes place in 1930s england where a young girl named briony tallis witnesses several incidents all in the course of one day and one of them involving her older sister cecilia and the houses servant robbie turner not knowing what to make of the events briony lies to the authorities in a move that will affect cecilia and robbie for the rest of their lives and will also haunt her for the rest of hers as well this film really is a perfect showcase for the different characters in the story and their emotions thoughts feelings and decisions going to the authorities and ruining the lives of the people around her are brought on by briony most likely because as we can see she is brought up into royalty in a very strict classy and conservative environment and probably has no insight or ideas of what she is later to learn on the night when everything changes because she has had such a carefree and in a sense isolated life she has been hidden from these sort of situations and also because of an underlying issue that we learn later in the film is the cause for her harsh and life changing decision she makes by going to the authorities the film brilliantly captures the different characters at several stages of their life and how the events of the past have hurt them and how they will never be the same because of it the emotions whether let out or bottled in are really shown by the very talented actors who portray these characters in the film and the films script gives us a lot to think about and shows us a side of human nature that may seem cruel or ugly but in most cases is probably more likely than we would like to admit the story is at times moving haunting thought provoking and is paced well especially in the second half and is a film that leaves the viewer with a lot to think about after the initial viewing not because the film is in any way particularly confusing but because of the different social studies of these characters and because of the decisions they make out of ignorance or for other reasons the film is set to a beautiful backdrop of wonderful looking cinematography great sets and costumes that really capture the place and time and a beautiful musical score as well the real gift of this film besides the very talented people in front of and behind the camera is the script and the book it is based on because it delves into these characters so deeply and shows us their raw and real emotions flaws and what makes them do the things they do i personally am one who likes a movie that makes me think and stays with me after i have seen it and this one did that for me this was a wonderful theatrical version of a great script and novel that is brought to such life and beauty by the great cast and crew behind it a beautiful thought provoking and in ways a haunting film that stayed with me and made me want to analyze the film more and more because of these rich characters this is certainly one of the best films of 2007,sad
i am not what one would call a huge fan of romance movies but this however is not your typical romance movie it is a powerful movie that will tug at the heart the moral story behind the events portrayed is also extremely powerfulfor guys like me who find romance movies rather boring dont be turned away by that aspect of the movie no there is not any action scenes there is a few scenes that depict a great deal of graphic war images but they dont depict any war fighting the movie is more a crimedrama that involves romancethe movie also has a bit of a twist for an endthis years oscars ought to be quite interesting between this sweeney todd there will be blood american gangster no country for old men and imho gone baby gone see this movie it is sure to win,sad
i saw attonement sitting at the very front of the cinema in the row where even when you slouch you cannot see the whole of the screen this horrible disadvantage when seeing a movie did not lessen or do anything to impede my enjoyment of attonement this testifies just how good this film really isattonement is set in the early 1900s and begins in an idyllic english house with a handful of characters we first meet briany saoirse ronana young imaginative girl who then proceeds to lead us too the other characters in a series of quick scenes she greets robbie the james mcavoy very briefly before we also get the first meeting with the other main character cecilia keira knightlythrough a series of misconceptions and assumptions on brianys behalf she convinces herself that robbie is a sex maniac and not too be trusted as of such when an assault takes place near the house she tells the police that robbie is the culprit she testifies against him and he is sent too prison chossing later to go too war instead its good to finally see a movie that does not treat the audience as six year old instead it leaves the audience too notice the small subtle details that are pivotal too the plot by making this assumption it makes the viewing experience more enjoyable as you begin too have to pick up and analise peoples reactions eyes and overall their characters to figure who is too be trusted and who is hiding under a phisade i also enjoyed this movie because of its ability too make the whole thing seem so realistic a mid way tracking shot of dunkirk beach is particularly effective in making it all seem so very real and haunting the performances are top quality james mcavoy in particular juggles a complex role and breaks out with some truly mesmerizing acting moments attonement is ultimately a story of love and really does not stray from this main plot its about a couple deeply in love whom are separated then against all odds they must get back too each other very sentimental i know but still it never seemed that way the way it was filmed written and acted did not let it become sentimental either almost like a shakespearian tragedy the writing in attonement is of absolute quality it is convincing believable and the end monologue left me stunned this is a deep movie that is deserving all off the credit it gets,sad
has awards written all over itthe story of two lovers betrayed by a younger sister then parted by the second world war is beautifully shot and conceived by a wonderful team the settings are perfectly realised and mcavoy et al do a good job for my money the ending is the best of any major film this yearcredit must go to working title and the legacy of george harrison merchant ivory and even greenaway for laying the tracks that kept the british film industry alive it may not produce anything like the amount of the us or india but the quality is outstandingthe score by dario marianelli is certainly a highlight not the typewriter but towards the end the score definitely captures strains of elgar and tippett for my money better even that his score for pride and prejudice which was oscar nominated last year in addition seamus mcgarvey and paul tothill both deserve mention for the cinematography and editing respectivelywill it win an oscar perhaps not best film  but one thing is clear it will clean up at the baftas for suredefinitely worth the viewing for my money better than the english patient  more human and detailed emotionally  a must for all who like their films to be something to linger,sad
i have been waiting to see this movie for a very long time and today i finally got to see it i had been trying not to get too excited in case it didnt live up to my expectations but i neednt have worried the movie absolutely blew me awayfirst off it was filmed beautifully joe wright really has a talent for using the natural surroundings to his advantage i also loved that in pride and prejudice the nowfamous dunkirk scene was just stunning i was really excited to see that after all i had heard and it was just amazing wright really captured the antiglory of the war when wwi is often characterized by the initial euphoria of all parties involved that war had come then the steep disillusionment that followed i was so glad that he did the shot as one long continuous take it was excellentnow the performances starting with the most attentiongetting keira knightley did a fabulous job as cecilia ive read the novel and i felt that she really embodied the character saoirse ronan was the most perfect young briony shes gotten a lot of attention as well and she fully deserves it she was fantastic as the selfcentered ignorant spoiled little rich girl i felt however that the movie truly belonged to james mcavoy he was so heartrending and incredible as robbie true he and keira knightley didnt have a ton of crackling chemistry but his earnestness and her eagerness make you really believe and feel for themthe writers did a great job adapting ian mcewans sprawling novel and they did an excellent job showing the introspectiveness that the novel conveys of course its hard to get so deeply inside of each characters head the way the novel does but the movie does an excellent job without feeling rushed or choppy as with pride and prejudice they clipped the unnecessary but kept the heart of the storyall in all it was an excellent amazing movie my definite favorite of the year and very worth seeing,sad
greetings again from the darkness teaming up again after pride and prejudice are director joe wright and the finally maturing keira knightley this time they tackle ian mcewans monster novel and for the most part deliver a tense emotional rideknightley and james mcavoy the last king of scotland are very good and very believable together but the star of the film is knightleys wicked lil sis played by three actresses  saoirse ronan age 13 the weak link of ramola garai age 18 and a perfectly cast vanessa redgrave as the elder briony wrapping the story up for the viewer in a tv interview for her final novel by the way the interviewer in that scene is the english patient director anthony minghellanot to give anything away but normally the story is what makes a film enjoyable for me here i actually admired the films structure and delivery of the story  definitely not dumbed down the way so many booktomovie projects are certainly the middle of the film drags a bit as mcavoy wanders through the countryside and 18 yr old briony pays her penance as a war nurse but the first 45 minutes of the film are truly outstandingjust a warning this is not the feel good sappy hollywood garbage that many think it is many scenes are extremely uncomfortable to watch and i heard more than a few sniffles coming from the crowd the score is outstanding and expertly conveys depth to many scenes  especially the remarkable long cut as mcavoy walks through the beach camp for soldiersexcellent support work from brenda blethyn and benedict cumberbatch amazing grace and again the elegant ms redgrave perfectly captures brionys struggle for the truth and redemption and,sad
a brief misplaced note an epic novel meant to cleanse scarred souls the knowledge that what is written and what is said can both kill and heal  and it all begins with the sound of typewriter keys clacking against white paper preparing the viewer for the cataclysmic events to unfolddirector joe wright has created the most breathtaking and tragic film of the last decade an event that is magnificent and intimate at the same time one that marries sweeping cinematic visuals with the most personal and nuanced acting performances of the yearkiera knightley and james mcavoy are astounding as the doomed lovers their mature performances defying their youth saoirse ronan is nothing short of spectacular as precocious briony tallis the child with the vivid imagination who sets the films events in motion as 18year old briony romola garai carries a lifetime of anguish on her face and although vanessa redgrave has less than five minutes of total screen time her heartbreaking soliloquy is like a punch to the gut that will have even the most hardened souls choking back the tears and leaving no one doubting that redgrave is among the finest actresses alive todaythe brilliant cinematography of seamus mcgarvey the tense musical score of dario marianelli who ingeniously integrates clacking typewriter keys into his compositions and the beautifully detailed vintage costuming by jacqueline durran form a perfect cinematic storm enveloping the viewer both visually and emotionallywhen the screen fades to black and the credits begin to roll but the audience remains seated and silent you know youve got a winner and thats exactly what happens with a near perfect achievement,sad
as a longtime movie buff but a novice imdb comment writer i approach this with a little perspective and a little intimidation i also went to see this movie not having read the novel and deliberately avoiding any detailed reviews of its plot the result i found the movie overall to tell its story absolutely amazingly well especially its outstanding beginning the portrayal of the early events that form the basis of this movie accomplish what only happens rarely  immerse one completely into the story and into its characters awards to all involved but most especially the director screenwriter and editor high artistic risks were taken by very talented folks acting on both their muse and the full potential of their talents to produce something rarely seen these day  mirabile visu  a film well worth seeing,sad
i saw this movie today the day after it opened here in general release and i think this is the best movie ive seen in a long timethe visuals captured me from the first frame what an amazing series of scenes a beautiful late 1930s english country estate wartime france dunkirk wartime london every scene appeared perfectly composed perfectly filmed with perfect colors and sights and sounds authenticity and beauty were captured on every single frame of this movie the attention to detail was exquisite without becoming at any point distracting if theres such a thing as perfect cinematography and perfect lighting and perfect editing this movie must come about as close to achieving these ideals as i for one can imagine in fact if this movie had had no dialog at all i think i would have sat enthralled by the absolutely amazing visuals from beginning to endthe story though was captivating in a special way special because of course we all know from the trailer what the basic plot is and although there are important twists as things proceed on the whole were watching a movie the storyline of which we already know theres a special pleasure to watching something unfold like this and i love the way the story was conveyed almost as much as i love the story itself deft flashbacks with changes of point of view convey so much of the richness of the storyto me the interaction between the characters and their context is what made the whole story so fascinating here we have really very narrow parameters laid down and our characters must make their choices within those parameters with consequences of personal enormity for each of them the film conveys the charactercontext interaction in an especially fine way by showing  repeating again and again sometimes the repetition comes through flashback for example in the fountain scene sometimes it comes through interleaving points of view for example near the beginning when cecilia and robbie are thinking about each other most fascinating to me is when the repetition comes through a sort of deft cameras wheeling slowly and deliberately through a scene following characters moving this way and that for example the amazing dunkirk sequencea key theme of the movie as we all know from the trailer is whats real and whats not and this is played upon in so many wonderfully delightful ways there are so many scenes through windows and sights in mirrors and pov shots up and down hallways and through fields typewritten pages retyped and retyped and retyped what we see what we think we see and what we do about what we see or think we see are all so intimately bound up with who we are and this is expressed from beginning to end with a sense of authenticity and beauty that was for me just extraordinarythe characterizations and performances were just wonderful throughout this movie james mcavoys robbie turner was excellent keira knightlys cecilia tallis was solid and convincing saorise ronan as the young 13 year old briony tallis was just extraordinary for her age i hope that we see more of this young talent all of the supporting actors and actresses were first rate special props should go to vanessa redgrave for her affecting and very convincing cameo as the elderly brionynow i do have two criticisms that to be honest may or may not be reasonably laid at the doorstep of this movieone is that to me the build up to the arrest felt like it may have been somewhat long maybe a little shorter would be better maybealso from time to time i plain old had problems making out what was being said i dont know if this is because i was simply so overwhelmed by the visual imagery that i wasnt paying as much attention to the dialog as i usually would or maybe the audio in my theater may have been a little offbut these are really minor drawbacks to the movie if they are drawbacks to the movie at all again im just not sure to me this is simply a splendid wonderful and captivating movie no lessbefore i close i have something to say on a personal notemy father  mother were both members of the greatest generation  the wwii generation which is depicted with such extraordinary clarity in this movie my father was a soldier in wwii my mother waited on the home front as she waited for him to come home i take away from this movie a very strong sense that this is a true and authentic representation of what that period of time was like for this generation i come away from this movie with a deep deep deep feeling of sheer gratitude for this generation for the last half of the movie i simply could hardly stop crying and left the theater crying as well tears of joy and gratitude and of sadness at the passing of this amazing generationall in all then if you want to see an amazing period piece about the extraordinary and ordinary people of the greatest generation set in the late 1930s  1940s please see this movie it is absolutely one of the most delightful and authentic human tales of the world war ii generation that ive ever had the privilege of experiencing and the movie conveys its story with the most lovely most beautiful most affecting images that i have seen in years perhaps decadesas i feel deep gratitude for this generation i feel deep gratitude to director joe wright and everyone who brought this movie to us it seems so little to say but ill say it anyway thanks,sad
from joe wright the acclaimed director pride and prejudice comes his sophomore effort based on the best selling novel by ian mcewan the film tells the story of robbie and cecilia two young lovers torn apart by a false accusation of young briony cecilias sister robbie is sent to prison and in exchange for his incarceration he must serve in world war ii for his freedomthis is technically and visually the best film of the year the stunning cinematography by seamus mcgarvey which acts like a photographer capturing the glimpses at the doors of heaven are absolutely breathtaking the scenery and images are all but believable as we are thrown into a time of passion betrayal corruption and tormentnow ive never been a fan of british cinema like the next avid oscar watcher never cared for sense and sensibility pride and prejudice wasnt terrible but nothing great howards end and the remains of the day are mediocre to me the reason i say this is that i was feeling the way i felt about those films with for the first half i thought was melodrama to the extreme and overly emotional and presented that it disengaged the viewer from the picture as the film continued i felt myself being closely drawn to the performance of james mcavoy very reminiscent of jude laws performance in cold mountain but with more depth more life more responsethe melodrama continued and all of a sudden comes this powerful last third of romola garai who plays the briony at 18 whos performance is very responsive and spacious heats up the screen with poise and control garai who hasnt had success in with mediocre performances and films like dirty dancing havana nights and vanity fair finally is given some scenery to chew inhabiting the guilt and despondency of briony was quite a task and sincere effort to bring her to the viewer with aggression yet subtlety was greatkeira knightley who has teamed up with joe wright before in his directorial debut is beautiful in elegance but nothing extroverted that makes you take her with you after the film ends her romeo  juliet story with mcavoy is the most tender parts of the movie however disappointment is the only feeling i can describe to you the reader with her work here with expectations so high maybe that was her downfall with myselfsaoirse ronan who has been reaping all the buzz is a talent to watch in the future but alas i cant wallow in the glory of ronan without feeling garai is missing out on the glory it is the best child performance of the year by far and her curiosity and crush on robbie is special to the film ronan holds her own against the other talents in the filmin the end its the wonderful veteran actress vanessa redgrave that steals the show and inhabits older briony which singled handedly saves the film in its entirety all the melodrama and over zealous antics of the film were summed up in the finale and because of redgrave it all made me swallow it a whole lot better redgrave holds all the tragedy of the film in her brief and final moments that encourage all of us to share in the love for all humanity thinking about all the things that you regret and wish you could change is the solution to the film in the sense of the word is needed in all our lives as the one thing that is a necessity but everyone hesitates to take the film is a work of artgrade ,sad
this is a movie where coming in late like the couple behind me tonight will lead you to be utterly mystified the movie unfolds and envelopes you with a complex plot with a sudden shift at the end if youve read the book you know what happens nonetheless the movie is worth seeing if only for its absolutely pitchperfect depiction of the characters environments and situations actually i gained an insight into the book by watching the movie which for me is extremely rare i dont give tens  a movie would have to basically be the second coming for that to happen  so this 9 is about as good as it getsby the way the version i saw here in the uae was bowdlerized if youre looking for that crucial scene that was snipped search youtube for and gq,sad
i had a difficult time staying awake people near me were playing with their cellphones my friend had read and liked the book and she didnt like the movie i should have followed the advice of the reviewer on emily rooneys heres boston who said something like dont botherthe movie is based on a very simple plot but seems like it lasts forever and whats the point anyway had just also seen gone baby gone which was captivating and presented a very interesting and difficult moral dilemmaive read many other reviews here to make sure i didnt miss any key elements of the story or characters or relationships and i didnt,sad
i wont rehash the major plot points because enough reviewers have done so the problem with this film the motivation for the characters behaviors is undeveloped nonexistent really what could robbie and cecilia possibly have in common other than sexualphysical attraction that certainly isnt enough to warrant 45 years of pining for one anotherwhy does briony falsely accuse robbie of her cousins rape has she always been living in cecilias shadow and sees an opportunity to gain attention for herself is she jealous because at this point in her life she lacks the physical beauty of her older sister as the son of a servant robbie would have known from birth that the daughters of the house were off limits and why in the name of god does the poor rape victim marry her attacker years later nauseatingif briony wanted to atone why didnt she seek out the authorities and recant her horrible lie writing a novel about robbie  cecilia with a happy ending instead of the tragic truth doesnt even begin to make things right and she does so later in life when she knows shes dyingi felt emotionally depleted and angry with myself for watching the whole film hoping it would redeem itself skip this movie,sad
with a title like we expect something moral and uplifting what we get instead is the selfgratifying maunderings of an aging authoress of bodice rippers as a spoiled child she ruins three lives by lying or letting her imagination go wild which is the same thing those with ruined lives are killed in ww2 but our heroine the little snot goes on to write 21 novels the last of which is her confession she writes her dead victims a happy ending is that no its yet another act of selfishness the film is suitably atmospheric and the morays and habits of the british upper class continues to mystify but this is only an entertainment wholly unworthy of the title is much harder work than this film could ever do,sad
ive seen four films from last year that were nominated for best picture and i liked 2007 the most i read the book when it was first published back in 2001 liked it but did not think of it much before the movie was released i did not rush to the theater to see  mostly because it was universally compared to the english patient i sat through the english patient once and decided that i would not want to see it again well to make the long story short i rented when it was released on dvd and to my utter delight it turned to be the best movie of last year its first part 45 minutes in the talliss family estate that depict one long hot summer day in 1935 the day that had dramatically and tragically changed the future of the films many characters is simply cinematic triumph the atmosphere of sexual tension of longing of discovering love and immediate losing it forever has been recreated masterfully the first third of the film depends a lot on the inner monologues body languages on the differences in ability to see something and to interpret it i found directors choice in showing the same events from different points of view very creative and appropriate for this kind of cinematic story telling i was very impressed by dario marianellis oscar winning score that used the sound of typewriter as a leitmotif i found it very fitting for the film which is about a devastating power of word that could be the deadliest weapon of all shrapnel and bombs just finished the deed that three simple words had started on the evening of one hot summer in 1935 i found the middle part of the film somewhat weaker not as intense with the emotional impact as the first part until one mournful tragic scene of the wars horror as seen through robbies eyes once again i was fascinated by the directors and young actors art of saying much without a wordin the movie with no single bad performance we are rewarded in the final with short but memorable appearance of vanessa redgrave who as one of my friends commented has only her face eyes and voice to work with but this is an actress whom katharine hepburn favored over all actresses and remarked that she was a thrill to look at and to listen to the short epilogue with redgrave brings the movie to the same high level as its amazingly artful opening part after i finished watching the first thing i did  i placed the hold for the english patient ten years is a long time maybe ill see it differently now or maybe the fact that anthony minghella who had interviewed redgraves character in the last scene of suddenly and untimely passed away last march had added to my decision to revisit his film,sad
there are not enough words to describe how truly amazing this movie is it was exceptional and most definitely one of the best movies i have ever seen every scene is breathtaking the director really brought mcewans words alive and stayed true to his story you are taken into the mind of young briony tallis whose innocence imagination and childhood fantasies changes the lives of everyone around her with one simple lie one small accusation she destroys the lives of the two people she cares for the most james mcavoy and keira knightley were in a league entirely of their own their performances as robbie turner and cecilia tallis were phenomenal they had that spark and that chemistry that really make the movie what it is but i must say that james mcavoy was both the lead role and star of the film i love him in every movie hes ever been a part of as an actor he possesses the talent and ability to invoke emotion in you from every scene he can make you laugh one minute and cry the next he is truly talented some of the most powerful scenes are when he is in the war just trying to make it back to the woman he loves and thinking about her every step of his journey the scene where he comes across a field of dead school children and begins to cry was very moving and then theres the scene wheres hes just lying there at night looking at the picture of the cottage until the match goes out wanting so much to be home there with her that was another tear jerker one of my favorite scenes too was right after cecilia comes up from the water and grabs the broken vase out of his hand and he just watches her walk away and then he goes over to the fountain and lays his hand on top of the water just to be close to her that was another really beautiful scene but what i loved the most was how much they both loved each other and all he wanted to do was just get back to her so that they could be together and i hate that they never got that chance the ending truly shocked me i really thought that everything was going to turn out the way it was supposed to and that briony would change her testimony and he would finally be cleared of any shame or reproach that he suffered because of her and i really thought they were going to get married and live happily ever after because they so rightly deserved a happy ending then come to find out that briony never had the courage or the decency to go and see her sister that day to try and make things right her character irritated me so much not just because she lied but because she was a coward and she ruined two peoples lives without cause or reason she could have fixed what shed done but she chose not to she only wrote that last book at the end because of her guilty conscience but even then what she did all those years ago was still unforgivable still im glad that despite all the odds that were against them they got a chance to see each other that one time in the caf and despite it all they still loved each other all the same maybe more even however even as evil as it sounds i am glad that they both died in the end so that one didnt have to suffer all the pain and heartache alone and go through life without the other i did like the very last scene too it gave you a sense of closure and was exactly how it should really have been all in all is a love story and one that stands the test of time and endures a lie the horrors of war and even death it was heartbreaking but then again most great love stories usually are,sad
with all of the ocsar buzz and a cover that looked like other epic classics such as the english patient i decided to rent this movie i really wish that i hadnt as it was the worst movie i have seen in many yearscharacter and plot development are awful and you are not given enough of the main characters relationships to believe the totality of the story the movie also jumps around and is very very confusing the scenes that were chosen for the film do nothing for the movie resulting in an unfocused piece of cinemaway too much time is spent on pointless war scenes and the story is entirely clichdi wouldnt watch this again if someone paid me,sad
joe wright the bafta awardwinning director of pride  prejudice has reunited with his filmmaking team and his academy awardnominated actress keira knightley one of my favorite actresses for another classic british romance starring james mcavoy as her leading man i had read the original novel and i thought it is a good wwii romanceunsolved mystery storyi would quiver and twitch during the suspension in the film like when briony saw robbie her crush and cecilia her older sister by the fountain and also when she read the letter written with sadisticperverted undertones when in reality it was a second draft that robbie deemed to silly to use briony assumes that robbie is a nymphomaniac and it is with this notion that she accuses robbie with the rape of cecilia but really they were making lovehello shes only 13 she shouldnt see that so overall my last word is that this is an great film to see,sad
the movie starts innocently but that doesnt mean its innocent please just dont expect any brilliant performances you would be disappointedexcept saoirse ronan playing young briony tallis who is really convincing actors go for nothing they are here you can see them but they are not playing keira knightley cant play well even if she wanted because she has nothing to play james mcavoy is not able to play at allplot too chaotic and complicated story seems to be too much even for the filmmakers youll find yourself lost and its not going to be your fault strange story will make you feel at least uncomprehending too much life involutions and too little to be told in two hourson the other hand the technique is excellent i can say this was one of the best photography directions i have ever seen what pleased me most was a continuous shot on dunkuerque which lasted about five minutes when the camera followed robbie throughout his walk around the place left him few times went its way and met him again elsewheregood point for music too compositions of typewriter sounds together with jeanyves thibaudets piano created really interesting music backgroundi give 4 points for the technique 1 for saoirse ronan this movie is not one of those worthvisitingit,sad
an incredible bore a pretentious bore concocted by someone who thinks like this i know whats beautiful lets have a beautiful actress pretend that shes lovelorn while we silhouette her face against moonlit waves under the white cliffs of dover and then well focus the camera on that and play dreck music for excruciating tortuous seconds lets have beautiful people argue and have bad luck and get frustrated in love and have to go to war and focus on their supposedly soulful faces for excruciating tortuous secondsand meanwhile all those seconds are adding up to a single extended contrived godawful boredommany people make mistakes when theyre young and when theyre old many people get frustrated in love many people go to war thankfully the real stories are seldom as boring and pretentiousand in the end as uglyas this fake one,sad
im likely the worst person to write a review of this type of movie films about the upper class british set in the victorian era the prewwi period or between wwi and wwii have always bored me to sleep emotions get reduced to clichd glances and facial twitches the same holds true for but theres the clich of young love interrupted laid on top of all that since the older sisters beau had been at cambridge for four years and shed kept her distance until their last summer together any love they had was largely a fantasy about the ideals of love knowing the low percentage of young love that survives i didnt believe that a woman in her early 20s in the late 1930s would carry a torch for five years while separated from her similarlyaged lover conversely i couldnt believe that she didnt beat her sister within an inch of her life to make her recant her false testimonyeven if i had believed it there wasnt enough character development to make me care if the movie had covered the fracturing of the family as the result of the elder sisters estrangement then death or if it had covered the wronglyconvicted young mans time in prison then there would be the basis for investing myself in the fate of the two young lovebirds but just seeing them pine in their minds for each other holding on to the ideal of their lover to sustain them thousands of miles apart didnt move methe socalled of the younger sister rang false striking me as a selfish public catharsis rather than a true repentance in fact in modern parlance the younger sister displayed traits of a borderline personality not caring about the impact her actions have on others nearly drowning herself at the edge of a waterfall to see if the object of her crush would rescue her without considering his safety is not the sign of a caring child she was old enough and smart enough to realize that her false testimony would wrongly send a man to jail but she didnt recant her storytelling couldnt possibly heal any wounds at the late date she wrote it and her life as a writer did nothing to make up for her selfserving actions as a young girl i doubt such a person could realize that there was anything she did that requiredfurther adding to the clichs is the score i dislike movie music that overtly tries to tell me what to feel at any given moment and the ratatattat of the typewriter and surging strings at key moments were intrusively obvious,sad
i have found somewhat disappointing even though i have not read ian mcewans novel it is rather obvious that only a great novel could inspire such a good story and the story is by far the best what this movie has acting is distant second best and the rest is only fair apparently the main problem is that the director joe wright has little clue about how to make a psychological drama and with amazing persistence treats this genre as an action movie or a thriller after the first 15 minutes i became so annoyed and tired with an endless stream of fastpacing flashandgo scenes that i was really looking forward to a commercial break and  surprise  the commercial break came up although a little late it happened when cecilia keira knightley was leaving on a bus with robbie james mcavoy running after her the back of the bus had a large slogan painted across have a guinness when you are tired it looked just perfect beside beautiful keira knightley indeed to summarize it would be unfair to say that the film has totally ruined the story however it leaves an impression that its creators perhaps needed a bit more guinness,sad
on boxing day me and my family went to the movies to watch i didnt think of it much as i do now but it really made me feel saddened deep inside this was the best drama flick i had seen since american beautythe movie had wonderful performances by the unknown and known actors and actresses at some scenes you feel confused with the time that the current part is set in this movie has changed my view completely on drama movies the way that the film was directed it is visible that the performers were into the storyline keira knightley showed excellence in acting along with james mcavoy though the film is an r what would a good emotional film be rated pg this has got to be right up in the best movies of all time near titanic,sad
movies dont get much better than it was nice to watch a critically acclaimed film that left you surprised by its power and intelligence usually its the other way around is a beautifully told love story that is both gripping and tragic without going into too much detail the story shares some common elements with the english patient both are based on acclaimed novels and include a pair of starcrossed lovers both stories are set before and during the second world war and feature military hospitals aristocratic men in tuxedos and a british army in retreat from the germans another key similarity is a beautiful upper class english woman who falls in love with an outsider and finds herself punished by events beyond her control joe wright is a wonderful director and the cinematography and look of the film are impressive keira knightley and james mcavoy are both excellent the period dialog by ian mcewan and christopher hampton was smart and refreshing highly recommend,sad
how much i loved this movie and i have to say it forced tears out of me quite violently what a beautiful filmas you can tell from the trailers this story is about the consequences of a misunderstanding i dont know if people realize how much damage something like this can do in the movies it almost never happens people say and do the right things all the time unless its funny then wackiness ensues but in real life it happens all the time i almost wonder if some people will think that these things dont really happen and that it makes the movie unrealistic just because theyre not used to seeing itanyway the film itself is beautiful and there is an incredibly amazing sequence when they get to a beach it goes on for a few minutes and i really thought that was breathtaking i dont think im familiar with the director but he did some great work he and the cinematographer because to look at it its just sumptuous the cast was also amazing a few different actresses played the young girl at different stages and i dont know if they really look that much alike or if i just bought into it because the movie was so absorbing but they all did fantastic work james mcavoy has one of those faces its so clear you cant stop looking at him kinda the same way you cant stop looking at al pacino he was underappreciated in the last king of scotland so im glad to see hes getting some attention for another great role and keira knightley continues to surprise me beautiful as she is she could just kick back and do a lot of vanity projects and collect pirates royalties but she continues to prove herself as an actressthis movie will be loved by people who love a film like doctor zhivago or the english patient its not as long as those but it fits into that epic love story genre and zhivago is on my very short list of favorites so i wouldnt say that lightly there are some graphic scenes but of war wounds not the kind of graphic i was expecting and there is one very bad word in it that becomes somewhat of a focal point but if youre a mature individual who doesnt mind those things and who enjoys classic film with war and romance then this is most likely for you,sad
i live in new york city saw the film in the best possible conditions opening day third screening with a good friend whod already seen it in sandwich kent this past summer he didnt really prepare me for what i was about to see hit me like a tidal wave usually when a film is very good it takes a little while for me to consider what id just experienced not this time i was completely affected by this movie from beginning to end most critics in new york have been very good and careful about not revealing too much of this epic story they mostly tell of the excellent production values and rightfully so it would be a great disservice to their readers to spoil moviegoers experience swept awayand what about that green dress,sad
two names keira knightley and james mcavoy they are incredibly brilliant and their acting is flawless in this absolutely stunning movie from the scenery to the acting to the musical score this movie is absolutely spectacular this is true filmmaking in the fleshthe first part of the movie is just incredible from the lush countryside mansion to a gorgeous knightley and a handsome james mcavoy its just visual poetry these two create such chemistry between their characters that it seems obvious why they would wait for each otherthe story is nuanced beautifully translated from ian mcewans novel and joe wright must get a best director nod and win keira knightley has come a long way from her bend it like beckham days she was outstanding in pride and prejudice but this is the defining role for her she is superb and absolutely nails it she plays cecilia as a conflicted young woman and her accent is right on the money this is her best performance to date and deserves a golden globe and oscar nod she will be robbed if she doesnt get bothsimilarly james mcavoy is wonderful in this movie what this man can say with one look is incredible definite oscar nod here toojust a brilliant astonishing accomplishment by the director and the actors and it shows you how putting together the right cast and crew and the megatalent inherent in this movie equals brilliancethis movie teaches filmmakers how to successfully translate a literary masterwork to the big screenthis movie is destined to become a movie classic people will be talking about this movie many years from now,sad
i was all set to be really impressed with this film but nearly laughed at how ridiculously serious it took itself this when i wasnt bored out of my mind wondering if i should bother watching it to the end i assume the director wanted a melodramatic feel as if watching an old humphrey bogart flick before actors learned how to be natural on camera it kept bringing to mind madeline kahn and gene wilder in young frankenstein and i couldnt help but imagine a spoof on saturday night live the exception was vanessa redgrave but her part was an alltoobrief scene at the very endthe plot moved so slow at times i wondered if they skipped dailies all together and just left every scene in the dp did an exceptional job but thats about all i can say that and vanessa redgrave is a goddess but it amazes me that this movie is getting any attention whatsoever it must be from people who loved the book ftr i havent read it,sad
im a huge james mcavoy fan and on discovering that he was making this through imdb no less i decided to read the book before the film came out i really liked the book and thought it would make an excellent film as certain chapters were too long and unnecessary what a fine film it has indeed mademcavoy is particularly powerful as robbie turner a character who completely transforms during the film and who you root for constantly saoirse ronan too is amazing both ronan and mcavoy pull off perfect upper class english accentsas is romola garai the only weak link is keira knightly who i really dislike as an actress as she is stiff and limited but the film is really about briony and robbies journeys and so her performance isnt particularly crucialthe cinematography is spectacular the dunkirk sequence is breathtaking the chemistry between the leads is perfect the scene where they meet over tea fizzles with tension and is one of my favourite scenesand the score is completely right the writing and direction fit the plot setting and acting perfectly and joe wright is a director to watch for in the futureso far my favourite film of the year by miles and im hoping both the film and mcavoy  ronan receive the recognition they deserve at the oscars next yearhighly recommended a,sad
2007 has been a slow year up until now at least i have been unimpressed by practically every release of the year so far hence my uncertainty of whether i should let my expectations rise for the opening of instead i decided to go in without listening to the hype i came out of the cinema exhausted yet it was a good kind of exhaustion the kind of exhaustion found after an emotionally draining experience which actually succeeded in moving the viewer has best picture material written all over it and at this current stage i sincerely doubt that i will find any 2007 film to surpass itadapted from the novel of war veteran ian mcewan is directed by young british talent joe wright weaving a convoluted sometimes fascinatingly dreamlike story of unforgiving love in ww2 britain centres on a rich family torn apart by a terrible crime and a love that could never be centring itself on three key characters the young briony tallis played by saoirse ronan her elder sister cecilia tallis keira knightley and their housekeepers son robbie turner james mcavoy from here on the film depicts the misinterpreted relationship drawn between cecilia and robbie the film conducts a web of disillusionment and regretfor me the finest element of is the editing which is some of the most subtly detailed of recent years it is the type of fresh editing which enables the viewer to realise how even more alluringly intelligent the picture is for example the moment where it cuts from keira knightley diving to james mcavoy bringing himself up from under the bathwater there are numerous other moments to name such as the cigarettes and opera sequence or the lavishly romantic sex scene everything fits together with a nonsuperficial ease providing a sense of far more thoughtful filmmaking having the pressing typewriter beats playing against a persons hurried walk is another notable case of sound editing it should be noted because it helps the atmosphere have an additional level of unavoidable allure you just cannot refuse to ignore the adaptable use of stylisticallyenhancing editing cinematography also plays a huge part in the picture too rather than simply relying on a cleancut narrative and some noteworthy performance the film makes an effort to employ all the features which start to create real cinema the fiveminute long trackingshot found when the troops enter dunkirk left me in awe conveying the destruction through its confrontational setpiecesnevertheless the acting is yet another one of the films triumphant endeavours being that the directors vision and the actors insights are fused together with an undeniable awareness meaning the film is at liberty to take a consistently smooth pace the camera seems to pick up every detail the performers exert eg the recurring use of handeye gestures to echo the feelings found within awkward or crucial moments evidently a lot of time was spent rehearsing the magnificent screenplay since all the actors deliver their lines with a secured knowledge but without the viewer feeling as though anything was overly rehearsed even keria knightley left me stupefied considering i have become exempt to seeing her provide wooden performances which offer nothing whatsoever for a film yet she is quite sublime in exemplifying the features of an upperclass woman proving that she can tackle mature roles meant i felt pleased to see a genuinely positive performance from the evergrowing star james mcvoy is by far the films overall star thoughnot only is a romance it is a war film and drama too i admit that i expected the film to be the generic sentimental tweaking on a periodpiececostumedrama premise to my great surprise i was blown away stunned by the dynamic personalities which were being portrayed onscreen and left in a daze over the luscious visuals essentially is a romance and i would be ignorant to deny it nonetheless i found it to be much more than a romance but in fact a lyrical journey of culpability,sad
i had the privilege to watch this movie on a screening the poster and title werent appealing for me at 1100 in the morning i didnt know what the story was about but from the beginning till the end the movie was fascinating i had no idea what would happen in the movie the story unfolds beautifully it is a nice if you dont see any trailers reviews beforehand for me everything felt right story plot acting camera editing etc i really liked the sound design changing in the music score the typewriter sounds as a theme was a beautiful way to point out that the love story was made up if this movie isnt going to win some prices im going to eat my 22 monitor,sad
i guess probabilities exist that would see me taking out aliens and cowboys child 44 and this piece of crap from the library on the same day all three suck and often in the same waythis movie is a mean girls with level1 tarantino a schedule ii shyamalan with an altman tracking shot kicker the tarantino is because it jumps around in time a very 1990s device and pretty bankrupt in this day and age worse yet it plays the exact same scene over just from a slightly different pov so it wastes your time while it confused the storyline its a shyamalan since it has a sociopath twist at the end this allows the writers to hurt you the same way the creeptastic girl in the story hurts everyone around herthe altman kicker is the long tracking shot at dunkirk in a scene that was irrelevant to the story its as if these young directors have to brag at cocktail parties oh i shot a horse chase in the desert aliens and cowboys or in this case oh i shot a beach scene from wwii because the technology of moviemaking has advanced so much the scene does look better but these selfabsorbed directors put it down solely to their geniusthe horror of this movie is that it made money and got acclaim which will only encourage more of this selfindulgent crap i guess if your brain is still infantile and you like pretty colors and distracting sounds yeah this film is great for that if you have moved past a noisy mobile dancing over your crib to the point where things have to make at least a little sense this movie is atrociousacting is good other than direction that has them all seem autistic as they all pause for 12 seconds rather than respond to whatever manufactured senseless dramatic situation they are faced with direction is so inept he changes the actress playing the star and also starts referring to her by her last name instead of her first what point in this crap symbolism she is changing go back to film school and stay thererobin williams said cocaine is gods way of telling you that you make too much money a deleted scene titled walking through the fields is gods way of telling you that you have too much budgetthe movie is titled but that is not what it is about first off there is no the creep girl does not recant until she is 79 years old robbies mother her parents everyone she hurt is dead cumberbatch is dead unable to reply to her new accusations some the movie seems to be a love story until the shyamalan happens and its all a lie told by the lying sociopath narcissist girl who ruins everyones life including the people that watch this drekso just when you think are are watching a move about a young couple its really about this despicable creepy crap brat great i love to see scheming creep sociopaths especially ones that maneuver their lies into a big life payoffyou could toss out all the war scenes and the scenes with anorexic girl then it would be about briony you would have to expand her pov and linearize the story line thing is who would want to watch this creepy little liar a novelist might think the story is all about the little budding writer but everyone else sees her as an ancillary little distraction to life a dorkthere were implausibilities like why didnt the police retrace robbies path to prove he couldnt have tried to rape the girl and prison for attempted rape pretty much a mild assault no hardly even if her daddy was lord truplewaite of devon on hardwickethe movie was like a promo reel for the director showing off his scenes the hiding from the boche the trudging in the field the hospital scene i guess that is why i hate this movie so much the soldiers coming into the hospital moved me to tears and rather than stick to a coherent logical story he had to bounce off to his next selfindulgent showoff clip reeli agree with another commentator that there is a privileged class in the world that never had to work at anything and always is guaranteed to have a happy ending so a happy ending is boring to them whereas to us its the rarest of occurrences i am sorry that the marie antoinettes of the world like this movie it shows we are in need of a colony collapse disorder,sad
am i allowed to give two marks for the two halves of a film if i could it would have been 8 for the first hour and a 3 for the second hourthe first half was wonderful wonderful plot with the directing of the excellent cast everything it should be and the scenery cinematography etc there to support what was going on not just to be there to carry the film the awards this film won must have been given for this first hour as the second half didnt deserve themwhen the second half started we couldnt believe what a let down it all was the film just seemed to suddenly meander from scene to scene with no real purpose and even less plot joe wrights usually astute direction of the story seemed to disappear and we wondered if he hadnt been replaced by somebody else when he lost interest in the project and that the new guy didnt have a clue what to do with the story he was leftscenes were included simply because they were visually dramatic not because they added to the plot for example the lengthy scene done in one take of jame mcivoy wandering around the beach with troops everywhere it accomplished nothing in terms of adding to the plot with its extreme length but it certainly was visually stunning why film it the term selfindulgence by the director came to mind and the scene with the older briany and the french soldier in the hospital what was the point was it supposed to make me feel differently about briany it didnt did it relate to something in the book that wright had left out when deciding what to include in the movie possibly but not having read the book i dont know it just felt pointlessfilming clichs soon appeared one after the other for lack of anything else to do lady macbeth scrubbing her hands to get the blood out soldiers walking through a field of poppies a character standing in front of a giant screen showing two lovers kissing lights being turned on one by one as another key character walks toward the camera the underwater image towards the films end come on i mean really thats all you can come up withdrifting aimlessly another phrase that came to mind when thinking about the second half of the movie it just felt like wright didnt know what to do with the material so thought hed shoot some nice scenes and put them together and hope it all worked it didntarguably the point of most of the second half is only finally revealed in the closing 5 minutes with the dramatic narrative conclusion i get that but by then it was far too late we were annoyed wed lost interest we were bored and we no longer cared,sad
i was actually very surprised i liked this movie so much i didnt think the book was that fantastic not very memorable i thought the acting was great and the filming superb the whole time my husband and i were thinking that stupid girl and i kind of hate that feeling i enjoyed it more than he did i agree with another poster that this is keiras best performance im not a huge fan but she did great and didnt annoy me thrown back shoulders and turned out arms aside this was her best role i really liked mcavoy he is simply a fantastic actor in just about everything ive seen him in it was a little long but im glad it went into the depth it did in the beginning to give a sense of history and background a great film,sad
first of all a comment on style ticks all the boxes in britishness you cannot but love the mannerisms the photography and the dialogue a classy film only brits can dothen its the acting although all performances are great there are two performances that stand above the rest james mcavoy and saoirse ronan sometimes characters define the actors but these two actually redefined their characters keira is undoubtedly stunning and lovable and she did indeed great but shes overshadowed by the sheer quality of the other two from the other two brionys vanessa redgrave shows what an excellent actress she is by perfectly mimicking the posture gestures and talk of little saoirse while romola garai unfortunately was not such a good fit and it seems this is mainly a casting errorfinally the story is very well told and while the movie may leave a sad taste it is actually a proof of its strength this is what good movies do they have the capability to imprint sentiments to the audience,sad
james mcavoy gave the best performance in i didnt think i would think that but he was terrific i would give him an oscar nomination for sure redgraves eyes at the end tell all seriously you didnt even need her tremendous speech because its all in her body language garai is great during and after her encounter with the french soldier as well as the apartment scene the praise for ronan doesnt capture how good and natural she is knightley was fine but doesnt rate with any of the brionys or mcavoythe cinematography in the movie is remarkable not only for the stunning tracking shot but for when briony goes into the library the way the light comes off that hair thing and then the lampthe script was a very good adaptation of the book and the direction of wright couldnt be better,sad
i am not a fan of love stories in fact this movie was not my first choice to see this year i fully admit that my girlfriend dragged me to this movie and i dug my heels in since i had no desire to see it in the end im glad i relented because it is one of the better movies that i have seen in a long time after watching it my first thought was finally a realistic love story i have two pet peeves when it comes to movies happy endings and love always triumphing over all in small doses these are okay but put together as they are in 99 times out of 100 it is a bit sickening this movie was the one in a hundred to have the tenacity to be realistic and is worth every minute for it while some would argue that movies should be designed to escape reality for some time most love stories take this too far and the lovers end up together regardless of the situation that is not the case with this movie and it is refreshing to escape the sappiness that most movies offer for the harshness of the movie the abrupt and sudden change of pace that the movie offers shocks you at the core and reminds you that movies can be a form of art yes the movie is a bit slow at certain points however this is easy enough to overlook once it comes together in the end i walked away from this movie not thinking about the slow points but rather focusing on the intense feelings i experienced and the fulfillment of my wish of a realistic ending while this will be called a chick flick by most men and dismissed by many for this reason it should not be in any way take a chance and watch this movie gentlemen you will not be disappointed well unless you insist on the unrealistic happy endings with love always triumphing over all,sad
after searching around for a movie to watch yesterday i finally came across i did the usual on imdb before watching it reading the trivia taking a glance at the cast list reading a spoilerless review or twobeing the nicholas sparks fan that i am i have to say that i was expecting the usual with someone dying of a terminal illness or something along those lines i was even expecting the unusual ending like the one from the french film a very long engagementthe ending of this film was totally unexpectedwho knew that something so simple could develop into a monstrous misunderstanding that changes the entire outcome of things this is a very different film and it does things in a way that makes you question why but by the end it leaves you thinking why not while parts of it may be confusing everything becomes clear by the end the ending is simply marvelous ive never seen anything quite like it you would like to think that its complete but after what has happened it can never be there is humor there is mystery there is romance there are twists and turns and there is heartbreakit is not everyday that you come across something as powerful as and when you do its something that carries you out of your seat and blows you away leaving you awestruck at the sheer beauty of it all as the credits roll,sad
tells a story of a young girl saoirse ronan who witnesses a terrible thing which changes many lives dramatically what is real and what is the truth plays with these subjectsjoe wright has directed a brilliant drama where beautiful scenery and great story play the biggest part the brilliant novel by ian mcewan is fitted to the silver screen fantastically the suspense is holding you tight in its grip the music supports the movie and gives a delightful touch to the storytelling the cast especially james mcavoy as robbie and young and talented saoirse ronan as briony deliver their roles with such a presence the appearance of vanessa redgrave is great also the episodic scene technique was imaginative and very mindteasing which was a very essential ingredient to the plotit was very surprising that director wright didnt get a oscar nomination for his achievement the screenplay of christopher hampton also lost in the academy awards both wright and hampton did a superb job but this was clearly a year of the coen brothers very well earned of course gladly dario marianelli won the golden statue for best achievement in musicis a clever beautiful emotional and touching experience definitely a worth watching,sad
my generation grew up on the novels of ian mcewan as undergraduates we ate up the illicit thrills of first love last rites and the cement garden we reveled in the delicious viciousness of the comfort of strangers it crescendoed with the cathartic joy of life death and rebirth in the child in time nothing lasts of course and black dogs amsterdam and enduring love all failed to scale previous heights we smiled indulgently at the dabble with childrens literature this list isnt comprehensive but you get the point  there was a distinct cooling off between mcewan and his publicand then along came an incredible startling return to form that ripped your heart outfilm adaptations of mcewan have hardly set the heather on fire i approached the movie aware of all the plaudits but expecting at best a decentish bastardization of the novel instead the film achieves the cathartic heights of its source material mcavoy is outstanding the weight of injustice chiselled on his every expression the technical aspects of the film are superb the dunkirk extended steadicam shot both outrageous and aesthetically appropriate the score is playful but serious in perfect harmony with mcewans devastating conceitmcewan fans will appreciate the elliptical structure rewinding of time flash backs and flash forwards having said that my japanese viewing partner had not read the novel but appreciated the film immenselyfor some odd reason the child in time mcewans best novel remains unfilmed i sincerely hope the people responsible for will one day turn their attention to that masterpiece,sad
i watched this film at skopje film festival 08 and it was one of the best that this years festival offered to the macedonian audience in skopjeill try to explain a couple of thingsat first it is very slow at times be prepared for that thats the only minus i can think of in this movie i think a few scenes could be left out and the movie wont lose anything at all but if you know the history of great love stories on film you know that the most of them are long flicks titanic english patient etc which is understandable considering the fact that the viewers will get to know more of the main characters so it would be easier to feel the things the characters feelyoull feel sad but satisfied at the end of this movie youll enjoy keiras performance her best till now  she is beautiful in the movie although she would be much more attractive with a few kilograms more the performances were great i cannot say who was better or worse all were convincing the original music score is one of the best ive heard in a while capturing the emotions in the movie and creating the atmosphere when neededthe movie works as a whole and its rewarding once the credits roll down i think that this film is one of those where the sum is better than the parts some that read the book may not like it as much as mei didnt even know that there is a book but as a movie it is a great piece of cinema and i recommend it to everyone that looks for quality stuff in every aspect of the art of cinema,sad
compensation for a wrongthe story is not always linear but in total spans from around 1934 when briony tallis future author is around 11 to around 2000 when she is 77 dying and announces that she has written her last of 21 novels she says in a real sense it is her first since she began thinking of it since she was a young girl the movie is made mostly from brionys perspective saoirse ronan is briony tallis at age 13 living in a mansion in rural england in 1935 her older sister is keira knightley as cecilia tallis the third member of the love triangle is james mcavoy as robbie turner son of the tallis households maid he is treated much like a family member and even his schooling is financed by them his mother is brenda blethyn as grace turnerbriony is smart and demanding and fashions herself as an author writing her first play at 13 but she also is secretly in love with robbie who just treats her as a younger sister we see a flashback to when briony was 11 or 12 her words and she jumps into a pond to have him save herbut robbie and cecilia are the ones who really are falling in love with each other something happens at a fountain briony sees it from afar doesnt understand what happened and comes away with a bad feeling against robbie partly because in her young mind feels cheated by him so when something else comes up later that evening she takes it out on robbie and it has a lasting affectso the rest of the movie is about briony eventually learning the truth and doing what she can for trying to make right her wrong good movie even touching on the conflicts in france in the early 1940s part of ww ii august 2013 update i just watched it again it is better than i had remembered it very good on repeat viewingspoilers brionys wrong was naming robbie as the man she saw that night apparently raping a teenage house guest in the field as a result robbie was imprisoned and after 3 12 years got out only because he agreed to enlist in the army and fight so his and cecilias romance was effectively ended but later briony found that the rapist and the teenager got married meaning it probably wasnt a rape at all unfortunately both robbie and cecilia now a nurse both died as a result of the war but in briony gave them happiness and a life together in her final book that was the only gift she could give to them after their deaths,sad
for these of my friends who i showed these others reviews i ever wrote this may come off as an odd one only because this time its nothing that i want to laugh about or point out necessarily in a review those previous ones have been written as a result of a sporadic burst of thought which i would sometimes experience after watching a good film that would excite me with its such a different caseto my dear friend alon rosenblum i wrote  i watched yesterday just before the oscars when i reach back into that experience while writing this i get tears rolling in my eyesi cried at the endi cried on my way out of the theateri cried in the car on my way back and then i yelled much later because the movie didnt get its best film awardi had 2 favorites last year that stood out pans labyrinth and the lives of othersthis year its and there is no movie standing close to this amazing vision and pain that has been transferred thru images and sound directly into my soul  and that couldnt even touch the tip of the iceberg of what and how i felt could not fit into my regular burst of desire to write because that movie took my hand and walked a path with me to remember i couldnt lock onto one particular moment and devour it with words over 2 weeks later at 1230am of saturday i felt like i should make an attempt to write a review i longed to write since watching the film itself it is a sad reality in the film world these days how rare truly good films come about either because of the abundance of available technology that sprung out in the last years which allowed too many painters too unpolished and yet ready to paint on the canvasor be that the ones who forgot what movies are about lost in their accounting and fame however it is not of a surprise to me that this gem came out of england the land of pristine acting and humble actors the land of harry potter and tea at 5 a movie so human real and touching to the core of everyone on all levels alikeif you dear reader look at other reviews people wrote on imdb you may notice one similarity people who hate it and people who love it alike will not stop talking about it for numerous paragraphs is a story of many things and people i think from human standpoint its a story about a person briony tallis who never knew how to stop creating worlds for herself in her writing as well as life it amazed me personally how she never ever changed throughout her entire life until the very end how she had to replace and justify the false ending of her book an action of which devoured her alive even after the book has been complete a girl and woman alike so trapped in their own world that the gravity of truth never applies briony turns into a study whereas she is a human being or a character in a book she needs to keep writing in order to live and therefore has the freedom to write her own reality it may not be for cecilia and robbie who were in love and wanted to be together not the atrocities of war not the death its nothing else to me but the power of ones imagination and the fruit it bears lost in her writinglife the older briony still voices out her concerns about the decisions she made for her sister and robbie and their lives writing them into a picture perfect home on the beach and shaving robbies facial hair as well as wrinkles and age off one cant really say if she is in denial its only the shocking revelation of her secrets she kept and choices she made since young age that make your hair stand still and its even scarier when you see her old and samei cried and cried and didnt know why at the end of the film was it because of the spectacular poetic acting by the entire cast without an exception was it because of the masterful hand of the director who created a movie so beautiful and strong the music or the sadness for briony tallis and her miserable life of a characterturnedghost only because the real briony never let herself exist outside of her own writingi would love to praise everyone involved above to below the line the working title and focus features joe wright the absolutely phenomenal performances by james mcavoy and keira knightley who maybe taught us what having a relationship with a character on screen is really aboutpersonally this years academy awards lost their clout of being a judge of good and bad it seemed like the traditional academy voters were replaced at the last moment by people who only like the cocktails but not watching the nominated films is the only film who can claim its title as best film of the year and it remains to be only because there was not a single day passing by when its name or plot did not come to my mind exhilarating exceptional powerful and unforgettableatonement,sad
i have an absolute no idea when i go in to watch this movie all i know it that it got nominated for oscar and bafta so that the reason i went in for and by the end of the movie i was blown away this is a truly beautiful and moving picturesynopsis briony 13 years old girls fell in love with her elder sister boyfriend couldnt stand them together so decide to accuse him of raping her cousin this incident changes the lives of everyone foreveri really love the story here it was wonderful though quite slow here and there i dont really get bored by it i think the pace was just right only problem was that i dont see much of robbie and cecilia romance i wish there were more of themwell as for the acting wise the casting of james mcavoy is the best thing in this movie he is utterly awesome keira knightley only adds stardom to the movie but didnt hold a candle compare to james saoirse ronan also did a pretty good job so do the rest of the cast actually its all balanceas for direction damn this guy is getting better and better this is his second main stream movie and it still came out this good damn he is good maybe he will be the next sam mendes i also really like the part where the director tried to show us different angle from each characters so that we can understand their vision more the movie also consists of brilliant score and cinematography and lightingoverall i enjoy the movie from its begin to the very end oh i love the ending i love almost everything in this movie maybe just a few bit of scenes that are quite unattached but overall it was brilliantrecommendation yes buy the dvd reason to watch almost everything about itreason not to hard to understand english accentrating 8510 grade aplease rate yn after read,sad
one of my favourite films of 2007 this made a great impact on me when i saw it in the cinema and watching clips screened on tv since only reminds me of the many highlights that it features the storyline of the film is wellstructured  based around a young girls confused and spiteful reactions to her older sisters romance joe wright as director subtly shifts styles leading from the clipped and mannered 1930s through the upheavals of ww2 and on to the dramatic revelations in the sterile tv studio at the conclusion delivered by the excellent vanessa redgrave this is one of those films that makes terrific use of the wide screen nowhere more so than in the excellent recreation of the soldiers views of the long wait for evacuation from dunkirk performances from the whole cast are very good with james mcavoy in particular delivering what will hopefully be just one of many memorable roles to come highly recommended,sad
is a true oscar film it received seven nominations and it deserved every one its the story of briony tallis a young writer who sees something she thinks she understands but really doesnt when she accuses her sisters lover of a heinous crime it changes the course of three peoples lives foreverthe cast is wonderful here with kiera knightley and james mcavoy giving perfect performances in the roles of the two young lovers saoirse ronan romola garei and vanessa redgrave all play briony at different points in her life ms redgrave is especially affecting in easily the smallest partall production values are done perfectly with great direction from joe wright cinematography art direction costumes all very welldone and that music what a fantastic score intriguingly mixing sound effects and music together its a shoein for best original scorein the end though its the heartwrenching story that makes the film a masterpiece as much mystery as it is romance is never boring but always changing and moving and as far as endings go this one is perfect unlike anything ive ever seen whatever you do dont spoil it for yourself if no country for old men doesnt sweep the oscars it will probably be because was right at its heels do yourself a favor and see it on the big screen while you still can 810 stars jay addison,sad
good movie with lots of drama its the typical romantic film with betrayal passion and tears it also has some moments of mystery the story is set around a forbidden romance and how one lie from a young girl who misunderstands a series of situations not meant for her perception result in incomprehensible tragedy for three lives the first hour of the movie is quite interesting with a good rhythm the next half hour turns to be a little slow almost to tiresome for my taste until the last half hour when all the issues begin to resolve the movie set is amazingly recreated in its first part in the england of the late 30s and then in the early 40s on wwii the cast is wonderful keira knightley with an outstanding performance as cecilia tallis james mcavoy also with a great acting job and saoirse ronan on an excellent role that deserve her a oscar nomination definitely a good and interesting movie worth to see,sad
when i read ian mcewans masterful novel upon its release a film adaptation seemed unfathomable mcewans metafictional multifaceted novel is a tour de force of what i believed to be inimitable depth here screenwriter christopher hampton and director joe wright turn mcewans novel into an epic beauty with powerful acting visual complexity and a story that is gracefully paced until rewarding its audience with an ending of moral consequence that many films often fail to deliver the film opens with young briony tallis typing away at her typewriter a play named the trials of arabella at age 13 briony has the mind perseverance and imagination to become a successful writer the film does not convey her peculiarities about writing in the same playfully elegant way the novel does but it still conveys her obsession and willpower however as her superficial play endeavors fall apart the plot takes a turn briony is a witness to four key events that change the life of the story as briony is in distress about her unsuccessful play she looks out the window and catches her sister cecilia keira knightley stripping down to her undergarments staring at her is robbie turner james mcavoy the son of brionys familys housekeeper briony is baffled and looks away for a second this is the first of four reasons for brionys imagination to run wild and believe that robbie turner is a sexual fanatic the second event is a mistake on robbies behalf a note written out of frustration for expressing his feelings about cecilia is giving to briony to give to cecilia it is too late when robbie realizes that he handed briony the frustration note not the final draft third a scene in the study convinces briony that robbie is a sex maniac the final event is one of the crucial events of the story and it is crucial to the theme of while wright shows both brionys perspective and robbie and cecilias to show the audience the different perspectives it is easy to empathize with the young imaginative briony briony believes she is witnessing inappropriate sexuality while robbie and cecilia are simple exploring their sexual curiosities at first it seems easy to assume that briony is an evil girl but she is simply an adolescent full of curiosity and a bit of frustration although briony is the cause of dreadful things she is not a despicable character by any means is the type of film that could have easily been an overdone love story but wright turns hamptons strong script into a story of love war and loss this film works on many levels including great acting a great score by dario marianelli and flawless directing with one of the most unforgettable tracking shots in recent film history in the final sequence of the film we meet briony again now much older and promoting what is said to be her final novel entitled the audience learns what happened or what could have happened to robbie turner and cecilia tallis from the mind of the atoning novelist briony tallis the story told through brionys character is a heartbreaking saga of the only thing she felt she could do to give herself the and piece of mind she desperately needed,sad
beautifully shot with stunning colours and exquisite tension at every crucial moment im not a huge fan of keira knightley but she served well for this film james mcavoy was a perfect as the wronged restrained but passionate lover a travesty that he was robbed of an oscar nomination the doublebacks to certain scenes and a brilliant score ensured that we were absorbed in this poignant masterpiece from beginning to end where we are met with a final heartbreaking twistperhaps not a film with an abundance of underlying messages immortalising the lovers in a book thats not call me a hopeless tragic but what she did could only generate a lifetime of suffering and regret never atoned for nevertheless it is a beautiful work of art highly recommended,sad
just as food was rationed in world war ii the waterythin story line of this film is strung out and made to last for 130 minutes there is simply not enough meat here not enough to get your teeth into and i left the cinematic table still feeling hungry but setting the story aside there is much to appreciate the casting is perfect although good in the role keira kightleys character doesnt have enough to do and not enough to merit her bafta nomination james mcavoy is excellent and a worthy contender for his nomination but he has no chance against the towering performance of javier bardem in no country for old men this time around  his time will surely come vanessa redgrave makes an appearance at the very end of the film and spends 10 minutes or so in close up using every nuance of her facial expression she is wonderfully moving wartime england is fastidiously recreated with meticulous attention to detail and with remarkable authenticity i really felt like i was there the cinematography and art direction are exquisite as are the costumes and easily merit their oscar nominations it seemed to me as though 90 of the budget was spent on one scene on the beaches of dunkerque an enormous sprawling set with thousands of extras where the camera wanders around and through the activities of the soldiers not sure why it goes on forever perhaps they had some cash left in the budget and so decided to splash out on a big scene big it is and painstakingly created but it is to my mind also superfluous visual padding to compensate for the inadequate storyline there was a wartime joke in england if this is chicken soup then the chicken must have walked through it on stilts that just about sums it up this is watery soup served in an exquisite handpainted porcelain bowl,sad
possible spoilers ian mcewans blew me out of the water when i read it shortly after publication it was better than any other novel ive read in the past 25 years although it changes certain details the movie captures the essence of the novel the tragedy caused by a 13yearold girl with a vivid imagination wrecking the lives of her older sister and her young lover with saoirse ronan as brioni the 13 year old keira knightley as cecilia the older sister and james macavoy as robby the young man sent to prison as a result of brionis misidentification of him as a rapist the movie gets off to a swift start and hurls along with the outbreak of world war ii the british retreat at dunkirk and the bombing of london where both cecilia and brioni now played at 18 by ramola garai are both working as nurses the shock at the end of the novel is also delivered by the film keira knightley james macavoy and saoirse ronan capture their characters perfectly in the early part of the movie when the beginning of the tragedy unfolds the second part of the film is a bit less satisfactory partly because mcewans description of the retreat to dunkirk was considerably more vivid than what the film is able to show  possibly because it would have taken greater resources to capture the sweep of mcewans narrative the london scenes also suffer because the novel concentrated on the ceciliarobby story line whereas the film focuses to a greater extent on the older brioni and garai is a much less compelling actress than ronan still considering the eventual outcome the choices made by joe wright the director and by the screen writer are defensible the story after all is brionis in the end however whereas was a great novel in my opinion the film version  despite superior cinematography and excellent acting is merely very good,sad
this is the fourth of the oscar best picture nominees i watched compared to the other three this movie is the one where i come out feeling that oscar is written all over it this is the one with the elegant epic feel reminiscent of past oscar winner the english patientthis is where cinematography by seamus mc garvey is a key star element all the scenes were meticulously composed shot like a special painting on a moving canvas so many breathtaking and sweeping landscapes even the scenes depicting the horrors of war were imbued with artistic insight so many vivid portraits as well with penetrating pain and anguishthis is where the musical score by dario marianelli harks back to bygone grandiosity like many past oscar winners yet the tension in the music is uniquely heightened by the sound of typewriters typing this ties in neatly with the story as the central character is a writerthe story begins with briony tallis an oscar nominated saoirse ronan a fanciful 13 year old girl who loves to write she had just read a lustfullyworded love letter by the son of their household help robbie james mcavoy to her sister cee keira knightley and actually caught them in a compromising situation in the library that night as an assault is perpetrated on a guest in their opulent household briony accuses robbie as the culprit and thus he is brought to jail this part of the movie felt like gosford park the second part of the movie traces how the love story of cee and robbie progressed through the war years four years after the arrest robbie was released from jail when he decided to join the army cee becomes a nurse however robbie gets sent to france and they continue to communicate their love through letters this part of the movie felt like cold mountain and a very long engagement i felt the third and last part of this story is the one that gives it its defining characteristic and twist the story goes back to briony now 18 romola garai she is now fully cognizant of her erroneous accusation and its tragic effects she gives up her slot at cambridge and becomes a nurse as well she seeks out robbie and her sister in order to atone for her past sins and just when you thought it is all over briony comes back again this time in the present vanessa redgrave in an epilogue with more to tell usi am not surprised that this film had already won the golden globe and the british academy awards for best picture i feel that its chance for the oscar for best picture may be compromised by the fact that its director joe wright was not nominated i am not surprised why its lead stars mcavoy and knightley were not nominated while they maybe the bigger stars in the story they play support to the main story of the briony character while this film had its flaws particularly its derivative feel in a greater part of the story as i have already indicated but so far in its totality among all the nominees i have watched this is my favored one for best picture of 2008,sad
i found this to be one of the most beautiful films i have ever seen although ultimately tragic this film drew me in from the beginning and held my attention throughout the amazing chemistry of the actors made this a believable film and truly brought these characters to life i am generally not a great fan of knightly however in this film she shines i also found that the plot was unanticipated but convincing and captured most of the audience through the film although not what i expected from the advertisements i found this film to be both thoughtprovoking and beautiful a must see for anyone who enjoys absolutely beautiful films that are not a cookiecutter image of todays hollywood,sad
as we know impubescent children mainly girls tend to be mythomaniac in what concerns sexuality mainly when moved by scenes that they watch and whose meaning they dont understand or feel fully considering his age and the absence yet of any sexual urge this is aggravated when someone they love is involved then they can be led to lie and arrive to convince themselves they are telling the truth in this movie a small girl accuses falsely a man she loves of raping a friend moved by this kind of feelings and with that she ruins her life and the lives of his elder sister and his lover the man whom she accuses the story is rather simple very simply told and not original enough to deserve a high mark however the movie is well made and worth to be seen mainly by the acting of all three main characters involved in that tragic story the suffered by the young girl develops itself through her whole life and ends in a remarkable and moving scene the last one of the movie in a very original way that one which makes us to wonder where reality ends and fiction begins,sad
i always recall roger eberts comment on anna paquins character in the piano he says she plays a little girl who is intentionally mischievous who sees things and uses them to hurt others well theres a little girl in called briony the intense 14yearold saoirse ronan whos exactly the opposite she reads something she witnesses something and makes a mistake that will chase her for the rest of her life its england in the 30s formality and distance between one person and another are the basis of ian mcewans famous novel what briony witnesses are two young people bursting in love and passion as you didnt see every day during those times but how could she understand and she drives robbie james mcavoy and her sister cecilia keira knightley away he ends up in a war she whispers come back to me he writes the story can resume our story can resume we wait however this is not the cold mountain storyline in which the blue knight has to face impossible obstacles to get to his princess no these are two lives that have fallen apart and before they did they sat together in a family table full of unspoken secrets sexual tension and disappearances all in one single day and the little girl experienced too much in such a short period of time too much to take for a joyful soul writer of plays full of fantasies is also the little girls story we come to realize and in a way the story of every individual present that night when everything collapsed joe wright teams up with keira knightley again after pride  prejudice and i cant help comparing both pieces i was expecting at least something better but makes wrights screen debut seem like a piece of broken glass in the floor you dont want to step on the appropriate correct direction its gone characters dont seem like puppets with final destinations anymore theres a creative turn this time around with the british director worried about the camera work seamus mcgarvey brilliantly inspiring cinematography a work of immense proportions that shows affection for the characters its shooting when you watch pride  prejudice you say how beautiful this looks and it stops there when watching you say how beautiful it looks and how powerful it is i think wright has done something more powerful than what he imagines keira knightley may not live up to her work as elizabeth bennett but she is perfect and looks beautiful in a completely different character with more strength and james mcavoy takes another huge step you may want to watch the last king of scotland and then thiswhat a leading man ill say no more maybe its the novel how different it is from jane austens beloved tale and how well christopher hampton adapted it covering the time changes and the different stages of life it goes through dario marianellis score unnoticeable in prejudice is definitely present here loud clear and meaningful although a little repetitive if you pay attention now that i mention repetition if you think the film abuses of flashbacks you are right but it has a purpose you see every flashback is from that day and that night and in different moments each of the main characters relive the events in their own waytake the little girl as an example i mentioned above that she makes a mistake that haunts her lifebut she thought she was doing the right thing then she grows up and when we see her as an old lady portrayed by vanessa redgrave in a heartbreaking final speech we wonder how long does it take for someone to realize the wrong they have done and everything that question means,sad
i had put off seeing because it looked like so many epic romance films that came before iti was pleasantly surprised this is a film that takes a lot of chances first and foremost is the narrative structure some of the scenes are shown out of sequence some of the scenes are shown twice and from different points of view and some scenes we later find out never really happenedfor the most part we are not told any of this so you really have to pay attention and think about what is going on unlike most films these day you cannot passively watch this filmin addition the film is carried by young saoirse ronan who dominates the screen whenever she is on the other actors are good but miss ronans performance is really specialthe directing also takes a lot of chances with lots of close ups and camera angles the music is memorable and incorporates a typewriter as a musical instrument it reminds me a lot of the film music of phillip glassif you have been avoiding because you thought you had seen it all before think again this is one of the most daring and experimental mainstream films to come out in a long time,sad
the first 4550 minutes of this film were absolutely beautiful had the film just been released as that i would have perhaps loved it more the director wright is certainly coming into his own and i am anticipating all of his upcoming films saoirse ronan was wonderful as the young briony her performance really impressed me especially considering she is so young her academy award nomination was very much deserved and not at all one of those nominations that is just tagged onto an epic film to make it look better i think i can almost even say that once her part in the film is over nothing quite holds up as welli guess this is mainly why i feel the film is disjointed we spend the first 45 minutes of the movie exploring one single day then we breeze through the final hour or so of the film and cover a span of several decades so we go from the minute exploration of the details of a day to the cliffs notes of the rest of everyone elses lifethis film was around 2 hours and really should have been right at 3 hours i felt so much was left unsaid and unexplored the pace for the first hour indicated that you were in for an english patient type of film and yet at some point the filmmakers decided not to be so bold with this projectspeaking of the english patient i am a film scholar and the director of the english patient shows up near the end of this film in a small role and that completely took me out of this film all i could think of was why did they put anthony minghella in this film i mean i know i shouldnt have been so distracted but i wasthis films marketing came in completely wrong it seemed arrogant all of the magazine interviews only focused on how it was believed that this film would rack up 14 oscar nominationsbut all said and done i still believe this film is worthy of its best picture nomination and of the nominees i might almost consider it the best although there will be blood was quite interestingbottom line see it,sad
wartorn romance is almost its own subgenre of drama though we feel weve seen it all still has some fresh ideas to deliver the film is a bouquet of imagery and gathers three interesting stories into something of a twisted love triangles narrative may be too familiar and often rushes past the point of empathy but the movie is so beautiful that we can forgive some of these faultsbriony saoirse ronan is a serious storyteller on the cusp of ladyhood she lives with her uninhibited older sister cecilia knightley on a large estate in the english country cecilia is in academic competition with a servants son robbie mcavoy as both are attending medical school with support from cecilias father brionys imagination runs wild when she thinks she sees robbie commit a horrible crime her testimony condemns robbie to prison and leads to his involvement in wwiiis most interesting when brionys story is explored shes a very smart girl but not altogether perfect  a little too prim and prone to jealousy but briony is also fiercely loyal and protective of her friends we cant completely love her but we admire her complexity hers is a story of the confusion and dark dawn of adolescence and her actions drive the rest of the filmcecilia is something of a rebel  proud and sharptongued im not a kiera fan but i enjoy her feisty nonchalant performance through most of the movie robbie is cocky but highly sentimental theyre practically made for each other and as you can guess from the posters they fall in love before robbie is sent to jail and war this is where the movie starts to lose uswhen the lovers are apart we experience their generalized pain and longing but it all feels like an outline instead of a heartfelt exploration so much attention is given to the images of war and suffering the costumes and despairing gazes that we cant fully sympathize this is complicated by how quickly their relationship develops only to be torn and kept separate through most of the movie we cant reminisce and sigh about the times they had together  there werent many we dont feel what theyre going through because its mostly done in silence against highly glorified images of war their actions arent especially telling the misty looks to the horizon speak for themselves but say little more than this sucks i want to go home there are several parts of this film that lead me to believe that its severely abridged from the novel the secondary characters are nearly perfunctory and one even pops on screen for a meaningful conversation with seemingly no context briony and cecilias parents are mostly absent the lovers meet during the war but how they found each other or why theyre separated again isnt entirely clear five important years of brionys life vanish we dont have much trouble connecting the past to the present but its nowhere near as developed as it should behowever the art of the film is very well established all of the prewar scenes glow white and are rich with pastels and florals briony always appears in white and is backlit through the movie for an ethereal innocence the shots are all highly composed and symmetrical with careful attention to the beautiful architecture and room design when passion is introduced twilight falls colors become richer and deeper and images are blurred montage is so prevalent its almost overused theres a tracking shot of robbie on the french beach with thousands of english soldiers waiting for boats to retreat home  the chaos and comedy of war is explored in this lengthly dense footage bathed in brown and gold beyond the costumes and colors the sound plays a pleasantly important part in the film brionys scenes are accompanied by the calculated clacks of percussion and typewriters scenes across oceans are connected by a thread of melody montage music dissolves into sounds of the next scene these techniques may be considered too overt but the were a joy for mehas its flaws and i can see why some would spurn it completely there are romantic clichs there is not enough time given to building the romance the ending is completely unsatisfying and gimmicky but were so cynical and wellversed as an audience that its difficult to please and nearly impossible to show us anything new without us assuming its a trick to gain our favor the primary focus of the film seems to be the art  im happy enough to hear a story that doesnt overshadow or detract from that stunning cinema,sad
i was completely amazed by the performances were incredible the cinematography was lush and brilliant and the score was genius it superbly and perfectly carried and underscored the film watching this move i was mesmerized by its beauty and captivated by the performances of the cast james mcavoy keira knightley and saoirse ronan deserve every accolade if this film has one weakness it is in its pacing though it pains me to admit it does drag in parts if you are looking for a dramaticaction war film this is not it however if you are looking for something that really does explore the human condition with all its strengths and flaws then i cannot recommend a better film,sad
this was a wellwrought film the actors pacing and dialog all worked to create believable and engrossing relationships and interpersonal dynamics in relative terms the film is faithful to the book warning spoiler coming  i have two gripes one is with the logic of the movie and the other is with its central pointmy first problem is the reasoning of the police and relatives that a man could rape a girl and then set out and find the two boys and hike back theres absolutely no thought given to the fact that the protagonist is last seen marching off into the dark with a flashlight to find the two missing boys briony heads out in a different direction stumbles upon what she thinks is a rape scene with the protagonist walking away and yet somehow the protagonist goes off to find the missing boys the movie glosses right over this incongruity yet i think in any court that was at all honest and mindful of the facts a reconstruction of the time line would have called into question the protagonists ability to have even been around to commit the crime he was accused ofthe biggest problem with the movie is that the title is unexpectedly ironic there is very little in the film sure briony becomes a nurse and tends to the wounded but the action she had to atone for didnt involve hospitals it involved stealing the chance of love away from her sister and she and her sisters mutual heartthrob we the audience are supposed to just accept that by being a nurse and by writing a happy ending briony has made up for her sins maybe i am just too much of an old testament type but she sent a man to jail and denied love between two people at a time  wwii  when there was little joy or hope to be had dunkirk was one of englands darkest hours to atone for what she did she need to make up for her specific misdeeds if i mistakenly break my mothers favorite lamp i buy her a new lamp and tell her i am sorry i dont wait a decade and write an email admitting my sin then send it out on a listservit was utterly unsatisfactory to have briony say she gave them the happy ending in her novel that she denied them in life she waited until she was on her deathbed to admit openly that she had erred how incredibly cowardly well now that the truth cannot harm me i will come forward what balderdash i love words i am using them now but i do not believe they can ever supplant our actions in their importrarely has a movie ending filled me with such revulsion how utterly remorseless of the filmmakers to create a train crash and shine a light on it until the bitter end what are we to learn from this i certainly found nothing redeeming in briony she needed to go tell the authorities of her mistake she needed to own up to what she did instead we are supposed to accept that the few pages of fantasy in a book she wrote literally decades after the death of the affected parties is somehow a form of if it is it is in gesture only it is a onecalorie soda when you really need an energy drinki left depressed and unsatisfied i could take no solace from the ending and it bothers me that this is so well liked i appreciated the reviewer who said the power of the story is that it shows the power of words to hurt and their power to heal but while that sounds nice that is not borne out i would buy it if briony had spoken truthfully to those in power i would have even been okay if she fessed up and the authorities turned her away but to do nothing is just contemptible and to me her nursing of others almost smacks of conceit and condescension it is a way for briony to feel better about herself without ever having to do the really difficult part which is to go to her parents and the police and admit her mistakethe best things i learned from this movie were 1 i am that most derided of filmgoers the one who always wants a happy ending 2 never again let my wife pick the movie at least without checking moviespoilercom to see if ill like it and 3 i genuinely hate tragedies which i have known since i read macbeth in high school,sad
well the movie was looking very promising from the day one of promos and because of that the expectations were high and the movie satisfy what you can ask for from a moviewhat i really like about the movie was when the movie starts it shows the same incidents with two different perspective which obviously makes you feel that its in the eye of the looker how heshe feels about the situation perception can be different for the same situationi have heard that this movie is based on some british romantic novel by ian mceawn personally i feel making a novel come into life on the screen is a tough job especially when the novel is itself as successful as this one thats why i would like to compliment their workas in case of acting keira knightley and james mcavoy are also brilliantno words to define their performances they should be nominated for the best prizes in their respective categoriespleasure for eyes  would strongly recommenced if you wanna watch a real good movie,sad
i read ian mcewans novel a little over a year ago for class its not the type of book id read for myself naturally i decided it would be interesting to see the critically acclaimed film adaptation follows the novel faithfully with the exception of a couple scenes it tells the story of a imaginative child briony tallis who discovers a love relationship between her sister cecilia and friend robbie she mistakes robbie for a sexual maniac and wrongly accuses him when another friend lola is attacked in the night the rest of the plot follows the consequences of this accusation and brionys attempts atthe film is oscar quality in many ways the direction is excellent the complex plot is difficult to clearly convey on screen but joe wright is able to put it together with few flaws in the first half hour or so the pacing is a bit jumbled this clears up as it develops the camerawork is well done a notable scene is the five minute singleshot recreation of the dunkirk beaches the acting is good from all parts and the character development is solid the music score was also excellent it really fit the mood of the whole movie and added a nice touch to the key scenesis an emotional film it carries a sense of sadness that few films are capable of the remarkable thing is that the sadness is not at all depressing but more sympathetic it is sad to realize the extent of such a small moment and how it could tear lives apart that is the main thing that makes a film that i would highly recommend,sad
such a film like is one that sneaks up on you it builds and builds seemingly going nowhere or not doing anything to suggest anything fantastic before hitting you with a contemporary twist its a film that makes you think thus already elevating itself above a certain level of quality there have been films that have used this little tactic in recent years that have spawned both great hate and admiration films like the usual suspects fight club and even the village the films hit you with a series of scenes that although seem disjointed and random all make sense when the apparent twist makes itself knownafter the film had ended it got me thinking which is a good sign what does actually mean i thought to myself and thats when the penny dropped such audacity to have a major clue in the films title hinting at the possible results that will happen following the events that occur in the films first plot point if that sounds complicated then good because clever films are complicated followings finale i think two thirds of what i was going to say about the film were rendered either incorrect or useless such is its nature that it relies on twisty bendy and fate driven incidences to get across both its story and tragedy i was sceptical for the best part of this film noticing a lot of frustrations and rather a few incidences of inconsistencyfirstly i did not buy how briony played by three different actresses put two and two together regarding the incident at the fountain and how she would perceive it to be anything sexual secondly i find it amazing how even in the 1930s it would seem a thirteen year old girl would be able to identify the worst word of them all granted the third occurrence of a sexual nature that happens in the library briony observes is the most blatant but i feel if shed spied them kissing previously or whatever instead of the incident at the fountain that had nothing to do with anything sexual it wouldve made for a better build up to sum up i fail to see how a thirteen year old girl can honestly see sexual discrimination between two people who are standing at a fountain talking before one of them has to take their top off so that they can get into the fountain to retrieve something but these events lead to the bigger picture because when she finds them in the library things really screw up her psychethis is where the films reoccurring theme of luckchance comes in if their hadnt been a wasp in the room briony wouldnt have gone to the window if robbie mcavoy hadnt sent the wrong note like he so stupidly does everything wouldve been fine if robbie and cecilia knightley had spoken to briony after she caught them in the library perhaps explaining what was happening and how everything would be alright briony wouldnt have felt as bad as she did little inconsistencies like this do bug me in films where the logical thing to do is substituted for sake of a story but the initial incident also has a lot of inconsistencies such as the fact briony sees another example of love andor sexual relations in the form of forced said events in such quick proximity to one another in a certain time frame the attacker is also stupid enough to recognise the witness that is briony and run off without confronting her i remember feeling that the attacker must not have known briony otherwise they wouldve hung around to explain their actions  turned out they did know briony but ran off anyway  how could they assume she didnt see their face following said events robbie finds himself in france just before the nazi invasion and the event that was the dunkirk evacuation which is brilliantly captured in one long take running parallel with this is brionys life as a nurse in london treating the injured here i wondered why we were following briony and this where the film makes you think its flailing and flailing but really its playing you because its doing everything right true briony would have no idea whats happening to robbie in france but we are shown it anyway instead cecilia is ignored only until she is visited by briony  an event that i was tearing my hair out over when questioning the characters sanity and ability to let it all go robbie gives her an earful because of her action but where i thought was going through the numbers of trying to make its apparent hero make up for past mistakes suffer an epiphany yadder yadder yadderbut no it was playing meit may sound like i am bashing but it does the business in the end getting there is a little messy but the story is very smart with a real feeling of what if said event hadnt happened and the closing montage of the fates of people is stirring because you dont see it coming you have been led to believe one thing and then had what you thought turned on its head there is enough authenticity and beauty to be had in the photography and costume with an air of tragedy and regret flowing throughout as the film switches perspectives in a confusing but rewarding manner,sad
with multiple award nominations and plenty of news hype i decided to check out strictly to see what all the hubbub was about is it overhyped or does it stand out as the best picture of 2007 the answer is both yes and novisually it a feast for the eyes the routing of the english army into dunkirk is nothing short of amazing let me clarify that too we dont see the battle leading to dunkirk but do see the aftermath in all its horribleness the crumpled structures and damaged soldiers are dark and forbidding and hold the viewers eyes even though one wants to look away from the destruction and seeming madness plastered on the screen this was the most intense sequence in the entire film it was also shot in a most uncommon way with the camera initially following james mcavoys character and then the camera splits from him and goes off on its own but returns to mcavoy later an interesting way to shoot this series of eventsthe costumes sets and props were perfect there was not a single thing that took me out of the 1930s and 1940s specifically i enjoyed the woolen army uniforms the streets of early london and the nursing uniforms the young women wore again all perfectthe acting was good james mcavoy the last king of scotland steals most of the show as the goodnatured but ultimately wronged robbie turner an educated groundskeeper at a wealthy estate owned by the family of cecilia tallis keira knightley pirates of the caribbean knightley does a fair job as cecilia a young woman in love with robbie a man far beneath her station when robbie is wrongfully accused of a heinous crime cecilia has to decide between her family or her eventual life with robbiebut more powerful than knightley was romola garai who plays her sister briony briony is the one responsible for wrongfully turning robbie over to the authorities after witnessing what she believed to be him performing a crime against a child it is briony who really rules the movie giving us her fervent wish for later in life after realizing what damage shes caused both robbie and her sisterthe powerful vanessa redgrave venus plays the aged briony as the film progresses to the modern day and we learn how futile brionys wish for are although mrs redgrave gives an astounding few minutes on film it is only a few minutes thereve been rumors that shell garner some award for this performance but i hope that these rumors are unfounded dont get me wrong she did a fine job but her brief performance doesnt warrant any kind of prizelisting the good above i have to point out that the story is not an uncommon one this is a war story something weve seen time and again director joe wright does some interesting camera work and manipulations with time but some might feel this as an attempt to force something new on a genre movie goers are all too familiar withthat said one needs to be prepared for an uncharacteristic ending if youre looking for a feelgood manreturnshomeandmarriesgirlandtheyhavefiftygrandkids kind of movie this one isnt going to make your happy tears listthis is a mixed bag as far as films go an overused premise with some uniquely new ideasbut is it the best film of 2007 it does have some of the best cinematography and great acting thanks to romola garai but its not the best that prize im reserving for no country for old men,sad
focus 2007 color 123 m romdrama keira knightley james mcavoy vanessa redgrave saoirse ronan and brenda blethyn star written by christopher hampton directed by joe wright rated r for language sexuality and adult themesi was privaleged enough to see the film tonight a film that reminds me of all the reasons i go to the movies i couldnt possibly even begin to praise this sensational film enough but here let me try this second pairing of director joe wright and keira knightley is even more successful than there last go around with pride and prejudice although i throughly enjoyed that film i found spots in it to be a little long and the film ultimately offered up nothing more than witty adult entertainment this time around the film centers on three central characters cecilia knightley robbie mcavoy and briony portrayed by three actresses through the years cecilia and robbie have spent their entire lives growing up next to one another until one hot fateful summer evening they decide to finally embrace there emotions and tell each other how they truly feel briony witnesses some events through childs eyes and through a moment of jealousy lies blaming the rape of her cousin on robbie he is torn away from his cecilia that very evening and it isnt until almost five years later that she finally admits to making the whole thing up cecilia and robbie are separated by the lie through jail time and than war but still remain very much in love the film chronicles many things but the central theme is the consequences of telling a lie and how it alters the fates of everyone around it the film is very sad one of the most effectively emotional films ever made its a sumptous feast for the senses from the picturesque cinematography which features some of the most beautiful shots ever found on film shots that radiate passion wonder creativity and enthrallment it also features a wildly creative score enfused with the sounds of typing reminding us of the written word and how powerful it is throughout the performances are all top notch its hard to put into words on how truly great these performances are keira knightley is at the top of her game here and at such a young age she manages to embody years of longing within a single glance james mcavoy is wonderfully handsome and a fantastic treasure to behold as robbie a gentleman to the end filled with such rage and such softness at the same time he has a stirring intenstity throughout his chemistry with knightley is stellar and there scenes together are hauntingly romantic and will stay with you long after the film is over this film will stay with you long after its over the direction from joe wright is monumentous he is one of the most talented directors out there today althhough he showed a spark of professionalism in his previous film here he grabs this story head on and makes this films every moment completely enthralling and original this may be the best film ive ever seen i have emotions streaming out of my every pore and a headful of memories from the film that feel like my own its very rare to see such a spectacle in the words of my friend its just a privilege really captures what the notebook and titanic aimed for but couldnt quite engulf its more than the best film of the year and one of the best films ive ever seen its one of the best experiences ive ever had5,sad
an absolutely love movie an absolutely hate movienot hate in the sense that the movie was bad hate in the aspect of how humans destroy astonishing how one person can destroy your life forever even at the end of this movie her nonregret was appalling,sad
it took me 12 years to watch this film due to it disappearing from the list of films to watch i have mentally stored in my head this is also the first review i have ever felt the need to make but after watching this film i just could not ignore how good a film it was the story is just harrowing and the final 15 minutes took me totally by surprise and with a mixed bag of emotionssorrow anger sympathy to name a few everything about this film exceeded my expectations from the directing to the editing costume design and the acting but it is the actual screenplay and the story itself which stood out the most 12 years late but well worth the wait,sad
a friend of mine insisted that i watched this film im truly grateful for such thing since this turned out to be one of the most outstanding masterpieces ive ever watchedi could talk about the breathtaking cinematography the gorgeous soundtrack the superb acting or even the amazing way this plot is made in other words i could make it long lets keep it shortis in its simplest form one of the best acts of storytelling in cinema history this film is much more than a story its a view changer avoiding spoilers i assure you that all of those who enter the world of this film will most certainly leave it as a different person and at the end of the day thats all we could ask from a good movie,sad
this is not just a beautifully written story but it is brilliantly captured by joe wright with perfect casting it is a tragic love story filled with love drama tragedy deceit lies war but most importantly hope if you like joe wrights other work then you will love attonement,sad
i have in the past been somewhat harsh in my criticisms of joe wrights films after my first viewing of i found myself rather badly triggered by its ending which i still hate and that certainly affected my appraisal of the film overall leaving me with the lingering impression that id hated the whole thing after seeing hanna which i found almost unwatchable i may have allowed my thoughts about wrights directorial style to become unfairly negative id also seen pride and prejudice and found it aesthetically pleasing but otherwise somewhat limpso when i recently watched darkest hour and found myself breathless and giddy with enthusiasm and loudly proclaiming it a cinematic masterpiece it dawned on me that i should perhaps give wrights films another chance so with gritted teeth i sat down to revisit and was blown awayfrom the very first moment i was captivated the cinematography was stunning literally every shot was lit and composed in such a way that you could take any random frame from the movie print it and hang it in an art gallery the early scenes perfectly evoked the bucolic charms of an english country estate in the 1930s with all the elegance opulence and sexual undercurrents that form the setup for a darkly troubling story every aspect of the period detail was beautifully done with gorgeous wardrobe immaculate artdirection and a jarringly bold and original music score the writing was sublime as were every one of the performances filled with depth nuance and truthfulness the spellbinding icily assured performance from saoirse ronan deftly directed by wright holds the whole first act together portraying a complex miasma of innocence jealousy and repressed sexuality which forms the foundation upon which the rest of the film is builtthe second act lurches jarringly out of the picturesque countryside into epic scenes of world war ii depicted with bombastic realism and cinematic flair including the famous and much celebrated 5minute tracking shot on the dunkirk beach again the artdirection and cinematography are sensational here wright shows his skill at going large every scene be it in france or in london is filled with thousands of milling extras period vehicles and superbly choreographed activity all captured with sweeping camera moves and lit entirely for artistic effect rather than mere illumination it is a visual feast every shot resembles a paintingthe third act is also very well made but it is here that the film falls down  at least for me and it is entirely the fault of the novel upon which the film is based i just hate where the story goes i can stick with it right up to the point that vanessa redgrave appears the shocking reveal in her interview ruins everything it pulls the rug out from under me as a viewer it is like a slap in the face it cruelly mocks me for being gullible and romanticspoiler warningif it had just shown the deaths when they actually occurred it would have been a tragic film but a beautiful one and i could have lived with that but to give them a fake happy ending and then say ha ha only kidding they died really was cruel and unkind to the audience and then to suggest that by making up a fake happy ending it served as because it gave them their happiness to paraphrase really added insult to injury it served only to make the wrongdoer feel better the people whose lives she ruined died without ever finding their happiness and now the audience must suffer the same fate thanks a bunch ooops i may be getting triggered againso i hate the ending but this time round forearmed with the knowledge of what was going to happen i was able to view the film more objectively and endure the lousy ending without it eclipsing the preceding masterpiece for which i am most gratefuli am not one of those shallow unsophisticated people who requires happy endings or for things to be tied up neatly with pretty bows i just strongly object to the very specific and particular way that went about its endingbut i no longer blame joe wright which is nice since i have fond memories of him from when we were kids he is a master filmmaker and despite still not loving all of his work i hold him in the highest respect and consider at least two of his films to be bona fide masterpieces,sad
and that typewriter sound the music is bad enough without that patronizing embarrassing gesture to remind us about the fictitious version of the account wow what a visionary move lol,sad
i have never reviewed a movie but i had to put in my two cents to defend this film i feel it needs to be said that the theme of is so prolific that it is easy to almost miss most of the symbolism the sister cecelia was placed in a physical cross position two times in the film once in the library and once floating in the water in the subway after she died it isnt so far fetched to conclude that she was the one atoning for her sisters sins along with robbie he was atoning for the sins of mr sleezy chocolate factory france was frankly atoning for the sins of germany and so was robbie as he was forced to fight in the war and eventually die for the sins of hitler as did celia there is no reason to assume that the referred to by the title of the movie is in reference to brionys attempt at righting a wrong but that also fits neatly in with the theme this film shows in many ways people paying the price for other people sins and it also poses the question can a person atone for their own sins is it even possible even lola and her brothers were paying the price of their parents wrong decisions in a way i watched this film having no expectations and i do agree with some of the other reviews did people even know that awful word in the 30s and certainly the library scene was just too much too soon to be believable but i loved the movie because of the questions it asks and the way it approaches the very many sides of atoningwhen looked at from a traditional christian perspective a person most definitely can not atone for their own sins it must be done by another i wonder if briony was a victim of someone elses sins as well sleezy chocolate factory mani gave the film a 9 because it was slow at times and because i cant remember the name of chocolate man,sad
i wouldnt necessarily believe everything briony tells you shes rather fanciful  cecilia tallisjoe wright directs a film based on a novel by ian mcewan the plot in 1935 the thirteen year old daughter of a wealthy family briony tallis saoirse ronan falsely accuses a servants son robbie turner james mcavoy of sexually abusing a teenage girl turner is arrested and jailed for this alleged crime this arrest tears robbie away from brionys older sister cecilia keira knightley a woman whom he lovess first half is mostly excellent stylishly directed the film watches as briony misreads the adult world around her to her naive eyes the sexual tension between cecilia and robbie thus constitutes a perversion a perversion which briony decides makes robbie a sex maniac and so rapist that adults readily believe brionys story speaks to the inequities and injustices of britains firmly entrenched class system at the halfway mark though morphs into another film here robbie joins the army is sent to france fights in world war 2 sees many horrors assembles in dunkirk with thousands of other soldiers and dies of septicaemia all the while robbie and cecilia pine for one another deeply in love theyre never reunited briony blames herself for this the film closes with briony now an elderly woman writing a fantastical novel in which robbie and cecilia live happily ever after a gesture which briony hopes will exonerate robbie and so atone for her liess second half is mostly kitsch tastelessly voluptuous the film unfolds like a bad david lean movie brief encounter doctor zhivago ryans daughter every moment straining for unwarranted grandeur by the time wright hits us with his virtuosic dunkirk sequence  an elaborate long take that seems pulled from jancsos the red and the white  its hard not to laugh the film has stopped being about people and problems and started being about expensively dressed clichs robbie and cecilia arent just a couple of lovers but a monument to every tragically wronged couple they arent just torn apart but torn apart by war ruined by rape and separated by oceans because the elderly briony is suffering from vascular dementia and because the younger briony is a childish romantic wright assumes that his aesthetic which is florid fantastical and at times unreliable the films soundtrack contains a feverishly typing typewriter is befitting wrights film afterall is the very hokey novel briony is writing but selfconscious kitsch is still kitsch more importantly though mcewans prose was similarly overwrought he was parodying readers who yearn for kitsch wright in contrast is dead serious he genuinely loves kitschvirtually all of mcewans books find adults and children losing their innocence after encountering some traumatic event consider the child in time in which a missing child shatters a couples domestic existence consider too enduring love in which a balloon accident torments a middleaged couple and the cement garden in which children cover up and deal with the deaths of their parentsmcewans lead characters also typically carry a corruptive secret which gradually expels them from their families or communities be it pregnancies rapes illicit romances or murders his characters tortuously conceal this secret only to cathartically release it during the novels climax we see this in but brionys crime is not simply that she is a liar and bad novelist but that she acts like a novelist at all for mcewan briony is guilty of creating fiction she is guilty of storytelling which is seen to be inherently corrupt and corrupting this resolutely postmodern theme  the unreliability of art and its inability to convey the whole truth  has long been mcewans pet obsession as such mcewans novel persecutes both briony and his readers for their compulsive need to tidy up lifes messiness with familiar plots and neat resolutions time and time again mcewan condemns the limiting projections of artists the trite desires of readers and demonstrates the implications of fictionality the result is a novel like nabokovs lolita which attempts to comment on its obvious falsity its construction as fiction and the dangers this masks whilst at the same time trying to convey reality none of this is captured in wrights which works primarily as an oldfashioned tale of love interuptus 610  worth one viewing see any film by atom egoyan for this material done better,sad
has nobody else watched somewhere in time in cecilia must say the phrase come back to me at least half a dozen times and that is the key phrase that is spoken in somewhere in time by elise to richard and that phrase is the trigger for the whole brilliant moving filmso every time i hear cecilia say it to robbie i am reminded of the much better more romantic film with a decent ending too called somewhere in time starring christopher reeve and jane seymourand for those who are looking for similar movies  see the message board at the bottom of page 1  the film somewhere in time beats this one hands down and it has fantastic music,sad
a stunning bitter sweet period piece based on the critically acclaimed novel by ian mcewan this movie is a powerful and dramatic love story of a tragic blistering romance when 13yearold briony tallis played by saoirse ronan witnesses a sexual encounter between her older sister and a servants son her confusion prompts her to blame the young man for a violent crime her halftruth changes their lives forever i love james mcavoy and this is a really great job by a young saoirse ronan as briony great casting of all three actresses who played briony you really believe these actresses are one in this character i couldnt help but sympathize with briony because she was unable to make peace with her sister i loved the way the film went back and forth to show you the lie and the truth i wouldnt mind seeing this movie again,sad
i liked the narrative structure of this film by the end it had me thinking deeply about the nature of story itself what started out with the promise of a lush romantic tale eventually both did and did not fulfill that promise in the most intriguing way this movie was very well acted emotionally resonant and occasionally breathtaking in its cinematic techniques eg a single panning shot against the backdrop of a massive set filled with a couple thousand people and animals complex in its execution a lighting change that achieved a powerful emotional effect the costumes were gorgeous and effective the settings were a perfect complement to the characters emotions and the character interactions were compelling an experience youll never forget,sad
movie was good as a whole though i fear knightly only has one look to her i cannot speak for the book that the movie was based off of but it was super sad and extremely depressing if you read the plot summary on wikipedia and you are a happy person screw watching this basically everything that happens goes from bad to worse and ends with everyones lives in shattered pieces and dead then because she thinks it the only thing she can do to make things better a very old briony tallis decides to write in her book what really should have happened so long ago righting all of her wrongs and making apologies and happy endings she still screwed her whole family and friends over gave it a 5 for all of the acting but i would give the story a 1 being mega depressing and containing not one shred of hope,sad
maybe i need to see this movie again but i just didnt find the story all that amazing or moving well moving sort of but it isnt a movie i would want to see again it was boring for the most part and i just didnt find the direction and story all that intriguing the style and period makes this movie a bit interesting at first but it starts to get boring bit by bit after a while not i have seen a bunch of movies like this that goes in a similar direction but some of them was done better the twist at the end was sort of touching but that is about it when it comes to the most positive thing i can say about this movie maybe i missed something but i didnt even find this movie to be all that powerful and after it was finished nothing really stuck with me it just wasnt heartwrenching although it tries very hard to go in that direction and sometimes movies like this after the credits start rolling i think about it later because of the impact of it but that just wasnt the case for this movie i wanted to like this movie but i am not going to force myself to like it either the cinematography is nice to look at and even beautiful at times though and it did mash love war and human sins in a decent manner its basically a overdone and over hyped movie but the acting in it is very well done510,sad
we are such a fragile race so affected by the shifts of a societal breeze a child misinterprets what she sees and brings about the destruction of people she actually loves so caught up in her dramatic wants and angry she lies and that lie haunts her for her remaining days this is a movie version of a wonderful book the best i read that year it captures the pain and the need to make true restitution the truth of the matter is that sometimes it just doesnt work that way the characters come to realize that its a slice of life in wartime and all the chickens come home to roost probably the most gut wrenching thing is that the character that causes the most damage has great success in life but carries around her guilt to her dying day she is never allowed to truly enjoy things this is a really fine movie and except for some breaks in editing does a nice job of presenting the issues in the novel,sad
joe wrights concerns a fledgling writer who accuses her older sisters lover of a crime that he didnt commit thus changing their lives irrevocably eventually she seeks to atone for her actions and what on the surface seems to be merely romantic melodrama evolves subtly over the course of the film into something wholly uniquethe cast is wellassembled with fine performances all around though perhaps none that are particularly outstanding saorise ronan as the young briony tallis received an oscar nomination in the best supporting actress category she showed herself fully able at a young age 13 to match the high standard put forth by the rest of the castthe story is an interesting one though the chain of events leading up to the accusation somewhat stretches the limits of plausibility these events are easier to accept in the end though as certain facts come to light which cast doubts on the entire story i should note that the script garnered a not undeserved oscar nominationthe direction by joe wright is excellent so i am baffled by the fact that he didnt even receive a best director oscar nomination his debut pride and prejudice showed promise and here he delivers on that promise the art direction costumes  cinematography all received oscar nominations so it should be apparent that the film is easy on the eyes the only oscar win for the film was for the score which is quite unique and memorablei definitely recommend the film though some may find the romantic aspect offputting nevertheless let it be known that this film is not merely throwaway romantic fluff there is indeed plenty of substance here for the discerning viewer,sad
i think the film is great it got me emotionally involved and i successfully empathised with robbie cecilia and bryony the plot whilst the ending is not anywhere near as exciting as the beginning is almost playlike in its vivid events and character interaction  something i admiredof course i dont think its perfect personally partly through the film during the war scenes the momentum of the film takes a step back i believe that after seeing the film the celebrated fiveminute dunkirk beach scene that people have mentioned is positively overrated and didnt prove to be an interesting or integral part of the story other than this the film is a certain thoughtprovoker and a great demonstration of human sensibilitywhat can i say about the acting by all those involved flawless and the romance and passion and guilt portrayed in the film is simply brimming its worth a watch undoubtedly,sad
i had a fulfilling time with this movie a fulfilling movie makes you think about many things even after seeing ita 13 years old girl briony has wild imagination always even from a single word like castle she can imagine many things this girl makes irrevocable sin through her imagination to her sister cecilia and her lover robbie finally she atones for the sin through her further imagination workwhen and how briony realized the sin of her wrong imagination is not explained well how much cecilia understood about the imagination of briony was not explained well too however at the last scene we know how seriously briony thought about the and how carefully all scenes were put together to portray the storyas for performance saoirse ronan acting as younger briony and james mcavoy as bobby are outstanding,sad
i must admit after all i heard from the critics about not being one of the best films of 2007 i didnt watch it expecting to be one nevertheless i felt it was better than given credit for all the way around the look is very good especially in the first third set in the gigantic house of the tallis in england however as the mood of the film transposes so does the quality of it the young daughter briony falsely accuses her older sisters lover of attacking her sister this leads to serious conflict as well as the separation of the starcrossed lovers robbie and cecilia as the years go on briony becomes more and more guilty of what she did and robbie fights in the war facing death at every corner the ending and the buildup to it is very well executed as is most of the film the sets and costumes are gorgeous the acting is solid and the writing is clever in many regards however what keeps from no country or there will be blood greatness is the lack of depth to the characters especially the central ones of robbie and cecilia we never really get to know about their relationship and it doesnt make for a great payoff at the end the film is still very wellmade and doesnt falter too badly but the lagging in the middle and lack of character depth keeps it from being best pictureworthy and one of the best films of a very strong 2007,sad
2007 with hesitations i need to see this one a second time it may go up or down in my categories theres no doubt the acting lighting and photography were great the 1930s story has too much of what ive long been weary  constipated english gentry there is a glossy invisible division between the viewer and the characters making them seem less real the story jumps around and often morphs which i didnt mind but doubted its usefulness until the last 15 minutes when it was finally clarified it didnt take long to understand the idea of but i was caught by surprise as to how it was all happening this was interesting to me and finally removed the glossiness with which i had trouble,sad
i read the novel before seeing the movie so i knew what i was going to see ian macewans book is about how writers always cheat you really should know that going in because i think a lot of people expected ryans daughter or some other sweeping historical romance that may end tragically but movingly the ending of is not tragic it is absurd in a way the movie ending copped out the book ended with an internal monologue by briony at her own crowded happy birthday party the book reveals her own pretensions to have given robbie and cecelie a life together when in fact she really just wrote a happy ending to alleviate her own guilt its pathetic and shows how briony is still the selfish brat she always was and there was no final scene on the beach in the book the book is deeply deeply bitter its wrong to slap on a fantasyonthebeach endingstill most of the movie was captivating what with the masterful tracking shot the musical typewriter the suburban american audience i saw it with gasped out loud when they saw robbies typewriter slam out the most taboo word in the english language david lean is notian macewan writes fairly transgressive fiction too bad the filmmakers werent willing to go the distance,sad
this film is highly moving but if i understand it correctly briony gave evidence in good faith later on she came to realize that she was mistaken and she regretted what she did but if robbie had had a good lawyer this lawyer could have shaken her testimony she saw the rapist from behind and he was one of three four men dressed in identical formal wear and about the same height and age that should not have been enough to convict him without some other evidence it must be a terrible thing to be convicted of a crime you didnt commit and im sure it happens all the time but its only in the way the writer has chosen to tell the story that everything is brionys fault,sad
the title means to make up for what has been done this film thus portrays a mistake made in love which must be repaid with sacrifice and pain the emotional content for such a topic must be strong and the expression of the same should be clear and moving this film stands up to thisan adaption from ian mcewans novel the film is based in the countryside of britain and then some surrounding areas later on the background score first of all is very unique and rhythmic its suits and enhances the feel conspiracy thrill and suspense which this is the base of the movie its mostly taps of the typewriter wonderfully set with shots by clever editing at a few places the sync of music and cuts is amazing the cinematography and art direction is good too the colour variations throughout the film are wisely used to create emotions the story basically is about cecilia talliskiera knightly and robbie turnerjames mcavoy they live in a mansion of countryside britain robbbie once mistakenly proposes to make love to cecilia who agrees while they are doing it cecilias little sister briony tallis sees them being a suspicious child she reacts aggressively and later on blames robbie of a very serious crime he is sent to jail on the basis on her testimony war breaks out robbie as a prisoner is sent to war as a soldier a pile of grief in the form of this news falls on cecilia who had been eagerly waiting to be together with him again she leaves her home and joins army as a nurse the war goes on both lovers eagerly wait to meet each other and briony who had caused all this chaos is left in deep guilt waiting for a chance fora very impressive story this is drawn out really well with great performances by all actors and very sensible and clever work by the technical team a must watch,sad
a very pretty and engaging tale of redemption whether we need it or not rather wonderfully directed by joe wright whose austen i didnt think quite as much of christopher hampton manages for the most part not to make too much noise clanking his quill against the ink bottle leaving ian mcewans novel more or less alonethe first half of this movie dances by like a whimsical reverie sweetness and hope piling atop playful forebodings it moans and runs a little out of breath at dunkirk but thats dunkirk isnt it a fever dream of pure hot horror not the mrs miniver version at any rate the remainder of the picture pants and starts breathless and troubled eventually waking to gasp in miserable regret at the nature of truth and the power of illusion the storys early lightness is finally reconciled with its ultimately bleak ending and alls miserable that ends miserablythe women in this picture are uniformly superb keira knightley is poised and fetching as ever proof that god plays favorites  girls who look like this sometimes can have other gifts too but the film relies most on three performances of immense depth and compassion saoirse ronan vanessa redgrave and in particular romola garai all of whom portray the same woman at various stages of petulance and penitence,sad
i almost turned the tv off the second half of the movie is outstanding i realize the first half had to be the way it was presented set the background the music was outstanding the scenery and back ground shots were outstanding the war scenes was outstanding my kind of movie i loved the ending ill watch it again many times this film should have won the oscar i loved michael clayton and thought no country for old men was disgusting to be an oscar winner this movie should be considered one of the great war movies of all time it was not about the war but depicted the war so well great memorial of scenes from world war ii,sad
there is a historical discrepancy in this movie for which i remove a star the sailor in the dunkirk beaches relates that the lancastria had floundered the day before carrying with it 3000 lives the lancastria did not really sink off dunkirk but close to st nazaire and about two weeks later during operation ariel try wikipediaorg this event was a smaller but still large evacuation after general weygands plan to counterattack the germans northwards from the river somme failed and the british and french forces were pushed into the northwest coast of france this was perhaps the biggest loss for the brits during the war of france because in comparison to the success of dunkirk an important number of troops was caught prisoners inside the city the germans having stormed in before they could embark i highly recommend reading churchills war memoirs if this chapter of history is of your interest this remarkable and admirable leader won the nobel price for his work which is a way more valid and fair award than the highly criticized oscar which in my frank opinion underrated such a delightful movie,sad
ian mcewens brilliant novel is one of the most popular of recent years ever since it was published in 2001 it seemed as if it was destined for the screen however there are undoubted problems with adapting it for cinema the structure is anything but cinematic and there are so many perspectives that the novel is written from that adapting it successfully seemed impossible this is nowhere near as detailed or as electric as the novel but that would be impossible this is a successful adaptation of a difficult novel that is filled with invention quality and is genuinely beautifulthe starting point with any film is the script and christopher hamptons script can only be described as tough it does a very hard job quite well it is interesting genuinely well written but he fails to do justice to the novel the latter part doesnt matter as each adaptation deserves to be taken on its own merits but it doesnt manage to be quick enough at points and the film chooses to centre on the romance more than the real central character briony as such she suffers a bithowever joe wright must be commended for his fine work on this film he lifts the film from what the script is and introduces a lavish visual style to every frame genuinely interesting directorial touches and whilst this film is by no means perfect he shows great potential he evokes the heat of the english summer the passion of the central relationship and the horror of the second world war with apparent ease the result is a film that is genuinely heartbreaking and breathtakingthe film is assisted by a supremely good ensemble james mcavoy is the standout he is spectacular as robbie turner and takes the weight of this film on his shoulders and carries it off superbly the lack of awards consideration hes received is scandalous keira knightley delivers her best performance to date but is still somewhat outshone here saoirse ronan is brilliant as is romola garai and vanessa redgrave all in the role of brionythe visual style is near perfect the cinematography is stunning as is the costume the production design and the makeup however the score is quite astounding dario marianelli produces some ingenious music that incorporates the strangely lyrical sound of the typewriter with a superb orchestral score and emotive piano solosall of these elements contribute to an excellent film it is also helped by some quite extraordinary sequences most notably the four and a half minute long tracking shot of the beaches on dunkirk that shows the horror of that retreat and is breathtaking but there are four or five of these moments it is a flawed film but it is a fine one a film that doesnt have to be seen but should be seen wright shows himself to be a promising director and mcavoy appears to be a tremendous actor but ultimately this film shows the visual power of cinema and its potential even if this is not a perfect example of it,sad
my original psyche of the period film was that it was going to be formulaic brit piece comprised of a bunch of socialites talking fancy maids  butlers eavesdropping protagonists trivializing major issues while defocusing on mundane matters and all that mumbo jumbo talk that you get from the cinema britannica i must state that did encompass a few of the aforementioned elements but the final product turned out to be a very enlightening film about atoning for ones immaturity so i am truly sorry i did you like that because after i saw it with my own eyes i recognized that it did not merit my preconceived notion i must atone myself now by writing a positive film review for the narrative stars james mcavoy and keira knightley portraying the romantic leads robbie turner and cecilia tallis robbie is the son of a tallis housekeeper and cecilia is the eldest daughter of the wealthy tallis family so you see that robbie does not have it made and cecilia is constantly financially nurtured by those benjamin tallies or whatever prime minister is printed in the british currency bill robbie and cecilia romantically fall for each other and are on route for the eventual nuptial until the visual disaster occurs that would come in the form of briony tallis played by saoirse ronan the youngest tallis who has a massive crush on robbie and her ravaging jealousy causes her to falsely witness a crime which she accuses robbie as being the perpetrator poor robbie gets convicted of the crime and ends up fighting in a war in order not to get jail time so you can say that robbie and cecilia are apart because of the brawny briony syndrome the developmental plot of focuses on briony in various stages in her life trying to make amends on the hell she caused and also on robbie and cecilias emotional solitary grief the performances from mcavoy knightley and ronan hit the right thespian tone of admirable brawny supporting work was also contributed by romola garai who played briony at age 18 and the legendary vanessa redgrave who played the geriatric briony director joe wright who also helmed pride  prejudice should be proud of his unprejudiced direction of the costume design art direction and cinematography of were of picturesque amazement christopher hamptons scribe was adequate but not oscarworthy even though i love the i saw him with my own eyes line it was an eyeopener so all in all you will not be sorry if you check out  good,sad
focus features has finally gotten it straight in this excellent movie showing love between a man and a woman a fine story it is one of the few films of 2007 aimed at the adult over 12 audience fresh and original what more could we ask for keira knightly is always a sight to behold at 57 with super slender model looks i dont think she has a single fat cell in her body any man whos actually held a girl like this will never again settle for the playboy centerfold stereotype her acting is also excellentduring 2007 intelligent moviegoers had little to choose from eastern promises was great as was juno but then there was no country for old men  a slasher flick for pseudointellectual emptyheads and the stupidest movie of 2007 no country was pretty well rejected at the box office but the mental midgets are still trying to peddle it via the oscars dont fall for it see and choose qualitywe took the trouble to see in a real theater not a multiplex the senator in baltimore big auditorium big screen neat,sad
a typical tragic poignant love story that is augmented by a very well thought out story and technical and cinematic expertise in directing editing and cinematographyif the audience did not read the book they might feel it is about a doomed love and how the lovers would attempt to find each other after being forcefully parted however the story evolves into a tale about the guilt and remorse of the one who disrupted the lovers love and happiness her own naivety immaturity fear and disappointment with her own attempts and wishes for passion lead her to doom the happiness of the lovers and eventually severely regret her own actionsthe progressive timeline is not straightforward futures occurrences happen before the past a flipping back and forth sometimes with a difference of several years other times only several minutes this gave the movie an interesting texture and made it more artistically enjoyable yet clear since flipping back and showing what lead up to the crucial occurrence clarified the plotbeing a little slow epic and overly sentimental it may arouse romantics and annoy pragmatics the ending is heartfelt and sentimental as she does what she can incorporating into her lifestyle to atone for her past act of indiscretion,sad
if one were taking a course on how to appropriately adapt a novel for the big screen would certainly need to be among the required materials though i personally have never read mcewans novel the attention to detail that joe wright and his team bring to telling this story visually is superbis the story of a young girl named briony played well by three actresses at different ages of her life with a very incurable appetite and curiosity for plot and drama enough so that she tells a lie that separates her sister cecilia knightley from her newly discovered love of robbie mcavoy the son of their mansions grounds keeper the rest of the film is the consequences of brionys actions and her struggle to forgive herself for what she did the acting is top notch but not as deserving of accolades as the production crew and the minds behind the cinematic telling of this story the art direction and wrights choices are simple and beautiful and most notably is dario marianellis original score that is both creative and effective particularly in the beginning and end of the filmthe only thing holding back is the middle of the film which lacks attention grabbing substance the symbolism is all over the place but the plot lacks a distinct something during the point in which robbie and cecilia are separated to really grip the viewer as the films wonderful ending reveals itself i cant believe that i would be the only one who really needed more convincing of the love and passion between themthat said the story is still brionys story at heart hence the films title and her story is told with brilliance unfortunately the aforementioned middle part keeps her out of the story for a significant amount of time the film therefore requires patience and really keen eye for the the subtlety that makes a film more than just a story told with a camera,sad
this was a very good movie but for reasons not normally listed here to me i focused on the moral aspect and the devastation which can be caused by its aftermath i believe the girl suffered regret from when the realization struck home as the police drove the accused away but instead of going the full distance to put things right she worked at a job her society posing would have let her bypass and perhaps tried to make things right with herself more so than with the othersso the moral of the story we all know that as we grow older a heartbeat can be enough time to take us from here to where death will take us if weve done wrong and it has and is hurting others then the time to put things right is now and the reason no better than it is simply the right thing to do forgiveness may be forthcoming but its got to be byproduct of the process not the reasoni enjoyed the movie but i like mostly how it reminded me of what the wages of sin carries and how that weight is sometimes careless upon whom it chooses to bear its burdeni think the young couple suffered greatly,sad
hi allmy girlfriend made me sit through this film i wanted to go home early because i went out for a few drinks last night and am very tired i had 4 beers 1 cognac 2 cocktails 4 glasses of red wine 1 glass of dessert wine a guiness and then 3 more beers whilst playing darts i didnt do very well they  linda and sander are still watching this bloody movie i decided to write this short article i think the end is near now finally s something is happening i will not spoil anything but seriously dont ever watch this movie nothing happens i just kept asking questions but i think they didnt understand the movie either because they did not answer them olga chose the movie and she is sleeping now how unfair is that i am soooooo tired i still need to drive home next time i will post this earlier and add a poll based on that you guys can vote sorry got to stop the film has finishedpaint drying is more funbye byedrew,sad
i have to say i am completely surprised at the numerous positive reviews on this mediocre film this film had a lot of hype and was compared to titanc which made me want to watch it and i am very disappointed i dont think i completely understood the film in the first place but it still doesnt nearly live up to the hype the film is very slow as in there is a lot of waiting to see what would happen next so you wait and then expect something big to happen but it never does the entire middle part of the film was a bore to me parts of the ending seemed good at first but by then i already had negative impressions on the film throughout the film there were shots that were beautifully shot and some good touching scenes but the film doesnt do much for me i am rather mad at all of you who claim this to be the best film of the year or whatnot i obviously missed something or you views are just into this type of artsy film thats another thing toothis film seemed to try to hard to be artsy and to touch on peoples emotions all it did was drag on and on once i lost interest it never came backhaving said all of this i may just have to watch the film again on dvd im curious what important info i happened to missif all of you claim it to be so good and considering i like beautiful and touching films it makes me even more angry that this film seemed to miss all of that for me but honestly didnt this film drag on and on especially during the middle of the film the shots and scenes didnt do anything for me alright im actually still mad about this film now so convince me otherwise what did i miss,sad
is a majestic and moving novel one of my favourites by one of my favourite authors so i approached the movie with optimism and trepidation in equal measurei need not have worried it is executed with impeccable taste brilliantly directed acted soundtracked and photographed surely it will do some damage at the oscars its essentially a caustic attack on the class society in england where the stiff upper lip leads to all sorts of undertheradar crueltyjames mcavoy essentially a bit of a lady chatterleys lover being as he is the housemaids son falls for the toffeenosed cecilia tallis keira knightleyand in the process drives her 13 year old sister into a fit of jealousy that has tragic consequences for mcavoy this is magnified when the young brioney brilliantly played by saoirse ronan acts as gobetween between the aforementioned james mcavoy now certainly one of britains best actors and knightley who carries the part off more than adequatelythe film is in three acts the first set in brideshead revisited english opulence the second in northern france around the d day landings and containing a 5 minute steadicam tracking shot that takes the breathe away the third in the suburbs of war torn londoneach is rendered differently and observed immaculately in the snobbery of prewar rural england the tension can be cut with a knife and the language and mannerisms of upper class torpor are fantastically realisedthe war scenes aside from the amazing tracking shot are less well executed budget restrictions methinks but the ending is deeply satisfyingspecial applause has to be reserved for dario mariavrellis soundtrack which uses the sound of typewriter keystrokes as a hugely original percussion instrument that adds energy to the whole piecebrilliant1010,sad
in watching this film and other recent films it occurs to me that film making is returning to the era of silent films by this i mean that scenes with minimal dialog or no dialog are becoming more common this is not bad in itself since this is film and not a novel however in silent films the scenes advance the plotin this film they do not the silent scenes are poses that neither advance the plot nor shed insight into the characters poses no matter how well shot do not comprise a scenefor the film to hold together character motivations are important this is really what is missing in this film there was no reason presented for briony to behave as she did envy comes to mind but clearly this is not her motive the original setting was 1936 upper class england so the dialog among the children did not fit the times which makes the transparent motive the childs overwrought imagination suspectsince i have not read the novel i can not comment on whether the characters and motivations were more clearly defined but the film is a failure in both plot and character development,sad
tragic story of a lie told and the pain and heartbreak it causes as briony a 13 year old girl who sets things in motion when jealousy causes her to frame her sisters lover for a terrible actwell made and well acted story is exactly the sort of film that oscar loves every thing in the film is pretty much picture perfect in ways that only movies can be i was so aware of the art and artifice that i was never really engaged even if there were a reason for it its too perfect the early sequences among the idle rich kept me distant i did connect to robbie played by james mcavoy but hes the working class stiff in love with the bosses daughter keira knightley is ravishing as cecilia brionys older sister and i could feel her passion for her lover however i began to lose patience with her performance since it often consisted of the bold acting choice of smoking a cigarette while not as bad as natalie portman in closer i should remember the person and not the cigarettenot a bad film i just dont think it scales the heights that place it among the best of the year on any level other than a technical honestly i should have been crying at the end instead of going being ready to move on to the next thing6 out of 10 for imdb purposes 55 in actuality,sad
is a masterpiece of story telling combined with the brilliance of cast and direction and keira knightley and james mcavoy deliver characters which are rich in drama and each compelling in their journeys throughout the film beautiful lighting costumes and the elegance of british country life make the film a lush tale of romance and suspensei had been waiting for this film for months watching the reviews and international success of and now focus has brought to the shores of america a beautiful holiday 2007 gift with the launching of this sure to be oscar nominated film watching keira knightlys face on the screen and the true elegance of her performance is really one for the pure enjoyment of a what it is to be brilliant young actor and the supporting cast like in gosford park make a film you wont forget,sad
its easy to imagine that many people at working title were very excited when they decided to put in production since they could be aware that with its mixture of love and death and with its setting during the second world war that could be the right occasion to achieve a sort of new english patient but since the movie is based upon ian mcewans masterpiece the final result established itself as something different and in some ways more interesting without being necessarily a better movie than minghellas one directed by joe wrightin his sophomore effort after the critically acclaimed pride  prejudice but actually in his resume you can find a lot of tv worksthe movie is written by christopher hampton and its quite faithful to its source material as typical by hampton so everyone who read the booker prize finalist novel knows that the movie can be ideally distinguished in two parts and a resolutive epilogue set many years after the first part tells the chronicle of a special day of the summer 1935 during which the lives of the main protagonists are branded briony tallis played by the extraordinary newcomer saoirse ronan the younger daughter of a rich family is a child with a vivid imagination she dreams to become a writer but shes having also her first crush the object of her desire is robbie turner the promising and charismatic james mcavoy a young man whose mother is one of the family servants tallis family paid the college for robbie and hes also a good friend of brionys older siblings actually briony doesnt know that robbie and her sister cecilia the always ravishing keira knightley very convincing in her first adult role its hard to forget her especially when she wears that green dress are in love therefore when she sees something from the window of her bedroom she misunderstands and when robbie ask her to deliver a letter and besides a wrong one to cecilia she cant stop from reading it and soas you can see you can find reminiscences from the gobetween even if briony is more unreliable than the young boy in that film but you can see the influence of loseys classic which was written by the future nobel prize winner harold pinter even more in the atmosphere and in the choice to handle the time briony accuses robbie of a crime he didnt commit even without any proofs everybody except the loving cecilia believe her and robbie finishes in prison this part is the more particular even if at the beginning the description of the house and the dynamics of the characters could appear a little bit boring but while the drama is erupting the tension raises notably thanks also to the music score by the talented dario marianelli who received an oscar nomination thanks to pride  prejudice and it wont be so shocking if hell have another one for this new collaboration with wright the second part is set 4 years later during the war cecilia is estranged by her family shes a nurse now and shes still in love with robbie who is a soldier and hes in mission in france where he also witnesses the evacuation of dunkerque in the meantime briony now played by romola garai whose perf is quite weaker than ronans and also than vanessa redgraves who replaces her in the epilogue has grown up she still wants to become a writer but she also has understood her mistakes so she is intentioned to atone them just like her sister shes working as a nurse she wants to meet cecilia and robbie to tell them shes sorry and that she is going to to exculpate the young man from the charge even if it wont be so easyin this part the material becomes more ebullient but wright is quite apt to manage it even when hes tempted by the virtuosity for example the dunkerque sequence shown in a long take briony accomplishes her just at the end of her life after to have become a writer in a way it could be wrong to bring forward quite ambitious in its seemingly realistic system in this context the first part is superior because more surprising the movie is rather satisfying even because the director didnt choose to direct his attention on the more agreeable components the doom of the two lovers cecilias devotion showing he doesnt look for the simpler solutions lets hope that also in his future films wright keep this will to risk and maybe tomorrow we could see his filmography with astonished admiration,sad
i did not like this film nor did i dislike it it simply vegetated in that uncomfortable state of triviality that is not caringfirst off let me say that the acting in this film is quite good and they really managed to pull off the different ages of the characters the idea of using a typewriter as music really appealed to meon the negative side however i was appalled by the way this film reinforced stereotypes once again the rape victim lies the man is innocent and the whole movie revolves around the fact that he did not rape the girl having said that i was disappointed that the film did not go into any detail at all on the court case as i for one feel it unlikely that any court would convict purely on the evidence of a teenage girl also the movie did not really have too much of a story to tell and i left the cinema with a distinct feeling of so whaton the whole this film is not very good nor is it so abysmal that you can enjoy how terrible it is it is merely unspectacular and that to me is the most annoying kind of movie,sad
this movie is nonsensical and ludicrous for most of the story i could not relate to the characters at all and found myself feeling the main characters got exactly as they deserved there were several scenes where the director made poor choices which detracted from and confused the story the writing was pretty pathetic as well as the story progression was circuitous and uninteresting the movie didnt flow or grow in depth but just degraded into inanity dont waste your time with this one it is overrated and awful,sad
its been a while since i saw this film but time hasnt dimmed the shear irritation i felt after seeing itnot having read the book on which it is based i cant say if it was as bad as the film it seems like stating the obvious but only an author could come up with the idea that you could atone for ruining two peoples lives by writing a happy ending for them if that was the only affront to the viewer it wouldnt have been so bad but the film is full of episodes that were just simply unbelievable to give one example dozens of casualties from the evacuation of dunquerque suddenly turn up at a hospital in london without any warning no telephones or radio in 1940 a film i will never watch again,sad
i read the book and watched the film recently and i really liked them both the book is beautifully written with flawless narrative detail though at first it isnt very easy to sink your teeth into the film on the other hand is beautiful to watch wonderful cinematography and excellent period detail the music was quite nostalgic and i suppose positively hypnotic the screenplay was wonderful to start with but the last parts narrative did lose its way a little and despite the fact that i thought brionys portrayal was fine on the most part when she first finds that lola is being hurt by who she suspects is robbie i didnt find her as comforting as she was in the book the library scene i thought was more believable in the book it just felt thrown in in the film i will say the performances were wonderful with kiera knightly at her loveliest and james mcavoy very handsome and heroic as the two lovers who embark on a complex love relationship also worth of note are the performances of two great actresses vanessa redgrave and harriet walter who didnt disappoint here is beautifully done well performed and fairly faithful as an adaptation 910 bethany cox,sad
note over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book cut to the chaise lounge or i cant believe i swallowed the remote get it at amazonpossible spoilersthere is little i can add to the myriad critics and viewers who have seen this beautifully rendered work of art from the novel by ian mcewan but i want to point to the commanding performance by vanessa redgrave at the end in which she tells us what has happened she absolutely commands the screen and engages us in such a direct way that we are enthralled and touched from an artistic point of view it is interesting that the words she speaks need no embellishment or any acting out there are so perfect and her delivery is beyond professional it is lived as is the case with all great actingi also was very much taken with the performance of romola garai who played briony at 18 her face conveyed more than words can tell she felt so deeply not just her characters great sin but the tragedy of the war and the dying she saw all around her and the sense that she could not be forgiven saoirse ronan who played briony as a girl had a hard edge almost an evil edge to her that was perfect for the part a kind of bad seed depiction with her washed out face and small selfimportance and her inability to not just understand what she saw and experienced but her inability to understand herself and to love instead of desiring only to be lovedthe way the story is presented with scenes out of chronological order but in psychological and emotional order was most effective i was especially impressed with the idea of showing us the scene where briony pretends to drown and is saved by robbie after the fact of the great lie she tells as presented we immediately understand why she lied his anger and failure to understand her childish love for him perhaps worked like the achilles heel of his character had he been able to love her as one might love a child and help her to understand that he could not love her otherwise everything might have been different or perhaps not in a sense hers was an act of although not in a positive sensethe epic scenes of the beginning of world war ii with the british in retreat and all the bloodshed and waste of war magnified and accentuated especially the scene with briony and the dying french soldier luc made us understand the how precious life was for those who witnessed this while serving as a dramatic and psychological foil for the love and life that cecilia and robbie could not experiencei also like the economy with which the essential details of the story were presented we see the dramatic scenes and then we understand with just a few words or even a look what actually happened for example when briony as a nurse attends the wedding of lola and paul and as the bride and groom walk away we see the shame in their faces the same shame that briony feels only they are not going to own up to it we know and then there is the quick flashback to the scene that briony as a girl had witnessed and this time her mind allows her to see the mans face and then a bit later on in the scene that the author inside the author briony makes up we understand that there will be no revelation of the truth because a spouse cannot testify against a spouse or at least in this case would notand then there is the brilliant ending with vanessa redgrave summing it up and tying it all togetherbut more than that showing us how briony grew as she went from childhood to old age in fact the emotional and human transformation that takes place in brionys character is perhaps the central point of the story i havent read the novel by ian mcewan but i am familiar with his work and know he must have been responsible for such a psychologically compelling development and endingalthough it is obvious that the script by christopher hampton and the direction by joe wright are more than first rate,sad
i have never seen something like every edge of the film is outstanding the director joe wright captured every feeling of the story and put passion into every edge keira knightley and james mcavoy were terrific they were so clear so passionate saoirse ronan dazzled me she is so young yet so capable to impersonate a character seen to be a hard one to play she made it look so easy it was really sad for me see it not receiving the academy award for best picture because it deserved it more that any other film i have been seeking for the proper words to describe this film but really when it comes to it words are not enough never will be this film is a relic by far the best ever made,sad
there are many words to be told about this movie like someone joe that wrote the novel we are always learning writing is a deep place to hear in to ourselves and maybe maybe one day someone will read and fell a light or heart beating then in several moments the creators writers or screenwriters see there work in a book store been produced to movie to reach more people that some times don t simply have much time to read that is the best that can happen to a writer there are three special microfone moments in the movie maybe for that only one oscar but some times those awards that are not given in many of the festivals are like those details and that the best is the public award i can tell a lot about leading roles in this movie but only one special statement about lady redgrave brilliant cinematography is also very good well i don t have any more words,sad
it took me a long time to get interested in watching even after it was so well received at the oscars recently i watched the first 20 minutes or so and was immediately put off by the atmosphere and the characters ive been going completely doolally up here for exactly the same reason that i am generally put off by books like the great gatsby or faulkners the sun also rises which feature characters of such wealth that their biggest problem seems to be what to do with all their surplus money and leisure time such people are difficult for me to relate to for a couple weeks i put the movie aside and couldnt get up the interest to watch it until finally i did and now i realize why it was one of the best pictures of 2007 keira knightly a clearly talented actor who for some reason almost never impresses me plays the daughter from a wealthy family living in the beautiful english countryside just before world war ii and james macevoy plays the daughter of a man working for her family he is a promising and educated young man but the son of a housekeeper nonetheless so clearly a romantic relationship between the two would be highly taboothe first 30 minutes or so of the movie depict a life devoid of trouble or worries and yet still manages to create an atmosphere of slight tension about the war that we can almost feel approaching somewhere beyond the edge of the screen before long cecilias knightly 13 yearold sister sees a couple of things happening and makes some dangerous assumptions followed by some increasingly dangerous accusations and radically alters the lives of her sister robbie macevoy and herselfthe three main characters from this point on have remarkably little control over their own lives reminding me of the struggles of the main character in kubricks brilliant film barry lyndon the unusually structure of the film allows us to explore the results of a few catastrophic days in the lives of these three people and how they affected the rest of their lives the film covers the course of many decades tells a stunning and moving story and never once comes off as pretentious or cheesy or preachy even in the closing scene which shows briony cecilias sister as an aged novelist giving an interview about how that one decision during her childhood has affected her life this is a story about life and how we affect those around us particularly those closest to us even when we think were doing the best thing for them one imdb reviewer calls it pure poetry on film and its not easy to think of a more accurate descriptionnote there is a scene in the film where robbie comes across a horribly grisly scene in the woods during his military service the following closeup of his face is one of the best pieces of acting i have seen in many years,sad
when i first heard about this movie i was kind of in between if i really wanted to watch it or not and boy am i glad i did although i am usually open to watch any movie and give it a fighting chance especially a movie that is up for a picture of the year award then it is almost always a given that ill watch it is honestly up there as my picture of the year either this or gone baby gone which was poorly misrepresented in the whole award ceremonyprovides the viewer a completely engaging experience on multiple different levels first it sweeps you up with an engaging romance that was completely misinterpreted and misunderstood then gives the viewer a look on both sides of the fence seeing the young man go off to war away from his love and how they both coped with being apart from one another and more importantly the grown up little girl who separated the two young lovers and how she was dealing with the mistake that she had made i like the presentation i like the actors and i just flat out like this movie most movies i watch i do work at a blockbuster just seem to drag and im always watching the clock to when it will be over michael clayton no country for old men we own the night and i could keep going instead of watching the movie itself but was a complete experience that i never lost interest in and was actually disappointed that it ended it is a sad ending i will warn the casual viewer but dont let that draw you away its well worth it in the endso guys if you like good movies watch this one with your girl you wont be disappointed and you might actually like it,sad
this is a romance set in england just prior to and during ww2 this was all i knew about the film before seeing it i didnt read the novel i had no real desire to see the filmit was more a matter of a convenient show time rather than being on my mustsee list if you do not know much about the film or novel please do not read furtherthe film begins in a generally conventional way for a british period piece but then a few events are shown from two different points of viewone which is objective and one which is very subjective showing the different points of view have fractured the time line so in the second half of the film the shifts in time continuebut is it also a shift from objective to subjective povs again the ending of this film was profoundly moving i had no idea at all that vanessa redgrave was in this film her three or four minutes in extreme closeup are perfect absolutely perfectnote what happens to your hopes during this film the first half of the film ends with robbie being unjustly arrested and hauled off in the next scene several years later we find robbie in uniform in france and so we assume that the injustice has been corrected otherwise he would be in prison then we find that he signed up in order to be released from prison we then find him meeting cecelia again but this was prior to the scene in france will the lovers eventually be reunited the situation at dunkirk becomes increasingly hopeless after the rescue from dunkirk we are surprised and greatly relieved to find the lovers have been reunitedjust what we hoped forand then there was the scene with vanessa redgrave set in the present the hopedfor conclusion was just fiction and the truth was tragic but the creation of the fiction which granted the characters their hopes and wishes was the only way to correct the injustice which had been done to them i saw this film a second time after knowing its secrets and i enjoyed it even more the actors are uniformly excellent james mcavoy is even better than excellentnotice the scene in the restaurant when his shame is so great a burden that he does not even presume to look cecelia in the eye this is an outstanding film,sad
wow im not even sure i saw the same movie as most of you i found it to be blandly directed and almost totally lifeless from beginning to end even the muchballyhooed onetake which i would normally be a huge fan of didnt move me or excite me at all i just followed it mindlessly i suppose my problem is i didnt buy any of it i didnt buy the romance i didnt buy the tragedy i didnt buy brionys regret i actually kinda liked the first thirdish up until robby was arrested it set up the story in an interesting way it craftily showed brionys distorted perception which culminated in her false accusation but once the story shifts to robby and the war it just dies we should have stayed with briony the whole time seen her grow up seen her regret worsen and deepen seen her ultimate act of as actually meaning something but instead were left with some shoddy war scenes a choppy final act and a completely unfair and unrealistic endingi mean its not terrible i thought ronan was terrific and the dialogue at least in that first third was sharp and witty and enjoyable but after just having seen twbb it just doesnt even compare,sad
for those who have had the immense pleasure of reading ian mcewans not once but several times basking in not only the brilliant storymystery but also in the inordinately beautiful language rest assured that the film not only does the book justice in the transference to the screen but in the hands of screenplay writer christopher hampton we know that mcewan approved of the modifications as mcewan is one of the producers of the film becomes even more clear in its realization of the complex plot and finds the visual beauty inherent in mcewans prose joe wright as director steers this story well finding just the right amount of back and forth nonlinear development that formed the magic of mcewans initial weavingthe cast is uniformly superb from the initial selfcentered liar briony tallis an impressive saoirse ronan to the years later sorrowfully guilty young nurse briony romola garai to the epilogue briony of vanessa redgrave the entire story is adroitly centered on this perpetrator of tragedy but without the power of james mcavoys falsely accused robby turner and keira knightleys tragic cecilia tallis the triad would not work even the smaller yet important roles assigned to gina mcgee brenda blethyn jrmie renier and countless others are played to perfectionthe cinematography by seamus mcgarvey captures not only the misty tranquility of 1935 prewar england complete with creative use of luminous light sources as well as the raw brutality of the battlefields as england enters ww ii dario marianellis music score much of it played by pianist jeanyves thibaudet incorporates the superb sir thomas beecham recording of la boheme with de los angeles and bjrling as incidental music to the typing of robbys fateful note and then proceeds to incorporate the typewriter as if it were an instrument in his orchestrationsrarely has this viewer been so moved by a film and perhaps that may have been related to just having heard a performance of brittens war requiem at the los angeles philharmonic the previous night it is the perfect marriage of novel cinematic realization and commitment on the part of all concerned in the creation of this superlative film highly recommended on every level grady harp,sad
based on the novel by ian mcewan set in 1935 young 13 year old budding writer briony tallis saoirse ronan and her older sister cecilia played by keira knightley live a life of wealth and privilege in their british family mansion briony has a passionate teen crush on cecilias boyfriend robbie turner played by james mcavoy robbie is the house keepers son briony makes a very strong almost sexual advance to robbie which he totally repudiates and she is hurt terribly by this rejectionbriony witnesses one of her young girlfriends having sex with a much older man and accuses robbie of the being the older man the consequences are devastating for robbie and briony realizes she has at last broken up the intimate and loving relationship between cecilia and robbieas the years go by both ceclia and robbie remain in love and eventually temporarily unite despite both being caught up in the second world war briony realizes what she has done and tries to atone but the long term consequences of actions were far beyond she could ever imagine a tale of unrequited love for briony other reviewers have mentioned the steady cam and four minute long shooting on the beach in france but this is common these days  the cinematography and the overall production values were superb a very beautiful and touching love story with great performances from all the actors a very sad and melancholy love storythose who enjoyed the great film  a long engagement will really enjoy this one if you are not moved by this film you have a heart of stone,sad
this is a lovely film with incredible acting by characters who never leave you the setting is england in 1935 a country estate right before wwiibased on the novel could have been a very pessimistic sad affair because of the unfair accusation against robbie the son of the familys housekeeper it never is though because the passion between the leads keira knightly playing celia and mccvoy as robbie is so human and redeemingthis is a beautiful movie which begs to be seen again there are many nuances not caught the first time which the second time can explain betterthe young girl briony who makes the false accusation suffers her entire life for ruining her sisters and robbies lives she was only 13 at the timewith an overactive imagination burgeoning hormones and equal parts innocence and spite her emotions overtake herresulting in tragedy in the end the book she writes names names and gives her sister and her lover the happy ending they never haddefinitely a keeper is an excellent film of the highest caliber,sad
yes i read and was very moved by the book quite some time before the movie i read many novels yet its quite strange because it wasnt until briony was foundering as a nurse and giving the impression of wanting to atone  that i thought oh my gosh ive already read thisthis is a strange choice for big or small movie awards and rather disappointing the quality could not be upped from the usual british tv historical period pieces the costumes are all there is it so hard to add personalities with which the audience would have some empathy what a motley crew overall  generally reasonable functional welldressed actors in an elegant cinematic setting many in my theatre were looking at their watches and they dont go for bells and whistlesi have a great love of the cinema and am bemused by the overreaction to such mediocrity,sad
turns out to be a much better movie than it is a book but before i explain what i mean by that a little background on the story may be in orderian mcewans novel  which spans eight decades from the 1930s to the present day  centers around briony tallis a precocious 13yearold who lives with her family on a country estate in england briony is an imaginative child who revels in a world of fantasy and makebelieve a writer of stories and plays who is actually less equipped to interpret the realities of the adult world than she gives herself credit for one unusually hot summer day in 1935 briony witnesses a series of events involving her older sister cecilia and the caretakers son robbie that her childs mind misinterprets in a way that leads to tragic consequences for all involved her choosing to act on what she believes to be true winds up echoing down the corridors of time through world war ii and beyond as time passes and briony grows to adulthood she comes to see the error of her ways and spends the rest of her life trying to find a way to atone for what she has done the coup de grace is that due to circumstances beyond her control briony is forced to achieve her redemption in the only way she knows how  as a writerat the risk of offending devotees of the novel i must confess to being somewhat less than enamored with a book that many seem to rank among their alltime favorites for despite its sometimes impressive dreamlike quality the novel is too contrived and selfconscious to make the reader anything more than a mere dispassionate observer of the events it is portraying as a writer mcewan has an undeniable flair for narrative voice and description but it frequently comes at the expense of characterization and story his plotting is often arbitrary and clumsy and his dialogue when indeed he deigns to use any is almost always stilted and unconvincing i have to admit to laughing and rolling my eyes when i was reading the crucial letterswapping sceneyet something has gone terribly right with the material in its journey from the printed page to the silver screen suffice it to say i didnt roll my eyes this time around since film is a largely visual medium screenwriter christopher hampton and director joe wright are able to convey through images what it takes mcewan endless reams of paper to get across here an idea can be suggested through a simple shrug of the shoulders a meaningful turn of the head a barely noticeable gesture or wave of the hand and indeed the movie is rich in beautiful and unforgettable images that evoke a feeling a time a place sometimes even an entire theme all on their own even though the screenplay remains faithful to the threeact structure of the piece that structure comes across as less fragmented less arbitrary and less selfconscious than it does in the novel thanks to the seamless fluidity of seamus mcgarveys stunning cinematography and the unifying tones of dario marianellis brilliant musical score everything in the film version of feels perfectly integrated and all of a pieceof the performers only keira knightley is in any way problematic she looks positively gorgeous as the seductive cecilia and there are moments when she achieves the proper mixture of tenderness and haughtiness essential to the character but she has a tendency to spit out her lines in a much too rapid fashion and her tightlipped poutiness a problem too in pride and prejudice eventually becomes annoying and distracting as robbie james mcavoy proves again why he is one of his generations most exciting screen talents while young saoirse ronan is remarkably poignant and poised as the 13yearold briony ramola garai and veteran actress vanessa redgrave do nicely as briony in later stages of her life although the ending while moving is a bit more reminiscent of titanic than it needs to bewright is often at his best when turning what could have been mere technical stunts into integral pieces of the drama a beautifully realized fiveandahalfminute long tracking shot of the carnage at dunkirk the effortless incorporation of a clicking typewriter into the musical score a row of nurses marching in time to the rhythmic clacking through sight and sound wright creates a surrealistic dreamlike tone perfectly appropriate to the material at hand whats amazing is that even with all these stylistic flourishes wright never loses sight of the human drama at the storys core in his direction he displays an astonishing economy of means moving the story along at an almost breakneck speed yet never allowing the movie to feel telescoped or rushed not only does his pacing not sacrifice the emotional resonance of the piece it greatly enhances itends on a lyrical note of melancholic uplift that leaves audiences wrung out and emotionally exhausted as briony engages in her final and greatest act of storytelling creativity watching the movie is nothing short of a rapturous experience,sad
the title may sound a bit pretentious or exaggerating but i can say a definite yes when im asked if was a good movie it was a phenomenal one when i first read the book i thought that it is impossible to convert the idea of the book into a film in my opinion there are certain books that are hard or impossible to adapt into a screenplay but i must say that joe wright has managed to do that in a very elegant matter elegant is probably the best word to describe this movie there is a kind of soft flow to the movie it isnt too fast nor is it boringly slow it is the tempo i have seen before with virgin suicides and it is the perfect tempo for as well this is the first movie where keira knightley cecilia tallis comes out of her usual role as a young beautiful girl who just is and becomes a young woman whose depiction of the character is brilliant we see for the first time that ms knightley is not just a pretty face but she has the potential of becoming a great drama actress james mcavoy robbie turner is of course charming as all the ladies will agree but he also goes deep into the character of robbie turner he conveys robbies pain and anguish as if they were his own and makes us all believe that his love for keiracecilia is real saoirse ronan is plausible as a the young briony tallis and romola garais plea for forgiveness makes us want to forgive her but does not let us forget that her guilt runs deep in my eyes vanessa redgraves portrayal as an old and weakening briony is better than that of ms ronan or ms garai mrs redgrave knows what to say when and what emotions to reveal on her face brionys final act is what brings tears in my eyes being an avid moviegoer i must admit that is the first movie over years that has managed to maintain the essence of the book but still stays unique and is not simply an adaption and i think it doesnt hurt to say once more that deserves an oscar,sad
ive read this magnificent book more than 3 times published in 1998 and it is one of my favorites books and undoubtly ian mcewan best novel i was very afraid and curious to see the movie  because i didnt know how it will be transalted to the big screen amazingly they did an excellent job  starting from the magnificent actors and the incredible scenery the film is a copy of the book and i was really surprised to see the dunkirk scene which was superb sensational and stunning  howeever i was a bit disappointed that we didnt see int the movie some war bombings as described in the book alos they could have made briony a little more esthetic keira knightly and james mcavoy are terrific and should get an oscar my conclusion  this is the best movie you will see in 2008,sad
where do i start id never heard of this movie before going to see it didnt know what it was about and didnt even know who was in it my wife had read good reviews and wanted to see it so off we went i was looking forward to itlet me say there is nothing wrong with the film the acting is good if not very good the settings were pleasant the story that was the problem it seemed so pointless if not boring it seemed to try and get somewhere but it was about as exciting as watching grass grow the whole movie seemed to be completely there for the ending it was not worth it for a comparison i would rather see lions and lambs again before i see this moviethere was an incredible amount of artificial grain added to the image that was so distracting that i found myself trying to see if it was a repeated pattern this was probably the first time i had noticed grain in a filmits not a bad film but definitely not top 250 material in all honesty i would have probably rented it when id run out of films that i want to see,sad
i was prepared to love but i came away very disappointed the film failed in two basic ways 1 none of the characters were intrinsically likable or endearing the only one i felt any sympathy for was the 18year old briony because she was truly suffering and could find no way out but neither of the two protagonists grabbed me in any way their love was never made credible or plausible we never got to see any of the reasons why keiras character would fall in love with that guy aside perhaps from the hot weather and the dreariness of the other available men but thats hardly enough to keep her love at whitehot pitch for years afterwards2 so many of the key incidents are so utterly improbable that one cannot take the plot seriously at all take the incident with the flower vase they live in this huge mansion theyre obviously filthy rich and the girl is distraught over breaking one silly ceramic piece and even if she was wouldnt she just call a servant to go dredge up the broken piece rather than diving into the water herself or sending a 13year old out in the dark alone to search for the missing twins who would ever do that if this were more of a fantasy story id be more accommodating but this was clearly presented as gritty realitythe filmmaking is good but even that had some annoying qualities it seemed like so many shots were closeups i felt nauseatingly oppressed by the sheer size of the images the whole typewriteraspercussioninstrument idea was cute the first time but it lost its novelty after about the third instance the first portion of the movie reminded me a lot of a poirot episode except without the grace and charm the english are all snobs upper crust with genteel manners but horrible people at the core and there is no one of any value you can cling to the dunkirk scenes were quite impressive and the reality of nursing life during the war was equally intenseand i have to say of all keiras major roles thus far this is easily her least likable maybe its all that smoking you almost feel like coughing by the end,sad
was adapted from ian mcewans book by screenwriter christopher hampton director joe wrights previous work includes pride and prejudice in an article in creative screen writing magazine it is explained why it is so evident that the film has been wellreceived it was decided to stay as close to the original story as possibleweve all heard the phrase the book was better uttered by so many people that it is pretty well expected to hear that in connection with film adaptation however it is rare that anyone dares to say that a film is actually better than the book version of the storywith keira knightley and james mcavoy in the leads including a nearsurprise appearance by vanessa redgrave it is difficult to find any fault with the cast in particular despite her physical frailty ms knightley remains an emotional force to reckon withthe opening scenes of are more than effective at setting the stage for controversy even surprisingly so it is doubtful that most of the audience members unless they had read the book first were prepared for the gravity of the inyourface brashness of the first acttaking place in 1935 as the world is on the brink of war the story begins with families who have managed to still enjoy the sort of serenity reserved by the wealthy in the isolated remoteness of the english countryside but all is not as it seems as is usually the case every family has its own drama and the tallises are no different as 13year old briony saoirse ronan later played by romola garai a budding writer who has already penned a play bears witness to older sister cecilia kiera knightleys coming of age she displays the inevitable combination of envy mixed with a potent anxiety over cecilias hot quick and heady entanglement with servant robbie james mcavoywhile the film is a period piece it is important that this doesnt dissuade anyone who is not usually partial to such types of films it is simply unfair to relegate this movie to the unfortunate and derogatory chick flick status it is truly so much more than that romance aside mcewan is most certainly no emily bronte or jane austen this film marketed as a romance is actually more about the importance of truth and how the lack thereof can destroy lives most importantly the life of the liar who must live the resultant life sentence of sadness and pitythe film just as the book does possesses sharply distributed dialog and character interaction which strongly emphasizes the gravity of the story the storys urgency is paralleled and very much affected by the wartime depictions of britain and northern francethe method that wright embraces to enhance the cinematic nature of the story includes shows events twice from both brionys eyes and a more neutral honest perspective which is effective at explaining how a young girls impressions can mistakenly convince her to actually believe against what is really occurringwhile keira knightley does issue a fantastic performance the star billing she receives does not match the importance of briony played by three actresses saorise ronan as a 13year old romola garai as an 18year old and the amazing vanessa redgrave as an older womanthematically is tragic whether its story is told in book or cinematic form the film augmented by its dramatic music score by necessity is far faster paced than the book as woody allen uses the city of new york as a character in his stories this film used a typewriter which as an instrument manages to successfully remind one that there is a very serious story being toldall in all is as finely crafted and visually stunning as a film can get and its pace is every bit as good as any thriller including its emotional gutwrenching surprise ending 2008 susan s davis,sad
while this movie got a lot of hype  i very much disliked it i will say that the acting in it is wonderful which is why i see a best actoractress out of it but best picture surely notit is possibly one of the most depressing movies that ive seen and for briony to actually think she gave them happiness at the end is ridiculous i understand the irony in all of it but i thought it was a weak ending and a horrible way for her briony to rationalize her actions she is weak and essentially sent her sister and her lover to the grave and in the end she thinks that she can fix it by writing them a happy endingwhat a way to profit from tragedy briony,sad
its a cinematic masterpiece which should cop a ton of oscars an unbelievably superb screen adaptation of the novel by ian mcewan a film that starts off slowly and builds and builds grabs the viewer and doesnt let gowhat is superb about this film the worksthe reenactment of the bef nearcatastrophe on the beaches of dunkirk is worth the price of admission the story of a fanciful lying female adolescent plus an unintended note begins to weave a complex tale which is so clever it leaves the viewer astounded the circumstances leading to an innocent wronged the approaching and early stages of world war two the of sin the shocking ending how everything comes together masterfully to produce a film of unforgettable poignancy lust hate pity sinits miraculousrating this film a ten is an understatement,sad
everything about it screams overdone the music is everpresent and substitutes for dialog throughout much of the film characters spend a lot of time staring at things while a loud soundtrack plays the setup is ok but then it turns into yet another ww2 story i dont read romance novels and didnt like watching one on the big screen if your girlfriend drags you to this be ready to fall asleep i wouldnt keep going here but imdb has rule that we must have 10 lines of text so im writing this to fulfill the obligatory space requirement repeati wouldnt keep going here but imdb has rule that we must have 10 lines of text so im writing this to fulfill the obligatory space requirement,sad
cecilia tallis i love you ill wait for you come back come back to me sweeping involving wellacted masterfully directed entertaining long and extremely dramatic exactly the way i like my epics lord of the rings king kong saving private ryan schindlers list but certainly not one about romance between two teenage lovers usually im not a big fan of the period piece genre especially the romantic period piece genre in 1996 a romantic period piece won best picture despite its immense critical acclaim one of the most boring films ive ever seen was the english patient as i sat there on my couch watching i almost began crying because i thought this cruel form of punishment in the form of a dvd would never end of course i could have taken the dvd out of the player but i always complete a movie once i start it no matter how bad it is however im not reviewing the english patient im reviewing so walking into i wasnt expecting something id be too excited to recommend to people but after those ending credits started to roll i was absolutely shocked at how brilliant the piece of filmmaking was i had just witnessed for the last two hours is perhaps the best romantic period piece ever made and without question one of 2007s very best films on the outside may seem like something jane austen would write however it is not first of all its too rough around the edges and secondly its far better than anything she wrote its not a sappy unrealistic feelgood movie but a hardhitting painfully realistic and uncompromising masterpiece of a motion picture the story takes place in 1935 england when the country is just on the cusp of world war ii theres a rich family plantation owned by tallis family cecilia tallis keiria knightley is the goodlooking and desirable lateteens rich girl who the notsosimple cleancut farm boy robby james macavoy falls in love with one day cecilias younger sister briony sairose ronan witnesses cecilia and robby physically expressing their love for each other what the twelve year old understandably mistakes for forced sexual violence upon her sister when robby mistakenly gives briony a letter addressed to cecilia explaining how robby would like to taste cecilias nether regions and there is an incident in the house briony comes forward and indicates robby as a sexual predator robby gets arrested and sent away never to see his love cecilia again the story then shifts a couple of years later in 1939 where robby is a soldier in the war and cecilia a nurse thats about all ill tell you about the plot the biggest achievement of is perhaps while the film isnt always fastpaced its never boring this is due partly because of the exquisite acting james macavoy who has usually been upstaged by other actors in his previous films cough cough last king of scotland cough cough finally gets his moment shine and hes brilliant in his performance keira knightley is great as well in a small part but the best performances come from the three actresses who play briony vanessa redgrave is remarkable in her five minutes on screen and romola garai is extremely powerful as briony at age 18 the best of these three is 12yearold saoirse ronan as the 13yearold briony shes absolutely incredible if not creepy in her role that will no doubt be remembered at oscar time joe wrights directing and the films cinematography is without question some of the finest of 2007 and christopher hamptons screenplay is outstanding theres really nothing i have to complain about it may not take the 1 slot on my top 10 list of 2007 but it will be there around 2 or 3 is not only one of the best movies ive had the pleasure of seeing this year but its also one of the best movies ive had the pleasure of seeing ever grade a,sad
since i have wathced pride and prejudicei fell in love with keira knightly so as long as her movie is on show i will watched it without any doubt atonemnet is includedtoo sorry for my pool english i can not find a exact word to describe such an amazing movie maybe fantasticor maybe marvelous i just wanna say that will be surly nominated by the academy awardbecause of its unforgettable storyline and the fabulous acting i say from my heart that i have deeply touched by this story it reminds me of the same category movie coldmoutain which told us a story about love in the war i think in some way that atonemont is a little bit similar with coldmoutain but it is more successful than that anthony minghella moviewhich means that has that kind of power to make you cry especially the sense that cecilia and robbie had a chance to gather againand briony could make everything right and later the old briony told your all of that was only in her book as i previously mentioned the performance in this movie is one of the most significant element to make it outstanding its nice to see that james mcavoy a young britain actor who has charming appearance and talent gave us a perfect show his put his passion into every expression of robbie and every line he said which made such a complicated role alive i am pretty sure that james will get a nominee of oscar he deserved it and attention must be paid to keira knightlywhich the main reason why i watched this movie she has proved that she is not only a young britain girl with beauty but a talented actress with wonderful skill she gave us another perfect performance by the role cecilia but it is still i can not say it definitely that she will get the nominee as a best actress generally speaking cecilia cannot be called the heroic role in this movie this role is too simple or too easy for keira,sad
there is lots to like about this movie the acting was generally very good particularly the contained intensity of brioney most of the scenes are well constructed with the exception of the outdoor shots in wartime london  which are a little awkward have feel stagedthe fiveminute one shot sequence at dunkirk would have been a brilliant achievement in a different type of film where it served a purpose as in children of men in this one its out of place self conscience and makes the audience feel the sameoverall its an enjoyable film that does draw you in and hold your attentions but it fails to leave any lasting impression what exactly was the point of that was my question leaving the cinema,sad
gripping heart wrenching thoughtful and pieced together brilliantly notice the subtle nuances of the filmmaker how cecilias foot slips out of her shoe during the love scene in the library or the piece of china sinking to the bottom of the fountain the depiction of war is perhaps one of the most accurate in recent history bringing the horror to full effect this provoking story gives everyone pause to reflect on the fanciful lies that children can tell and the havoc they rake the acting is perfection sheer artistry the chemistry between the two leads lends a great deal to the believability the scene of their reunion in the tea shop where robby moves his hand is so tellingbravo to everyone involved,sad
opens on a young briony tallis jubilantly finishing a play to be performed that evening for her family she stands and walks through her home searching for her mother and we follow her ghostlike looming above as she searches in a way the themes of this film are summed up in this first shot briony aimless searching for truth in her imagination and fiction and if this sounds like a contradiction trust me when i say you will come to understand this by films endi have not read the book written by ian mcewan but after viewing this film i am eager to pick it up and follow the thoughts of the characters more intimately than what is shown on film what we have here is amazing work both technically artistically and emotionally yet on some level it is unable to grasp the concept of writing fiction from brionys point of view there are no doubts about the talents of joe wright who at 34 has now made two exceptional films pride and prejudice being the other one with his lead actress keira knightly who herself grows in her abilities with each passing yearjames mcavoy cements his position as a leading man creating a brilliant life in robbie that glues your eyes to his predicaments and his thought on the world around him he carries the weight of the film and is the one who undergoes the most change from his fresh faced boyishness in the opening scenes to the rugged worn and tired eyes in the latter mcavoy is able to successfully convey the innocence of young love to the brutalities of war and we love him for itjoe wright has again proved his talent as a film director whose use of the tracking shot will be among the greatest up there with goodfellas pulp fiction children of men and magnolia his use with a camera lens is so poetic at times they could be freeze framed and placed on walls as pieces of art in themselves my only qualm is sometimes these shots are too technical and distracts from the film itself though that is more of a personal observation than a general oneand lets not forget to mention the score which only enhances the epic feel it brings successfully weaving diegetic noise the typewriter in particular with the nondiegetic dario marianelli composer of wrights previous work pride and prejudice creates moody dramatic pieces that perfectly set the tone of the scenes they play in its one that will be recognized in years to comewithout a doubt is one of the best films released this year and certainly a must see for lovers of film in general if only for its amazing tracking shot of a war torn beach in france i for one look forward to viewing it a second time in the near future,sad
simply put is equal in its technical beauty vision and scope to gone with the wind joe wrights vision as the films director is the principle reason this movie will attain the greatness it richly deserves the story and plot would be otherwise lifelessand of no consequence taken by itself the acting while superb is not extraordinary and is not the reason this film is a must see although vanessa redgraves appearance is so persuasive it would be easy to forget that she is a superb actress the directors vision sets this epic romance apart this movie is an extraordinary achievement in its visual feel and beauty film is a visual and emotional experience simply stated this movie delivers and how,sad
i saw in seattle yesterday to a packed house i felt for two hours i literally could not move i had been looking forward to the release after reluctantly falling complete in love with joe wrights previous movie pride  prejudice he has proved to be an upcoming visionary director who pulls you into stories on a whole other level but james mcavoy amazing his face on screen pulled my heart out and crushed it to the floor of the theater i felt i needed air when the lights came up and for a movie buff that is a good feeling has the tragic feel of the english patient with much more likable characters i cant say enough incredible i hope oscar sends many well deserved nods its way this year,sad
i cant praise this film highly enough sufficient to say it is cinema at its very best beautifully directed filmed and acted in my book it qualifies as a classic already keira knightly although stunningly beautifulwith the perfect delicate look for the era the film was set in has failed to impress me with her acting in previous films but here she captures the essence of cecilia beautifully as for james mcavoy  what a star this young scot is going to turn out to be his facial expressions alone spoke volumes  and with those beautiful eyes how could any woman fail to fall in love with the lovely robbie a subtle yet truly great performance from him  and the rest of the cast were excellentif this film doesnt get recognizxed as the best picture of the year when the awards ceremonies come around then i for one will be sorely disappointed,sad
it is rare that a film in which nothing really happens can have such a huge impact on the audience i was really stunned by the cinematography and the brilliant acting of all the actorsi went into the film not sure what to expect but came out amazed and a little depressed its not just a love story but one of personal reflection and facing up to the consequences of your actions even if you have to atone for them your whole lifei think the performance of 13 year old briony really deserves a mention  it was essential that all 3 brionys link together seamlessly to make the film effective however the young brionys the first we see of this central character  if shed been a whiny annoying brat the entire effect would have been lost but she played it so well and it was believable that she didnt simply lie she was so appalled as to convince herself of robbies guilt a great findaside from that i still cant believe this epic work was only joe wrights second and hes so young a very talented director who stuck faithfully to the book  which im now going to read and compare he captured the emotions and motives well leaving no doubt in my mind about each characterisation the slow tempo only allowed long still shots to emphasise this effect and that 45 dunkirk scene was just breathtaking even though it wasnt like the opening in private ryan which was gritty this almost had a tranquil beauty which nevertheless showed the realism of war in crystal clarity the intertwining shots and objects through robbies eyes were also placed just right that there was always something to look atthe uniqueness of this film is that it is not memorable throughout though its certainly memorable but that there are certain scenes such as the library scene the dunkirk scene and the scene where briony goes to see cecilia which are so vividly done that theyll always stay in your mind a long time after the end a very raw film that has plenty of feeling definitely worth seeing with some patience,sad
being the jaded soul that i am i wanted to hate this film mostly because everyone else was loving it does that make me a bad critic but you see the thing is i just couldnt dislike it in anyway it is told so well edited so cleverly the music is powerful the story is multilayered theres that six minute tracking shot in the middle which is simply breathtaking filmed on a set that cost 1 million pounds all in all it is everything a movie should be based on the ian mcewan novel it tells of how a simply misunderstanding can have disastrous effects and escalate a situation way out of control with a backdrop of world war 2 the two star crossed lovers knightly still wooden and mcavoy always brilliant communicate through letters and long to see each other again but the war and circumstance may have other plans a real human story packed with emotion and depth its like a british english patient and i wouldnt be surprised if it isnt in line for an oscar or two at last a film with a brain enjoy because it will probably be a while before you see another film this good,sad
theres a lovely irony at work here inasmuch as the bulk of the action takes place in the thirtiesforties an age when movies were made for the masses rather than a target audience but even a target audience is no longer sufficient so that today movies like this are what i choose to call festival fodder where the director has one eye on the viewfinder and the other on the golden palm silver bear bronze ego massager or whatever and whilst these films are certainly good for one viewing and attract lots of puffery from arts programmes and sunday supplements they seldom stand up to a second viewing a few years later hands up anyone who can sit through the english patient again joe wright current critical flavor of the month has turned out a decent enough movie and some of the trendiest names in the business  knightley mcavoy  are on hand to lend gravitas to the project but significantly the best acting by a country mile is contributed by vanessa redgrave at the very end of the movie  in another irony the character she plays is very similar to the one played by her father michael in the gobetween ie youth grown old and bitter and filled with remorse for lives damaged in earlier decades  and as virtually all of it is shot in close up she has only her face eyes and voice to work with can you stand more irony you can swell in the dunkirk segment theres a brief clip from the marcel carnejacques prevert quai des brumes featuring michele morgan and jean gabin this is mistakenly referred to as recif de corail by imdb quai des brumes was released in 1938 whilst jean gremillons recif de corail was interrupted by the war and had not been completed by the time of dunkirk a far far superior film than and one that was made with both the directors eyes on entertaining the masses come to think of it mr wright thats how you make classics by default rather than design,sad
is a sort of compilation of all the besetting sins of british cinema the obsession with class and sexual repression the endless retreat to the past the fetishistic recreation of period detailthe story such as it is is about an intense interaction between just three characters but these lives all but disappear against the backgrounds of teeming london streets country house vistas and the chaos of dunkirk this last scene is both the films best and worst moment a triumph in cinematic terms it adds little or nothing to the story and in retrospect is made to look even more of an overblown gesture every scene in this movie appears to be aimed at an awards jurythe ordinary viewer cant help feeling a little left outthe initial conceit of the storya confused adolescent misinterprets the actions of two adults and ruins their livesisnt really worked through instead the action is driven by a chain of melodramatic and increasingly unlikely coincidences and chance discoveries bryonys when it comes is at first overdue and inadequate and ultimately vastly overdue and incredibly inadequate her final reduction of everyone including herself to mere characters to be manipulated forms a heartless coda to a heartless filmmcavoy is his usual superb self but his foil is todays porcelain clothes horse of choice kiera knightley a sort of stretch limo to helena bonham carters mini cooper here she who displays her complete acting range which basically consists of narrow eyes icybutindifferent and wide eyes loyalandloving ultimately knightley is a metaphor for the whole film lovely to look at well put together but devoid of any meaning,sad
beautiful scenes of the english countryside and the stately homes of the rich do not save this from being the kind of romantic fiction which used to be swallowed up by 14 yearold girls at least the english patient had handsome naveen andrews to gaze at and why is it that the blue eyes of children frequently turn brown when they grow up with all the actors available one would think that they could find a pair with the same color eyes or avoid close upsthe dunkirk scenes were interesting even if militarily inaccurate if the evacuation had been as depicted it is no wonder the bef was in retreat they would have needed to go home and learn military tactics as for the black soldier where did he come from for me the best scenes were in the hospital with gina mckee as sister drummond the true martinet of the times running the hospital like a boot camp but why did she not set the nursing trainees straight about floppy hair falling out of caps at that time hair had to be firmly held in place and not a stray hair loose the scenes of nurses mopping floors and being used as skivvies was certainly correctoverall i found the sloppy continuity and cutting back and forth confusing in addition to which they seem to have got the dates wrong a little reference to the history books would not have hurt i especially cringed when someone referred to a character being evacuated to dunkirk and i had always thought it was from dunkirk  well well,sad
i found not to be the same movie everyone is gaga over i must have missed something that they saw in this movie maybe those who read the book had a better understanding of its characters i thought the beginning of the movie to about maybe half way through was very good it was filmed so we could see what broiny saoirse ronan saw then what actually happened the movie flipflopped in time to accomplish this it was a bit confusing at first once we realize that this is whats happening you just follow along once the situation is out in the open the movie then asks us to be concerned for its characters but we dont know them all we have seen is that the truth has been twisted all i felt about it was i couldnt believe all the adults believed the child above everyone else no one asked why she believed as she did that most was taken out of context why wasnt kiera knightlys character more influential in stating the true character of robbie than a teenager i didnt know ceceila kiera knightly or robbie james mcavoy enough to truly feel anything we had no idea what the relationship between ceciela and broiny was did they battle each other for attention were they jealous of one another or were they very close not enough to involve me it struck me that broinys love for the written word did not propel her to seek to have the ones in the letter better explained to her to ask if ceceila was offended by themthe actors seemed to know their characters even if we did not and the acting was very good the cinematography was beautiful perfect lighting the clothing looked especially well done quite to the era the score was brilliant inserting the typewriter into the music was very well done if i had known more about the characters at least enough to care about them maybe i would feel more about the movie i am not a fan of soap opera maybe this is the key ingredient necessary to see the awe everyone else seems to see in this movie maybe i went to this movie with expectations i know for other best picture movies i did not find myself looking at my watch to see if it was almost over as i did with this movie if the movies intent was injustice it was,sad
in was left thinking the film must have been sponsored by a cigarette company seeing as cigarettes appear in almost every scene cigarettes with classical music cigarettes with love letters cigarettes at the private pool blah blahas for the film well watch it if you have nothing better to do but on the other hand if you have nothing better to do and havent read the book then forget the film buy the book and spend some quality time reading it or any other ian mcewan bookas for the film well watch it if you have nothing better to do but on the other hand if you have nothing better to do and havent read the book then forget the film buy the book and spend some quality time reading it or any other ian mcewan book,sad
i heard from my brother that the voting of on imdb was quite good therefore i was expecting a lot from the film but through out the film to the last10 minutes my feeling towards this film was disappointment the whole film was too draggy and boring i was going to vote 4 stars for it till the last 10 minutes after 2 hours of the film the reason was because in the end i finally realize what the hell is going on and therefore i raise my voting to 6 stars its not good but better than 4 starsi was sitting there wanting to get out of the theater so many times during the film but i paid too much to make me actually walk out there were too many scenes where the actoress didnt really act out what the purpose of the scene was eg the beach scene during the warthe piece of head falling and i dont know where the whole film is going sometimes its about love sometimes its about war sometimes its about sick people lets just say i should have done more preparing work before watching this movieanyhow since i dont want to reveal too much of the film plot im just going say that this film disappointed me and my brothers if you are going to watch this movie i strongly suggest you not to have high expectations and read the plot beforehand then maybe youll have more joy than i did after you walked out of the theater ,sad
when i first saw this i was quite happy with the film i thought it was a tasteful adaptation of the brilliant novel ive been surprised however at how forgettable the film is its not a film that takes a hold on you even for just a little while the book pulls you in and includes one of the best descriptions of what it mustve been like to work at a hospital during wwii that ive ever read the film is beautiful to look at and joe wright is a capable and gifted director however there is a sense of detachment that permeates the whole film james mcavoy wonderful in the last king of scotland is stymied by the painterly scenes that dont let their characters be real breathing people the music is pleasant but has the effect of just adding to the whole package the music says now you must feel this way the only thing that is truly worth seeing in this film is vanessa redgrave at the end of the film sure the film will get oscars its the kind of film major awardgivers love its a love story set in the interwar years that segues into wwii there is a long tracking shot of a battlefield who can resist these but its all glitter and not much substance i like the fact that there are filmmakers willing to adapt complex novels into films and they should continue to do so however about this film i must say read the book,sad
mr joe wright if this directing lark doesnt work out for you you clearly have a sparkling career as a landscape photographer waiting for you in a manner similar to his previous british literary adaptation the infamous remake of pride and prejudice every shot was of such beauty that for as has previously been said of raging bull you could take any frame of the film and it would a make a more than sizable photograph and for my part id certainly put it up on my wall even the mindblowingly long tracking shot of war torn dunkirk beach was simultaneously filled with despair and yet a certain picturesque quality perhaps intentionally contrasting it between the chocolate box imagery of the seaside and the stark contrast with the current situation and as ever the sets in this film are so clearly painstakingly set up the beach shot the most sizable notice of this which even the harshest of critics could not fail to be impressed by the first act was again echoing pp almost like a film and a ode of love to the great english countrysides and stately homes panning over the trees and charmingly uneven hilltops even adding a dash of glamour to what appeared to be overgrown weedsin newspaper reviews a couple of critics accused joe wright of being style over substance the style is undeniably there but i think in order for the film to have stood up as well as it did there must have been a hefty great deal of substance also i think the main problem was that the book id imagine with its to and fro narrative didnt quite translate onto film although each section was beautifully crafted in its own way it did seem to jump to time periods with no prior warning such that youd have to later realise what was going on a minor niggle i know and it may not annoy anyone else as previously stated though each part was expertly navigated by joe wright and of course this was also in great part thanks to the actors involved the three actresses playing briony were stubborn numbly guiltstricken and resigned respectively the relative newcomer playing 13yearold briony is a standout find james mcavoy again displays why he is so sought after with a sterling performance as a least flawed character in a film filled with imperfect people keira knightley managed to avoid pouting her way through the movie and is again brilliant in her flawed english rose role making the transition from aloof elitist to lovelorn with perhaps an overswiftness but that again may be what the script asked of her the support cast provided a more than adequate frame though not given much limelight to work with as the three main protagonists do such a brilliant job as corny a prospect as it sounds i think the sets and shooting locations should be credited as an invaluable cast member also adding an additional emotional facet to every scene appropriately taking your breath away without taking your eye away from the acting in the foregroundin short mature and sensitive directing form joe wright surely a name to look out for robbie cecilia and briony x 3 all ever so much more than adequately portrayed an excellent story from award and kudosgarnering ian mcewan smartly adapted for screen mouthwatering cinematography and locations tied up with another star turn from dario marianelli returning for his second joe wright collaboration with an flowing and swelling score punctuated appropriately by typewriter sound effects all the emotion and beauty of titanic set onland sans boat and celine dion a mustsee,sad
horribly boring and disgustingly slowpaced how come it got rating over 7 all old aged people have flocked to rate this awfully slowpaced movie and thus it reached over 7 thats the only explanation the life of an old man is slow he walks like a turtle eats slowly sleeps slowly as he cant be fast asleep poor guys they found solace in this cursed slow paced boring movie i have never seen such a worse movie in life  stretching the movie deliberately with such an ordinary plot and horrid lengthy duration it almost made me  dead i now understand why old people love to watch it it is because they are also almost dead stepping on their graves hence their liking on this movie young guys who love racing with your cars playing games with full volume stay out of this movie of boredom or else after watching this movie you will turn into an old man,sad
ian mcewans novel was beautiful spare and elegant surprising thoughtful excellent writing in short like many of his novels are so i figured a movie of would have to be at least pretty good oh how wrong i was if not for the handsome james mcavoy i would have bailed early on the only thing that kept me from stopping the movie and finding something better to do was remembering how much i enjoyed the book the movie is overlong and selfconsciously gorgeous with long ponderous shots of scenery and the skeletal keira knightley that serve no real purpose except to make this movie seem merchantivory like or somethingalong with mr mcavoy vanessa redgrave was the highlight although she only gets a little bit at the end she was far and away the best actor in the film really keira knightley  she cant actall in all i feel like this is a couple of hours of my life ill never get back again do yourself a favour and read the book instead,sad
the next time a reviewer questions some of the scenes in my script by saying yes colin very nice but how are the characters developing and do these actions really drive forward the narrative im gonna leap across the desk and smack himher across the head with a copy of this dvd and snarl they didnt bother in this movie so why should i or or i could say it was written exclusively for mr joe wright and such frippery doesnt matter as long as it looks pretty and is very expensive to create hell be perfectly happy and so were my daughter and wife  they loved this film and hate me for hating itive not read the book so cant comment on that but as the story appears in the film it doesnt work i read somewhere if you are adapting a complicated novel it is always advisable to chose one character and tell their story on the dvd they claim it was brionys story then why did we spend so much time in france meeting characters she didnt meet or was that also just a chapter from the book she was writing as well i dont know and unfortunately i dont care,sad
is one of those movies that completely draws you in and never really lets you go even after the credits start rolling it is to the films credit that it manages to be completely unforgettable even after a year of having viewed itthe film is divided into two parts the first half is a mystery that is slowly unveiled and told from two different viewpoints the second half is more straightforward but it has a number of flashbacks this is a densely plotted film and especially during the first hour it requires absolute attention from the viewer dont worry the film is so good that this will happen anyway as such i cant give much in way of the plot just watch the trailerthe acting is outstanding keira knightly has never been one to sell out to hollywood she clearly only takes on projects that interest her and challenge her her performance as cecilia tallis is easily her best performance and should have earned her a second oscar nomination she captures every emotion perfectly and uses restraint to emphasize the effect of her emotions likewise james mcavoy equals her giving us a perfect romantic foil for cecilia mcavoy wisely avoids giving us a harlequin romance lead instead he creates a real person that has a powerful romantic connection with his costarsaoirse roman despite being very young holds her own against the upandcoming alisters shes a natural and perfectly captures the complexity of her character much of what she does and feels is presented without words and only a truly talented actress like roman can pull it off her oscar nomination was well deserved her older counterpart played by romala garai is so good that it is hard to believe that these are two different actresses and not one character that simply grew up its tough to pull off but roman and garai are perfectly in synchcould have gone wrong in so many ways but director joe wright manages to keep it all straight he keeps things moving including a 5minute long unbroken take across a soldierfilled beach additionally the soft light he chose for the film enhances the experience producing an almost dreamlike quality to the film and even in the war scenes it worksthe best part of is that its kept on a personal level while all the characters are caught up in an extraordinary event the story that connects them is purely personal there is no national scandal or flashing photographers wanting a scoop on this drama there are only a few characters who knew about what happened and novelist ian mcewan and especially wright wisely focus on them wright keeps the epic scale of the war intact but he personalizes the dramais a beautiful and harrowing film it is not to be missed and was easily one of the best if not the best films of 2007,sad
a magnificent visually splendid powerful drama i cried towards the end which i havent stopped thinking about since i saw itjames macavoy plays one of those classic benighted putupon noble dignified victimoffate characters that  unless bjorks playing them in a lars von trier picture  are rarely more than rag dolls or punching bags for the writer to pile plot points on but his character is so wellwritten so likable and his performance so good that every little blow hes struck resonates deeplythe initial stages of the love story at the heart of the picture somehow dont feel rushed even though the two leads spend remarkably little time on screen together and  dare i say it  kiera knightley turns in a fantastic performance that has proved to me once and for all that she is indeed capable of great thingsnot only is there a powerful love story theres also a fascinating moral question running throughout that isnt really wrapped up and is left to the viewer to decideaside from the stunning sledgehammer twist ending the final moments are incredible in that they dissolve all the films flaws issues i had with pacing in one scene that seemed interminable and my annoyance at the overlychoppy timeline just went away all fully justified by the time the credits rolledit looks beautiful has a great score and the scene at dunkirk an endless tracking shot of huge scope and ambition is as impressive as anything ive seen in a war picture,sad
this movie was at my last options list the title didnt sound so catchy plus the covers plus the summary  i was trying back then to find some movie with more interesting title and plot of course you can judge by my vote that i was wrongthe beginning of the movie was not really promising i thought i was going to spend hours sitting and flowing through the infinity of boredom i guess the elements sorted themselves during the movie and i was shocked  the movie i was watching was great the plot after realizing that i made a huge mistaking thinking this wouldve been boring was great the characters were emotionally developed and that dose of sarcasm throughout the movie was brilliantif i had chance i would see it again if youre hesitating dont  watch this movie you will not regret it,sad
strange how you watch a movie for a non specific reason ie sexah ms knightly and are drawn to your own past and closeted memories how little things can turn to larger broader impacting consequences i suppose some of us are living out our owns or surviving thru anothers consequences or sadly both how our minds eye can help us see a situation as it is or as we wish to see it yet again this same inner reflection can twist ones reality beyond the scopeeveryday we live with things and hopefully before we center on it in our mind we let it blur past fortunalty i was alone at home when i saw this and when my walls were swept aside  and my guard down the brevity of it all crushes like a long fall grief is so hurtfull bottled up and sometimes its release still hurts and for a time helps loss is my one word for this loss of youth love or a loved onei rate this highly yes it could have expounded on the characters of robbies two war buddies but that wasnt the point the reflection we do of the story and the lives in the story as well as our own did not allow for too much extra filler info well done,sad
this was one of those movies that we were sorely tempted to eject 30 minutes into the viewing  and are very glad we didnt it turned out to be the rare film that made you think and seriously analyze what you have seen so much so that my wife is now reading the book to see how faithful the movie was to the novelit was certainly not without flaws so lets get the major of those out of the way right up front 1 the setting that was chosen england prior to and during wwii to construct the central transgression and link the dual message was just too easy and convenient and the screenwriters even played with the time frame a bit to make it just that much easier we felt this was a bit lazy2 the inconsistency in the methods used to shift back and forth in time was disconcerting and smacked of selfsatisfied gimmickry some time shifts were labeled as such some were not some reran a just viewed scene from a different perspective most did not it just became too clever and ultimately annoyingnow down to the stuff that raised the movie above its flaws the film asks  and answers  dual but closely related questions a can the artist atone for hisher transgressions through hisher artistry and b can society atone for the atrocity and horror of war by writing history to reflect on wars heroes and victories the answer in both cases is clearly no and the film does a very good job of illustrating whybriony destroys at least five lives hers her sisters her cousins robbies and his mothers with a petulant adolescent false witness  and spends most of the rest of her life trying to find a way to atone for her transgression her narcissism prevents her from summoning the wherewithal to face and attempt to undo the wrong directly and time and dreadful circumstance quickly rob her of any opportunity to do so by the end of the movie we find that she has written a novel in which the people she destroyed are blessed with a happyeverafter fictional existence  and she has even been able to come out of herself far enough to expose the fiction and face her responsibilityas the events of the central characters lives unfold we see a reflection of the primary conflict in the circumstances of the war raging around them we are shown the foul atrocity that is the reality of war then at wars end we are presented not with the images of the dead the maimed the maddened or even the ravaged earth but instead offered the weary but smiling victorious heroes arriving home this is the for war but it doesnt work for us because we have been there with robbie and we know what he was subject to was so horrible as to precludeand so it is also for briony her rewriting of her own history cannot atone for what she has done we can also realize that her entire life has been an incarnation of hamlets to be or not to be soliloquy wherein the only thing that has enabled her to continue living has been her fear  given her horrible transgression  of what may lay beyondvery special mention must be made of vanessa redgraves short but incredible performance while doing her brief monologue as the now aged briony she says with her eyes more than all the other characters in the film combined while she calmly and quietly lays out the basis of her last novel  and the fact that it does not reflect reality  her eyes plead with us for forgiveness she is facing death she is afraid she wants more than anything in the world to hear someone say we forgive you but the desperation in her eyes lets us know that she is fully aware that the only people who could rightfully say that to her are long dead it is an extremely powerful momentdespite its flaws and the fact that the movies central questions have all too obvious answers there is enough artistry and power in this film that we would highly recommend it,sad
is utterly breath taking theirs this intensity in the movie that makes you think your there and makes you want to cry robbie and cee love is eternal and the fact that she was acting stubborn proves shes lying to herself about loving him along with briony trying to atone for her actions is just a journey that you will remember long after you leave the theater if you havent seen this movie i recommend it 100 and better yet read the novel as well some people told me they thought this movie was boringwtf okay lol its only boring to those that like fast pace non stop action its a true genuine love story about betrayallove war and redemption if you dont know what any of those words mean then i think you will find boring or anything boring for that matter lol go watch it,sad
you can only imagine the truth its got the worst tagline that ive ever read but who cares just wink at the soso romance of the notebook and pan your eyes to this awardwinning tearjerker coming from director joe wright director pride and prejudiceis definitely the best movie ive seen in weeks this romantic tale is something that ive never heard of and by far it is the best love story that ive ever pondered on it even overshadows the love story of amelie just neglect the unremitting clamor of the films critics they criticize this movie heavily because keira knightleys in it and for the plots shallowness every facet of this movie is truly extraordinary the story the performances the direction the art direction the score and the cinematography i could go on praising this hollywood gem for yearsit tells us about the tragic love affair between cecilia tallis keira knightley and their gardener robbie turner james mcavoy their liaisons were later torn apart by a testimony coming from cecilias young jealous sister briony tallis saoirse ronan falsely accusing robbie as a sex maniac robbie was arrested and was sent to the army leaving cecilia behind crying over their loves ill fate their threeway tale kept on rolling over the years until briony on her late teens romola garai realized what mishap she has causedits about a lie which severed multiple relationship ties it speaks of how the mishandling of words can lead to chaos and how tough it is to accept your wrongdoings and take those words back i loved how the three brionies saoirse ronan romola garai and vanessa redgrave delivered those crucial few words of wisdom i love ian mcewan author of the novel this film was based on for shining the light on that maximsaoirse ronan undoubtedly has delivered the best performance among the acting ensemble which rightfully earned her an academy award nomination meanwhile keira knightley keeps on irritating me with her perfectly shaped jawline and that accent of hers but thank god her performance did not ruin the entire film unlike what she did on all the three pirates of the caribbean installments james mcavoy was great in his role i cannot imagine where would this movie go without him its a pity that he wasnt recognized that muchjoe wrights camerawork is reminiscent of olivier dahans direction in la vie en rose and i admire him for that we owe the movies big hit in the box office to him and his directing prowess his long shot on the dunkirk beach is something that every movie buff should see also for its wonderful cinematography and the set designthe original score of dario marianelli was too much like philip glass score on the hours but if we should compare the two marianellis would come out as the better one hands down it was marianellis score which kept me awake throughout the course of the film romancewar movies easily puts me to sleep and it also glued my eyes to the screen the tones generally hyper it grows even more tense whenever the plot arrives at one of its climaxes and it practically enlivens any scene which lacks some vivacitywith joe wrights direction saoirse ronans powerful execution of her role and dario marianellis compelling score combined is a film that you seriously wouldnt want to miss,sad
i finally had the chance to see this much talkedabout film last week and what a fulfilling viewing experience it was it lived up to my expectations and didnt fail to deliver in all the scrutinous aspects of filmmakingto begin with is a crafty interpretation of ian mcewans bestselling novel of the same title christopher hampton did a great job on the screenplay though i wasnt very impressed with joe wrights work as the director the overusage of juxtaposition between brionys perspective and the real event worked most of the time but the recurring flashbacks would be too much for the ordinary moviegoer im not certain if it is wrights style or technique but he deviates to mislead the viewers at some points in the movie there were also some unnecessary scenes that could have been deleted without affecting the storythe films art direction set design costume design and cinematography successfully captured the essence of the plot and the emotion of the characters as well as the atmosphere of the films setting it takes us from the laidback splendor of the tallis estate on the summer of 1935 to the dreadful scenes of world war ii i particularly liked the long shot on the dunkirk beach where the singing soldiers somber songs of valor and hope combined with robbies longingturneddesperation to see cecilia again touched a part of my heart but my favorite part of the movie has to be the sequence starting from cecilia composing herself in front of the mirror with opera playing in the background interspersed with the shots of robbie typing his anatomical letter of apology to cee leading up to the scene in the library it was pure grandeurone of the most memorable things about the movie is the superb musical score by dario marianelli its the first time in recent memory that ive seen a movie where a typewriter is used as a device to present most of the films musical score the incorporation of the typewriter rouses the viewers emotions and builds up tension thus adding to the thrill it was used masterfully in the scenes where briony read robbies letter and during paul marshalls wedding  the ascending pace of the typewriters sounds matching that of the simultaneously increasing volume as the scene drastically progresses makes up for a magnificent and not to say dramatic finishin the acting arena saoirse ronan pronounced sr ronn though honestly at first i thought her name sounds like seahorse lol is a sensational discovery she is the perfect choice for the role of the young briony tallis ronan understood the guileless profundity of her character her expressive eyes speak and convey a wide range of emotions that provoke our thoughts and challenge our capability to judge she portrayed briony very well and judging from her striking performance in the movie ronan is a very promising new talent and shell definitely make it far im pretty sure shell give abigail breslin little miss sunshine and dakota fanning i am sam a run for their moneynot to be outdone is the very talented but underrated james mcavoy as robbie turner his strong and arresting performance in as the illfated housekeepers son who fell in love with his masters daughter clearly shows why he received a golden globe nomination for best supporting actor you can see depth and derive profound understanding of his character just by looking in his eyes and observing his gestures i felt that his work in this movie was overlooked by the academy members maybe in the next couple of years hell finally wow them and get his longoverdue oscar nominationwhile ronan and mcavoy breathed and lived their characters keira knightley gave a satisfactory portrayal as cecilia tallis brionys elder sister and robbies dearly beloved her acting was ok throughout the movie but she didnt exert the same amount of passion fire and spirit as her coactors did i didnt see anguish or turmoil in both her facial expressions and body language that would convince me that she is in a wartorn time and place she gave too much finesse that it seemed like shes not affected by the ongoing chaos at all and finally her unnaturally hasty line delivery just seemed very anticipated and rehearsed thats why i didnt feel the intensity of her acting in this movie same goes with romola garai as the 18 yearold briony tallis she was good but i know she could have done betterthe one that gave body to the whole film was the 77 yearold briony played by the legendary vanessa redgrave who did her meaningful part excellently substantiating guilt remorse and enlightenment she may have appeared on screen for only a mere 5 minutes or so but her performance was pitchperfect the closure she gave  with no rhymes no embellishments  brought tears to the eyes and tugged my heartstrings when i least expect itthe ending was executed perfectly it wasnt over the top nor exaggerated  just the right tone and mood to give the audience an emotional upheaval and a heartrending realization of the meaning of the wordin a nutshell is more than just an artsy film about two lovers separated by war and betrayed by the consequences of a childs nave understanding of the world around her  its a lesson about integrity strength endurance hope and compassion and how the absence of those can deprive us of happiness change the course of our destiny and ever ruin peoples livesthis film just blew me away so it currently ranks 15th on the list of my most favorite movies of all time 14th had i not seen hayao miyazakis howls moving castle the day after securing its position as the best british film ive seen so far,sad
should i have read the book before seeing this movie not necessarily of course but in the case of it was certainly an advantage as i asked myself how the richness of the vocabulary the suggestive delicacy of the verbally painted pictures and the intricate pattern of the relationships between the various characters would be rendered on the screen the answer to these intriguing questions is not difficult at all the cinematographic version has come as close to the original literary work as one can possibly get the author ian mcewan always excels in depicting life as it was in england in the early 20th century with its restraining formalism hypocrisy and a numbing form of awkwardness that often lead to a lasting form of tragedy all these elements are constantly present throughout the movie and together with the excellent acting the captivating images of landscapes and the cameras keen eye for detail one cannot but acclaim as one of the best productions in recent years,sad
why is getting such a positive response is baffling this is the kind of thirdrate movie youd see at midday on tv director joe wright telegraphs plot twists so early that all dramatic impact is crushed using certain techniques that are heavyhanded and obvious keira knightley offers yet again a onenote performance leading the new generation of dull nopersonality actors who manage to create a black hole where there should be a character james mcavoy fairs better but his character becomes less interesting as you see clearly where he is going to end up the ending is so predictable and anticlimatic that you feel the director assumes that the audience is stupid and unless he hits you over the head with a sledgehammer you will not understand what is trying to be said this is the kind of film merchantivory could have done in their sleep and even their lesser efforts tower over this halfbaked overrated film that shows that filmmaking standards certainly have dropped in recent years,sad
occasionally a movie comes along that leaves you with a great feeling of satisfaction this movie has the layered effect of a modern novel looking at lifes events from the perspective of time and drawing them together in a way that gives some sort of closure there is no way to change the past we can look back with remorse but admitting the truth is the right way to deal with the human cost let it be said that the first 30 minutes are slowgoing but this background is necessary to understand the story that follows pay attention to the perspective of the young people whose lives will quickly unfold and unravel after the initial scenes take placethe movie gives us images of great beauty childhood fantasies grotesque scenes of war actual newsreel footage and a sad incident that haunts the main characters for the rest of their livesbritish cinema and literature often deal with the underdog but not in the frank capra tradition of happy endings this alternative tradition says that life can be mean and unfair dont gloss it over with fairy tales cloaked in patriotism and heroism this movie delivers that message in a fine piece of filmmaking by director joe wright,sad
a previous reviewer mentioned the shift between the first hour and the remainder and i agree while beautifully shot and after some excellent tensionbuilding scenes the rest of the movie seemed to be making earnest attempts at resolving the plot lines but never really did perhaps because they werent in the novel i dont know because i havent read the novel and probably wont i cant gush at the performances of the two leads because they never did convince me unlike saoirse ronan who played the young briony and romola garai as the 18 year old briony although this character was the villain of the piece i found i had far more interest in her and sympathy for her than for james mcavoy and keira knightley i think their difficulty was in building characterizations out of sparse script material and the result was a pastiche of clichs lifted out of films like gosford park and similar depicting the english upperclass prewar period once james mcevoy was taken away by the police the film lost cohesion and became a series of scenes again beautifully photographed but never coming together to provide a sense of unitythe dunkirk scene as cinematically impressive as it is left me thinking it was there to compensate for the lack of plot development after id marveled at the continuous shot along the beach the planning and choreography that had gone into it the brilliant set design i really had to ask for the sake of the story andthe point here is things pick up again back in wartorn london with romola garai as the 18 year old briony atoning for her crime by becoming a nurse but just when i was being pulled back into the story which had always really been about this character we get a rather confusing scene with keira and james and and an even more confusing appearance by vanessa redgrave who portrays briony as an old woman the author of the novel that tells this whole story she tries to explain that she fictionalized the lovers reunion because well she could but in fact they both died apartand thats the moviemaybe this is the kind of movie that should have a crawler along the bottom of the screen saying this is a very very sensitive film just to remind us not to go expecting a larger and more satisfying experience,sad
i read mcewans book of before i saw the film which i would definitely recommend when i watched the film it was all i had expected it to be and more i was captivated by the confusion of brionys actions celcilias and robbies love and the brilliant ending the entire cinematography were perfectly arranged around the story and created a flawless atmosphere the music and lighting was what really struck me corresponding with the scenes fantastically there was ill admit a lack of dialogue  though the characters presented by mcewan had always seemed concealed with thought thus allowing the audience to create their own reasoning conveyed extremely well in the filmthe war scenes were perfectly effective and truthful of gore and emotion the ending was surprising even though i had read the book i had not fully understood it i felt it was a severe twist to the story yet made sense of brionys character the last scene with elderly briony quickly became one of my favourites with the truth of reality rather than a fairytale ending where everyone has a chance to right their wrongshas become my favourite film and for audiences who enjoy a similar genre this is one of my first recommendations bravo,sad
i wanted to single out vanessa redgrave for special acclaim as she brought the whole movie together i felt in a very purposeful summary of the consequences of her actions as a very immature and spoiled 13year old she is an astonishingly powerful and convincing actor that takes nothing away from the other key actors who quite simply were brillianta very thoughtless and selfish act effectively created the plot for an astonishingly beautiful and wellcrafted piece of cinematic genius i saw this movie on my own as my wife was away and four young rowdy teenage girls walked into the theatre and sat beside me half way through the movie i noticed that the girl immediately beside me was gasping and sobbing which almost moved me to tears also the whole four girls had the tissues out well before the end of the movie i must say made me feel what it must have been like to live through the horrors of ww2 and it made me feel great compassion for the nurses who gave so much of themselves at a time when there was very little that medicine could do and the best treatment was to just be there and sit talking with the wounded and dyingi agree with all the other comments i have read and will certainly go back and see this beautiful movie again with my wifeand take some tissues i was extremely impressed with the unexpected impact this movie had on my feelings it was never predictable and had a great grabbag of emotions scattered at unpredictable interludes so you were kept guessing all the way through i now need to go and buy the novel,sad
tap tap tap goes the typewriter the tapping is coming faster and hitting harder the pace is set and the race has officially started director joe wrights bursts out of the gate from the moment it starts as a pan away from a modeled replica of the tallis manor reveals a parade of toy animals and ends aptly on the purported queen of this particular animal kingdom briony tallis saoirse ronan briony is only thirteen years old but she is just about to finish her very first play this precocious child is captivating she is at once frightening while just as frightened her focus is eerily burning and her need for command of the situation and those involved motivate her every decision on this particularly sweltering day briony believes her play to be her greatest accomplishment yet and sees her future more brightly boundless than even before she has no idea that everything is about to crumble beneath her chance allows her to witness a few things she was not meant to and before long she makes a desperate play to regain control of her destiny who knew that one little girl could cause so much trouble for so many people and invite turmoil into her family for the rest of her days by telling one misguided liewhen briony falsely accuses robbie james mcavoy her sister cecilias keira knightly lover of a horrible crime he is arrested and sent to prison it isnt clear whether briony was aware of how serious her accusations were or how far robbie would be taken from cecilia and his future as a result but it is clear that she interrupted a love of immense proportions first act goes back and forth between brionys breakdown and the escalating sexual tension between robbie and cecilia cecilia is not your typical period drama maiden she is provocative and sharptongued for all her fierce selfawareness though she has made a point to repress her longing for robbie out of respect for status robbie too has been hiding how he feels to appease the rules that apply to status and boundaries not so much out of respect though but rather for blind tradition societys restraints cannot hold back a love of this magnitude the passion bustling between them is palpable and exacerbated by the heat it is no wonder that it all comes to a head on this fated day and is halted no sooner than it is just begun as they are only given the chance to wet their lips with each others taste before being ripped apart theirs is a relationship that will live in a suspended state of foreplay for a long time to comewhen robbie is taken prisoner shifts into a new and noticeably different movement the intensity carefully crafted in the first act dissipates as the characters enter their own individual limbos left to meander aimlessly in search of repair the build toward brionys lie was punctuated by a sharp concise score by dario marianelli and highlighted by seamus mcgarveys bright and elegantly fluid cinematography both artists employ entirely new approaches toward the action that unfolds in the lies aftermath the score becomes dark somber  less driven and more haunting the visuals follow suit feeling heavy and dense the change halts the flow of the film and feels like a misstep momentarily once you catch the breath you were holding previously the severity of the scenario sinks in and the fresh aesthetic takes on its own significance it cannot help but feel longer or slower in comparison but how else are we or the characters expected to feel when they are living their new lives lost and haunted by a past they could not control besides being relevant to the tone of the story the shift also gives birth to a four and a half minute shot depicting the 1940 evacuation at dunkirk beach that is mesmerizing in its grace and awesome in scopeis a fresh and surprising spectacle wright impressed with charm and poise last time out in 2005s pride and prejudice also starring knightly but his latest grabs the period drama by its snotty superiority and turns it inside out thanks in no small part to ian mcewans much loved novel of the same name the gravity of how one bad decision can ruin many lives resonates loudly and the guilt that follows gives way to the need for forgiveness from those who were hurt and from the one that caused the pain does not judge briony for what shes done instead it allows her the chance to heal and make things right without ever presuming that her recovery is inevitable for breaking convention and for demonstrating sincere respect for the story the characters and the audience wright has absolutely nothing to be sorry for,sad
this movie was like a really long beautiful song filled with great frames and background musicthe acting was amazing and that ending that damn endingtime wellspent,sad
kiera and james is just win they deliver both of their characters so beautifully i havent read the book but the film made me cry so hard i dont particulary like warthemed films but this one surely has unique place in my heart highly recommend to watch it is just so universal  everyone finds their piece in this,sad
the first 50 minutes were absolutely riveting masterful even unfortunately the 2nd half was much slower but the performances by pretty much everyone were fantastic it also had a great score that incorporated a typewriter as in instrument how beep cool is that,sad
i had a need 11 years later to watch this movie again after watching it probably 5 times 10 years agothe shots scenes and actors music not to mention are perfectits so artistic and realistic makes me feel like im in that moment feeling what they are feelingi wish they made more movies like this where the actors are so good that there is no need of special effects and making it fake beautiful when its notbook is amazing of course book should be read but if its not this is probably one of the best adaptation i have ever watchedenjoy,sad
before watching i expected it was a romance between cecilia and robbie who are separated by the irony of fate and wondered what for they would have to make for but as i keep watching i noticed that it is a story of briony younger sister of cecilia and we would see her path to pay for her guiltin the first act many of the scenes are described from brionys eye the landscapes of england is really beautiful but throughout the scene there is always a feeling of tension especially after briony happens to see a secret romance between cecilia and robbie the situation gets accelerated the background music synchronized with sounds of typing prompts nervousness among audienceswhile robbie is arrested and struggles to go back to cecilia we have to face severe conditions surrounding soldiers especially after watching dunkirk i had to update my image of operation dynamo as a severer one it is so heartbreaking but james mcavoys act is amazing the last scene is a little bit unsatisfactory since briony seems always try to justify her action and the interview scene sounds rather explanatory than emotionally however i feel saved by the ending briony prepares for cecilia and robbie and all the more with they could walk such a way together,sad
5 january 2008 the crisp and cinematic marvel of a period piece in a romantic drama genre is easily one of the best movies of the year if not the best the sharp attention to audio detail and the set design exudes of a bygone era this cold mountain 2003 brazil 1985 recreation of an exacting british household is perfectly captured on screen with the few exception of a few minor flaws or perhaps more correctly alternative approaches to a few scenes this amazing movie depicts a fascinating romance innocent youth and bittersweet tragedy in a fantastic literally sweeping film presentation there is a panoramic scene of dunkirk that is lost in translation 2003 in its authentic experiential camera work the few possible changes that might have enhanced the movie included taken more time to capture a smoothly realistic scene with the fly allowing the audience to be as aware of the contents of a typed letter as the characters in the movie a clearer presentation of the hunt for missing boys a more detailed and emotional in depth examination of the arrest scene and the turn about of facing ones decision and reactions of the various parties involved the evolution of the three soldiers later in the movie that suddenly become about two soldiers and finally a more reasonable presentation of a soldier who stumbles across a movie screen nevertheless this movie cannot be diminished by the small minute possible alternative details the twist in this movie is brilliant and the subject matter universal in scope such that this movie may easily become a classic in years to come clearly a best picture contender nine out of ten stars,sad
i thought it was a stunning movie gorgeously shot well acted and devastating as intended but am i the only one who is going to admit that as an able bodied young man in england in the 30s robbie would have still inevitably gone to war and quite probably also inevitably died regardless of false accusation,sad
i love this movie and the actors in it its a great love story and ends in a beautiful way if you are putting off watching this movie like i did dont its bit a movie to be missed,sad
the movie is a series of events that brings to brionys after a life of guilt and remorse at the very beginning when she is 13 we see her as a girl who cannot do her own business and we cant stand her anymore when she denounces robbie mistakenly for the rape of her cousin following only her childish paranoia by doing this she also prevents him and cecilia from being happy toghether during the war she has turned adult and were glad to see the her repentance for what she has done we are also happy to see robbie and cecilia finally reunited after their war adventures and at the end two twists that upset what we have watched until now we discover that brionys cousin has married her real rapist which has become famous in the meanwhile and that both robbie and cecilia have died during the war its briony herself that reveals it to us presenting her last book 59 years later not having had the chance to redeem herself with her sister she rewrites her story giving her back the lost happiness one of the best finals ive ever seen,sad
epic and heartrending accents its oldfashioned qualities with a modernday frankness,sad
a friend of mine insisted that i watched this film im truly grateful for such thing since this turned out to be one of the most outstanding masterpieces ive ever watchedi could talk about the breathtaking cinematography the gorgeous soundtrack the superb acting or even the amazing this plot is made in other words i could make it long lets keep it shortis in its simplest form one of the best acts of storytelling in cinema history this film is much more than a story its a view changer avoiding spoilers i assure you that all of those who enter the world of this film will most certainly leave it as a different person and ate the end of the day thats all we could ask from a good movie,sad
a sweeping beautiful and deeply moving account of a 13 year old girls mistake that shapes not only the rest of her life but the lives of her sister and her sisters lover isnt for everyone its a slow two hours bathed in sadness but for those who like amazing acting beautiful cinematography and having their emotions stirred this is for you,sad
this movie has changed everything about me such a powerful and great movie,sad
excellent cinematography music story acting and directing,sad
author ian mcewans creation is always full of heartbreaking moments and capabilities to bring tears from all races of human the same effect is done by director joe wright and christopher hampton despite with tears in eyes audience can see how extraordinary level of beauty was created by cinematographer seamus mcgarvey taking the opportunity of sarah greenwoods set and costumes by jacqueline durran if there is still any wanting left apart from great acting from all of the actorsdario marianellis hear wrenching and innovative music easily fill the void although there wasnt any henceit only increases the level of the movie it would be a better choice to keep a tissue box while watching the longing of old briony,sad
absolutely outstanding the acting was unbelievable too very interesting story i am very very delighted,sad
i was ready to punch the eject button on the player after about 1520 minutes the movie however was laying the ground work for an excellent story during that time and frankly it got a little old but i stuck with it then briony told her lie and off the story went my rating went from 2 maybe 3 to a 9 by the time the credits rolled that has never happened to me before and what an ending the acting the direction the music the sets the costumes and the story were all worthy of at least a 9 9 or 10s are very rare for me,sad
in the 1930s english countryside young briony an aspired writer with great imagination just added the final touches to her first ever play she waits for her cousins arrival to stage it with them and show it to her family including her older sister cecilia and house employees however she is mostly exited to show it to robbie the house gardener for whom she has developed a crush on briony is unaware that robbies heart is already taken by cecilia who reciprocates the feelings their relationship successfully remains a secret to everyone until one day a particular incident crashes the peaceful days of the tallis household and triggers a series of events that will leave consequent scars on the charactersthe movie is a twohour long flashback seen at most times from the point of view of briony that we see growing from a young nave and selfish 13yearold girl to a more mature young women and finally to a wise but regretful old lady everything within the plot revolves around the mistakes briony has committed when she was younger and how she needs to understand them and to cope with their consequences as an adult taking her on a journey towards personal development the purity of robbie and cecilias love is also very touching moreover the way the movie is filmed is esthetically breathtaking with a lot of beautiful and complex shots such as the dunkirk beach one take scene if the original soundtrack of won an oscar it is also for a reason indeed the music fits extremely well with each scenes of the movie and truly brings it to life some very well composed tracks include one of the first of the film which is made using the noises of robbies typing machine and the long track which accompanies him during the dunkirk scene and manages to this scene all its power finally what also truly makes this movie worthwhile is the final twist along with the very emotionally packed final scene is therefore a very well executed movie whose beauty and uniqueness rests on its narration its twist and turns its complex characters and their development its breathtaking cinematography and its original soundtrack i highly recommend this movie to everyone but beware of some hard topics that are evoked in it,sad
a pure joy  sincere pure and sensitive story about how one lie changes lives how love fights its way and how guilt rips apart,sad
this is one of my favourite movies and mcavoys execution of his character is one of the reason why it is so absolutely heart wrenching character i feel that witnessing his character alone is reason enough to watch this film,sad
is a rare beauty a film that shatters hearts while bringing them peace at the same timeanalysis of notable work writingdirecting the story plays out brilliantly and is of a certain brilliance that few films have ever achieved characters have such level of charisma that it is near impossible not to fall in love with each of them joe wright showcases his genius in the way he tells this phenomenal and emotionally distressing film the film touches ones heart in the deepest way both with sadness and joy cinematographyediting the work of seamus mcgarvey is incredible the film begins with a dreamlike quality as we view the world through 13 year old brionys eyes as things start to become more mature and less childlike the dreamlike quality fades the color palette is of a simple beauty the openness of certain shots and the closed in feeling of others serves to heighten the feeling of the characters throughout the film every frame is beautiful and authentic the editing is beyond the level of many other films the way the story is revealed to us is breathtaking the transitions are seamless and the feeling of being inside of the characters becomes so natural due to the way in which the story is cut dialogueacting the dialogue is wonderfully authentic and beautiful coupled with the incredible performances of the cast it becomes an unforgettable film james mcavoy and keira knightley deliver one of their best performances of their careers saoirse ronan is incredible and talented beyond her years in this film musicsound design the film score is outstanding elements of a typewriter are sprinkled all throughout the music plays wonderfully with the action taking place on screen the whole film seems to work together wonderfully the sound design is masterful in the beginning it is especially strong as we view the world through brionys eyes we hear the things she does with absolute clarity later the sound brings forth a great deal of emotion particularly when silence is used production designspecial effects the costumes set pieces and locations are of magnificent beauty and authenticity one of the most impressive sequences is the long take at dunkirk every chapter of the film feels real there are not many special effects in the film but the makeup and props are wonderfully within the realm of realismconclusion makes wonderful use of all the aspects of storytelling through film and is a masterpiece that will not soon be forgotten,sad
sometimes there are films that present a story in such a way that it makes you rethink the entire film after the first watch not that i didnt know what to expect with considering i did read the synopsis before viewing but theres something so incredibly impactful about the way joe wright adapts the acclaimed novel you never exactly know the final direction until the last moments of pure devastation and thats what i call an affective filmits not just wrights direction however as theres absolutely magnetic performances to dive deep into including one from the young saoirse ronan ronan plays briony tallis who blames a serious crime on her sisters boyfriend because of her clouded judgement its an unfortunate tale of a person bringing their previous beliefs of a person into a judgement call that is far beyond their understanding especially for someone who is only 13 years old the other notable thing about is the original score the way dario marianelli factors in a typewriter to his already beautiful piano score is meticulously unique it really adds an extra element to a deep film in its own right its also gorgeous film to look at especially the long shots of the dunkirk beach and the costumeproduction design throughout and really the film is a gorgeous tragedy something that in order to be effective has to be directed with extreme care and an original touch is all of these things and more8810,sad
bright sun bounces beautifully off keira knightley convinced yet as she chats to mccavoy sassily not without delightful teasing i say to myself okay a love story this film has much more on its mind than the happy lives of two pretty lovers one innocent lie and james wonderful romance and whole life deteriorates such strong emotion only cultivated with years of british plays you are really rooting for a happy ending love story and it kills you they arent together which is most of the film the story is refreshingly clean of cliches framed in a war era which cinematographer plays around with some impressive results a dunkirk gritty continuous shot is done with great sympathy and care mccavoy climbs the biggest hurdles and we see more of him reminiscing about knightley and seemingly bringing her on screen lighting is great and a soundtrack thats heartbreaking a tragic love story with twists and turns and turning my upset tummy thinking about all that can go wrong just like my relationship with women,sad
sprawling across six decades it chronicles a crime and the unfortunate consequences that follow i have yet to see all of joe wrights filmography at the time of this review but this is easily his most competent having not read the source material ive heard that the books structure makes it rather difficult to adapt seemingly wright made it look easy embedding character perspectives integrating flashbacks and utilising a clear three act structure the journey we are taken on seems small in scale but draws in on the vast historical events of wwii to make an epic romance it portrays how a childs vivid imagination and innocence of youth can cause damage to others in years to come a false accusation that splits young love apart theres something so ominous and vindictive about such a feeble mistake that it packs one heck of a punch to the heart the characters portrayed are all played out incredibly well and become fully developed by the heartbreaking end which im sure will depress you all its a resonating tale but one not without shock value some career best performances from knightley mcavoy and ronan they all captured the elegance and lavish lifestyle of the first act to then succumb to the emotional devastation of acts two and three wrights bold direction is what truly captivates particularly the infamous one take scene of dunkirks evacuation the props the extras the camera placementit all came together to create an aria of desolation it was sublime the sound editing was notably fantastic also especially the cacophony of typewriting sounds marianellis score was beautifully haunting and deserved all the recognition it got i do find the acts to be incredibly different and jarring which consequently means i have to take a few minutes to adapt to the adjusted tempo of the narrative also the gorgeous cinematography slowly fades as the running time gradually concludes however this is a solid piece of cinema that showcases excellent talent on and off screen,sad
atonementwithin few minutes you will fall in this world ie so beautiful and horrific at the same time with the help of probably one of the best background score of all time it may remind you of birdmans background music is the perfect mixture of two antonyms for when there is beauty in it one feels full of hope but when it gets dark it may get difficult to digest the practicality of it hats off to joe wright in its such a beautiful depiction of love pettiness and consequences of ones action by justifying each and every frame and character of it with a mild but dark tone james mcavoy and keira knightly oozes vulnerability and strength at the same time doing some of their best work with the help of brilliant supporting cast like saoirse ronan steals the show in excellent execution brilliant writing and stellar performances all wrapped up in one of the most dreadful and heartbreaking love story ever,sad
watched this movie again for third time  first time was mid 2008 about 10 years ago but still like i am watching it for first time  one of best drama i ve ever seen ,sad
stylish visuals smart performances neat direction excellent classy music score has it all but what about the writing according to the academy and certain critics this is class stuff  yet looking at a very large quantity of the viewers comments it seems they were more readily able to see the lack of believable story elements and situations contained within not many likable characters to help you connect with these at times one dimensional folk  who live their lives more like a group of yr 2000 hbo yuppie types  than the 1930s personalities theyre supposed to be portraying this good looking movie with its interesting title  tends yet again to prove that the current folk who make up our movie analyzers and judges of award worthy product might be sadly lacking any practical understanding of decent writing dont look too hard at the details within this work or you may find yourself questioning the wisdom of the somewhat overthetop raves dished out to this could have been but sadly is not such a good story there are some moments of high emotional impact during the latter halfs war years and the performers play it all for real but overall this ends up being for the easily pleased or lovers of big glossy productions with more set dressing than real character or attention to fine details,sad
when a young boy is accused and punished for a crime he did not commit he gets the choice of staying behind bars or join the war we follow his tormented life from when he is brutally separated from his beloved as a result of a lie until his last breath in a desperate attempt to return to his previous life and loveits a highly dramatic movie which starts a bit unconvincing but soon changes everything raising the bar with every scene it depicts its actors especially james mcavoy and keira knightley do a really good job in creating and maintaining this dark emotional and tense atmosphere which simply draws you into it making you care for the its characters as their fate seems more and more troubled as a drama it does its job incredibly well bringing more and more tension and sadness one event at a time it also has an unique way of telling its story by jumping from past to future and back without any warning while the shooting perspective helps it even more in its quest what it turns out to be is a very good drama credible and emotional with an unexpected but somehow logical ending if only it had a better beginningit would have been perfect still it managed to impress me to the tears which its story making it the most dramatic movie ive seen so far,sad
if it wasnt for the upcoming dunkirk movie by christopher nolan and if i didnt come the singletake shot i probably would never see this film ive never been interested in pride and prejudice anna karenina or sotosay pink novels adapted in film at all although i did come across the soloist by the same director joe wright which i liked but didnt have a lasting impact on meit is difficult to review this particular title it is absolutely not a war movie at least in my view the sheer lenght of the sentimental relationship between mcavoy and knightleys character prevents it from being a romance the specific premise to which things are set in motion doesnt let it being a classconflict centered story although subthemes constantly pop up it is to note that the classconflict aspect of the film is mostly very subtle particularly in relation to how that event which acts as premise to the plot is being dealt with by the aristocratic family of knightleys character certain aspects reminded me of stage drama tragedies the title has much been criticized hows the ending an at all in my interpretation it is a certain characters whole existence with her being always thorn by the acts she did or omitted to do that acts as a sort of an attempt to somehow even out things between her and the other characters relationshipsi would like to keep the plot as much as under wraps id like to point out that until the last 10 minutes i kept trying to ignore as much as possible an aspect of the plot i found idiotic why a certain character didnt simply just withdraw its statement it was those final minutes that provided an explanation which simply brought back things to be logical that said the film is clever constant timejumps and very subtle implications suggest some of the smartest portions of the plot dont expect nolanleveled complexity though technically again the photography is outstanding in nearly the entire film certainly the peak is the 5 minutes dunkirk single take sequence but really it is needless and too long to list every single outstanding shot the film had2008 was a year packed with too many good films that prevented from winning more oscars that said deserves the acclaim it receives,sad
you know the book if you use public transport youll recognise it as the one everyone was reading circa 2004 there was that booker prize shortlisting the reams of laudatory articles about its author ian mcewan and then arrived the inevitable film adaptation which should by rights be as stilted and anaemic an affair as most bigscreen versions of serious fiction a merchant ivory tower of selfimportant emoting from rsc heavyweights except that this qualitydrenched effort is as stilted as a bellydancerthe movies opening act is like a breathless celebration of pure heedless joy a demonstration of the theory that the pinnacle of human happiness was reached by life in an english country house between the wars of course that was more true of those upstairs than downstairs we meet cecilia tallis keira knightley the bold older daughter of an old family and robbie turner james mcavoy their housekeepers promising son who is an oxford graduate thanks to the generosity of cecilias father despite their difference in social class they are powerfully attracted to each other and that leads to a charged erotic episode next to a fountain on the house lawntheres a careful contrast between the gilded youth of cecilia and friends literally glowing in seamus mcgarveys burnished cinematography robbies earthier colours and brionys cold little face pinched with selfimportance all setting up a conflict to comebut its the tone that sets this apart from more traditional eversoslightlyfusty interwar dramas mature actors barely get a look in  nearcameos from brenda blethyn gina mckee and vanessa redgrave aside noone over the age of 30 even registers magicalrealist underwater scenes make the stately home seem an idyll but the oppressive heat that radiates from the screen hints at tension sexual and otherwise bubbling under the surface the most erotic sex scene in years  this despite the fact that both parties remain almost fully dressed  cant ease the growing dread even aside from the world war glowering on the horizon its clear that something is about to go horribly wrongto say much more about the details however would be to risk unbalancing a plot as delicately calibrated as clockwork if youve read the book you know whats coming if you havent count yourself lucky and watch with your heart in your mouth as events build to a climax barely halfway through,sad
i loved this movie and im not a romance movie person more drama and horror the more i thought about it the more i hated briony the character really wait until you are an old person probably every person who could have benefited from the truth is deadevery single person and now you write the truth for what exactly she waited so that anyone who could have cared is dead and gone and cant judge her anymore for lying and her reason to give them what they ultimately wanted thats a pretty picture in her head to justify somehow waiting all those years to reveal the truth when it really doesnt matter anymore briony knew she did wrong when you see her looking out the window as they took him away to show them happy 50 years later was it on a beach how romanticand fakesomething you conjure up in your mind to help you sleep at night she basically killed both of those 2 characters within 4 yearsnice a jealous nosy busy body preteen whose actions killed 2 people and ruined more lives the mothersparents brother etc and is now confessing in her book as some sort of when she really is dying of cancer and needs to feel like it matterswell at this point it doesnt the scene she caught in the woods was consensual but her cousin couldnt outright admit to having premarital rough sex could sheso she also went along with the charade to look like a victim but if briony didnt accuse someone no one would have gotten hurt there just would have been a lot of hard questions as to what was happening out there when she should have been looking for her brothers instead of having fun with some guy she was attracted to good movie hated how it endedbut i suppose it was appropriate the only part of the ending that makes up for it is that i think briony ended up alone all her life,sad
this movie is artistically and well done but as such it can also move slowly at times this movie reveals the horrors of war poverty greed falsehood and prejudice some of the horrors of war are graphically displayed there is one very sad scene of a dying man in a hospital there is a very touching moment where keira knightley calls her true love home to her large portions of the movie deal with the struggle for and several of those moments are very poignant when i rate a movie part of my rating is my own enjoyment throughout as opposed to the quality of the film this explains why i havent given it higher marks,sad
looks like im one of the few out there that was not a fan of the movie while i think the acting was superb the sets and locations were stunning and visually appealing the sound track was wonderful the style of the movie was not to my liking the movie is written in snippets telling a story then back filling it in it continues to do this throughout the entire length of the movie and i found it at times hard to follow and cumbersome i dont believe the actual story line made itself known until about and 1 12 hours into the movie and i was disappointed in how it wrapped itself up i didnt hate it but wont be keeping it on my list of movies to rewatch,sad
on the surface this movie seems just like a normal tragic love story but this story is actually well used in delivering a strong message the painfulness of living with guilt and unchanging love only causing hopeless yearning for each other is shown very well in this movie through a hearttouching story beautiful and desolate setting and the great acting of the actorsin this movie the main character robbie is falsely charged and taken as a soldier to war and cecilia is left behind longing for her lover because of a single incident caused by her sister briony briony had the prejudice against robbie that led to the problem they do meet after a few years but as difficult as it was to just meet again it is not easy for them to start their relationship again they promise to meet again as robbie leaves again for war and they are separated for another several years which becomes forever after alleven though briony was the one who had falsely accused robbie she was just the spark that led to the tragedy it wasnt wholly her fault that the two couldnt be together it was the atrocious war that destroyed love families and lives of people all because of the greed of some people the harsh conditions of the war and the destruction of innocent lives is eloquently and movingly shown this gave me a strong impression and made me rethink about the cruelty of war and humans ultimatelythe after all must not only be from briony who was late in her confession about her mistakes but also for the victims of war this powerful message both about fallacy and war that is delivered through this movie makes it a mustwatch,sad
2007  i loved this movie so well made and shot absolutely beautiful cinematography and setting their house in the summer was amazing i wanted to be there so badly loved the actors in this especially the little girl saoirse ronan such a good actor at such a young age keira knightley with her incredibly pursed face was good too and james mcavoy i couldnt really get over the beauty of the cinematography at the start brionys blue eyes the english countryside in the summer and the amazing castle they lived in incredibly well thought out story one thing i didnt get from briony was jealousy though which was supposed to be there they maybe could have conveyed that a bit more it just shows how quickly life can change and what someones perception of you can actually do i thought briony genuinely 100 thought robbie was a dangerous rapist but the fact there was actually jealousy in there and a childish crush makes a bit more sense it also reminded me of the great gatsby especially the quote theyre careless people i loved the ending too how that part was in her imagination so sad that she seemingly never got in contact with her sister again and she ruined her relationship with her when she accused robbie i preferred the first half of the movie to the second but thats probably just because i wanted to be there but just shows how different life can look after not a long time everything about this movie was fantastic sincerely enjoyed it,sad
i barely review a film but this is the exception this film is riveting and has a fantastic premise mccoy gives the best performance of his career in this stunning movie the film starts out strong then dips a bit in the middle and then ends so majestically that i was left in tears without a doubt this movie deserves its nominations and even more than what it got i have not seen a movie that knows how to channel the viewers emotions so well i was happy sad hateful and burdened this was a thrilled and everyone should see this film from the cinematography to the acting it was new refreshing and most of all a real masterpieces i will definitely buy this movie when i next see itthe only thing that i have a tiny problem with is the fact that they do not illustrate very well what time period the movie takes place in as in what year or month we are in after the beginning if that were a bit more clear it would be perfect,sad
this film delivers style substance melodrama and heights of suspense all in a single pot for the viewers to feast uponranging from music direction to casting and up to the twist in the plot its a must watch for all movie lovers this is one of those movies that makes you stick to your seat waiting for the film to never end but there is one little addition i think  that could have been added it was just that with imagination one can imagine even the end of the universe to me the aspect of imagination used in the film has not been utilized to its full potential i could have disclosed the part of the film about which i am talking but that would merely spoil it because the movie flamboyantly starts at that precise point once again its a must watch,sad
i first watched this in 2007 and this became one of my favorite movie because of the ending and the overall plot and its twists its heartwrenching and different from your typical romance dramas im bias for the two main characters keira knightley and james mcavoy i saw my rooted couple torn apart then back together then bam a plot twist again saying just kidding theyre not together after alli have to give credit to saoirse ronan for portraying the core of briony so well that i am reminded of briony every time i see saoirse the actress the briony character is the one that causes me so much distress watching this movie because it was her false accusation that took away the happiness of others yet in the very end she says i gave them their happiness its characters like briony that makes a movie good and frustrating to watchi rewatched this again in 2011 and i didnt like the film as much as i remembered i had perhaps i was judging the film solely on its great ending twist or perhaps its because i already know all the plot the second time im watching this so the excitement from the unknown is gone either way i found the movie moved at a very slow pace the middle part where robbie was at war was dragged on to the point of boring i seriously think the movie is still as good without the middle intermission that slowed down the movies momentum,sad
i really should have waited a little longer to gather my thoughts i just switched off the tv and grew to enjoy this film very much i was not really in the mood for a film but since it was recorded i decided to give it a go i had to stay alert to keep up with the twist and turn of the beginning then i found it more and more interesting both females lead were giving such a good but intriguing performance and the male lead was in the same league i caught on early with what went on however it did not spoil the story for me and enjoyed the development to the full story i also liked the conclusion that made a lot of sense for me i was haunted with the soldier character whom i could not remember the name but knew i enjoyed in some other workimdb helped me it was daniel may i had seen in ronald big tv show vera a detective story whose episodes i enjoyed a lot gives a good appearance as the young mans mother,sad
its 1935 england briony tallis saoirse ronan is an imaginative writer who witnesses her sister cecilia keira knightley and servants son robbie turner james mcavoy robbie is thinking about going to medical school with her fathers help briony has a crush on robbie when cousin lola quincey gets raped brionys false accusation sends robbie to prison four years later robbie is in france retreating towards dunkirk he has been released from prison to join the army cecilia cannot forgive briony romola garai who has abandoned cambridge to do something useful as a nurse briony is haunted by her mistake as she writes her storythis is beautifully shot and acted its worthwhile for multiple viewings there are epic scenes like dunkirk and memorably constructed ones like the fountain it can be slow at times but its never tired the biggest change i would add is the important rape scene i think its important to show the mans identity to the audience heres the thing its not a needed mystery except for briony its obviously not robbie but it would be more intense to know for sure,sad
briony tallis has seen something something that will change her life forever but not only hers cecilia her older sister and robbie turner the housemaids son will also be dragged into a spiral of lies and regrets that will last for years and decadesis ian mcewans most famous novel an intense heartbreaking story about mistakes their power to ruin lives and the that might lead or not to forgiveness director joe wright after revisiting jane austen in pride and prejudice goes for another period piece this time set in prewwii england taking mcewans novel and the final result is just as provocative and moving as the book but favored by ravishing costume design that green dress worn by keira knightley is already a fashion icon seamus mcgarveys breathtaking cinematography an incredible art direction and dario marianellis captivating score for which he won the oscar all these elements are perfectly assembled by wright and help to create a bigger impact in the audiencewright relies on the work of oscar winner christopher hampton ad whilst he doesnt derail too much from the original source he achieves an emotionally compelling adaptation that keeps most of the moral dilemmas pointed out by mcewan such as how to make amends and for how long for something like briony did or is truly possible to forgive when the damage is too much brionys conflict is a tough one and even though her action can be perceived as vicious and mean shes not a bad person and as we can see she tries to fix things in her own wayto play briony through the years wright casts three actresses the first is saoirse ronan her oscarnominated breakthrough performance as the young briony a girl enthralled by writing and whose imagination leads to the dramatic confusion that will cause robbies disgrace then comes romola garai the adult briony the one who finally understands the consequences of her actions and finally vanessa redgrave as old briony at the end of her life ready to end her after living with the guilt all those years all of them provide brionys range of emotions with an adroit virtuosity also james mcavoy shines as robbie with an affecting turn we can feel his pain frustration and anger as hes sent to the war field and becomes a witness of the horror caused by it and keira knightley offers a really mature performance as ceciliais what can be distinguished as a beautiful ache you know itll hurt you but its inevitable to not watch due to its striking beauty,sad
after watching the film its hard for me to figure out how exactly to review the film in an honest way i do want to say though after seeing the film it made me want to read the book and thats saying a lot because i do love reading books before movies unless i didnt know a movie was based on a book to begin with such as this one and although the film was satisfying by itself it made me want to read what the story was based on to watch an innocent naive girl go through a series of emotionsinfatuation confusion jealousy guilt etc is an emotional rollercoaster that i enjoy the film is beautiful through the way it shows different perspectivesfrom brionys to robbie and cecilias the plot itself is tragic and heartbreaking and confusing in a lot of different ways and for someone who adores thinking and complex situation this film brings that part out of me it makes you question the idea of forgiveness and guilt and thats the type of stuff that i enjoy watchingreading anyone who enjoys something that causes you to think rather than just watching a film and just enjoying itthen this film is for you,sad
is a movie based on a 2001 novel of the same title by british author ian mcewan the book and film have three parts or they wind three stories into one first and no doubt the films big attraction is a love story second it has a very well done war segment third it is a story about a lie a grave injustice because of it and the tragic result in the lives of several people this last is the wrapping that bundles the three together one synopsis of the book says it is about understanding and responding to the need for personal it is that indeed and it shows what happens when one doesnt atone at 13 years of age briony tallis has a crush on robbie turner the son of the tallis familys longtime faithful housekeeper robbie is treated almost like a son in the tallis family he grows up close to brionys older sister cecilia briony sees robbie and cecilia together in a very seductive scene at the large fountain pool she later sees them together in the library some viewers think that she misinterprets this scene as robbie raping cecilia i rather think its a clear case of jealousy some earlier scenes of robbie scolding her and not paying attention to her bear this out later the young twins in the tallis home disappear and everyone goes looking for them briony stumbles onto a scene in which her brothers friend paul marshall is making love to her cousin lola marshall and lola had been making eyes at one another since he arrived briony runs back to the house and reports that she saw robbie molesting cousin lola she lies to get even with robbie who no longer pays much attention to her and who is in love with her sister in the film the family seems all too willing to accuse robbie and not doubt or question briony they didnt ask lola who it was robbie returns a short time later having found the twins himself and with one riding on his shoulders the family knows that briony has a vivid imagination in her story telling yet they accept robbies guilt without question based on her accusation this isnt very believable in the film the truth doesnt come out in a trial which the movie skips over briony would have to have lied again in testimony for the trial robbie is found guilty and sent to prison now the story begins to take on tones of briony having regrets over her lie her conscience bothers her she cant deny her guilt or what happens as a result of her lie but will she make as time goes on cecilia splits with the family robbie is released from prison to fight in world war ii and briony takes up nursing instead of going to cambridge robbie dies of wounds while waiting to be evacuated at dunkirk and cecilia is killed in a london subway station when german bombs fall on it we see other scenes as flashbacks of robbie and cecilia and briony but these arent real briony has made them up as a way to cope with her guiltthe last scene is decades later robbies mother and all the other tallis people have died only briony is left and shes now a famous novelist at this point vanessa redgrave plays the 77yearold briony she is going on television to explain her latest book its a fictional story she made up about robbie and cecilia getting back together in her tv interview she tells about her lie about robbie and its tragic results briony lives all of her life with the wrong she has done on her mind yet she has been unwilling to atone why means to make amends or reparation to one harmed that might be humiliating and its certainly humbling but its necessary for a clear conscience and peace of mind she didnt make amends to robbie and cecilia while they were alive and she could have at any time over those early years she didnt atone after their deaths while robbies mother and her own parents were still living she could have cleared robbie in their minds and hearts again she had many more years in which to do that but it would have been humiliating to her so she waited and waited until she was past and humiliation with those affectedone suspects that briony was sorry more for her own suffering than for that of all the others she affected she certainly wasnt atoning  because it was long after being able to make amends to those she hurt had she announced that all of her profits andor her estate would go to help broken families or some other justice cause or worthy charity it would be a different story she might have had a statue made of robbie as a wrongly accused victim who gave his life for his country but there was none of that just her word that she hoped her book at this late time in life might bring peace to robbie and cecilia  who have passed into eternity briony knew she was far too late to make any and although positing that she is honoring their memory by her fictitious book she glumly realizes that her lie will be in her memory and on her conscience to the end of her life vanessa redgraves face in the last scene longs for peace when she will no longer have to live with her lie for more on this i recommend the 2008 documentary bringing the past to life the making of,sad
it begins like a bbc period drama with a highsociety family taking vacation in their isolated country mansion then it turns into a sort of english  saving private ryan  and then it closes at old age so its really about a life testimony and this scope is well suited to the plot  fallout of a shameful act i imagine the pain it is to drag such a weight endlessly and to be unable to correct things whats is well done here its that the facts are told from different points of views and we cant say if its true or fiction  beyond this the feminine cast is really exceptional  young saoirse her mature version who looks like natalie imbruglia and for sure keira who proves with this movie she is an actress of amazing talent ,sad
so under appreciated i always wonder what goes in the mind of these reviewers the movie opens the heart the plots are amazing the screenplay is vibrant the repeated sound tracks give me goosebumps the tragedy leaves you wondering how marvelous the story was the protagonist played an amazing lively role a great story directed exactly the way it should be the long takes are stupendous its a magicians work i never had favorites after watching the movie i had one there is a saying there are certain emotions in your body that not even your best friend can sympathize with but you will find the right film or the right book and it will understand you  bjorka must watch novel based film happy watching,sad
2007 dir joe wright  cast james mcavoy keira knightley saoirse ronan vanessa redgrave harriet walter overwhelming period piece set in 1935 about guilt and the desire for salvation an adventurous girl accuses a housekeepers son of being a sex maniac after her cousin is raped to avoid jail he goes to war where he plans to journey back director joe wright deserves credit for capturing the time period although the screenplay is slightly faltered with the information plot twist that plays as a downer it does effectively play off the period for which the story takes place and stars actors that conjoin the ages effectively james mcavoy plays the accused with a torn reputation but a desire for reparation and survival in the hands of the war keira knightley plays the woman who still loves him and defends his honor when the accusations surface this is one of knightleys stronger roles as she knows the truth in her heart but cannot render it saoirse ronan plays the young playwright and accuser this is a terrific start to what will hopefully be great things to come for this bright young talent then vanessa redgrave makes a superb cameo that ties things together she is the ronan character in her senior years where she can only right things in her mind to counter the problems she caused fantastic film about guilt and that traumatic road to making amends score 9  10,sad
joe wright brings us a story about love about war and struggleby telling us the story distorted time and perspectivewise he charges every scene with possibilities and to a degree lets them stand on their own but the story develops staidly while also filling in the created gaps but dont worry there are a few unexpected twists and turns in store while i would have loved to see more of the relationship between robbie and cecilia i have to admit that this is not the focus of this story as the title suggestsas far as performances go everybody delivers in a way to not steal the limelight but create a great balance you will be hard pressed not to feel for the the 3 main characters and be moved by their struggle with themselves and this cruel mistress we call fateif you are not on a first date i feel it is my obligation to recommend this movie,sad
there is an audience for this type of thing frustrated females film critics and those that have the patience of the english the film is mounted like masterpiece theatre hallmark greeting cards and it is the mounting of a more personal nature that propels the story that spans years and the consequences that result from bearing false witnessthe angst of the story is that the false witness is beared by an egghead aspiring writer in her early teens and the guilt she carries as the lives of those she falsely witnessed are affected beyond repairsaoirse ronan who plays the girl gives the best performance and got an oscar nomination one of 7 the film received keira knightley has a face to die for her closeups are stunning and she delivers a good one too but james mcavoy is a bit stiff and expressionless most of the time benedict cumberbatch if you were wondering is peripheralspeaking of stunning the cinematography surely is but it is one of those look at me displays of natural beauty backdropped here for not much more than that it doesnt add much to the already awkward modern trend to timeshift and timeshift some more as facts and situations are withheld and then revealedif anyone thinks that quentin tarantino hasnt had a profound effect on films since he showed up with reservoir dogs 1992 needs to think again in this type of thing it comes off as belonging in another genre its too pretentiously clever for an upstairs downstairs story about snooty brits in the middle of the twentieth centurythe film is overrated because it feels like a parade of selfconsciousness using the aforementioned shifting and a banging typewriter as an instrument not only symbolic because main characters are writers but is pushed to become musical not the subtlety this type begs for much like the dunkirk scene as look at me as it gets want one more how about the heavy handed sex scene in the library get it this is about a writera moderately effective heart pump of a film for its target audience from a novel that has gained praise but if you feel you dont qualify for that audience it might be best to stay away from this because it is likely to disappoint and be a bore,sad
to get this out of the way the music is amazing brilliant it suits each scenes mood perfectly and the repetitive sounds like the typewriters buttons have been very intelligently connected with the music atsome points the music is incredibly annoying which is just perfectcongratulations to the composerswhen it comes to the story i found some problems the way the movies main plot is set in motion is a bit too silly and convenient its also like the movie itself is trying to separate the first act from the second and third ones with most notably a different directing approach i also got the feeling that the director watched requiem for a dream one too many times before shooting the first actthe overall plot is a bit predictable but theres no reason why it shouldnt be i enjoyed pretty much everything about this film and i think that its a really good one for its genreso overall the reasons its an eight are 1 the first act which i found too convenient 2 i find the film the whole genre in fact a bit pointless it does not offer new perspectives its not really thought provoking and it doesnt present a world we would like to go to or explore is just one of those quoteunquote sad movies however its probably the best one thats because of its strong ending the solid plot apart from the setup the likable characters the music as already said and one of its strongest aspects the themes it explores not just love family war and the like but also some stronger and much less presented like well you guessed itin conclusion my vote for is between 7 and 8 i eventually settled to 8 because of the music,sad
i believe truthfulness is truly important this movie has changed me for the better now i realize the circumstances of not telling the truth how it affects other peoples lives and my own i was taught that accusing someone for something they did not commit is worse than actually killing someone nobody should be punished for something without a true reason the love story between the main characters is epic i am not afraid to compare it with the epic love story of titanic personally i think it is even better the feel is intensely real because james mcavoy and keira knightley showed it in their eyes i can sense the sorrows of the characters they achieved their best trying to live out the characters i almost forgot that it was just a movie i got overly emotional at most of the parts i swear i almost wet my shirt because of my tears it was just too emotional for me i hated briony but that just shows how good of an actress saorsie is i felt like stabbing her if i could she was the cause of all the misfortune anywaybravo epic love story,sad
i recently watched this movie again after several yearsin our household we are always distressed with the shallow selection of movies currently being made we often say why so much trash watching this work of art demonstrates that sometimes a movie can be accurately portray the literary beauty of a well written screen playin this effort never mind the great acting never mind the lack of special affects or adrenaline pumping action the movie gets down to things we all experience in life regret it allows a sober reelection of ones life while the consequences of mistakes vary we all make them and we all suffer from themthis is a well written story and even if the book is better like they always are this effort is superb and worth the retelling and rewatching again and again,sad
i liked this movie because of the telling manner in which it highlights two important themes of life in the world the first is the danger that is fraught in being judgmental more so from a moral or religious standpoint that was the mistake briony made in being too hasty to judge robbie the second is how the beliefs and actions of one person can alter the lives of so many others briony ruined two innocent lives by her deficient understanding and action come to think of it how many lives are altered by the stupid actions of parents relatives teachers and even people we do not know personally such as politicians by the same token actions performed in the light of good understanding benefit so many others this goes to show how intimately the mass of humanity is interconnected and why it is so important to encourage wisdom and truth in the world,sad
with complete honesty i didnt expect much of this movie but as soon as it began i was completely hooked saoirse ronan did a wonderful job as young briony and kiera knightley and james mcavoys acting was out of this world every moment of the movie led to the ending which was heartwrenchingly painful to see props to everyone involved creating this piece and all the actors were superbi dont think i have anything else to add to the other reviews other than please watch this moviei cant watch movies again too soon but ill definitely be rewatching in a few months time,sad
the last few minutes or sentences suddenly change your mood and make you very sad when she said  she never made a journey to balham where her sister cecilia lived due to her cowardliness and when she said  because in fact robbie turner die in france and they have not time to get togetherbut graphically poor when school girls laid down dead on ground this was not looking originally dead they seemed like sleeping because girls clothes neat and clean and very low blood spot on their facesshore scene was amazing and heart touchingone last scene which make me mad and romantic was the scene of the bus stop where she left him and both saw each other last time robbie turner ran to see her,sad
the film starts out with the sounds of a typewriter and a doll housea man is falsely accused of raping a little girl evidence relies on the testimony of a confused girl who was probably influenced by the class of the actual rapist and confusion over the relationship between the accused and the witnesss sister to avoid prison the accused robbie james mcavoy joins the british expeditionary force he eventually dies in northern france the sister of the accused cecilia keira kinghtley also has a difficult time shes angry at how her family handles the case and goes off on her own to london here shes killed in the blitz the story is told through the perspective of the little girl as she has grown old and writes a novel as form of repentance she was never able to set her false testimony straight i really got into this movie i loved the pictures of the english countryside and the cliffs of dover it was easy to get a dreamy state with the idyllic pond and huge wildflowers this put my hard down so that the scenes of battle carnage were all the stronger and more powerful the beautiful tuxedos of the wealthy class at the beginning made the dirty faces and the cockney accent of one of the soldiers all the more cruel and hard i rarely enjoy romances as theyre often too sentimental as though the only people that feel affection are halfwits that choose to beget a bunch of spawn and live in the suburbs many of us are screwed over by lies and apathy this film shows that but it also shows a ferris wheel and kisses such that the gritty image was arguably trueits another great performance of the beautiful keira knightley and levelheaded james mcavoy,sad
in england 1935 before the war a noble woman cecilia and a menial man robbie was in love one day cecilias little sister named briony finds their unusual behaviors by chance and misunderstands their relation that night an incident happens and briony charge robbie falsely before i watched this movie i had thought this is a story of a sad love between cecilia and robbie of course it is an important theme of this movie after i watched the whole story i was more impressed with the scenes of war in the latter story the three each have to do with the war and see the disastrous sights with their own eyes the pictures are terribly realistic and i was creep while watching the scenes cecilia and robbie suffers because of their parting briony suffers from the weight of her guilt the refrain of the sound of typewriter and images of water emphasized the impressions of sorrows,sad
cecilia and robbie who is her servants son love each other but briony who is sister of cecilia mistake robbie for a rapist and he get arrestedi like james mcavoy and keira knightley so i watched this movie but i felt bad for this movie becayse briony doesnt understand anything but she make mention with whimsical speculation and he is arrested its a terrible thingit is impolite to lead other peoples letter on her own children should not dive deep into love between men and women i like james so i felt emotionally stressed,sad
it had a amazing fantastic setupbut thenfell flat what i liked the replay of scenes from a different perspective if you werent paying attention youd be in the dark great looking film solid performanceswhat i didnt obvious misdirection  i cant help feel this lie wouldve been investigated and cleared in less than four years furthermore the explanation as to why is silly bleak why not a happy ending or betterwhy not go even bleaker having read others reviews on the book it seems the books ending wouldve given briony a more harsher sentencei genuinely wanted to love this movie in fact i wish i wouldve seen it in theaters i think the experience wouldve been different i think i wouldve been more immersed in the tragedy of the story as it were i found myself easily distracted when the lie snowballed into brionys sad desperate attempt at,sad
i found it difficult to decide on how to rate this movie so i felt obligated to explain a bit the seeming mediocrity that my six stars rating conveyshaving just finished the book i watched eager to see the novel come to life realistically a book of this magnitude filled with such lush and lavishly descriptive narrative would not fit into a two hour movie it likely would not even fit into a five hour epic of the bbc pride  prejudice variety that being said i could not help feeling as though so much that made the book so remarkable was simply glanced over or not included at all in the movie i wonder what the virgin viewer who has not read the book would make of the characters depths and motives without having had the opportunity to read mcewans nuanced character portrayals in the novel formthat being said i think the movie itself stands on its own rather well in spite of certain small liberties taken with the plot in order to make it a cohesive story that lasts the expected two hours possible spoiler alert in particular while the last settingepilogue of the book reveals and details the lives of the characters very neatly and precisely i must say that i appreciated the impact of the films ending in the form of the author interview,sad
its possible to consider atomement as one of ian mcewans most conventional novels but with its elusive plot and shifting perspectives it depends very much on the authors characteristically precise prose to hold it together therefore i had my doubts about a film billed as a romantic epic and indeed there are moments when a little less in the way of lush stirring music might have been a good thing but for the most part it captures the tone of the novel well and through this succeeds in maintaining its coherence although the section set in france feels a little adrift overall i feel much the same about it as i did about the book its a clever subtle exploration of feelings and motives yet its almost as if its lacking the climactic scene i think this is mcewans point that in real life this scene as often as not never takes place i certainly preferred it in both its forms to enduring love another of mcewans novels adapted for the screen,sad
universal studios and working title films prestige picture of 2007 with its sights on the award season it was the second film of an upandcoming director joe wright showing that keira knightley is more then a blockbuster star and showing its a good example of british filmmakerin 1935 in the country estate of a upperclass british family cecilia tallis keira knightley starts to succumb to feelings for robbie turner james mcavoy a family friend whom parents helped through school and university but from a lower class in the space of one day they finally give in but their time is short cecilias younger sister briony saoirse ronan sees the events of cecilia and robbie but misunderstands what happens because of the events of her imagination and misunderstanding she ends up accusing robbie of a horrid crime after five years robbie is serving in the army in northern france he had finally rekindled his relationship with cecilia who became a nurse and exiled from her family they are separate when he ends has to serve in evacuation of dunkirk briony romola garai now 18 gives up the chance to go to cambridge and trains to be a nurse she tries to fool herself about what she saw but suffers guilt and wants to be amends for her actionsthis is a well structured directed and acted film it tells a compelling story about how a misunderstanding can alter the course of some peoples lives it also acts a commentary about class relations with upper classes looking down on others no matter how educated a lower class person may be they is the ideas between truth and imagination which could alter reality it also offers a look on the british army in dunkirk and wartime londonchristopher hampton writes a well structured screenplay showing the different elements of the story and with joe wrights direction makes it a wellcrafted and does not tell it in a linear style wright shows his skill as a director with excellent editing an effective tone and some brilliant shots one true moment of genius is showing the british army on the beaches of dunkirk wright would have been worthy of an oscar nodthere is a good cast for this film saoirse ronan was nominated for best supporting actress and she is clearly an actress to watch out for keira knightley shows that she is more then elizabeth swann from the pirates film or domino harvey in the awful domino she is trying to prove herself as a proper actress she does a decent job here but for me the main star was james mcavoy in the strongest performance i have seen him in he was one oscar worthy film and should have been nominatedthere are some moments that dont work examples are some characters do acts a little too dumb and a surreal sequences in the middle of the film did not seem to fit with the rest ofhowever a worthy film for film fans,sad
though not the great film some would have you believe still has quite a bit going for it for example it made me want to learn more about the dunkirk evacuation and much more about the events leading up to wwii alas this is essentially a romance and the historical perspective and details take a back seat to weepy longings and misunderstandings caused by jealousy the film looks terrific and the acting is more than satisfactory where the film goes wrong has to do mostly with its inability to sell the characters motivationsthe story deals with a mousy tween girl accusing her older sisters lover of a sexual assault from there he is sent to prison and then finds himself serving in the british army in the early stages of wwii all the while the two sisters have given up their wealthy lifestyles to work as nurses as the elder sister longs for the return of her beau while the younger sister wishes to atone for her lie by saving lives and hopefully one day reconciling with the starcrossed lovers as one can tell this is the type of plot that grows inside a romance novel apparently the novel this film is based on is quite wellregarded if that is the case then i might suspect that much of that book never made it the the screenthere are problems all throughout how this film is constructed a viewer who doesnt let themselves get blinded by the sentimentality will question much of what they see what on earth could be the little girls motivation for seeing the young man blamed for such a terrible crime and never speaking up for all those years to clear his name not realistic the film seems to be channeling the movie cold mountain in some ways we have two young lovers who hardly have much between them except a tryst in a library and now separated by war the woman can only look to the horizon and repeat a phrase about wanting him to come back silly the first act seems needlessly drawn out and full of contrivances the rest of the film feels a bit truncated trying to catch up the the present after the last few years of these characters lives have happened off screen what was prison like for ronny what was the fallout like between the sisters did celia try to clear his name what was his trial like all of these things could have made for some interesting viewing are they detailed in the book the film does have some good selling points good acting great period costumes and props and the 5 minute unbroken scene along the beach is just as incredible as advertised i wish the rest of the film could have been that good 6 of 10 starsthe hound,sad
joe wright has presented a film that would sit comfortably in the merchant and ivory stable it looks great on the screen the actors accents could cut through fridge cold butter and the class system rules ok  im not a great fan of keira knightley but she is perfect in the role of the simpering cecilia her upper class angst is well played out against the rogueish imp that is the role of robbie who is the working class lad made good played by james mcavoy his flawed conviction heats up the viewers satisfaction when robbie and cecilia are finally reunited only to find that a further ride is required on the emotional rollercoaster as an elderly briony cecilias younger sister imparts the lie of the tale in the final pay off i almost weeped myself there are few faults with this film although the time switch and mix between reality and imagination in certain scenes is slightly disconcerting this is especially so in the first scene of this kind where briony watches cecilia and robbie having some very unacceptable behaviour by a fountain which when replayed proves to be a different view on reality and sets the tone for robbies later fate the mix between reality and dreams is basically the theme of the film brionys imaginings of her life with robbie which leads to her spiteful slight on his character which in turn leads to his imprisonment and through a chain of events finally to a sad death in dunkirk likewise the fate that befell cecilia who having obviously turned her back on a family who betrayed robbie probably would have continued to live a fairly steady existence in the country finds herself the victim of an air raid even briony doesnt escape although the novel which is the inter film source for the actual film acts as a final confessional before she leaves the mortal coil her death is nigh and also unpleasant in the form of dementia recommended for those who are prepared to stick with a film and watch it slowly unwind itself at its own pace 810,sad
prepare to immerse into a very passionate emotional journey that doesnt end at least for a few days after watching this movie the climax cant be any better i dont really get emotional watching movies but this movie stirs your emotions inside out i consider this movie to be the best drama i have ever seen the actors did a superb job the cinematography is excellent and the overall movie is just exemplaryif havent watched this movie yet you are certainly missing something in life i know it is a very strong statement to make but honestly i think this movie deserves all the praises,sad
on the background of a terribly violent second world war seen through the eyes of the young innocent soldiers a story of passion and guilt is portrayed with elegance but also strong intensity a very good photography together with closeup shooting and the use of refined and impressive details i cant get keira knightleys wonderful green dress off my mind contribute to an effective visual impact there is a taste for figurative art for example the love scene in the library is for a moment fixed on the two lovers leaned against the bookshelves in a sort of chiaroscuro painting passionate and refined at the same time the handling of the whole story may appear too melodramatic and unrealistic but i think it is the result of a precise choice by the director due to his conception of art in terms of expectations from the public and this is also evident in the final revelation the idea that the work of art being it a novel or a movie should provide the reader or the viewer with something unattainable in real life representing but transcending reality playing with time situations and endings obviously the moment comes when we have to go back to hard facts and the last scenes starring vanessa redgrave whose uncontroversial talent makes the difference remind us of this when she enters the scene the emotional and visual climax of the movie is reached her wrinkled face with her wonderful blue eyes could speak by themselves truly astonishing the whole movie is very well performed keira knightley playing cecilia and james mcavoy playing robbie are attractive and seductive by themselves and when paired spread pure chemistry all around also the girl playing the young briony tallis seems very promising,sad
2007  out of  directed by joe wright with keira knightley james mcavoy saoirse ronan and vanessa redgrave spectacular drama about confusions where two lovers  mcaboy and knightley find lost when the war begins colorful with spectacular narrative technique a lot of twists first rate performances and masterful filming specially in a continued beautiful beach scene nomitated for 7 oscar just won one for best original score based on ian mcewan novel one of the years best,sad
i had no idea what this film was going to be about having heard nothing of the book and seen no trailers what a pleasant surprise this was a thoughtful and at times rather sad piece with some strong acting keira knightleys new lover is accused falsely of a terrible crime and carted off to jail eventually ending up in the army during world war two as an alternative to staying in prison the film chronicles the breakdown in knightleys relationship with her younger sister who had accused the lover the mood is pretty bleak at times and the film ends on a surprising note for someone unaware of the book the sense of desperation experienced by soldiers at dunkirk was well captured not a film i would traditionally go for but well worth the time,sad
i didnt think a film has been made to promote a trailer before but if one was this was it seriously lacking in the screenplay department very little character development and a pointless kind of narrative drive that reveals itself in the end i really enjoyed the first 13 of the film but after it went off to war and then into a dreamlike lala land and then ruining itself in the end i found most of the information pointless now ill be perfectly clear i understood the meaning of the film i understood its called for a reason and that the character of the girl and her evolution was really what the film was about it was really a story about her fiction and her guilt and coming to grips with it by making up another lie in a way but seriously then why not focus a little bit more screen time on the girl growing up then instead of pointlessly following james mcavoy around for near and hour in one of the most mindnumbingly loud and obnoxious series of long takes ive ever seen every one says oh the book is so emotional nothing could compare to it no adaptation could come close and youre right but this movie errvery long string of awesome cinematography doesnt come close to so many other of its contemporaries i knew i was supposed to feel something for all of these characters but i just wanted the film to be focused more on them and less on the editor cinematographer and director patting themselves on the back i liked pride  prejudice even though i was dead set against it i can understand why some critics would like this and compare to that besides the same creative team being behind both but no one will remember this film the trailer is the film the film is the trailer there isnt a whole lot more to say than that,sad
i thought was a giant step backwards for joe wright this was a film i was eager to see i enjoyed pride  prejudice the first 40 minutes of were sensational the last hour plus was extremely disappointingthe beautiful pacing and energy and heart of the film left once james mcavoy was arrested that 10 minute stedicam thru war carnage was pretentious and brought the film to a grinding halt it never recovered fromgreat acting by mcavoy not so much anyone else i usually love keira knightly but she is horribly miscast 100 unbelievableit pains me to write all thisi think all this oscar talk is nothing but the films and actors publicity people working overtime the movies 2 hours long and it felt like 4 i cant see anyone talking about this film in fact im guessing there wont be many who turn out at all,sad
in l p hartleys the gobetween a young boy in edwardian england is sexually and emotionally scarred when he catches the two people he most admires in flagrante having already acted as gobetween carrying notes from one lover to the other in a young girl of similar age is similarly scarred in a similar fashion having been emotionally betrayed by two of the people she most admires in both cases notes are involved though the actions of briony in prove more devastating in the endalthough somewhat different in tone and structure and setting from the l p hartley novel and joseph loseys subsequent film ian mcewans and this terrific film version by joe wright moves very much in the same ballpark they would make a fascinating doublebill both deal with betrayal loss and regret and quite directly with issues of class in both the sexual relationship is between an upperclass girl and a workingclass boy so far so much the same but while the gobetween contented itself with the relationship between the protagonists and its fallout and left it there mcewan goes furtherit begins in 1935 in an england already preparing for war and after the initial events that set the plot in motion moves forward to dunkirk and its aftermath there is also a coda set in the present day something else it has in common with the gobetween and the dunkird sequences are neither mere plot contrivance nor windowdressing but a direct comment on the horrors of war brionys crime placed in a much wider historical and social context and in this film version the whole dunkirk sequence works in the most powerful and surreal way imaginable a tracking shot through the chaos is particularly stunning although seemingly divorced from the events that preceded it these two halves of the film work beautifully together and brionys realization of what she has done in the past in superbly conveyed in romola garais performance indeed in a film full of great moments and perfectly sustained sequences its greatest coup lies in the casting of the three actresses who play briony saoirse ronan as the naive uncomprehending child garai as the emotionally shallow young woman and finally in a magnificent cameo vanessa redgrave as the much much older briony finally achievingbut the film isnt total perfection when briony walks away from her reunion with robbie and cecilia i felt strangely unmoved just as the sequences in dunkirk left me unmoved they are magnificently done but where i asked myself is the feeling in so far as it goes you cant fault joe wrights direction or the burning intelligence of christopher hamptons screenplay intellectually you certainly feel engaged but emotionally you may feel shortchangedperhaps the fault lies in the casting of james mcavoy who makes robbie a very cold fish he is very good however at capturing the boys cocksure arrogance but then the film redeems itself in its closing moments and the emotional punch packed into that final sequence more than makes up for what i felt was missing earlier it could have been sentimental but wright never allows it to trip over into such saccharine territory and again this may be down to casting vanessa redgrave is so overwhelmingly good in her final monologue she almost throws you offbalance this is a great performance by a great actress even if it only lasts a few moments hopefully when the film is showered with oscar nominations next february she will not be overlooked,sad
i should at least start with what the movie does right as many others have cited the cinematography and settings are extraordinarily well done plainly a lot of money and care went into that the score is also evocative and is very well matched to scene and the use of the typewriter as percussion is nothing short of brilliant the movie is also very well cast and the actors top to bottom do a very good job of portraying the characters and script they were given now thats aside lets review the romantic leads have their happiness shattered by a jealous little snippet and they never get it back each dying in cruel fashionthe molested girl marries her pedophilic rapistthe aforementioned snippet never does actually atone only coming clean when shes dying and has nothing left to lose decades after the revelations would have done anyone any good and even then has a problem with the truthyou also have the constant flashbacks some in near realtime which after the first bit of briony looking at the fountain scene are far more irritating than evocative by an hour into the flick we were downright scowlingtoss in titanicesquire ripoffs like floating dead ladies a few anachronisms lancasters in 1935 blowing the date of the barham tube disaster no constant strafing at dunkirk and sorry but another reviewer was dead on the starcrossedloversinwartime thing has been done before and far better of course the academy fawned all over it but i see no reason to do so myself510 and only for the things it did right,sad
now i loved the story behind this film howeveri did not like the way it was unbalanced there was too much of robbie and not much of cecilia i also did not like the way the elderly briony was included into it i would have preferred to have seen the ending as broiny refereed to in her bookit was to anticlimatic knowing that they both did not survive the war and yet the film ends with them walking on the beachi did really enjoy the cast choice i felt that they conveyed their characters really well i also enjoyed the beginning of the movie it ran very smoothly and there were no bits i did not feel went wrong overall it was an okay movie but there are things i would of changed,sad
visuals and cinematography are mostly what carry this film although the acting is good the problem is how much one must suspend ones common sense to be satisfied with this film the main plot line for the girl briony works well but its almost as if we see all the other characters and plot lines through a 13yearolds mind albeit a precocious 13yearold adults act as if they were all characters in her play a play with characters like mindless pawns rather than intelligent educated human beings the central crisisthat a 13yearolds testimony would be sufficient to override all evidence of innocence and divert the authorities from considering other possible suspectsis just not believablea truly great film like a great book is worthy of being mulled over fails that test,sad
a person watching this film for the first time will not only be struck by the full extent of the monumentally heartbreaking though somewhat consoling ending but upon watching for the second or third time they will find themselves unreservedly choked up and on the verge of tears a mere 30 minutes into the film now burdened with the curse of foresight some may even wish as filmgoers often do during repeat viewings for some minor and consciously impossible alteration in the film in hope of a different conclusion perhaps a happier one even at the result of a lesser filmbut collectively depressing ending and all is an absolute gem of a production that spares no expense as an original and surprising tragedy to be treasured greatly whats more it is certainly the best work to date of director joe wright whose faithful yet refreshingly vibrant adaptation of the jane austen classic pride  prejudice in 2005 is surpassed by this incredible spectacle he has in what must have been a long arduous and demanding process not made one misstep in this romantic epic beginning with screenwriter christopher hamptons detailed and intimate script which successfully transformed author ian mcewans hardgoing narrative into an intriguing dialog ridden film dario marianellis the composer behind the academy award nominated score of pride  prejudice award winning score is also a great quality of often independently defining stages of the film and existing as a contribution to many scenes in its own right at times a poignant orchestral ballad of sentimentality that plucks longingly at the audiences heartstrings at others an eerie piano melody reminiscent of the xfiles theme song laced heavily by a monotonously clicking typewriter that only truly makes sense at the films conclusionexceptional casting prevails james mcavoy casts aside his broad scottish roots to bring out an achingly pitchperfect performance of the british upperlowerclass robbie a young man whose youth naivety and notions of love are all shattered by his false imprisonment for rape in a suitable choice by joe wright keira knightley the lead elizabeth bennet in wrights pride  prejudice delivers well as the mature but still pensively idealistic cecilia tallis she is in the films earlier stages stubborn and aggravating in her attempts to snobbishly disregard her affections for robbie purely due to his social status once her temperament towards him relaxes however the tense misinterpreted feelings of separation for her are in turn forgotten a true performer is uncovered in the casting of 13yearold saoirse ronan as briony tallis who perceives and hence captures the true essence of a confused and impressionable youngster often without even speaking offering merely an expression or quizzical flicker in her eyes she immerses herself in the role beyond even ian mcewans own expectations calling her remarkable thankfully her successors at different stages of brionys life romola garai at 18 vanessa redgrave at 77 are just as well equipped to establish interesting and clearly developed aspects of this characters mysterious personalityfinally after alluding to the ending of throughout the entirety of this review it would probably be appropriate to offer a direct synopsis of the conclusion briony age 18 visits cecilia at her london flat where she as is briony herself is working as a nurse for the wwii effort robbie having returned from an imposed service at dunkirk is there also briony has decided to make this appearance so as to be confronted about her misdeeds and apologise to them both for the trouble she has caused hoping to quench her guiltan interesting note in an interview regarding cast member keira knightley stated that briony feels the need to relieve this guilt she has whether or not she is guilty she feels guilt is it true perhaps that because brionys actions were those of an unwitting child then she cannot be truly held accountable for her actions but still be expected to acknowledge these sins contritely and atone for them as any adult would morality issue what are the ethical parameters to which guilt is applied hmmm anyway they both lecture her accordingly robbie more aggressively than cecilia and instruct her to undo the wrong shes done and clear robbies name by informing the authorities and anyone involved with the rape incident the true identity of the perpetrator this holds with it its own complications but the confrontation concludes on somewhat amiable grounds although robbie and cecilia maintain that they wish to never see briony againfastforward 60 years briony 77 years old has become a renowned author and is being interviewed on her latest novel which is semiautobiographical and in fact to be her last work of literature although she claims it is also conversely her first as she has been writing it since she was a teenager the novel is then revealed to be the setting for the entire film so far mimicking brionys actual life in almost every way apart from the ending she divulges restraining her emotional disposition as much as possible that she never was actually able to work up the courage to visit cecilia and robbie to apologise in reality robbie succumbed to septicaemia while awaiting evacuation on a beach in dunkirk and cecilia drowned in the notorious balham tube station flooding they never were reunited there love left unfulfilledbut here author mcewan and screenwriter hampton demonstrate some of the most poignant logic ever told of tragedy no one could possibly benefit from this ending what could be gained from concluding such a romantic struggle so definitively so depressingly and so for the sake of her sisters and robbies love briony changed the outcome and gave them what they were owed what she took from them she gave them their lost time together to love and be loved by each other the way they truly deservednow thats an ending,sad
once again the british get it right maybe there was just too many good films and good performances last year but i like seeing this film get recognized not only as one of the best but the performances of james mcavoy and keira knightley getting recognition also yes saoirse ronan was great as a supporting actress but i cannot understand how the academy could ignore mcavoy and knightleyof course the film would not be as good as it was were it not for the brilliant cinematography the music and the absolutely perfect sets all under the brilliant direction of joe wrightthis was an amazing romantic story with a twist at the end that knocked me out of my seat it was just brillianti keep getting more and more impressed by knightley and enjoy seeing her and her roles mature,sad
while it didnt hold as much power for me when viewed on dvd compared to a theatre viewing this is still an excellent work from director joe wright i have read ian mcewans beautifully written but nearly impossible to film novel and wright really does an amazing job in bringing it to the screen i have to argue with both camps who say its either about atoning for past wrongs or the perspective of the writer great works of literature and great films are rarely concerned with just one central theme there are so many amazing parts to this film and things to think about the acting from an ensemble cast is throughly excellent the young actress playing briony got the oscar nomination but its redgrave who really ties the threads together and her appearance packs a huge emotional punch that said romola garai one of my favourites is unnervingly perfect as briony too knightley is growing into a better actress in leaps and bounds with each film and mcavoy is the perfect robbiei still think that the famous onetake beach scene is a piece of showy direction but it doesnt really detract from the film overall the film begins sort of like a merchantivory production and i love those films with rich and beautiful english characters pondering over life while smoking copious amounts of cigarettes which may be offputting for some viewers but it becomes something different entirely and it really is wonderful my favourite scene mcavoy and knightleys brief encounter in the tea shop so poignant,sad
despite the critical accolades and awards i found this movie quite disappointing based on a novel by ian mcewan and directed by joe wright who had filmed the latest movie version of pride and prejudice much inferior to the bbc miniseries the bulk of the movie occurs in a british country house during one day in the mid 1930s in which a crime might have happened of might have just been the figment of the imagination of a fevered child the main characters will feel for years the consequences of what happened that day since im totally uninterested on the life of englands upper classes i was quite bored during a lot of the movie and as if that wasnt enough the final twist of the movie in which vanessa redgrave has a cameo role is totally insulting and makes the viewer feels cheated the engaging presence of keira knightley and newcomer saoirse ronan are among the movies few assets on the other hand the much praised scene set during the evacuation at dunkirk is very showoffy in my opinion,sad
in 1930s england robbie is the son of a cleaning woman who has fallen in love with his mothers masters daughter his childhood friend on the same night where they reveal their love to each other robbie is accused by the womans younger sister of a rape he didnt commit robbie is sent to jail and off to fight world war ii and for the remainder of the film the two lovers try to reunite while the younger sister comes to term with the horrible mistake she made that tore her family apartlet me be honest up front i had a very minimal interest in this film i was mildly interested by its oscar aspirations 7 nominations and then i was slightly more interested when my friend chelsea expressed interest with whom i ended up seeing it a chick flick starring keira knightley who to me is a younger classier winona ryder not my first choice although i went to go see i know who killed me so my instincts arent always he greatest anyway point being  i saw this film halfheartedly and really liked itthe beginning is really strong and interesting and surprisingly funny the involvement of a certain curse word one of the more notorious ones plays a big part and was funny in a somewhat awkward way after the opening the tone of the film turned decidedly darker which youd expect with a film about war and rape i guess emotionally the film runs strong all the way through working with loneliness and casualties of war theres a scene later on with a dying french soldier that doesnt shy from showing the realities of warworth singling out is a very long continuous shot maybe 8 or 9 minutes of english troops on the shores of france we see troops singing troops destroying jeeps troops shooting horses and much more to get this all in one shot is a major feat the last long shot i recall is in children of men which ran about maybe 6 minutes but with much less going on to coordinate the choreographer or whoever deserved the oscar if anyone did although in the end it only won a single award  for best original soundtrack which i dont recall as being a particularly standout scorei think the film closed rather weakly after all the quality emotion i cant really explain more without revealing things but its still a good film only maybe losing a point from this closing if youre a fan of period pieces or tough romance stories this is no romantic comedy this is for you i dont know if i could watch it again  its good enough but a bit emotional but im glad i saw it at least once and you should see it too,sad
i wouldnt say its a bad movie it just doesnt live up to all the craze it brought aboutthis movie just never gets you hooked but is rather one long big yawn the characters however are brilliantly performed and keira knightey albeit not as good as she usually is still achieves a remarkable performancethe thing is theres just nothing going on in this movie the whole flashback thing just ticked me off especially in the story i didnt see the pointoh yeah kudos for the actress playing the 13yearold girl she truly makes you want to blow her brains outthis is somewhat of a letdown considering how much i liked movies such as pride and prejudice and the notebook,sad
this film did not get a lower score simply because of james mcavoy he carried what little part of this film that he could keira was not a believable as a young woman caught in a deeply passionate love for robbie she played cecelia as if robbie was a passing fancy and nothing more i just didnt feel the passion in their relationship so to me this was a boring movie i could have done without the extra footage of keira lounging around her vanity smoking cigarettes it seemed like they were filming a chanel commercial most of the time with keira i am glad i saw the movie so that i can complain if this movie actually wins any academy awards for acting directing or best picture,sad
well i rarely call a movie pretentious but i make an exception now an annoying repetitive piano score a constant mix of long and short shots well not constant but when it happened it was very irritating and a script thats completely incoherent the writers seem to have forgotten about a little thing called act 2 you basically have a very long opening act where you dont really get to know the characters and then it just keeps ending one drama after another that is supposed to affect usbut how can it there is absolutely no connection between the characters and the audience about the actingjames mcavoy was quite good he confirms his excellent performance in the last king of scotland and romola garai and vanessa redgrave were decent too although they got way too little screen time imo keira knightley however was terrible ive never considered her to be a bad actress but her performance in this shouldve been better she got such a big role and so much screen time and she doesnt manage to even affect the audience a totally forgettable film im afraidto end on a positive note id like to mention the great locations one very impressive onetake long shot in dunkerke several minutes long mcavoys great performance and one scene that is very powerful and almost heartbreaking6210,sad
omg i havent seen the movie yet but my sister told me all about it and i cant believe that they never meet each other againits so sad i love jamesrobbie and i completely hate briony only if she told the truth robbie would not of died but cecilia most of likely would of died with robbieone of the saddest moviesnow pride and prejudice has a happy ending i just cant believe iti found out about it last night and i starting crying when i found outi was in an incandescently happy mood before she told me never mind that so if u love romancewar dramasad movies this is completely the one for you i just hope u will enjoy the movie kellbell,sad
i saw yesterdayi was stunned till the last minute of the moviei was hoping for a happy endingi cried so much in the endmcavoy performance is absolutely the best ever theres no rival to such an acting its perfecti wanted him to get an oscar for the last king of scotland because he was the one who made the movie a great onehis emotions are so real i loved every minute of i saw it 3 times i learned a good lesson from itthe way we perceive things isnt always enough to make judgments i was like briony as a little girl i used to write stories i was like her in every way but when i grew up i learned that i perceived things somehow in a wrong way i didnt expect anyone to write a bad review about this tremendous movieits a classic its pure artthe expressionseverythingmy favorite scene is when he was dreaming that he wished none of this has happened its really sadhe was dreaming of becoming a doctorhe is an honest person  a loyal mani wish with all my heart that the oscar would go to mcavoy i want to see more and more of such performancesits high level when i saw it yesterday i said to my friends the standard this year is so far better than last yearthis movie is simply great with no flawsi think we should recommend movies that touch our hearts not our eyes with blood shots and thriller moves,sad
i just saw this film last night at a test screening in chicago and i must say that it was fantastic the visuals and acting are both superb the story is absolutely devastating though there are quite a few bright spots i really felt for all of the characters there is one absolutely fantastic shot that goes on for nearly 10 minutes of robbie walking around a british army camp it really made you realize the absolute devastation that europe was enduring the scenes in the hospital are just as devastating i more than likely will see this film again not just because i am a fan of keira knightley and james mcavoy but because it was a really high quality film i highly recommend seeing this film,sad
in my home town we have a phase for films like and that is down from the hill this refers to those predominately middle class folk who come down from the topend of town to make their 1 or 2 annual visits to our local cinema and always to watch films like this past films that have fallen into this category have included such worthy but rather dull films as the english patient gosford park pride and predudice etc  ie those films that tend to fall into the english heritage mode of film making this years movie to satisfy their need is but for once this is a film that to my mind is actually very goodthe film is very cleverly structured and this adds to the understanding of why certain decisions by certain people are taken leading to a train of events which pull you the viewer along to a quite superb ending  which i have no intention of giving away here needless to say the acting is uniformly excellent especially from the younger members of the cast the psychological side of the film is also wonderfully handled and i felt genuinely moved by what i saw on the screeni feel sure that this film will do well at the oscars  not that i pay any attention to any awards  and for once it is a film that deserves all the praise it is getting,sad
a touching story of contemporary tragedy is a great conceptsadly this film just doesnt translate such a story well enough failing in various areas so strongly that it managed to ruin the entire films feeling for methe story progresses with a sluggish pace and unwarranted jumps too often detract from continuityoften i felt the film was trying to force me to feel something rather than immersing me in its storyoften you are exposed to drama that seems to try to shock you or move you in some way but at the time it is out of context then the film ungracefully jumps back to give context to the dramathe characters gain context via these unwarranted jumps as well but the film does not convey the feeling forcing you to follow these jumps to tie everything together in the very endand even though the ending sequence is very touching and memorable a lot of potential with very well rendered scenes very nice acting just goes to waste through the sluggish story pace and the unwarranted jumps forward backward true false better worsein the end i felt as if i had been bombarded with a sequence of incoherent feelings that just didnt tie up with the end result rather than drawing me in to suffer and feel next to the characters of the story i felt empty and distanced from them instead and felt sad that so much great potential was wasted with this film,sad
this was a very frustrating movie to watch flash backs flash forwards darkly lit scenes difficult to identify characters and out of sequence shots supposedly for some sort of artistic effect the biggest problem by far was the dialog all characters mumbled their lines french was spoken in several scenes and the subtitles provided were of such small type i had to continually hit the stopframe button and press my face toward the screen to read it by the the time i got to the end of the movie i still was unable to sort out what happened too bad guess i will just have to read the book to figure out the story line i regret the money spent for this dvd surely producers can do a better story telling job than this,sad
2007  keira knightley james mcavoy saoirse ronan brenda blethyn harriet walter ramola garai vanessa redgrave excellent adaptation of ian mcewans best selling novel about an unlikely love triangle set in wwii europe involving mistaken feelings unspoken secrets and the titular curse for its main characters newcomer ronan is an amazing find as the young girl who turns things topsyturvy for her older sister knightley in her best role to date and lover mcavoy equally good  the welltodo familys handyman when a communication breakdown sends the three into a decades long whirlwind with heartbreaking end results filmmaker joe wright and screenwriter christopher hampton make the familiar storyline something bright and new and surprisingly humorous and expectedly haunting but the length is a tad padded particularly the battle sequences at dunkirk but overall a well produced sad love story,sad
i watched this film and when i stopped watching it i was amazed by the pure beauty of it expressed in how it was shot acted and the environmentfilms like are rare and it deserves every award it is nominated and i will be shocked if it doesnt receive an awardi like keira knightley as an actress anyway but this film tops her career off but james mcavoy stole the main prize one of the bits that really stuck out for me with him is the bit where he sees the dead bodies this scene captures so much emotion and sadness and james mcavoy acts it perfectly this scene choked me upthe chemistry between keira and james is incredible ill name another bit where i got choked up  the bit where they were in the caf and they barely had any time together this film made me think how would it feel to be in that situation where you was innocent but was still being punishedi did not see the twist coming and the film is so well acted that i actually felt sorry for briony at the end as you can see she is genuinely sorry and tries to atone for what she has done by giving them their love back in the novelalso the last scene with cee and robbie on the beach is perfect so sad so dramaticif you have not seen yet then i suggest you rent it or buy it it is worth it i promise,sad
having read and studied the novel a couple of times i was curious but also nervous about what i might encounter on the screen i found the adaptation stupendous it was clever artistic and complex rather than adapt the exact story word for word plot for plot ian macewen and christopher hampton astutely wrote a selfreflexive film that draws attention to its own fabrication just like the novel is formed by fragments of truth history and fiction the film is a compilation of shots that continually reminds the audience that this is an adaptation for example the film reels in the background of scenes the closeups of eyes the windows as barriers the shutting doors all these symbols serve to accentuate the films positioning of the viewer as voyeur and to highlight the films central conflict misunderstood sight this is after all not a love story but a story about what we see and what we imaginethe stunning cinematography contributes to the films voyeuristic ideas  the movie performs the visual as the novel performs the linguistic the scenes often move from light to dark submerging characters in shadow when colours are used they standout as symbolic gestures the luscious and exquisite green of knighleys gown or the vivid red x that keeps brionys cape in place but also marks her shame so much of the tension in the film rests on the long glances shared by the characters which reveal more than words hence why the resounding silences are effective particularly in the library sex scene the moment is hot in the book but the adaptation is perhaps hotter the decision to omit music and let the silence become the simple noise of tongues and breath makes this the most erotic and passionate sex scene ive seen on screen for yearsmoreover the sound edits are synchronized with the visual reminding the viewer that this is a story that is being created the type writer noise over and over again which resounds in the refrain come back to me again this isnt a love story  the refrain appears on the surface as the loving words of c whispered in robbies ears however below the literal reading the haunting echo suggests the switches from present to past from past to present the layers produced by the movement from truth to fiction present to past hope and loss is best illustrated in brionys scene with the french solider as she removes the bandage on his head she metaphorically strips the rhetorical layers of the narrative the story is too tight and her guilt must unravel in addition the solider lacks the portion of his lobe that allows him to differentiate between real and unreal if at this point in the film the audience hasnt clued in to the fictional fabrication undertone of the plot it has done the movie a great injustice,sad
great movie about love and all obstacles that comes with it well briony you had to do it did you no one will ever forgive you you little rat,sad
just one defect is the movie is not fluent except this i can tell that the movie was completely nice with the acting and the cast i felt the tragedy deep inside i believe that if a movie makes me feel any kind of feelings is the one tracer thing,sad
2007wow this is a movie begging to be classic i liked it and wanted to love it for all the deep emotional implications the great set designs and the wonderful cast the story is actually astonishing as it unfolds at first its about true love between two young adults and its equally about the fertile and misguided imagination of a girl who doesnt understand this true love and manages to sabotage it its also about storytelling and about the everfascinating problem of world war ii for the participants and the civilians caught in the riptides of its damagesthats a lot its enough for any good movie and this actually has the bones of a great movie one of the strengths is how good it looks mostly thanks to veteran cinematographer seamus mcgarvey who has been on the fringes of a feast of awards but never quite rises to the top of the celebrity pile here check his list of movies to know his serious accomplishments but mostly watch how he deftly makes this movie vivid and moving scene after scenecredit of course goes to director joe wright who has moved from television to serious moviemaking very well and to the writer novelist ian mcewan but beyond these are the actors especially kiera knightly who i find at her best here shes often an affected actress far to aware of the camera but here she backs off enough to fit the tightly scripted style throw in saoirse ronan as the young writer and troublemaker and her sister the terrific actress waiting for her major breakout film juno temple and the one man to note james mcavoy is strong if not the equal of the others never mind benedict cumberbatch who is good but slightly out of step for some reasonso you see the movie is loaded for bear as we say here in the us or used to and it soars and swoops and makes your heart patter and your heart swoon and then i think its up to your feeling of how the plot unfolds and whether you believe it or not and whether you go along with what i found to be a bit pushy and contrived contrived to make you cry yes but so obviously you feel slightly jilted like the date who turns out to not really like you after all and was just out for a good timecertainly give this a try it might just be the best movie youve seen in a while it wont be bad by any means and it really is gorgeous in many ways,sad
although not an entirely awful film it was not the masterpiece people i know attested to it being there are some picturesque scenes scattered here and there however overall the pace of the film in anything but even the first 40 min feel like nothing has happened its the build up to the act that defines the rest of the film but did it necessarily need 40 min briony ronan decides to accuse the wrong man of a heinous crime why because she is infuriated by the fact he doesnt reciprocate the affection she has towards him yeah i think thats it of course no one thinks to question the words of this privileged assuming 13 year old the next 40min are dedicated to the lovers of the film i say lovers in fact they are separated due to the war and hardly ever meet up during this time span cecilia knightley is the rich spoiled and hardly likable young lady who has gone out of her way to shun the servants son robbie mcavoy until the fateful night of the crime a sequence of event leads them to admit their feelings for one another and a passionate moment between them ensues a few hours later robbie is arrested cecilia leaves behind her family and their riches as a form of protest to the injustice done and in declaration of her undying love for robb hang on what really in the last part of the film briony garai reappears 45 years older and supposed wiser she is now punishing herself for her previous sin by refusing to go to cambridge and becoming a nurse instead its a hardknock life scrubbing dirty bedpans and taking orders from the strict orderly i mean oh how the mighty have fallen am i supposed to feel sorry for her the thing is i dont overly sentimental it was hard to feel for anyone except maybe the victim robbie there is a sense of helplessness that lingers throughout the whole film knightley expands on her typical brand of acting in this film she no longer limits herself to just eyebrow dances and outward jaw thrusts she now includes a staccatotype speech pattern to synchronize i guess with that annoying perpetual typewriter sound heard throughout the whole film garai is just meh is her performance mcavoy and ronan however shine the story ends with a statement from an older briony played by vanessa redgrave relating to her the pomposity of which left me flabbergasted in summary i could not feel for almost any of the characters in the film and as such i spent most of the time looking at my wrist watch waiting for it to be over,sad
a comparatively poor but aspiring doctor mcavoy seduces a wealthy young woman of class knightley in 1930s england but their budding romance is struck a fatal blow when hes framed for a rape lengthy and laborious effort doesnt really deliver on the hype the youthful leads perhaps not convincing enough to persuade me of their plight their sacrifices and the severity of the injustice done to them by the immature teen ronan who manufactures the scandal that tears their lives apartthe twist ending is welcome though a tad depressing and the appearance late in the film of vanessa redgrave as the present day version of the saoirse ronan character is quality casting but for me mcavoy is too juvenile for this role knightley while apparently more age appropriate and able to perform both the regal and promiscuous roles well in tandem needs a stronger more virile and masculine leading man to properly establish her characters complexitytheres some exciting war battles authenticlooking sets and costumes and while its epic the narrative is constant but ultimately for me the dialogue sounded a little beyond the performers capabilities in its unnatural delivery and the overall impact was earnest but unconvincing,sad
i dont know what to say about this one a very twisted pathetic pitiful story not that i dont liked it it was a good movie the acting was great the background and score gave a more deep significance to the story and the story itself with the all the twist and turns was ok but it left me with a blank feeling i really dont know what to think about it did i understood what happened did i really enjoy it or its just my nature to not criticize so harsh a work did the story its just that captivating and interesting as many others say or i just applied the sheep thing and convinced myself it was a good film based on others opinionsthese are my feelings for now after a half hour waiting after seeing the movie to put all the pieces together in order to write my opinion i understood the hole point of the story i understood the story itself and what happened buti dont know maybe i expected more what more exactly that is i dont know cause in many cases including me viewers tend to like twisted stories because they act like riddles you love that sense of misteryous events that need to guessed feeling but this one left me with a really blank feelingit took me a almost a half hour to decide what to write here and almost three minutes to decide whether to give a seven or an eight to this movie but in the end i thought seven suits the story more in my point of viewworth watching people but aim yourself with patience and dont give up if it confuses you a bit just pay attention details of the story are hidden throughout every films bit,sad
a quite faithful adaptation of ian mcewans most acclaimed novel christopher hampton took the liberty to make some changes but they did not in any way affect the story and its tragic beauty the direction and cinematography are out of the world joe wright used his camera to perfectly communicate the unspoken words and the emotional intensity of the events to the audience i felt totally absorbed in the scenes both wright and hampton managed to overcome the difficulty of turning words into visuals especially when it comes to a novel that mainly deals with inner thoughts and personal perspectivesalthough i am not a big fan of either keira knightley or james mcavoy i have to admit that their natural presence on the screen breathed more life into the story moreover saoirse ronans mature performance as the young briony foreshadows a great talent in the makingi also fell in love with the music score from the very first ten minutes kudos for dario marianelli,sad
2007 sure is one of the most beautiful movies i have ever seen joe wrights sentimental direction gorgeous cinematography the emotional score and beautiful performances are the factors which make one of the most special movies to me it gives a splendid novel the film it deservesis effective at getting under the skin i cried watching it it sure is the worst thing that you cannot get what you actually want it is haunting and beautifully disturbingthe best part is cinematography art direction and original score best of the year and as far as the year goes i believe is the best movie of 2007beautiful 9510,sad
is not a movie who will please everyone it is a complicated story far more than a simple love story as it is sometimes describeditto me the main center of the movie well of the novel actually is the power of words its brionys imagination and love for words that draws her onto this fantasy world where she does not make the difference between reality and fiction its robbies letter and use of the c word that will later turn against him its brionys statement that sends him to jail and finally its brionys novel which in the end allows her or not to atone for her mistakes its a very powerful story which demonstrates how devastating words and miscommunication can be and interesting take of what is or is not history in factthere are many layers in the movie and other subjects treated there class warfare war and yes a bit of how love can survive despite the events and distancefrom a direction point of view the movie is very interesting particularly the famous 1shot beach shoot which in one and single take captures the horror of dunkirks retreat and the feel of exhaustion and despondency those men must have felt back there there are lots of other very clever shots and the image is beautiful the score must also be underlined rhymed by the tictictic of the typewriternow atoment prevails essentially thanks to stellar performances from the whole cast with saiorse ronan and james mcavoy being just incredible ronan such a young girl there perfectly captures brionys confusion but also what really transpires in the novel which is her desire to be a control freak to be the author in a way the character thinks of herself as a god and i can just praise sr for being able to convey so much on screen with this difficult character as for james mcavoy his performance is so so good that i still dont understand the oscar snub a nomination a least should have been made its a very understated performance subtle nuanced and so powerful each time hes on screen that you cant help but feel what robbie feels in each scene more particularly the scene in the caf the one where he discovers the college girl slaughter and the confrontation with the grown up briony are outstandingyet is unfortunately a bit too slow in its middle section and because of this looses part of his power up to the point that i get why some people called it dull at times i had to rewatch it to completely appreciate it and this is why its only a 7 for me nevertheless this is a movie that deserved to be watched if only for its fantastic performances,sad
i was handed the book by my teacher for my higher english exam and fell in love with the story then so obviously i was wary of it being turned into a film not just because it was one of my favourite books but because i knew it inside outfilms are never going to be exactly like a book as they are two completely different ways of telling a story this film is such a good adaptation i love the film as much as i love the book all actors suit the roles perfectly and the feel of the book is not lost the first third is meant to be a little faster paced as it quickly leads up to brionys accusation the last two thirds are how each person has been affected so are a little slower these lead up to the last scene when briony is an elderly ladyit is a beautiful and moving story and the film has captured this the long scene on the beach is a fantastic idea as it gives the viewer an idea of just how big and overwhelming the evacuation was the jumping between different characters and different years was done brilliantly too i could write forever about this film and what it is about but there is no point as i would never do it justice if you have not seen itdo,sad
was a beautiful movie it was without a doubt one of the best films of last year it was done so brilliantly its incredibly sad and definitely romantic and it shows that when you make one little mistakeexcept the mistake made here isnt little it will come back to bite you in the assbriony tallis one of the main characters in the film makes a huge mistake i dont know how you pronounce or spell this young actresses name but the girl who played briony was fantastic she was nominated for the best supporting actress award too she probably deserved it not tilda swinton though that was a fantastic movie too is a romantic drama that takes place many many years ago it mostly revolves around a thirteen year old named briony tallis when she receives a letter from her gardenerplayed by james macavoy she begins to think that he is in love with her but she soon learns that her sister celiaplayed by keira knightly was supposed to get the letter so briony accuses him of rape just for revenge this is what ruins everyones lives foreverin the future briony ends up becoming a nurse her sister hates her brionys best friendplayed by juno temple ends up marrying the man who raped her and the gardener is sent to war for years he tries to get to celiais a true romance film it could even be the best i have seen the performances are fantastic i liked the way it shows you one thing then it goes back and explains it is a romance epic to never be forgottenatonement,sad
a good adaptation of a british novel the movie is for people who are looking for some intense drama and a touching romantic filmthe movie starts through the eyes of a girl aged 13 of the affair between her elder sister and her lover and her misinterpretation of a series of events which changes the course of all three of their lives the visuals of the movie depicting the countryside are very pleasing at the same time it also depicts the suffering of the british soldiers during the world war ii in a heart wrenching waythe movie in some frames moves back and forth and some frames move pretty fast so watch out for it the highlight of the movie is its last thirtyforty minutes at the end of the movie you would say we simply dont have any control of most of the things in our lives and there is no for some mistakes,sad
this is a remarkably audacious and original film experience playing with typical period set pieces and devices before descending into what could only be described as a postmodern hell it deliberately angers and frustrates the audience by not only withholding vital information but by offering false information and later cynically dashing viewers hopes by grabbing them back such an effort could be ruined by general confusion and misplaced intentions if the entire film wasnt so thoroughly polemical and even critical of its primary characters in the end the film titled seems in some sense to be about the impossibility of such a glowing emotion and the films purpose seems to be to tantalize the audience with the possibility of redemption and peace while perpetually dangling it out of reach like the proverbial carrot in front of the mulethe basic plot setup is as heartbreaking as it is simple  a young girl of privilege named briony saoirse ronan misinterprets and misrepresents events which she has witnessed in order to frame a young charge of her fathers estate james mcavoy with a rape which he clearly did not commit his lover brionys sister cecilia keira knightley is left with an abiding bitterness towards her sister and her entire family for their classbased complicity in the frameup robbie mcavoy enlists in the army to get out of prison leading to a separation that tears the lovers lives apart and leaves briony played in the middle section by romola garai and in the final portion by vanessa redgrave without any outlet for her growing regret and selfloathingwhats really profound about the film in my opinion is the fact that even brionys relatively mature need for is a form of selfindulgence she cant live with herself anymore  but why should cecilia or robbie care about that what could she actually offer them to make up for so much that she has taken away as the film gradually reveals through flashbacks that even at the tender age of 13 brionys motivations were confused by sexual jealousy our sympathy for her character dissipates even as our sense of the overall tragedy deepens the audience is driven further and further from sympathy with briony and yet we cannot for a moment doubt the sincerity of her desire to set her wrongs to right it is the impossibility of this more than the lovers sad fate that really forms the heart of the tragedy even in the final portions of the film with redgrave playing an elderly briony who has now sought to give the lovers some form of by giving them an artificial happy ending through her semiautobiography of the events we are subtly led by the writers and the director to realize that she has still never atoned for the evil that she did none of this is by way of making briony an inhuman or an uncaring person  tragedy in its high and classical sense requires not simply sadness but the impossible longing for a higher character than we can achieve as humans briony did the best that she could at all times but it was never enough to erase a decision that had already been made and whose consequences had already been feltthe performances by mcavoy knightley and garai are particularly effective and memorable there is never a moment where the actors and actresses put themselves above the material the directors style is at times a bit showy particularly in the dunkirk beach sequences but these scenes are so gorgeous and effective that any consciousness of the film process must be overcome by the sheer power of the images there are a few scenes that seemed unnecessary or illplaced to me especially a sequence with mcavoy discovering slaughtered children in a field but mcavoys performance in that scene is so powerful that once again im inclined to overlook any kind of misplaced emphasis and to simply admit that what works cant be fixed this is the rarest kind of great film  a film that leaves us with a truly profound sadness a sadness that is only enhanced by the beauty and grace of the proceedings to think that we as human beings can reach so far and grasp so little,sad
the story of joe wrights film starts as romantic and social drama in the setting of a 1930s high class mansion very similar to the one of easy virtue the rich elder daughter of the owners of the estate cecilia keira knightley falls in love with handsome and clever robbie james mcavoy the son of the janitor and the two live a short and passionate affair which is brutally interrupted by briony the young sister of cecilia a confused but imaginative teenager who misreads some of the scenes she is witnessing and sends to jail robbie for a crime that he did not committhe next part of the story happens in europe at the start of the second world war robbie has won his way out of prison volunteering to serve as simple soldier in the army and lives the tragedy of war and the days of the debacle of dunquerque his moral anchor is a short meeting he had with cecilia and the hope to get back his love and lifein the third segment we meet again briony out of her troubled years and starting to understand the evil she had made to her sister and her sisters lover she renounced the easy life at the estate and studies at cambridge has volunteered as a nurse to do some good and tries to contact her sister to get forgiveness and fix the evil she has done by recognizing that her accusations were false but is sufficient and can evil deeds be undone in real life or can imagination compensate for what destiny has decided to happen in real life is it actually destiny or hazards and misunderstandings of real life that govern what happens it is the final segment of the story that will provide answers briony becomes the real hero of the story with her permanent alternation between imagination and reality with her tentative to take responsibility and get absolution from deeds she committed long time ago but which need to be with her for the rest of her life the final key scene gives a different perspective to the whole story and this is probably reflecting the structure of the narration in the original novel there are two scenes of beautiful cinema in this film  the run in the forest in the first part of the film and the long shot scene on the beach of dunquerque bringing to life the debacles of war  and the name of the director of cinematography seamus mcgarvey must be mentioned in this context out of a fine cast i liked most james mcavoy who brings to screen personality and charm to match the beauty and talent of keira knightley and vanessa redgrave with a moving performance as old briony a role that fits her perfectlyi did not read ian mcewans book but the quality and intensity of the story can be felt in the script of director joe wright uses a couple of times an interesting technique of playing the same scenes from the perspective of different characters emphasizing the role of perception real or false in the story as a viewer i had the feeling that this time we may be in the case of an adaptation to screen that succeeds to be true to the spirit and quality of a good book,sad
im a chick which means i love tearjerkers and this film is no exception i wasnt actually going to see this movie but my mom bought it along with love actually they were both in an economy pack and it was really cheap and since mom liked both films dvd covers she bought them and so i watched love actually first which i didnt really care for then i watched a few days later and this film just blew me away i havent read the novel so i cant compare them or judge one or the other but i can say that this is one of those films that if you havent read the novel you will still understand it because it is so well explained and told so brilliantly by pride and prejudice director joe wright and from both films i can already tell hes going to be a high in demand directorwarning major spoilersthe story is about a thirteen year old overly creative girl named briony tallis who is an aspiring writer she comes from a wealthy english family the year is 1935 and world war ii is rapidly approaching one hot summer day soon turns into a chaotic one when briony witnesses an intimate moment of sexual tension between cecilia her older sister and robbie the housekeepers intelligent son who goes to the same university as cecilia briony misinterprets this innocent moment and thinks that robbie is somehow assaulting her sisterafter briony reads a letter meant for her sister from robbie she makes up her mind that he is a sex crazed pervert who is obsessed with her cecilia later that night she witnesses robbie and cecilia in the mists of passionate lovemaking in the library she mistakes their act of love and believes that robbie has raped cecilia later when lola her fourteen year old cousin is raped while searching for her twin brothers who have run away briony is the only one who witnesses the act she convinces not only lola but herself that robbie is the rapistlola immediately believes her as does the rest of her family all except cecilia who maintains that robbie is innocent and defends him during an interrogation with an inspector but it is simply not enough to save poor robbie from been prosecuted and sentenced to years in prison when the war begins however five years later robbie is permitted to leave prison so he can enlist in the armythe rest of the film consists of the troubles and pains that both robbie and cecilia have to go through after brionys lie tears them apart they fight to be together but it seems like they are destined to be apart meanwhile briony grows older and as she does she realizes the mistake she has made and is later revealed during the movie that petty jealousy was perhaps the reason why briony made up the lie of course briony doesnt realize until later that her lie has horrible consequences not only for cecilia and robbie but for the rest of her family including her cousin lolavanessa redgrave delivers a great performance however short as the elder brionywhat i love about this film is that at the end you are left somewhat empty because we find out that she never truly realized the kind of damage that her lie caused and she never truly achieves her by not telling the complete truth and disguising it with something that makes her feel less guilty about what she has donethis film has great performances by mcavoy knightley and newcomer saoirse ronan i am definitely looking forward to saoirses upcoming performance in the lovely bones another thing i love about this movie is the film score by dario marianelliif you like romance tearjerkers and intricate story telling that this is mustwatch for you,sad
this film is a brilliant masterpiece that will allow you to appreciate art in film it composes many elements of literary symbolism and you will always find something new every time you watch the movie the movie demonstrates cinematography at its finest by the way camera angles were used and the constant movement of the cameras many people will not appreciate this film unless they find the hidden meanings to certain objects and scenes in the moviethe film is a prime example on how we see things a certain way and we think we know but in reality what we know is the wrong thing we learn that assumptions can go a very bad way without clarifying our thoughts that are clouded by our emotions is a must see movie if you have not seen it you can rent it at your local video store it is like poetry in motion,sad
at the heart of each movie is the screenwriter sometimes in collaboration with a novelist preordained studio junk notwithstanding there are too many poor attempts at postmodern selfreference in film but there are also too many critics trying to dig up that postmodernism where it never had primacybut this is a wonderful example of it done rightas a natural writer briony views ambiguous events in her childhood and shapes and directs them according to the compass of her craft writers do this into adulthood normal people stop in adolescence everything after the rape scene is her invention and it adds a rich level of viewership watching and knowing that these characters fates are entirely in the hands of a child the narrative takes turns of its own all originally conjured by a jealous mind which all writers possess a mind that couldnt accept reality as it was no matter how ambiguous all reality is and so had to change ithalfway through though she overcomes that jealousy within her own story by abandoning her authorship and adjusting her own character to the mold of the people shes damned by becoming a nurse like cecelia and giving up her place at cambridge to do something practical just like robbie this is her real damning herself to the loveless life she created in others names a monastical sort of giving her victims a fairy tale ending is just another side of thatsome of the metanarrative highlights that stand out for me are robbies dreams which occur in reverse slow motion almost as if hes trying to undo the weave that hes been written into the recurring imagery is wonderful and like a detailed rug it reminds us of the repeated patterns that make up the whole submersion in water is probably the most critical for lots of reasons i think all these images and themes coalesce in the singleshot sequence at dunkirk a remarkable shot  ferris wheels dying horses drunken soldiers repressive authority  all icons of childhood or dying childhood all at a critical point in the plot all on a beach in which our hero is stranded just as he is in the storyits no accident that the seed of this narrative tree is discovery of sexuality the moment all real writers hear the starting gun,sad
jealousy and lie are part of almost all romantic tragedies but the conclusion is that has carved out a niche for itself based on the popular novel of the same name which swept many critical applauds its movie version also manages to make audiences around to attach themselves with the character the story of a lie that dramatically changed the lives of people around it will take you across a decade of human tragedy in europe and the personal tragedy of the three protagonists the strong performances by the all star cast lead by robbie mccoy and keira knightly adds luster to the already formidable written work but a word of praise cannot be missed for the young miss ronan playing the character of young briony tallis her striking eyes and facial expression showing range of emotions along with a tinge of innocence shadows over every other performing artist in the rather long first act of the moviethe story unfolds during the beginning of the 2nd world war in a large english estate of the tallis family the family includes a rather stressed mother along with two daughters played by kiera knightly elder who is busy with her awkward attraction for the servants boy robbie turner james mcavoy who has a hidden love for cecilia tallis keira little does he know that his harmless show of his desires for cecilia would turn his life upside down and off course the young miss saoirse ronans character briony tallis which in the next two acts of the story set in separate periods of her life is played by two other actresses in cecilias own words briony has a fanciful imagination which threatens to destroy everything around her not that briony is a spoilt rich child but she is innocent and also has feelings for robbie which creates a jealous trait as she witnesses robbie locked passionately with her elder sister before a dinner gathering of her family to celebrate the arrival of the two sisters brother along with his friend who has a rather questionable character features as that particular dines begins an untoward chain of events begins to roll which leads to briony witnessing a forceful sexual act over her visiting cousin in pitch black darkness by a unknown person but as the entire days events take a toll over briony she concludes that robbie is the guilty person her one false claims leads to robbie being imprisoned for four years and then later driven into france to fight the war knightely abandons her family and leaves for london to serve in the war as a nurse while keeping her relationship with robbie alive as briony grows up she starts to get the feel of the consequences of her is mistakewhat transpires in the next acts of the film is the briony tries to find for her deeds the movie moves along in swift pace after the first act miss knightly do not have much of dialogues in the film she rather makes an efficient use of her expressive face robbie holds himself and the movie strongly in many mono acts during his time in war as mentioned earlier briony played by young ronan goes away with most applauds while the other two actresses have very little space to evolve as they just end up taking leads from miss ronan it is not just the three strong characters that make this movie worth watch it is also the cinematography of the film especially prolong sequence of the dunkirk evacuation which catches the audience breathless in the end the movie does not deviate from its subject and concludes exactly like the fanciful imagination of briony tallis with reality firmly places around it,sad
i cant say that swept me off my feet but i do believe it managed to do something increasingly harder in a world with a less sentimental or more cynical mentality sell us a tragic love story without seeming too melodramatic or sappyi avoided going to see this film in the theater because i was convinced it will be a bit boring  i find sentimental melodrama for the sake of sentimentalism a bit passe and i am not a big keira knightley fan after seeing all the nominations and awards the movie got i decided to give the dvd a try gotta say this story of ill fated love which is such common subject dontchathink could have resulted in a mediocre movie had it nor been for the way the film was structured and directed and the talent of mr mcavoy saorise ronan and all others funny how talented filmmakers can turn even a common themed story into a great film,sad
did this movie live up to the hypenonot reallyit is a watchable film to be sure but at the end of the day i felt it was ok and nothing better than thati wont go over the plot of the film as i am guessing that you have already watched itit is a good story and very well filmed but i didnt feel a connection with any of the characters at all and felt no emotion throughout the filmit is nicely directed by joe wright although i did feel that the dunkirk sequence was overdone and almost felt as though it was the directors way of showing how clever he washe does do a good job overall though in fairness to himacting wisejames mcavoy was fine as robbie but keira knightley was average at best and i am puzzled that a lot of people were pushing for her to be nominated for an oscarshe struggled at times to show emotion and though her performance is reasonablebelieve me we are not talking about award winning stuff herethe two best performances for me were from saoirse ronan as the young briony and vanessa redgrave as the oldthey are both excellent and the best things about the filmso is a pretty good watch but not for me a classicit is one of those films that i was struggling to markmaybe a 6 or a 7i decided on a 6 finally because it isnt a film that i would watch again,sad
i did really think this was an exceedingly good film but i am thrown by all the best movie this year comments i was basically moved by it but this was a great year for movies and i can name five movies two of them nominees which i considered betteri dont want to waste time nitpicking though there was a whole lot going for this especially in the technical fields the music was arguably the best of the year and this included the sound of the typewriter the sets costumes and cinematography were all splendid and i was under the movies spell much of the time and yet there were times when i felt detached and uninvolved not often but often enough that i cant call this perfect and flawless damn good is about the most i can say about it,sad
this film is misdirected by joe wrightbadly written by christopher hampton  adapted from the novel by ian mcewan does recreate the atmosphere of 1935 england the dunkirk beach of 1941 the sets costumes  cinematography are the best parts of this film  that is the only reason for my rating of 6the story is unbelievable contrived  worst of all unconvincingthe performers go through their roleswithout making me care what happens to themthis may because the script has elements of far better moviesthe childrens hour lying young girl ruining livesa place under the sun tragic love storyfactory worker  rich young womanmrsminiver tragic events at dunkirkwatching scenes unfold in this film brought back better memories of the above 3 filmsnow to the castjames mcavoy is terribly miscast as our our hero keira knigfhtly as our heroine is a beautiful lady  that is about allit takes 3 actresses to portray the young lady who who tells a liespurring the inevitable tragic events soirese roman as a cute 13 year old jealous little lying vixen romola garai same gal at age 18  now a nurse many years later vanessa redgrave in cameo role as on old woman who has just written a novel about what happenedspoiler alert james mcavoy spends some time in prison because of the lies we do not see him in any prison scenes  when he says it was rough he shows no emotion of what happened to him mrmcavoy is slight build  very handsomenuff saidthe scenes on the dunkirk beach are the best scenes in the movie but unless you know the story of dunkirk we arent told where we are you will be confusedthey used to make many romantic movies with a war background some were excellent some were just goodwill not be rememberednow i see why it got so few award it deserved noneratings 12 out of 4 72 points out of 100 imdb 6 out of 1,sad
when thirteenyear old briony tallis saoirse ronan stumbles upon her older sister cecilia keira knightley being embraced by the housekeepers son robbie turner james mcavoy in the library of their country estate it sets off a chain of events that alters the lives of every member of the family for years to come set in the english countryside in 1935 and based on the novel by ian mcewen is a tale of jealousy betrayal and the consequences of a lie an epic of the doomed romantic genre the film works hard to impress and has a few inspired moments but ultimately fails to completely engage while it touches on class distinctions it does not explore them in any depth and though cecilia seems somewhat more liberated than the rest of the stuffy clan most characters are wooden and never come fully alivebriony in an oscar nominated performance by ronan is a talented writer who writes her own stories and plays and has a crush on robbie she even jumps into a pool of water to test whether or not he will rescue her but the incident only creates resentment that boils beneath the surface her discovery of an obscene letter written to cecilia by robbie intended as a letter of apology frightens and confuses the young girl though the letter allows cecilia to realize for the first time that she is in love with robbie awaiting the opportunity to present one of her plays at a family gathering that includes new arrivals brother leon patrick kennedy and his friend paul benedict cumberbatch a wealthy heir of a chocolatier she sees her sister and robbie embracing letting her fears run rampant she accuses robbie of assaulting her young cousin lola juno temple and the repercussions of her lie are immediate and far reachingon the flimsy and uncorroborated testimony of a thirteenyear old girl robbie is sent to prison and the two lovers separated at their most vulnerable time neither briony nor lola nor the real perpetrator ever makes a move to correct the injustice and neither seems to feel much remorse eventually robbie is allowed to join the british army as a world war ii private while cecilia becomes a nurse in the war effort before his unit deploys the two lovers meet in london to rekindle their shortlived affair and she tells him that she left her family in disgust and tells him that she will always love himwhat was fully involving in the first half hour becomes a chore in the middle however as the film loses its momentum and the promise of its exciting beginning becomes a lost opportunity as robbie waits at dunkirk for a ship to bring him home briony now a young adult becomes a nurse caring for soldiers wounded in the war hoping in some small way to atone for the havoc caused by her lie many years later as a successful novelist she uses the power of fiction to try and make amends but her guilt is not convincing and there is ultimately little catharsis either for herself or the audience,sad
if you like period drama then i highly recommend even if you hate keira knightley she stars as cecilia who after a serious misunderstanding is separated from her lover robbie played by james mcavoy ok ill admit i saw this at the cinema and it felt like it lasted about 6 hours when it was only like 2 but all i can say is stick with it it may be slow moving but what happens is well scripted well acted and generally well executed keira knightley has a knack for this kind of period drama and suits the style james mcavoy is interesting to watchalthough i don t find him attractiveif youve read the book then you really wont be disappointed dont bother if your a fan of fast paced action this would be in danger of sending you to sleep,sad
many of us believe that time heals everything memories fade oblivion arrives as a cushion to rest your weary soul all is not lost even if or when love goes to pieces life goes on we will find a new love a better love after war there must be peace after badness there are goodness forgiveness humility and emotion mistakes are made and can be corrected pain is relieved wounds are healed bad luck is nothing of import there will be good luck soon hostility turns into friendship there are always hope laughter fun and happiness even if or when times are horrible beyond the pale we have a shoulder to cry on a hand is given to us when we die not so in this film human machinations add up with the impulse of time to destroy the flicks of paradise sparkling and shimmering in human souls for futile moments lies prevail wounds fester physically and psychologically the truths of death and perdition hang over lost souls of lovers played excellently and unforgettably a cathartic movie a must to see,sad
this film is about a love story between a rich young woman and a poor young man that is complicated by a jealous little sisterthe initial pacing is very slow but every scene is there for a reason and will make sense at the end the plot is excellent it is full of surprise twists especially at the end who would have thought some things in the film are imaginary and yet by making such a twist the impact of the plot is even more profoundjames mcavoy and keira knightley make a convincing screen couple and have great chemistry their acting is great and their award nominations are well deserved the film is so surprisingly touching that will easily move anyone,sad
the individual scenes are the best of any movie i have scene but all together the whole picture is similar to gourmet meals of all sorts blended together the result is difficult to digest very disappointing the story is a forced series of misunderstandings that seem very amateur and far fetched i think the tv show threes company had more realistic misunderstandings i suppose the blame to the lame story goes to the original author but if i was to take the story seriously it is really robys carelessness that leads to tragedy the fault is also partly do to cecilias lack of relationship with her younger sister communication in general is important but is even more critical within a family,sad
first off i have to say that people who thought this movie is terrible is wrong im not saying they cant have there own opinion because thats what movies are all about but they need to really sit down and watch this movie again because it really gives you a scene of love andsecond for me loving movies and wanting to be a director some day i thought that this movies was so ravishing and spectacular the director really out did himself in this film although i was worried at first because i saw pride and prejudice right after i read the book and was really disappointment that was one of the only reason that i had from seeing the movie but when my friend forced me to go see it i had no objection since it seemed amazing in the preview the first 10 minutes of the film i was drawn i love how they showed the girl as a writer showed you how creative she is and foreshadowing for later in the film also the second i saw keira knightley and james mcavoy first hit the screen and looked at each other i saw the chemistry right awayi dont want to go off about the film because this film you need ever aspect of it to understand and i dont want to ruin it for othersfor me i loved how the director didnt rush into things and got the main point of the book out there and yes there was a lot of scenery but if you look closely into to film you get the love and passion that the 2 lovers wanted and neededi recommend that everyone see this film and make your own opinion of the film,sad
after the first 30 minutes of total despair watching this slow muddled and garbled chick flick i was ready to leave and wondered why it was reviewed so well what did i miss but i stayed due to my wifes effective insistence but even at the end it still was just a watchable film overall certainly not great and surely mainly interesting to female viewers wantingneeding a love story the skinoverbones skeletallythin lead actress kiera knightly was a aggravating melodramatic messchanneling a young katherine hepburnwith all her exaggerated gestures and with her very unattractive figure and underbite she was totally unappealing to me as a romantic lead but hey the critics sure liked this movie both male and female as they watched and whooped it up while drinking their pink ladies and bloody marys in their hot pink feather boas and tights ill betof course brit females and girly men everywhere surely loved it but ill bet that most men of any nationality surely did not and if any nonbrit male or female understood even half of what was said ill give them money that it had garbled dialogue would be a big complement for the lousy sound this is good filmmaking not to me and with its irritating soft and outoffocus cinematography the only visual things i liked were the 30s period sets and costuming and the lush english countryside thats itim as bored writing about this film as i was watching it it is not worth any more of my words instead see before the devil knows youre dead and no country for old men for two films actually worth seeing,sad
starts at a great english country house on a hot summer day before the second world war it speaks of the attraction between two young cambridge graduates cecily tallis keira knightley and robbie turner james mcavoy despite their shared educational background cecily is upper class her family owns the great house and robbie is the son of one of the familys servants and out of this disparity comes a remarkable and rather tragic story in the novel by ian mcewan which joe wrightwho directed ms knightley in pride and prejudiceworking this time from a screenplay by the skillful christopher hampton has made into an impressive moviethe trouble with a movie thats a literary adaptation is that you may have read the book especially when the book is as good as ian mcewan may not be a great writer but hes certainly a very good one he writes delicious intelligent sentences and with them tells surprising quietly bold tales the best film adaptation of a mcewan novel is andrew birkins the cement garden the cement garden its worth noting is haunting and strange and touches on one of the most ancient of taboos but as a story its simple in its basic elements is manyleveled and far grander and more emotionally fraught encompassing as it does the decline of a ruling class and a great war and themes of sex and love and class and the danger of ignorance and the capacity of literature to redeem a lifeor not filming this novel is an ambitious taskmcewans is a particularly dangerous novel to film because its so easy to make the details overblown and lose the essence of the thing this is what joe wright has done hes still produced a beautiful occasionally engaging and involving but sometimes fatiguing movie replete with moments of shock and sorrow and grandeur but the book wasnt about wounded troops massed on the beach or an underground tunnel being floodedthough these are among the more memorable images of the film mcewans really isnt about the grandeur of prewar upper class english country lifewhose details are just sketched in deftly by the novelist while he focuses on the emotions the suspicions the doubts the passions nor as one reads mcewans novel does one hear in ones mind the sound of large string orchestra playing with an incessant overlay of a loudly clacking typewriter but in the film one never gets away from that this is one of the reasons that novels about or from any period are timeless the period trappings dont overwhelm because we dont have to see them as henry green wrote prose is not to be read aloud but to oneself alone at night and it is not quick as poetry but rather a gathering web of insinuations  prose should be a long intimacy between strangers with no direct appeal to what both may have known it should slowly appeal to feelings unexpressed it should in the end draw tears out of the stone  the novel is about the mistake of a nave willful dangerously overimaginative girl that plays into the class prejudices of a great english family and ruins several lives these are events that at various points you really cannot stage at all theyre things you have to tell aboutor rather hint at and make the audience think about where the book is delicateyet disturbingtears from the stonethe movie is more operatic and not always opera of the highest order it may be merchantivory or masterpiece theater but its not brideshead revisited as beresfordhowe said in film threat imagine if the team that made the english patient tried to make the same kind of movie with even more braveladsfightingthejerries porn and this time with extra added english country manor porn and without really good actors and this movie is what youd have this is the sad truth one wants to like knightley and mcavoy and theyve been excellent in other roles but they arent quite up to their jobs this time and neither are the two young women who play the younger sister briony saoirse roman as the elevenyearold girl who makes the false accusations and romola garai as the repentant eighteenyearold briony is central she needs to be infuriating yet sympatheticwhich isnt so easy and neither actress quite has those qualities there is a great actress at the end in vanessa redgrave with her immense authority and wisdom as the aged soontodie briony who appears in one speech to a tv interviewer about her latest and last novel which is called but this is just lastminute exposition and since the message is one of failure and quiet despair its not the grand finale the elaborately staged scenes have led one to expect too much of the movies time is thrown away on great paneled hallways and country house lawns bright lipstick period hairdos silk blouses little boys talking as little english boys no longer do and haggard battle scenes that could as well be of the first world war as the secondi dont side with those who think the vast scene of troops on the beach is a mere tour de force without emotion well maybe it is but its still the most mesmerizing sequence in the movieperhaps its involving because we dont know where its going to go and ultimately pointless or not the postbattle sequences are the closest thing we get to an objective correlative for the human tragedy the young girl has wrought other scenes which can be evoked in a few lines in the novel are so elaborately staged they overwhelm the ideas mcewan meant to evoke we dont need to see that underground flood its far more affecting just to learn what happened without seeing it mcewans novel isnt perfect its too manipulative but its a better story,sad
after received almost unanimously excellent reviews a female friend  who had read the book  and i went off to our local fleapit to judge it for ourselves in a cinema which was only about one eighth full i guess it was inevitable that a couple would plonk themselves right behind us the man immediately displayed his credentials as a trailer for the kingdom came on he pronounced in a very loud voice well thats a load of fxxxing propaganda and then continued to denounce every other item  including the adverts  in a similar fashion rather optimistically i hoped he might quieten down for the main feature it was not to be is one of those rather precious british productions which wear their literary credentials on their sleeves one can admire the beautifully realised images of a sweltering hot english summer the restrained acting which subtlety highlights the unspoken class structure that permeated through british prewar society the way madden overcomes the nonlinear complexities of the novel by using such clever techniques as the clicking of the typewriter as a joining mechanism unfortunately this also means that the overall effect can feel rather difficult slow and dull obviously our friend behind us felt this to be so almost from the beginning he shifted and shuffled in his seat punctuating it all with low grunts groans and barely suppressed yawns finally as the revered tracking shot unfolded before us he blurted out god this is boring in an unexpected turn of events however my normally very wellbalanced friend had also had enough violently jerking round and in a venomous whisper that would have caused gollum to take a step back she spat out well why dont you p off then silence this meant that the films rather special cinematic representation of the chaos of dunkirk was diminished by the fact that at any time we could have been embroiled in a real life fight anticlimatically the couple quietly got up and left so what of the film in retrospect although very classily made is actually less than the parts the first section is too reminiscent of the go between and the war scenes although brilliantly realised are not creating new ground it was well acted especially saoirse ronan as the 13 year old briony even kiera is fine  although as my friend pointed out she works in the part as it calls for someone who is stilted and wooden god women can be far crueller than men you know but in the end maybe our vocal friend had a point,sad
i very much enjoyed the look and feel of this movie but for it to be a masterpiece requires being emotionally invested in it which i was notthe romance between the two leads was unconvincing perhaps in the book it was better also it was not clear to me whether briony knew she was lying about robbie being the rapist or actually believed it was him if she believed it than she did nothing wrong hence nothing to atone for but even if she knew she was lying i had no sympathy for the lovers so didnt really care both of them knew this young girl had read a sexually explicit letter and caught them having sex but said absolutely nothing to her to explain what was going on and reassure her that it was alrightanother reviewer called this a middle class drama and that ultimately is what keeps me from really connecting with this movie it is not tragic enough to be a tragedy or more accurately tragedy is now too common to be tragicfinally whoever made this movie was either financed by phillip morris or has a massive smoking fetish there must have been 30 full minutes of people smoking in this movie with it seemed like about 20 lightups although this smoking frequency may have been true to the time i found it extremely distracting,sad
is one of the most overrated movies of last yearsits a boring movie and its enormously pretentiousthis is a typical oscar movieancient clothesa story which is developed in various decadessome war scenescharacters who are tortured by their past and a tedious developmentkeira knightley brings a cold and unnatural performancejames mcavoywho agreeably surprised me with his performance in the last king of scotlanddoes not show too much enthusiasm with his charactersaoirse ronan brings an extraordinary performancethis young actress shows a lot of talent and i would like to see her in more moviesis a totally overrated movie which bored me with a tedious development,sad
it is such a rarity but such a delight when an accomplished novel is successfully transcribed to the screen i was enormously impressed by the exquisite prose of ian mcewans work and anxious about how it would fare as a movie but the result is a triumph director 35 year old joe wright  whose only previous direction was the most enjoyable pride and prejudice  and screenwriter christopher hampton helped by cinematographer seamus mcgarvey have crafted a fine adaption which is faithful to the novel but makes impressive use of the film medium to give us a new insight into the workat one level this is an achingly poignant love story centred on the upper class cecilia tallis keira knightley in one of her best performances to date in a role where her thinness is actually appropriate and the son of the familys cleaning women robbie turner james mcavoy in a richly textured offering with no hint of his natural scottish brogue but at an another deeper level this is a narrative of betrayal and by cecilias younger sister briony  played successively by saoirse ronan as the pubescent and overlydramatic 13 year old by romola garai as the tortured 18 year old and by screen legend vanessa redgrave as the 77 year old authorno film can replicate or emulate the prose of a novel but the movie scores in other ways an incessant and insistent typewriterladen score detailed invocation of period clothing and settings repetition of crucial scenes from different viewpoints a sharper clearer and more emotional ending and  above all  a stunning lengthy steadicam shot of the hell on earth beach scene at dunkirk this is almost as good as cinema gets,sad
tonight i watched for the fourth time the film based on the book with same title written by ian mcewan i remember the first time i watched this film it was winter of 2007 and i had gone to the cinema with my sister and our parentsthe film came to an end and i remember myself not wanting to leave the room it was the first and only time i felt like that even though i was so young i felt so enchanted and heartbroken that i didnt want to leave the room until i dont know whatthis film is about forgiveness the main characters are three young people cecilia robbie and briony cecilia and briony are sisters with the first being some years older than the other robbie is a young man to whom both sisters feel attracted to but when by mistake robbie gives briony a letter to forward it to her sister in which he admitted in a vulgar way that he wanted her briony feels betrayed by both cecilia and robbie and takes the decision to destroy both of their lives by testifying false that she saw robbie molesting on her cousin lolapolice arrested robbie and gave him the choice prison or army he chose armyas years past cecilia grew up to become a nurse and briony was being prepared to join university but in the last minute she decided to become a nurse too thinking that this was the only way she could help and in someway erase part of what she had done some years agothe film follows the lives of the three people robbie facing the cruelty of war cecilia helping in any way she can the soldiers and briony never having forgotten of the awful thing she had done just before the end we see cecilia and robbie in their home living a happy life after war with him still facing some difficulties and briony visiting them to apologize which apology was never acceptedand at the very end we see an old woman giving an interview shes briony tallis the well known writer who gives an interview regarding her latest novel as she explains the end of the book is imaginary because cecilia and robbie never met again after the arrest they both died some days apart and this book as she says has a happy ending not because she wants to lie to people but because she wants to give the two lovers the ending they deserved but never had because of herthis film is truly a masterpiece i wouldnt have watched it four times if it wasnt and for the first time i feel that the film is better than the novel keira knightely and james mcavoy are outstanding they give the passion and tension their characters deserve i give this film 10 out of 10 stars there is not a single thing i didnt like or i would change this film makes me cry every single time not so much because of the two lovers who didnt have the chance to enjoy their youth and love but because briony lived a life in guilt she was responsible for destroying two peoples lives and not only that she never had the chance to do the right thing and after the end she dies with her memory faded from some disease and now im thinking of it maybe thats a gift given to her because she had felt truly sorry the gift was that she would for once feel innocent and kind having forgotten of what she did she dies,sad
a mainly glum disturbing and strangely creepy fiction of doomed romance in one of the features on my disc one of the participants describes the house which is a character as creepy i havent read the book or any of mcewans tales but this depressing story could be his selfaddressed excuse for telling porky pies and makes him feel better many most  all  gloomy writers make use of other peoples misfortunes and their own when creating their fantasies perhaps they sometimes even create these misfortunes themselvesthe way the narrative is filmed continually reminds us that a lot of it perhaps all of it is not actually happening this socially divisive love story is endtoend imaginary that must be why it rambles over the place the narrative is intercut with puzzling flashforwards anticipating later events did briony actually see two figures clutching at each other on the library ladder or did she just make it up in her embryonic little scribblers head  the bookish setting suspended among stacks of literature is appropriate all art is unreal if you will but there are degrees of unreality in this case the reality of english interwar types cambridge or oggsford men during the mid1930s is quite distancing even though i was sufficiently alive myself to recall the run up to ww2 this distance annoys and clouds still the package is not uninteresting very wellmade welldressed wellacted and all that seemed like an excessive amount of time at dunkirk was dunkirk really like that  i cant quite believe it there really are rather too many plot holes and i had one question why didnt the young redhead lola come clean  however this has been more or less answered on this site she was out to snare a chocolate millionaire no matter how creepy i was going to give this eight but now its seven,sad
it was excellent a well made movie with some thoughts to ponderaccompanied by strong cast good script and an amazing scorehowever there are holes in the plot some things that were not explained and they seemed to be ignored and keira is dull as alwaysputting on her usual onedimensional acting which was fortunately covered up by her counterpart mcavoys stronger performance at times the characters faces looked disgustingly unreal perhaps too much make up the dressing esp keiras seems to be too revealing for people living in that era and nothing moving enough or thought provoking enough to impress my mind disappointingly speaking there were many more better and oscardeserving movies of 2007,sad
is a romantic and war film directed by joe wright it is a film adaptation of the novel of the same title by ian mcewanthe story is about a mischievous girl accuses her older sisters lover of a crime he did not commit only to find that her words have irrevocably and permanently changed the lives of all involvedthe film stars james mcavoy keira knightley and saoirse ronan together with romola garaivanessa redgravejuno temple and benedict cumberbatchthe year is 1935 and as the summer heat takes hold 13yearold fledgling writer briony tallis watches her older sister cecilia get undressed and go frolicking in the garden fountain on her familys country estate the housekeepers son robbie a childhood friend and recent cambridge graduate also witnesses the innocent act when robbie and cecilia subsequently cross a particularly sensitive boundary and the scheming briony accuses robbie of an unspeakable transgression for which the boy is wholly innocent the repercussions of her unfounded claim threaten to affect all three for decades to comethis movie is an epic grandiose and immensely sad filmit is an extremely well crafted visually rich love story set during a tumultuous time of war where two impassioned characters are forever torn apart by the selfish jealousy of anotheralsoit has strong performances from james macavoy and keira knightleya brilliant cinematography and a unique scoreit is definitely one brilliant film that ever came out,sad
the meaning of is always ones quest for redemption forgiveness and salvation for others no matter how long it goers on even a lifetime it is an important mission that must always be complete for the happiness of others as well as ones ownthis film is one of the most emotionally moving and tragic films ive ever seen joe wright whom directed pride and prejudice film i love and previously reviewed knows how to make a romance film rightthe theme in the film is about lost romance a romance that gets robbed by two people robie turner flawlessly played by james mcavoy and cecilia tallis keira knightly equally brilliantthat obviously deserve and belong to each other both have done no wrong except love each other all of this because of one grave misunderstanding by one person briony tallis played at different ages by saoirse ronan romola garai and vanessa redgrave and as we see all three try to reclaim that lost romance but it is tragically out of reachone of the brilliant things about this film is how we see the film is broken up into split focus which creates that sense of mystery throughout the film and makes the drama all the more emotional we get down tot he perspective of cecilia and robbie we just love both of these characters cecilia is just a bit stuck up but in a good way spunky constantly has criticism that can be a bit unforgiving but has a sense of warmth to her robbie we see is like your usual good guy hes an underdog has a dry charismatic charm a bit on the shy side but never short of courage when it comes to feelings we can see despite class and character differences their right for one another and personally i feel thats part of what love is it shouldnt matter who a person is whether in class race religion or any other feature its the feelings both share for one another that matter the scenes with them are in a way blissful and beautiful even the shots of that countryside really reflect the innocence of the romance between the two the fountain scene we see both are exchanging romantic tension and banter it seems like arguing celilia is constantly trying to get a rise out of robbie while robbie teases her a bit its obviously this interplay has gone on for some time i cant help but sense ceilia might have had a crush on him since childhood well thats my theory anyway we know from the way they look at one another throughout the ordeal that in reality they have deep feelings for one another once cecilia is soaked and both look at one another their fate is already sealed it was also great when we saw another scene with them when cecilia got the wrong letter robbie wrote robbie as hes coming to see her tries to apologize its just funny from how nervous he is but of course cecilia does believe him and this leads to a scene i thought was romantic and eroticit was just sad and unfair when we see their romantic interplay robbed as both get torn away and of course we see both are trying to come back together from robbie in the war resulting in some brilliant shots which add to the emotional weight one shot which was memorable to me was seeing robbie go down a bunker and see there is a french romance film playing he looks at it and of course cries because he feels that cecilia and their future together after the war could be further out of reachthe of course we would see things unfold in brionys point of view which as we see is not completely reliable the truth is presented to us but not the whole truth because she never sticks around long enough to get all of the facts like a fountain scene she mistakenly thinks its robbie being rude in a way to her sister but maybe just a bet if jealously intermixed since briony herself has a crush on him her interpretation of that incident is unreliable because we cant hear anything from where shes positioned plus there is some time thats missing this weakness of course leads to the downfall in robbie cecilia and herself making her feel misery for her own grave sinwhat is missing from her point of view makes this all the more sadder because it reflects brionys life and quest which is incomplete throughout the film like when she goes to a wedding we dont see who they are most of that wedding we see a shot of how briony is viewing it its a wanting look she wishes this was cecilia and robbies wedding which it really should of beenit all comes down to the final part of the film which always breaks me heart when we see vanessa redgraves appearance as an elder briony ill just say what she says at the end will haunt you foreverrobbie and cecilia will live in my heart forever even i want to believe their romance has returnedrating 4 stars,sad
yes i saw him i saw him with my own eyesits past time i wrote a proper review for as its am excellent movie in all aspects and a personal favorite of mineim quite the fan of joe wright hes talented enough to make pride  prejudice into a movie that both guys and girls could enjoy and pairing him with keira knightley again for another historical piece is basically a guarantee for success the man knows how to craft a good dramathe first thing i love about is the cinematography from the opening portions in the beautiful english countryside to wartime london and the british evacuation at dunkirk this is a startlingly beautiful movie not a moment passes by without something eyecatching in the frame from the settings to the costumes its a cinematic showcasesecond the cast is outstanding this was the movie that made keira knightley one of my five favorite current actresses and made me a fan of james mcavoy it was also the movie that proved that saoirse ronan is easily the best actress of her age all three actresses who played briony at different ages were good but ronan had the task of defining the character for the other two women as well as the most challenging role in the movie her academy award nomination was completely deserved especially for one so youngthird this is an excellent adaptation of an excellent book its a movie that easily could have seemed disjointed because of the way it switches time periods settings and tone but every part of it works and flows together the changes from period drama to war film and back to drama are pulled off flawlesslyso yeah i think very highly of any time a movie takes a genre that im not a huge fan of and makes me a huge fan im impressed it has something for almost everyone and its just a wellcrafted film check it out even if this kind of thing isnt normally to your taste,sad
if you care about accuracy this movie will drive you nuts here are some examples1 the male protagonist lies in his bath looking up at the sky through a skylight its 1937 a lancaster bomber flies over that plane first flew 4 years later in 1941 2 theres a scene where the bad guy discusses marketing a new brand of candyusing language straight out of the 1990s 3 there are no germans at dunkirk the brit soldiers sing hymns and bawdy songs untroubled by a single artillery round or dive bomber 4 in a key scene the leading lady needs to retrieve something from a fountain which holds about a foot of water she could have just reached in and grabbed it but it turns out to be about 6 feet deep so she has to semistrip and dive in 5 in london just before the blitz nobody is carrying gas maskson the plus side the sets and costumes are excellent and the acting great but if lancasters in 1937 grate this film is not for you,sad
just brilliant started off a bit weirdly but got better an better as it went on it was so beautifully written it did get a little confusing with all the timejumps but all becomes clear towards the end before the final really emotional scene i dont think ive ever cried so much at a film in my life james mcavoy and kiera knightley are totally believable and are so good together in this film it actually seems real but the plot is so deep its only sort of halfway through when you begin to realise that the film is not in fact about them but about her sister by the time the end came along i was staring openmouthed at the screen just not believing that this is how they would end it it was the perfect ending for what the films about and the scene at the normandy beach is superb too liked it so much more than no country for old men this should have won the ocsar,sad
is the most recognized film to date by director joe wright pride and prejudice set in britain in the time before and during the second world war comes across as a story about guilt love and chaos bryone tallis a 13 year old girl comes to realize that she may have reached the end of her childhood however she still lives according to her imagination one night she sees her older sister cecilia and her childhood friend robbie together in the library and after reading a forbidden letter bryones naive mind leads her to take the wrong conclusions when her cousin is attacked bryone accuses robbie and that decision changes the familys lives forever robbie is forced to fight in the war cecilia becomes a nurse and gets away from her family and bryone chooses to do the same over going to cambridge and has to live with her crime for the rest of her life this film deserved all the acclamation it received its one of the most brilliant adaptations in recent cinema history its very faithful to the novel which is not an easy task since a lot of it is developed inside the characters minds the director found a very ingenious way of translating this aspect to screen the soundtrack during the course of the film we dont ever hear any thoughts but we know exactly how the characters feel and thats due to the brilliantly placed music the casting is almost flawless most of the characters are very truthful to their description on the novel and some great performances make them very close emotionally to the novel the only exception goes to keira knightley and her approach to cecilia in the book she is warm nice and caring which is a contrast to the cold and snobbish woman we see on screen she is the worst miscast on the other hand james mcavoy gives a spellbinding performance as robbie and the actresses playing bryone do a wonderful job the veteran vanessa redgrave captures perfectly the quiet desperation the character feels towards the end of her life another great achievement is the visuals of the film the scene on the beach where robbie and two of his fellow soldiers are walking among all the chaos is astonishing as its how closely they managed to portrait bryone at all stages of her life overall is no less than a masterpiece it works as a brilliant adaptation but it also stands on its own its impossible not to be affected at some degree by the film whether its for its love storythe chaos of the war or the desperation of guilt although it didnt have a place at the oscars it will certainly be a reference in the coming years,sad
thats a fitting description of this overhyped film apparently period clothes war  scenery are good substitutes for a solid story beautiful scenery  cinematography but ultimately does not deliver what all the critics say it doesit doesnt have much substance if you watch it carefully youll see what i mean the storys main factors are the supposedly heartbreaking separation of two young people  the for the one responsible for it however were never really shown that they are in love it seems as if theyre merely horny teenagers ironically robbie rightfully states at one point that all they had were a few moments in a librarybased on the book by ian mcewan revolves around the wealthy tallis family  a horrible incident one summer briony saorise ronan is a precocious 13yearold with ambitions for a writing career she has a crush on robbie james mcavoy the familys servant boy cecilia keira knightley is brionys older sister a young moody bored heiress were shown that she runs hot and cold towards robbie hes well mannered respectful ambitious  generally a nice young man this nice boy writes a vulgar letter to cecilia with whom he is infatuated he accidentally gives it to briony to deliver thinking hes sending an apology note briony reads it then gives it to her sister it serves as a catalyst for the initiation of r  cs relationship  they have sex in the library thank god for dvd id recommend fastforwarding thru the sex scene like i did its unnecessary as all such scenes stupidi also got the impression it was long briony walks in  sees them thistogether with the letter  brionys previous witness of a suggestive encounter is crucial is twisting brionys imagination for the worst she then falsely testifies that robbie raped her cousinthats the set up for the movie the majority of it is told through a series of flashbacks and time repeats were never shown why r  c should be together why theyre in love yet the movie forces you to sympathize with their plight robbie spends some time in jail but when offered the choice of going to war he does cecilia shuns her family  goes on her own to wait for him because shes suddenly so in love briony decides to punish herself by forgoing university education  choosing to train as a nurse director joe wright doesnt bother to show the heart of any of these events their beginning or the gradual effects on the characters youd think he would considering that theyre the major consequences of brionys actions  crucial to the story he just plops you down in the middle of it and youre expected to feel r  cs pain the tallis familys pain at cecilias estrangement  brionys repentancethe movie does give some feeling of regret and hopelessness but its mostly superficial  not for r  c its for robbie as an individual stuck in the horror of war when he doesnt want to be and for briony as someone trying to atone  find peace with herself some of the war scenes couldve been replaced with scenes that give the movie a more solid foundation it just feels too heavyhanded and halfway as if the makers intended it to be great but got lost in production details  forgot small things called the script  plot great job with the production though use of extras sets visuals and camera work are commendable knightleys wardrobe seems a little risqu for the 1940s  i suppose it was to emphasize the physical attraction between her  robbie on which their relationship seems to be basedthe performances were generally good a little overrated mcavoys character doesnt have enough to leave a strong impression he does well with what he has as hes done with his other roles ive seen hes natural  not distracting from the character knightley is same old same old despite the script she couldve shown more depth she needs to change her body language for roles  stop talking like theres gum in the back of her mouth shes overrated by the critics imo but at least she doesnt give the on cue rehearsed feeling that rachel mcadams does all three brionys ronan romola garai  vanessa redgrave in chrono order are well acted although i thought the older two couldve been more coordinated with the younger ronan is excellent esp with the english accent i believe shes irishi wont state any other spoiler im glad i didnt see it in theatre its nice not great  didnt make me want to talk about it unless its to say how it couldve been better it doesnt live up to the novel  i wonder if the author is pleased,sad
im surprised this movie didnt get more oscar nodswins than it did they took a brilliant novel and distilled and reworked it into a brilliant film translating the intricacies of mcewans writing into fab cinematic details like the use of rewind the long tracking shot at dunkirk and that awesome typewriter clacking fused into the score loved how little older and oldest briony all have the mole and pinned hairas an adaptation of a literary work i think this ranks up there with scorseses age of innocencealways great to see vanessa redgrave too in anything,sad
this is one of my lower priority oscargolden globesnominated moviesas i had no familiarity with the novel and the perception of this film came off as being a wispyenglish period piece those reasons and also that this was shown in somewhat limited distribution outside of nyc or la up until closer to the academy awards so with that in mindi was resigned to seeing this film on dvd and probably long after the awards had been given outhaving finally seen thisi can say that while my curiosity was satisfied and i found stuff to like about iti wasnt as awed or overwhelmed as some whose comments ive skimmed herethe damage done by 13yearold briony tallissaorise ronanlater to be played by romola garaiin regards to the relationship between her older sister ceciliakeira knightleyand her prospective boyfrienda longtime family friend and grounds keeperjames mcavoyis deep enough to tear the two asunderright as england is being thrust into world war ii over the course of the movieall three principalsand of courseto an extended degreetheir friends and other family membersare affected in ways that are both profound and simpledirector joe wright paces this movie in a slowsomewhat detached way anddepending on your patience for artsydisjointed narrativewill either fascinate or frustrate there is absolutely no hurry to spell out the situationsor for that matter fill in any blanks that the story leaves to meit feels kinda like dirty pool being played heresureyoure drawn in and intriguedbut it seems to string the viewer out and then leave said viewer perhaps confused and even angry by the third actbeautiful imagery and attention to detail makes this film at least marginally above average credit cinematographer seamus mcgarvey and film editor paul tothill with that this movie is certainly a visually intriguing offeringbut as overall entertainmentthis could be considered a bit of a testwhere patience is more than a virtue,sad
being loved by two girls at once as for example by two sisters does not seem to be as much of a neat thing as this reviewer always imagined never having had the experience himself that is its not if one of the sisters has a mean streak and disposes with the common object of desire rather than seeing it being swept up by the sisterly rival in this case the means of disposal presented itself by a case of rape that too provided new insights into a heretofore murky area of human relations it took place at night in the park of the manor when all members and guests of that multitudinous household were searching for two runaway boys so there were a number of possible perpetrators but its curious that the victim had no clue which one it was although she like everyone else of the search party was presumably equipped with a flashlight or a torch as the british might say it is even more puzzling that said perpetrator was able to carry out his deed with one hand over the girls eyes to prevent her from seeing him and the other hand over her mouth to prevent her from crying for help  a properly dressed girl of the english upper classes it is true pantyhose hadnt been invented yet and this being the middle of summer even those famous british knickers had been dispensed with as we observed gleefully when the older sister took a dip in the fountain  but still the dresses were long and cumbersome what comes across as not less puzzling is the english criminal justice system that gives more weight to a 12year old girl of a known fancy disposition than to a series of character witnesses which were hopefully heard plus the fact that the accused was at the time of the crime in another area of the grounds actually finding the missing boys if taking the story seriously one begins to wonder in light of these puzzles i whether the claim of rape was actually a coverup of an inopportunely caught dalliance and ii whether the british class systems preferred way of dealing with an unpleasant incidence is the quick conviction of a middleclass patsy rather than an earnest investigation that might lead to the unfortunate discovery of one of their own however the film does not give strong enough hints that the storys author had such possibilities in mind however while the film placed all the guilt and remorse on the young girls shoulders and showed how she suffered under it for the rest of her life it should certainly have shed some light on the thoughts and feelings of the rapist or surprised lover whatever he was he was the really guilty party one might be led to think that he was completely oblivious to the harm he caused to others but displaying this contrast clearly would have rendered the movie more complete and possibly ameliorated those slightly unconvincing events at the beginning speaking of unconvincing events that the british were not further tackled by the germans when they scrambled from the continent at dunkirk is wondrous but historically true that some or at least one of them got in the middle of that cacophony his feet washed by a french woman must be classified as utter piffle or was that to be taken allegorically oh stupid me,sad
this movie wasnt awful but it relied on too many tricks of flashback and closeup angles to try and disguise it as great cinema the first part of the film was okay but honestly didnt spend nearly enough time developing the characters of keira knightley or her lover to make their love story plausible just lots of long looks and confusing sexual tension and an absurd scene where keira knightley strips down to her knickers to dive into a fountain to retrieve part of a vase that got broken right in front of the servant lover in broad daylight no less even if the affair were true any young woman of high status at that time would never imagine doing such a thing discretion would be a main priority i just couldnt really care about these characters  briony for her ineptitude and selfishness and keira knightley and her lover cant remember the actors name for their lack of chemistry honestly they borrowed the sex scene right out of the english patient which i think was the feeling and greatness they were hoping to achieve but they didnt get there better films of this genre include the above and also the end of the affair with julianne moore and ralph fiennes also check out the old brief encounter by director david lean,sad
what is there not to like made me sad actors did a brilliant job and screenplay is great this film is a perfection the osacrs were wrong i think this deserved best picture screenplay costume design best director and best leading actor maybe something more can make you sad it can make you laugh it is absolutely perfect is very realistic and it looks cruel that is why i love it all the three briony actresses are great and they are very identical in their times rocks the book is not so close to the film and i think that the person who reads the book wont like the film i was reading the book when i saw the film and the first part of the film is better shown in the book,sad
first of all the movie was not as original as they claimed it was going to beit was nowhere close to being as good as pride and prejudice i have no idea why this movie was so acclaimedthere also seemed to be a lot of wasted footage while the long pausing scenes usually intensify the feeling they are trying to express these scenes just seem to be fodder to make the film movie lengththe acting was good though nothing so memorable to nominate oscar worthy but the part that got me the most was the repeated line come back come back to me i kept waiting for them to addcome back to cold mountainoverall not a bad movie i liked it i didnt love iti wont buy it or even watch it again i will add that the cast did an overall good job i mainly think the writing and directing just got a little complacent with having previous success,sad
wow i cannot understand for the life of me how this received 7 oscar nominations i dont know what movie they saw because i did not see the same one that is for sure this movie was very very flawed in almost every regard the only redeeming value was the acting was somewhat decent the plot however was boring the script jumped all over the place and i had no emotional attachment to any of the characters i could have cared less about what happened to anyone in this film i can usually understand why certain films people like even if i dont like them just as i despised american beauty because its sick but at least i can understand why others might like it this however was extremely slow moving the socalled love story was practically nonexistent and the over all feel of it was that of complete laziness dont bother to watch this unemotional snoozefest,sad
joe wright directs this beautiful story based on the ian mcewan novel thirteen year old briony tallissaoirse ronanoften stands at the window of her familys enormous mansion and lets her vivid imagination breed ideas its 1935 and this dubious young girl of privilege and wealth sees herself a fledgling writer she thinks grandiose and drama on a hot summer day she thinks she sees something between her sister cecilakeira knightleyand robbiejames mcavoy the son of the estates grounds keeper her crush on robbie and jealousy drives her to accuse him of a salacious crime he did not commit to reduce jail time the young man will choose the military during wartime briony for years will be haunted by the irrevocable harm she caused her beautiful sister and the man she begs to come back to her she wants to confess her horrible lie it wont come until she is ready to publish her 21st novel entitled the scenery is as lavish as it is at times harsh knightley is so ravishing she can carry this two hour movie through its dismal moments the finale finds the veteran actress vanessa redgrave playing briony and this sequence will make your chest cave in and breathing almost stop there may even be a tear or two as you try to swallow with a throat dry as attic dust in time this movie will prove to be a classic the cast also features romola gari benedict cumberbatch juno temple julia west and patrick kennedy,sad
this film is an instant classic as everyone fully realizes however people should not be making such a fuss about james mcavoy and keira knightley just because they played the romantic leads in the film which of course they did very well indeed there are easily a hundred actors and actresses who could have done just as well in these two undemanding parts what is easier than to gaze longingly at someone i do it every day at my wife and no one has given me an oscar yet perhaps because i am not actually acting and the idea that keira knightley should have won a bafta or an oscar rather than marion cotillard is absurd and thank goodness she didnt and that sheer genius was rewarded but that said this film contains some truly spectacular performances which made the film a success the first is that of the thirteen yearold saoirse ronan who in the story commits the terrible act for which no is possible she well deserved her oscar bafta and golden globe nominations without her the film could have been tepid as its core would have been weak the other amazing performance is by that genius for all seasons vanessa redgrave whose appearance at the end makes the whole film click into perfection there are excellent supporting efforts from harriet walter fancy her dressed as radclyffe hall whatever next i ask you juno temple fresh from her success in notes on a scandal maybe she wants to become a screen goddess now having become bored with being only a roman one and frankly all the others having achieved such a triumph it seems pointless to repeat all the welldeserved praise which has been lavished on this powerful film which has burnt its way into the hearts of thousands with its searing story of remorse ian mcewans story joe wrights direction and christopher hamptons wonderful script have combined with the whole cast and crew to make a masterpiece yes virginia there is a santa claus as well as a sanity clause and yes there is still a british film industry,sad
well two of my best friends thought it to be a masterpiece also a teacher in the university recommended it well well a masterpiece it was not thats for sure interesting definitely well made absolutely a masterpiece certainly noti think the symbols in the movie were the most interesting thing about it water and drowning represent the dialectic between passion life and death i also liked the fact that it turned out the whole movie was a novel so almost everything about it was fiction so wheres the problem youd ask simply put it was too americanhollywood stuff something thats meant to win an oscar in the end it didnt but im sure the intention of the producers was the golden statue in my opinion the way the director presented the old writer in the end was the worst possible she simply tells us everything no ambivalence no art no symbols what a waste my god anyway to summarize it could have been a lot better the way it is its just good nothing more nothing less,sad
first off let me say that this is an extremely well done movie and i wont be surprised if it does indeed take the best picture honors tomorrow the acting and directing are outstanding i saw a lot of reviews that said keira knightley didnt do as good as job as others but i thought she did a passable job the cinematography was amazing as well as the musicnow on to why i only gave it a 7 i just didnt care it took 45 minutes for it to start getting at least somewhat interesting but im not really much of a romance fan either also i thought the character of briony to be a nosy little brat and i couldnt stand her at all not even at the endif you generally like romances it will be tough to find one done better than this but if you dont like me you can at least appreciate this movie for artistic reasons,sad
the first half of is so deadly slow and dreary in spite of the spectacular cinematography of seamus mcgarvey however the ending captivated and blew me away vanessa redgrave surprises as an old briony now near the end of her days talking about her latest and final novelan autobiographical story she confesses i dont expect to be forgiven the touching irony of director joe wrights is that it is not briony may have spent her entire adult life in penance for what she did when she was 13 years old but ultimately she may not be forgiven director wright and screenwriter tim bevan who adapted ian mcewans novel tell a story of starcrossed love and profound sadness i really liked more than i thought i would i truly admired the craft of the movie more than the touching tragedy personal preference aside is a great movieit is 1935 england before world war ii we observe the world of upper middle class england precocious 13 year old briony tallis saoire ronan fancies herself a play writer her beautiful older sister cecilia keira knightley battles her raging hormones she has a physical attraction for robbie james mcavoy the son of the tallis maid robbie is the estate handyman briony too has an unrequited crush on handsome robbie the tallis have house guests in the quincey children lola juno temple and her brothers jackson and pierrot briony and cecilias older brother leon patrick kennedy returns home from school with his bud paul benedict cumberbatcha creepy young chapbriony spies cecilia with robbie in a compromising situation by the estate fountain robbie gives briony an accidentally enclosed letter for cecilia which she secretly reads before giving to her sister robbie mcavoy and cecilia knightley engage in a totally steamy and erotic tryst in the family library which briony witnesses then during a family crisis briony ronan perpetrates a lie that sends robbie to prison and cecilia is irrevocably separated from her true love though only 13 years old briony does not realize that her lies may have destroyed true love and more importantly the lives of people she lovesnow 5 years later robbie is in france in the middle of world war ii cecilia has left home and has become a nurse 18 year old briony romola garai has decided to leave cambridge to become a nurse like her sister this is her attempt to reconcile with cecilia what echoes throughout is knightleys plea to mcavoys robbie come back come back to me is punctuated by profound yearning of the heart and resounding sadness keira knightley is sexy amazingly strong and movingly vulnerable james mcavoy is compelling and compassionate throughout he embodies nobility in robbies suffering soul the surprise is romola garai as the older briony she is amazing as briony begins to realize the pain and suffering she caused by her lie years ago vanessa redgrave is powerful and sad as the old briony spent by a life in penancejoe wrights is touchingly sad life ends and at best that life ends complete however we can not always expect to be forgiven for our misdeeds and unintended cruelties so perhaps the best we can do is be at peace with life being incomplete there is no in and that may have been the point of wrights passionately moving story,sad
initially fails to deliver on any major level most of the time the plot remains fairly slow moving and somewhat routine hoewever it works due to the fact that it is very powerfully acted by the lead roles namely romola garai keira knightley saorise roman and james mcavoy you can tell that this story was initially a novel and in the opening sequence it is difficult to determine whether this is meant to be a musical or a period drama which it turns out to be on saying that unlike many clichd period dramas this one actually delivers something of subsidence in the form of the clever twist at the end the great tragedy of this story is that it shows what can happen when a child comes into contact with a situation that they dont understand and due to the time in which they are no one is prepared to give them any actual guidance as to how to behave or to respond to that type of situation we can be thankful i suppose that we live in the age that we do where people are a bit more clued up about male and female relationships then they were 60 or 70 years ago ,sad
this will be a short review because i refuse to add to the tedium of this movie and as someone who dislikes pushing a story to unfold too quickly for me to call this thing tedious is a big dealthe story such as it is revolves around young briony tallis who sees a few incidents that could be and are misconstrued after each incident the story jumps back and shows us that what she saw has an innocent explanation but she still uses them to send the gardener robbie turner to prison for a crime he did not commit then comes world war 2 and dunkirk and the story shifts to the long distance longing of robbie and brionys sister cecilia and how briony begins trying to atone for her liesof course the production values are good the acting is good kiera knightly and james mcavoy make a surprisingly acceptable couple sometimes the director gets a little carried away with things but not ridiculously so i got no complaints there and let me make clear  i have not read the book is based on so my only reference concerning this story is the movie but if the book is anything like this overlyselfimportant film ill never go near it i hate being lied to by a storyteller  and that is what this movie does about halfwayno maybe twothirds of the way through i wont say what that lie is but it all works around that ageold saying oh what a wicked web we weave when first we practice to deceive the movie should have paid attention to its own message,sad
very mild spoilers in this reviewthis was sadly another movie that was lesser than the sum of its parts i really loved the cinematography i actually really liked all the scenes too but the story as a whole didnt work because of the endingits the but it was all a dream ending again just one scene was a dream ie fiction of course but a very important scene i cant figure out why screenwriters think it works to trick the audience into thinking that one thing happens and then yank the mat out from under them and say but thats not really what happened after all its like the old briony said it wouldnt be a very good story if it had been told straight like it happened ie showing what really happened to the two lovers and then ended it the same applies to this movie which means that the story the real story in itself is not a strong one but it certainly didnt turn into a better story by adding a scene as a deceit and having the old briony explain what it all meant in the end this movie really showed me how incredibly difficult it is to write a good storyjust to clarify i dont mind dream sequences or even fictitious scenes as told by a character in movies if it fits with the tone and the audience either knows its a dream or isnt entirely sure but dont use it in a movie where every other scene has shown reality and the tone doesnt begin to suggest that this scene wouldnt also be real in its clearly meant to deceive the audience into thinking it was real in what world is that a clever or poetic trick to use well i guess its clever in a calculating waybetter to show a fictitious scene from brionys book and say that thats what it is after we have seen what really happened but that would be a totally different movie and the scene would have to be totally different and i dont think it would have helped the story of what really happened it still wouldnt have worked to show it straight before we get to the fictioni get that is about writing maybe thats the problem its about writing all right but at the expense of everything else since the characters arent real anymore in certain key scenes theyre actually characters their misery or sadness ultimately doesnt matter its all a conceit there is a right way of doing it though the comic book the sandman was about storytelling without sacrificing the characters or any of the other themesstill gets a 7 because many things about it were incredibly well done i think it couldve been a 10 if the story had worked,sad
i enjoyed the first act immensely it all takes place in one day and is cinema in its finest form simple acts take on mythical qualities the use of time and music gave energy to what would have otherwise felt to be a slow pace i was especially a fan of the subtle dark humor including the use of a naughty word i wouldnt have even thought to be in existence in the 1930s and a man telling a young girl to bite it you have to bite it referring to the chocolate hes given her very funny moments and in fact both become pivotal to the story the rest of the film is also pretty good just not as much so as the first portion i felt it became a bit too wwii clichd at times the casting of all the briony actresses was remarkable for likeness and talent and all the performances and filmmaking were still spot on but i found myself wanting more of the story what happened during his prison time i guess what was really missing for me was significant enough development of the romantic relationship i didnt really believe they could truly be in love i should also say i dont care too much for scenes in films that turn out to have not really happened still the second half of the film had some powerful moments and overall is an excellent motion picture,sad
i admit that i found this movie far too complex and full of upheavals than i could cope with the idea of presenting the centralflawed heroine in three different periods of her life was impressive and i admit that i was surprised by the final turn of events although i had a read a hint about that in a paper that i had not completely understood as for the actors i am a fan of keira khightley and i admired her performance she has i think found an idealtypus portraying upper class british girls with romantic leaningsthe actress who played briony was convincing in her role i am referring to her as a young girli can not but point out that the scenes in the beach with the soldiers were heartrending and were of hogarthian power i have such an ambivalent impression from this movie witch i think captures the real intricacies of actual life in times of political and social upheavals a description that actually includes every age the evocation of the english country side was fine and keira knightley swimming and diving was like aprodite coming out of the waves although she was a more anglosaxon aphrodite that the known mediterreanean one i would recommend this movie also on the grounds that contrary to hollywood clich it does not presents the plot as a thriumph of good over evil the real rapist marries the victim and becomes very successful largely because of the war robbie dies because of the waras a soldierwhich he became because he was falsely accused and cecilia dies during the war as many british people did due to an aerial bombardmentbriony is going to die because of illness but in an age that her death can not be consider as punishment for her sins so reality is not valued in moral terms and the plot has evolution that defies conventional notions of just retribution and crime and punishment the depiction of life in an english country house is also convincing and one might think that it could have been like that during the relevant age i very much recommend this film which i found of great sophistication british flair and moral ambivalence,sad
saoirse ronan who was 12 when the film was shot may have solidified the best performance by a child since jodie fostertaxi driver and should win the academy award she is absolutely mesmerizing as the young briny tallis and while there is good chemistry between knightley and mcavoy ronan carries the film this is not an anna paquin performance or the girl in whale rider being touching in that film saoirse is briny tallis just as danielday lewis is whoever he plays move over dakota fanning and the rest of jr hollywood because this girl is the real deal id love to see her take the path of jodie foster and not sell out like so many do stay in ireland saoirse go to college and hone your craft talk to mr daylewis if you have to,sad
okay now i went to see this film because people were comparing it to titanic a film in which i liked very much i also went to see it bc i heard it will most likely be up for an oscar the film for me however was an overall let down sure the film was artistic and had symbolism in it but the story told did not engross me on the screen there is no real build up of the love or connection between cecilia and robbie also there is no build up of the longing that robbie and cecilia feel for each other as im sure there is in the book so basically there is no real love story although there is supposed to be this left me with a rather flat view of the circumstances that were to be driving this film in titanic you get the feeling that rose and jack have loved each other all of their lives when in fact they have not know each other for more than a week in you only get the feeling that they have just met and that robbie would like to get back to cecilia when what you should be getting is the sense that these two lovers are meant for each other and there is nothing that either of them wont do in order to be in each others arms again i guess what this film is lacking is more obstacles and a lot more character and story development no way should this film be up for an oscar sure its artistic but arent films made to be entertaining engrossing and artistic if so there are more choices that i would put up for an oscar before,sad
i saw this film several days ago and let me tell you it is mesmerizing magnetic and moving it is a little slow at the beginning but once the movie gets about twenty minutes in it gets good it shows you all sides of the war the separation the death the horror that the soldiers had to go through it also shows you the result of one persons actions and then later regreti must say has gorgeous scenery just breath taking beautiful i cant find enough words to describe the alluring county sidethe acting was superb although the little girl at the beginning briney did annoy me a bit it has several twists and at the end of the movie it wraps everything up in a neat little package so you dont go home wondering what happened to so and so or how did that happenthe movie jumps around a bit but you get used to it and you see it is a very clever movie making methodall in all i loved this movie an film i really enjoyed seeing this it is worth it so if you get the chance i really encourage you to see it,sad
everything about the file was beautiful i did not read the novel and given the historical circumstances of the setting the battle of britain and the brilliance of dunkirk i was let down that they were relegated to mere background to the relationship of the three main characters i am an american man raised on hollywood and although love stories are not my favorite genre there was a chance to give a little something to everyone i wonder what was left on the cutting room floor the heroic work of the average citizen on the home front refusing to cave under the pressure of unrestricted air war and the heroic efforts of the navy and private citizens to rescue the army off the beach at dunkirk while not unknown on this side of the atlantic certainly are owed more that the limited attention given themrespectfully sr in ny,sad
it is a really really really great movie as i expected from joe wrightit was impressed me as much as pride  prejudicei really love the wrights style of directing which you can see in both and pride  prejudice moreover it has the fantastic soundtracks which make you cry or love or feel sorry for the characters i havent read the book but i will deserves the best picture at academy award and also james mcavoy was amazing he also deserves tooand one of the positive points of the movie was flashing back and flashing forwardthat makes the movie unpredictable in addition the locations which the movie was shut in were absolutely glorious,sad
i have just got back from watching this film and what can i say it blew me away not in the sense that you get from a good action film but the way in which the film unveils itself to the viewer you could say its slowbut then it doesnt drag the way the film goes forward then back was quite impressive as it explains thingsthis film is a must see at the pictures and reaffirms the resurgence in british films over the past decade or sothe scene of dunkirk prior to evacuation is depicted so well and gives one a sense of nationalistic prideas well as sadness due to the killing during wartimebloody fantastic,sad
what an amazing film the story line was just fabulous and the way it was told was so clever the thing i loved most about the film is how it jumps back to fill in the missing pieces of the story as briany finds out the truth for herself because of course shes writing the story and she says she wrote several drafts meaning she had to go back and change bits of her story and they did this just brilliantly wot a way to the film i thought it was going to be a happy ending but wot a twist the actors were also brilliant and i love how the film shows us just how easy it can be to misunderstand the most simple and obvious situations which are obviously confusing to younger people who may jump to the wrong conclusions i hope this makes sense as i have only just returned from seeing it at the cinema and its quite late sorry if theres any spelling mistakes too,sad
a young girls lie forever alters the destiny of her sister and the latters boy friend this is what we are told in the advertising for the best picture nominee of 2007atonementthe director should atone for giving us this kind of picture we are dealing with nothing more than a little brat who accused her sisters boy friend of molesting a younger cousin of theirsthe story would have been far more exciting if the class angle issue would have been emphasized instead the lad accused of the molestation was the son of a cook in the house despite his education and ambition to become a doctor no one believed him probably because of class distinction and as a result he suffered imprisonmentthe picture alternately fast forwards and goes back to make its pointthe ending is most shocking when some 40 years later the girl is now an elderly woman portrayed by the venerable hag vanessa redgrave as a child briony loved to write and it was probably her precocious attitude that stirred her imagination redgrave admits to the fact that the book that she has written was a take off on the lives of the young man and her sister both of whom really had died during world war 11 she is atoning for her sin in writing the book of how their lives should have beenof all people to play a person atoning for her sins vanessa redgrave that witch should be atoning for her 1978 presence at the oscars when after winning for best supporting actress in julia she delivered her diatribe against zionism practice what you preach vanessa and atone for first things firstas for the movie it is an utterly boring and is so slow paced that it could have been told in half an hour,sad

there are movies that come along every once in a while that leave you speechless is exactly this kind of movie after finishing the movie i was left emotionally drained and almost in shock of the sheer greatness i had just witnessed the combination of emotion fear beauty and all around excellent acting puts at the top of my list of favorite movies keira knightly stars as cecilia a stuck up english woman who is desperately trying to find her place in the world in comparison to some of her other famous performances in pride and prejudice or pirates of the caribbean she shows a similar side in yet she still gives an unforgettable performance she is aggressive yet poised and seems to know exactly what she wants despite the disapproval of others around her cecilia truly stands out with her strong facial structure and lack of emotion not often seen from women in romance movies follows her and robbies gut wrenching romance from start to finish and literally leaves you hanging on to their every interaction the gardener robbie brings out a side in cecilia that you may have never seen from keira knightly as an actress his simplicity and boyish charm is a surprising match for cecilia yet they are just so wonderfully meant for each other throughout the movie you can just feel the sexual tension brewing between the two leaving you wondering what will happen next james mcavoy robbie almost outshines keira in his acting due to the raw emotion he brings to the table the story line speaks for itself but the acting skills of mcavoy truly do stand out another stand out actress is saoirse ronan who plays cecilias younger sister briony throughout the film it is easy to see brionys longing to live up to her sister and outshine her in any way possible their conflicting personalities lead to brionys decision to alter robbie and cecilias lives forever due to misconception and immaturity briony commits an act that can never be forgiven although a young and fairly new actress ronan delivers an outstanding performance her haunting eyes leave you wondering what kind of evil lies within children and how far they will go to get what they want the combination of knightly and ronan truly is a perfect match both girls are very head strong and it is easy to see that they have probably never understood each other jealousy remains between them that leads to an exciting twist in the middle of the plot not only are the actors and story line absolutely outstanding the sets and costumes really tie everything together the movie is primarily set in an english manor in 1935 which gives the image of an old fashioned welltodo family while the movie also displays images of world war ii the combination of environments keeps the excitement rolling and also keeps the audience on their toes not only does the time frame change drastically so do the characters and the journeys they embark on costume choice also plays a big role in the movie as cecilia is portrayed a sultry woman and briony as a young child this juxtaposition also adds to their differences as characters robbie is obviously from a much lower class family than cecilia which is also portrayed through costume design this is another factor that adds to the many differences within the couple overall i absolutely loved this movie and highly recommend it the dramatic twists and turns constantly keep you wondering what will happen next gut wrenching emotion as well as unforgivable deceit make this movie one of a kind is an all around excellent movie that you simply cannot forget,sad
im not sure why this movie got such high critical acclaim i didnt think it was that good first its one of those movies that skips around the timeline which i dont particularly like it starts to become confusing just show the film in time order also the actors talk so fast i could only understand what they said by turning on the closed caption basically the movie centers on a lie told by a young girl briony briony sees her older sister and the house keepers son near a fountain and gets the wrong impression then there is a mix up in letters and briony reads the one she shouldnt next she catches her sister and robbie in an intimate moment in the library i think she is sort of jealous because she likes robbie too and also thinks he is a perv the twins run away and everyone goes outside and looks for them briony comes across her underage cousin with a guy in the woods her cousin claims she doesnt know who the man was briony didnt really get a good look but assumes it must be robbie and swears to it she lies be saying she saw his face when she really didnt this causes her sister and robbie to live in misery robbie goes to jail and her sister cant forgive her at the end we learn what happened to cee and robbie and briony does the only thing she knows to do to atone for her mistakethe surprise ending was nothing earth shattering the movie was just too long and it just didnt capture my attentionfinal verdict just ok i sure dont think it was worthy of oscar nominations,sad
this year ive fallen so far behind in checking out the films up for an academy award that this one is actually the first of the heavyweight contenders  and the ceremony is just two weeks away anyway this is a very british product exceedingly refined and therefore teetering on the edge of boredom  in short overrated and encapsulating what passes for an oscarworthy title these days given the films oldfashioned appeal and being unfamiliar with the work of director wright i was surprised by its flashy technique perhaps adopted to disguise the thin plot which such as it is doesnt really compel attention with the entire war segment and in particular the apparent necessity to present it in such detail ie not merely graphic but even reverting to unsubtitled french for a couple of scenes coming off as a distraction more than anything else the lengthy tracking shot on the beach seen during this segment is a valiant attempt even if again it doesnt present us with anything we havent seen before in countless warthemed moviesrather its the central idea of a single impulsive action by a child having terrible repercussions on an amorous young couple  and by extension her own life  which is the most interesting and sensitively handled particularly when during the moving finale its established that part of what has gone on before is purely wishfulfillment on the girls part incidentally shes the real protagonist of the narrative  despite the couple james mcavoy and keira knightley being topbilled the girl is actually played by three different actresses including vanessa redgrave  since we see her through various phases of her life  and all of them deliver fine performances the youngest in fact saiorse ronan has even been oscarnominated in essence this is a reasonably good film within the low standards prevalent nowadays  but as with most of modern cinema it doesnt really warrant more than a cursory viewing for me,sad
so now we know why the young must be protected from vulgarities and from sexual scenes because with vivid imagination they could probably be quick to jump to conclusions being unable to grasp and fully understand the situation at hand nor the gravity of their actions especially when theyre shooting from the hipinitially i thought i would be able to watch if i had managed to make my way to tokyo for its international film festival last october but i didnt and i waited and waited and when i finally managed to watch it this evening i felt that it didnt work for me no matter how much i can identify with the longing to be with someone and being unable to it contained themes i very much like but perhaps im beginning to get tired of it since they are somewhat negative emotions that do take their toil over a period of timeset in the 30s england just before the outbreak of wwii we get introduced to the rather aristocratic tallis family where we witness the budding start of a romance between cecilia keira knightley and the housekeepers son robby james mcavoy with the help of flimsy wet lingerie to bridge the divide separating their swearing of true feelings for each other however to sister briony saoirse ronan who clinched an oscar nomination she starts to see a different side of it made worse by a misunderstanding and in actuality a mistake robby made when he handed over a letter written with tongue in cheek and brain in the gutter yep you can say men think about sex most of the timeand that one single day had everything a loving couple could have wished for  the discovery and declaration of love the passionate love making but only for everything to come crashing to a halt when robby gets accused for a crime he did not commit and you can feel the disappointment and anger of course at the accusation because it was somewhat steeped in presumptions of class or the lack thereof and the hypocrisy coupled with seething rage as we the audience with knowledge of hindsight and the benefit of just knowing can tell that its so utterly wrong with obvious clues of course to who the perpetrator might bewhile we love to see the lovebirds coming together the movies more about the time they spend apart and that unfortunately somehow sagged the movie to low depths as we see them spend their screen time independently with mcavoy brooding over his life now in disarray as he volunteers for war to escape from the confines of a prison cell and knightley unfortunately becoming relegated to a support role which you can hardly feel her character her pain and her love for the man now so far away it is hardly any wonder why both actors missed out on oscar nominations not that it mattered because their roles hardly challenged what these 2 actors could have delivered the scene stealer turned out to be child actress saoirse ronan who is the cause of the turn of events though the mantle of her character get passed to ramola garai and vanessa redgravewhat made work though was the technical side of it the score was excellent and director joe wright pride and prejudice made sure it gelled so well with the visuals that it becomes an extension to whats on screen you cant deny that art direction and cinematography were superb editing was nonconventional but never confusing offering you both what is perceived truth and hindsight knowledge just as how briony would have experienced it but whats missing for a romance at least and the danger of having every technical aspect delivered so clinically was the absence of an emotional resonance because without it a romance movie can be pretty empty and soulless going through the motions without attempting to allow you to crawl under their skins to empathize with them and their sorry plighti had looked forward to with so much anticipation that i guess when ive finally seen it my expectation got deflated so bad that it turned out to be anticlimatic for me even with an ending that should have wowed and kept one thinking and discussing about the unfortunate futility of ones actions set in stone setting the wheel in motion and being unable ever to be turning it back,sad
my wife and i went to get her a pair of eyeglasses in west knoxville this weekend we were told the glasses would be ready in 3 hours so we had to go kill some time we went to downtown west several movies showing but we close to seeusually i do not care for british movies or what the golden globe say when it comes to the best picture of the year as i find the foreign press very critical of the usa in most cases so i really did not think this movie would be worth seeing but thought what the heckthe movie i must say is one of the best i have seen in many of years but be warned it is a haunting movie as when you leave the theater you are still thinking about it i suppose we all have secrets in our family that we or someone take to their grave but is all that and morei love the mail 2 characters you all know who played the young lady has beauty but it is a very natural beauty and the lead guy could very well be your best friend so they are very likable and the way plays out it is just 1 little thing that is seen from a young girls perspective that changes the lives or should i saw ruins the lives of her own sister and the boy she loved  is very emotional the scenes are as beautifully filmed yet very haunting almost cold at times it leaves you thinking and wondering what if dont we all have what ifs in our own life covers plenty and you see what you want not always happy but always what you perceive to be the truth  then at the very end the truth is revealedthe sad truth  no it is not a english fairy tale a very emotional ridei am going back to see the movie again so i can figure out a couple of other things even if you were like me and dont like most british films see it is the best i have seen in yearsthis should win the oscar but who knows ,sad
this is one solid movie and will no doubt win some awards mostly the technical ones i feelit is beautifully directed has a great score acting and cinematography one continuoustracking shot on the beach is worth a mention it was a very nice sceneone spielberg wouldve been proud of the movie can be a bit slow for some but it seems thats how these warromance dramas are just like cold mountain both the lead actors were good but i do not see them winning any awards for this oneoverall a great movie making spectaclei wont be surprised if this one gets the nomination for best picture,sad
every once in a while or perhaps every year there comes your usual epic love story what i loved about this one is that it doesnt play like an epic here is a story that is about making amends and a love that was so strong it became an individuals redemption the film opens in london circa 1935 13year old briony tallis saoirse ronan who can break your heart with those eyes is a blossoming writer who one day misinterprets a series of events that occur between the affair of her older and determined sister cecilia tallis keira knightely and the housekeepers son robbie turner james mcavoy a pure hearted leading man but one night briony accuses robbie of a horrible crime he did not commit and is condemned for five years later the love between cecilia and robbie is as strong as ever and they correspond while he fights the second world war meanwhile briony grows older romola garai an true star in the making and realizes the mistake she made but can she make things right again the film lapses between the points of view of the sisters and robbie as they go through their own struggles between the war and the home front this film is definitely worth seeing and on my top ten favorites of 2007,sad
if youre looking for yet another ww2 sadromantic tale with two gorgeous leads a precocious point of view and dependable turns and twists then this movie will be your cup of chi i think a second look will reveal a number of significant problemsfirst there are trronged party or thoubling improbabilities at the key plot point of the movie two young children have gone missing in the english countryside at night what does the household do send everyone out in groups or at least in twos to search no they go out alone including the boys sister who is a stranger in the area that my friends is a setup straight out of the b horror flick manualsecond after a supposed dastardly act has been committed against the sister when robbie turner the male lead and fall guy returns later that night with the missing children he doesnt act reasonably returning with the goods one would expect him to call out something like hey everyone i found them they were in the south meadow in a haystack cold and tired but no worse for wear or something along those lines in typical british casual humility instead he is suspiciously mute and cautious for no reason at allthird it seems no one including the police found it unlikely that an upstanding young man and semimember of the family chose the night of a hunt for lost children to rape a visitor and then as an after rape distraction go out and actually find the missing children when no one else couldif we can suspend disbelief about these several points then it works fairly well as a ww2 sad romance until the end that is where it attempts a deeper moral aspect the story jumps to the present where we discover what we thought was the action was actually a visualization of the plot of a new book by another member of the household briony tallis a now elderly author who is flogging her latest and possibly last book on tour the book is semibiographical in that events which happened to her and her family are the backbone of the plot the author has waited till the end of her life to admit a great wrong she committed as a girl to several people and had never taken responsibility for now that she has completed a successful literary career and is safe behind age and a disabling disease she will write about her fell deed well almost actually the book has a happy ending or as the author puts it a more hopeful ending the truth will be revealed only in a cable channel book tour interviewthe question i pose is did she alter the truth to make the book more hopeful or to be more sellable that is if she were genuinely interested in using her terrible experience to warn people about being overly romantic and leaping to serious conclusions based on impressions then why wouldnt she have written the book telling the truly tragic result of her actions instead she manufactures a happy ever after ending just as she manufactured a heae so many decades before by purposely jumping into a weed filled pond when she couldnt swim so she could be saved which leads me to a second point is it because briony never outgrew the fanciful view of life and herself in it that she confuses confession for is making amends or reparation or paying for someone elses wrong doing what she did was make a confession an admission of guilt and she did that halfssed,sad
i went to the screening of with a friend happy enough to see a free movie and not expecting much actually i am also not a big keira knightley fan neither so clearly i was just happy to be out of the snow and watch whatever was being shownis set through 30s and 40s mainly wwii and revolves around the romance of the young cecilia tallis and the family up keeper robbie turner through a series of candid naive and finally unfortunate events robbie is accused of a heinous crime at the hands of the little briory cecilias little sister the way this storyline and the plot are revealed and expressed was very original and effective in understanding what briory sees and what actually happens it is a perfect example how things arent always what they seem and makes one debate how much kids understand things and how reliable or guilty should they be of certain crimesat any rate needless to say robbie and cecilia are separated robbie is set to prison then war families are torn apart and as briory grows older she begins to realize not only the consequences of her actions but also why she did what she did which is just as important i do not want to reveal how the movie concludes and what happens to cecilia robbie and briory because the ending of the movie was for me the best part of this film despite how tragic or unfavorable it may be it was very original and movingthe actress playing little briory was very good compared to the one portraying the older one and i was even more mesmerized by keira knightley whose performance is do i dare to say it truly oscar worthy she should stay away from pirates of the caribbean and silly movies like that and show her true talent in movies of a higher caliber i was also very impressed with the visuals the backtracking of the scenes and the storyline and the actingoverall i highly recommend this movie,sad
without spoilers this is a film with a very clever ending  so clever that it changes the whole meaning of what has come before in about 20 minuteshowever getting to this point is tedious beyond believe the rather bland story is told with something akin to a squashed snails pace the acting from james macavoy is pretty average which matches the performances of the rest of the castoverall this is a powerful film but its powerful punch is only made possible by the cheap trick played in the last 20 minutes of the film worth a watch but not a second viewing,sad
after watching this wonderful film i was left with only two questions why the limited release and when will it be out on dvd this is a heart touching film with spectacular shots based on a very well written book its a film that after watching you want to go out and tell all your friends and family to see unfortunately most of them around me will have to drive several hours to see it the film seems to follow the story line of the book closely or at least close enough that the fog of several years makes up for it although some of the imagery from the book is missing aka you still have to read the book for that literature class it would be impossible to include the depth of the book the film is very well put together and running sounds and images help it stay whole over all a very good movie and one that is worth a second watch at the theater and well worth the drive on some level i think the film wouldnt be worth watching in a normal theater the audience in the theater where i watched it seemed both in aw and reverence to the film you could hear a pin drop,sad
the first half of the movie set in the oppressive heat and isolation of an english country estate is perfect the overelaborate wallpapers the richly carved woodwork the overgrown garden grottoes and the still ponds create an atmosphere of ripe forebodingthe second half of the movie however set five years later is extremely disappointing after such a powerhouse opening i for one was waiting for the big twist the surprise the payoff that every reviewer had been talking about it never came the first half is tightly and elaborately plotted the second has no plot at all robbie and cecilia meet for tea robbie wanders around northern france cecilia does nothing at all and briony washes bedpans theres no real sense of passion or longing between the separated lovers and if we are to believe that briony has volunteered for such menial work as a kind of selfinflicted punishment she bares her lot so stoically that we never get a sense that she is suffering in any way whether physically or emotionally the constant announcements of three weeks later or six weeks earlier unnecessarily complicating the timeline of events has the viewer questioning the veracity of the hidden metastoryteller long before the supposedly surprising last actthe fact is that none of the plot turns those that the washington post describes as reverberate in a series of excruciating twists come as any real surprise the viewer knows that the moment robbie neatly folds up his dirty little note to cecilia that hell mistakenly pick up the wrong one just as we know that when he passes it into the hands of briony shell not resist the temptation to read it we know that briony given her state of mind will accuse robbie just as we know the identity of the real culprit who has been leering at every underage girl in the vicinity for the last half hour while being able to predict every turn of events may build a certain degree of fateful dread it does not constitute excruciating twistsjacqueline durran who created the grittily authentic costumes for vera drake does an equally stellar job here with sarah greenwood production design and seamus mcgarvey cinematography the three of them effortlessly recreate the world these characters life in able to bring something fresh and original to settings that have been recreated a thousand times in movies over the years the entire production is of the highest quality and the performances are universally excellent but for me at least the narrative was predictable and the story lacking in real passion or tragedy,sad
note to self dont get cute with events in historyis a very good film with superb individual performances and lovely cinematography when writing about an event as well recorded in history as the dunkirk evacuation why try to stylize it with absurd surreality the ferris wheel circus horses and singing choir did nothing for the story a grittier more realistic depiction would have been more appropriate when writing about and filming war regardless of the romance the end products realism will always be held up against true war movies like band of brothers of saving private ryanthe story is conceptually great but with a few holes the viewer is expected to believe a sensitive 13 yearold aspiring writer can be such a wicked bad seed as to send an innocent man whom she loves to prison by maintaining a fabrication through a trial a trial that glaringly doesnt exist in the story,sad
i have seen this film on its opening night and with all the hype what a good idea it was to book the screen was sold outthe build up to has led me to expect nothing less than perfection and that was delivered with an effortless performance by kiara knightly and james macavoy brilliant chemistrythe film amazing centred around a lie a lie that is a mixture of spite and doing the right thing the talented briany tallis destroys the life of her sister and love to settle her feelings of unreturned love and belief in her naive 13yr old misconceptionsthe story splits after a passionate show of affection in the library followed up by the lie that will destroy not only the liar but the pair who never came back to one anotherthe mid section sees the life of briney jump and show kara and james torment over there love ripped away from under them briney trying to repent reveals she never came clean she explains how she never could undo the lie but how it had destroyed her and how she in her novel gave for her sister and robby james,sad
my friend told me that this was actionpacked he said it was like rambo but better well he was wrong because this movie sucked it was 4 hours of boring romance its about these two people who love each other a lot and thats it it was so boring i almost fell asleep i mean seriously this was gay reall really really gay i felt like i was watching a straight brokeback mountain this was so gay if youre a straight dude and you really genuinely enjoy this movie then you better check yourself to see if youre gay because this movie is really gay its like a long lifetime movie for chicks and homosexuals only it is really gay,sad
i had seen many reviews for this film based on the popular novel of the same name and heard about many award nominations and wins and the critics gave it five stars so i thought why not give it a go basically the wealthy and privileged tallis family in 1935 live in a large mansion in the countryside the main focus family members are the sisters thirteen year old briony oscar bafta and golden globe nominated saoirse ronan and the older cecilia bafta and golden globe nominated keira knightley briony is an aspiring writer and she sees an incident down below at the fountain involving cecilia and robbie turner the last king of scotlands bafta and golden globe nominated james mcavoy son of a family servant who wants to attend medical school but we see their side of the story as an innocent mishap briony has a crush on robbie for some reason he writes a letter with highly sexual intentions including the c word in it instead of a true feelings one and briony reads it first making her think he is a sex maniac this is fuelled more when she spots them having sex in the library of course we saw the other side of this incident as well but fuelled by jealousy and high concern briony witnessed her cousin lola quincey juno temple being raped but she purposely falsely says it was robbie three or four years later he has spent in prison but he is allowed to be released if he agrees to join the army for world war ii which he does agree to do and cecilia meanwhile has become a nurse for war soldiers and victims eighteen year old briony romola garai has also become a nurse in london supporting the war effort by now she has realised the damage she has caused to her sister and robbie and wants to atone make up or apologise for her actions she starts by finding the true rapist of lola it was robbies friend paul marshall sherlocks benedict cumberbatch who is now engaged to the older lola and after their marriage she confronts this past truth cecilia and robbie do reconnect before he is shipped to france but it is not long enough and their love never truly flourished once again as his fighting became imminent and her hospital duties got in the way too the end of the films sees the older briony vanessa redgrave is talking to an interviewer anthony minghella about her new book an autobiographical novel telling the truth about really happened in her past flashbacks reveal that robbie did not die in action but from a fatal illness and cecilia died from drowning inside an underground room but to atone make up for or apologise for her actions she wrote an alternative ending for the lovers in her novel also starring little voices brenda blethyn as grace turner patrick kennedy as leon tallis julia west as betty harriet walter as emily tallis and daniel mays as tommy nettle knightley and mcavoy give fantastic performances as the lovers that never truly flourish to the extent you want young ronan gives a brilliant performance with her time on screen the war scenes are reasonable but of course the tragic love story is the most watchable part a splendid period romantic drama it won the oscar for best music for dario marianelli and it was nominated for best art direction best cinematography best costume design best writing screenplay based on material previously produced or published and best motion picture of the year it won the baftas for best british film and best production design and it was nominated for best cinematography best costume design best director for joe wright pride  prejudice  2005 best editing best make up  hair best music best adapted screenplay best sound and best film and it won the golden globes for best motion picture  drama and best original score and it was nominated for best director and best screenplay keira knightley was number 9 on the 50 greatest british actresses very good,sad
had potential but in the end was pointless and stupid some good directing and music but horrible story 1 viewing,sad
this movie is a waste of my time i dont know how it got 10 stupidest movie yet,sad
i cant forgive the image of british soldiers at dunkirk riding on a fully lit big wheelthis is wrong on so many levels that they are almost uncountable,sad
i was left with a bitter feeling at the end of this movie after hearing the elderly briony tallis vanessa redgrave explain to an interviewer how she manufactured the extended love story between her sister cecilia keira knightley and lover robbie turner james mcavoy granted and while putting things into perspective young briony saoirse ronan at the age of thirteen was not only mistaken in her accusation about robbie but was also in a bit of revenge mode after being rebuffed by him after the fountain drowning incident her twenty first and final novel was meant to put to rest her conflicted heart over the matter of destroying two lives but her means of at that point had no conciliatory effect on the way i felt about her character would that the relationship between cecilia and robbie have turned out the way it did following the war and its aftermath but it was all a fiction concocted by the troubled author in a way its a story that never happened at least as far as the latter half of the picture goes so it left this viewer feeling as if he had been strung along i dont think we had closure on chocolate heir paul marshall benedict cumberbatch and lola quincey juno temple either as their relationship further damned the future of cecilia and robbie as well they could have come forward to contradict brionys story when she was thirteen without jeopardizing their reputations although to be fair lola was a kid at the time too and was certainly scared about what happened between her and paul so ultimately all thoughts of a tragic love story between the principals was shattered by the end of the picture leaving me with only a degree of measured contempt for the author who couldnt or wouldnt take responsibility when it mattered,sad
i watched for probably the fourth time tonight and i had goosebumps pretty much all the way through the film it is a beautifully shot film and the actors portray their characters in such a real and organic way the scene where they are filming on the shore line in france with all the soldiers scattered across the beach this scene is was a particular moment when i was just astounded by how well shot the film was there are no scenes or moments that are wasted i felt that every little detail of every scene and every word said was crucial in telling the story at the end of the film we find out what became of cecilia and robbie and it is just heartbreaking but the impact of the film relies on the two characters fate and it really hits home just how one mistake one lie can change everything this film for me is just perfect i love absolutely everything about it especially the cinematography the score also is really important in building tension and the use of the type writer sound effect was just genius i highly recommend this film it wont be everyones cup of tea like all films are subjective but for me personally i highly regard this film and it would have to be on my list of my favourite films of all time keira knightley and james mcavoy are wonderfully talented and this film is a great showcase of that,sad
tonight i watched for the fourth time the film based on the book with same title written by ian mcewan i remember the first time i watched this film it was winter of 2007 and i had gone to the cinema with my sister and our parentsthe film came to an end and i remember myself not wanting to leave the room it was the first and only time i felt like that even though i was so young i felt so enchanted and heartbroken that i didnt want to leave the room until i dont know whatthis film is about forgiveness the main characters are three young people cecilia robbie and briony cecilia and briony are sisters with the first being some years older than the other robbie is a young man to whom both sisters feel attracted to but when by mistake robbie gives briony a letter to forward it to her sister in which he admitted in a vulgar way that he wanted her briony feels betrayed by both cecilia and robbie and takes the decision to destroy both of there lives by testifying false that she saw robbie molesting on her cousin lolapolice arrested robbie and gave him the choice prison or army he chose armyas years past cecilia grew up to become a nurse and briony was being prepared to join university but in the last minute she decided to become a nurse too thinking that this was the only way she could help and in someway erase part of what she had done some years agothe film follows the lives of the three people robbie facing the cruelty of war cecilia helping in any way she can the soldiers and briony never having forgotten of the awful thing she had done just before the end we see cecilia and robbie in their home living a happy life after war with him still facing some difficulties and briony visiting them to apologize which apology was never acceptedand at the very end we see an old woman giving an interview shes briony tallis the well known writer who gives an interview regarding her latest novel as she explains the end of the book is imaginary because cecilia and robbie never met again after the arrest they both died some days apart and this book as she says has a happy ending not because she wants to lie to people but because she wants to give the two lovers the ending they deserved but never had because of herthis film is truly a masterpiece i wouldnt have watched it four times if it wasnt and for the first time i feel that the film is better than the novel keira knightely and james mcavoy are outstanding they give the passion and tension their characters deserve i give this film 10 out of 10 stars there is not a single thing i didnt like or i would change this film makes me cry every single time not so much because of the two lovers who didnt have the chance to enjoy their youth and love but because briony lived a life in guilt she was responsible for destroying two peoples lives and not only that she never had the chance to do the right thing and after the end she dies with her memory faded from some disease and now im thinking of it maybe thats a gift given to her because she had felt truly sorry the gift was that she would for once feel innocent and kind having forgotten of what she did she diesread more reviews on httpbedtime reviewsword presscom,sad
is awesome it is a romance movie but the film dwells on a lot of other subjects such as regret forgiveness and hatred james mcavoy plays robbie who is falsely implicated by 13 year old briony played by saoirse ronan who gives an oscarworthy performance the casting is wonderfully done and the editing seamlessly fuses three separate generations together ultimately briony realizes her fault and is unable to make amends as robbie and cecilia are unwilling to forgive her the visuals are realistic and the attention to detail is palpable there is a brilliant scene in which briony comes to robbie and cecilias home to apologize for her mistake and james mcavoy gives a verbal thrashing letting out all the anger built up over the years it is a stunning performance and is incredibly acted by everyone involved in this scene as the movie is just a little over two hours the movie flies by without leaving the feeling that any scene is dragging on needlessly is definitely one of the best movies of 2007 and deserves to be seen by a wide audience,sad
first this would have got at least another a point in rating if the screenplay had not have been screwed up at the end fairly true to the novel except for the gross butchering of the story at the end which had a subtle way of illustrating brionys and the enormity of loss at her birthday celebration and the eventual presentation of the trials of arabellathis was so poignant in the novel and the eventual breakdown of her cousin was lost and omitted in the movie equally i felt the interview which served entirely for the purpose of exposition was cheap and lacking great performance by vanessa redgrave yes but could this not have been written to include the poetic implications that ian mcewan first transcribed albeit though a slight rip off of sonnet 18the cinematography provided a majestic look at landscape  even during the war the movement shots much like pride and prejudice were impressive especially in the scene at dunkirk which emphasized robbies disorientation nice film just disappointed with the last 10 mins,sad
in this war romance based on a critically acclaimed novel a girl through a series of misunderstandings accuses her sisters lover of a crime he did not commit and it subsequently changes all of their lives joe wright directs and keira knightly and james mcavoy star another successful movie from working title is a unique and sometimes powerful drama with shortcomings which fail to justify the number of academy award nominations its a good film but its overhyped the films selling point is its visuals which are exquisite the dazzling cinematography never fails to impress and the legendary single take dunkirk sequence is a beach scene to rival saving private ryans omaha beach battle sequence joe wrights steady hand keeps the film afloat and his direction emphasizes the tension and sometimes the emotional power that the interesting storyline conveys the visuals cannot be faulted although the film too often spills into style over substance territory still through the direction and staging many individual scenes are powerfulthe trouble is that due to the complex narrative the film keeps hopping between different events without coherency which blunts its impact the film isnt as powerful as it should be since the love story is rushed and underdeveloped and the war scenes are just soldiers walking around mainly acting wise james mcavoy does a good job and delivers on charisma and emotion with great success but keira knightly incapable of changing her voice even for one line rarely touches the viewer if she does its in a more distant way shes not as awful as some say but she just doesnt let her emotion through enough as for saoirse ronan shes striking at times but too one note and emotionless to connect to the audience properly why she was nominated for an oscar while mcavoy wasnt is a mystery overalls script is uneven and only sometimes delivers on the emotion beautiful as the cinematography is theres too much emphasis on visuals and not enough on the romance which makes the story hard to care about at times still that ending is a devastating sucker punch610,sad
indian films are famous for their happening base stories is based on a lot of happenings and occurrences so i think this film is same indian films but with a powerful structure same american films if you review the story you will find a lot of events which are accidental this problem is really unprofessional for a film at this level of production all problems refer to screenplay of this film and my comment is this that film production is really powerful if a film be based on accident film viewer do not believe film story and these films have no effect on their audience when you are writing a story or a screenplay you should make a logical structure for your story all events should base on a logical cause sometimes there are some accidental events in a film if these events do not be base of a film this is not a problem all audience accept these events if all the film do not base on these events if a film be based on accident and it can attract its audience and can make extraordinary sale same this is not reason for its screenplay powerful maybe this film contain of powerful director,sad
are you a sucker for happy ever after if so this is not the movie for you i usually enjoy movies that are set in the past and one could that keira knightly is one of my favourite actresses while the storyline was some what enjoyable the ending lacked any excitement it was rather slow and predictable i have to say that the worst part to watch throughout this movie was the ending at the beginning of movie you sort of figure that the couple will be together eventually after going through so much hardship that however is not the case as they fast forward to the future you realise that the sister was writing a booknovel and that the most important parts of the movie were in fact all a lie now i love happy endings and this ending was definitely not a happy one,sad

with his second feature film wright delivers a noholds barred sweeping romance with palpable echoes of classic epics such as gone with the wind casablanca and the english patient with their passionate love stories hindered or smothered by war egoism and human cruelty but at its seething core is really about the brutal painful awakening of a child struggling to come to terms with one senseless venomous act she committed and that haunts her the parallel with gone with the wind is facile and there are numerous sequences from a grueling hospital scene to a bravura war setpiece that are reminiscent of the latters epic grandeur and virtuoso unflinching cinematic approach but is something quite uniquean unforgettable combo of visual virtuosity romance and drama is a powerhouse motion picture superbly acted which reaches vertiginous heights of visceral intensity and immediacy by turns horrifying heart breaking and beautifully bucolic this has the guts and heart of an instant classic has 21th century cinema reaped its gone with the wind alreadysee my full review at httpmoviedatabaseemonsitecom,sad

i saw this movie when it first came out and loved it but forgot its name over the years finding it again recently what an utter masterpiecegreat script great story great direction great cinematography sound great acting great set direction great costumes and great editing if anyone knew how hard it is to have all these things go off perfectlyhow many movies have you seen where it was a 9 but the music sucked or one actors performance ruins it in witness all these fields of their own come together to make a work of art so complete so full and rich you feel like youve dined on a seven course meal after watching bravo to cast and crew,sad
ive a bit of doubt when i saw this movie for the first time well i only interested because of theres keira knightley name and i dont know james mcavoy except for his role as mr tumnus lol back then so i saw it lazily and unfocused but after i finally understand the conflict i said this  is  wow its amazing how a simple lie of a child can change the fate of two lover thumbs up for saoirse ronan she beats the main characters perfectly even she only appear in like 13 story not that i say keira and james mcavoys performance are bad but i just think that saoirses is better then im more fascinated again after i saw the ending its heart breaking desperating heart touching and beautifultotally recommended movie,sad
i watched a dvd release of this film and have to admit to being somewhat vocal in my criticism of what i perceived at first to be some pretty formulaic scenes the between the wars country house period drama can be irksome the brother and his caddish friend arriving in the open sports car the extended shots of a male lead lounging in his white singlet made me want to reach for the remote however as the movie continues and layer is added upon layer scenes which jarred at first become relevant until eventually the whole picture emerges this is the sign of great story telling no doubt helped by it being based on a very well regarded novel so even if you dislike the genre make the effort and you will be rewarded,sad
story based on the novel from ian mcewan this is one of the best adaptations i have seen if not the best this is a story about the power of lie story about guilt feeling of guilt and also as title suggests is a romantic but very sad story but it is also very beautiful and i liked characters form the movie because they were live characters very credible ones acting three actresses playing the same character in different time  ronan garai and redgrave are all great i would say most impressive is ronan who is not better then redgrave but considering she was thirteen at the time she was incredible james mcawoy gives a terrific nuanced and subtle performance his calm and intelligence is great he plays the calm intelligent but very self assured young man son of the maid just perfectly knightley also conveys her character in superb way in the beginning under a cold and sharp behavior you can see she is boiling pot of emotions and when they burst out it is really impressive then she plays passionate loving girl who also upon meeting those she considers enemy can be cold and sharp again all her three character positions are played beautifully i think it is a shame that those two did not get at least oscar nomination directing and camera this film is just beautiful full of great scenes you really feel what is happening hot summer afternoon summer night incredible chaos of beaches of dunkirk or chaotic scenes from hospital joe wright is really a master of moody scenes great one was the ling scene from dunkirk which is one of the most impressive scenes i have seen music very good and greatly put into the movie also very clever was the use of the typewriter sound in the beginning of the movieconclusion one of my favorite films beautifully shot with good music and great performances most notably form mcawoy and knightley who is also incredibly beautiful and wears the famous green dress also story is very good and it will not let you go long after the movie ends,sad
sadly i have read many articles on this film in which critics have pedantically pointed out the faults with this film yes no doubt there is always the risk of achieving historical inaccuracies when shooting films set in the past thats a given however to those who take pride in picking apart every single fault maybe you should stop wasting your time sit back and admire the sheer technological and performing brilliance of this featurejames mcavoy and keira knightley are two of britains most aspiring first class actors and in this film they really show it after all this film is a love story so the convincing chemistry between the actors is highly important luckily both performances fit this specification perfectly and what the audience are treated to is a romance which breaks all the boundaries the story begins on a country estate in southern england with 13 year old briony tallis an ambitious intelligent aspiring young play write upon seeing her sister cecilia tallis keira knightley by the fountain with gardener robbie turner james mcavoy she develops an irrational vendetta against the latter based a series of misinterpreted events through her childish imagination finally she accuses the cambridge graduate of a crime he didnt commit causing repercussions for the whole familywhat follows is a tantalising fast paced films which incorporates a healthy mix of elements which puts the film as a half romance half thriller the film splits off into a triple narrative exploring the lives of robbie cecilia and eventually briony as the country is struck by the effects of wwii here the film breaks new boundaries including a stunning continuous shot of the scene at dunkirk as well as the trials and tribulations of working at a wartime hospitalwhat is never lost is the chemistry between the lovers despite them being apart for much of the latter part of the film it encapsulates the struggles of putting a relationship to the test the film never looses out on its romantic side striking a poignant chord with the audience allowing you to really understand the deep connection between the two protagonistsin terms of its thriller elements the fast pace is achieved partly through its commendable score considered usage of typewriter noises during brionys scenes to not only achieve tension but to also exemplify her unfailing imagination additionally through successful characterisation we are able to view the changing emotions plaguing her as she comes to term with the wrongs she has committedall in all what this films represents is a pioneering adaptation which succeeds in delivering a near faultless drama consisting of all the right elements graced by superb performances considered camera usage developed characterisation and an emotional score this film will leave you stunned it successfully analyses the consequences of childish misinterpretation and the taxing battles for retribution and redemption in a context which keeps the audience guessing throughout this film is not just a film it is a love story thriller and even a war film all rolled into an emotional journey of determination which never fails in delivering82100,sad
what a film entirely unpredictable  and utterly compelling  is a breath of fresh air amid the countless stale remakes sequels and juvenile comedies that have been filling our multiplexes as of latei havent read mcewans book but from the trailers to this film i expected a romance i got it but also a lot more besides its as if a traditional romantic movie has been injected with a massive dose of realism to bring it into the real world with not always happy resultsone or two plot contrivances aside i was compelled by every minute of this production i also saw two actors mcavoy and knightley give fine subtle performances that i hadnt witnessed in either of them before especially knightley who i usually see playing simpering characters in the likes of those pirate filmsjoe wright  who also directed knightley in the 2005 pride and prejudice adaptation  does a brilliant job of getting the tone and mood just right his fiveminute tracking shot of the dunkirk beaches is breathtaking and on par with those seen recently in children of men and warrior kingkudos too for the inclusion of some unreliable narration in the latter stages something films usually avoid in fear of alienating viewers it works perfectly here,sad
is a brilliant adaptation for the screen of ian mcewans world war ii dark miscasted romance of robey turner james mcavoy and c tallis keira knightley the division of christopher hamptons brilliant screenplay into three principal parts first set prewar on an english country manor then four years later in the midst of the disaster at dunkirk and then 60 years later in postwar britain follows in the main the direction of mcewans popular novel it avoids the oppressive ennui of the first 50 pages of the mcewan novel by focusing directly on the major theme of the work the misinterpretation of an adult event seen through immature teenage eyes to emphasize the point christopher hampton uses a technique that violates the cardinal rule of story telling employing a multiple perspective on a particular scene the first part of the screenplay faithfully follows the book without venturing into the books tediumthe matriarch of the estate suffering in the summer heat from a migraine laments that warm weather leads to immoral conduct age 13 briony tallis cs teenage sister is particularly attentive having caught the servants son robey and her patrician sister in fond embrace in the manors library briony has persuaded herself that robey is a sex maniac when she spies her 16 year old cousin lola quincey juno temple out in the bushes with guest paul marshall benedict cumberbatch briony cries rape and accuses robey out of convenience or indifference the elite prosecute robey who is whisked off the prison with c crying come back to mepart ii of the movie is fairly faithful to the book indeed in part ii the action in the book becomes somewhat lively and interesting flash ahead four years robey is out of stir in the fire of battle on the continent with the john bull type tommy nettles daniel maysand the colonial sergeant frank mace nonso anozie nettles complains give the jerries the continent the french hate us anyway lets keep our empire robey promises a kindly french farmer that the british will return the colonial emblematic for what was to come drifts awayrescued from dunkirk robey reunites with c briony tearfully promises to atone to set the record straight is this a formula hollywood endingflash ahead 40 years to part iii for the surprise which is delivered with a bang the ending differs from the book the movie ending is well played and short but one wonders whether briony is atoning or braggingthe books ending is more drawn out and leaves a different question most subtly did briony make the whole thing upthe story is typically english with the long time gaps i might have thought robeys trial and conviction too interesting to leave out,sad
this movie brought me in tears the story was well written and impeccably directed joe wright certainly created a master piece ian mcewan should be equally credited and praised as he came up with such a brilliant story is a story about an act of penance that briony tallis  cecilia talliss younger sister  does in order to punish herself for a sin that entailed separating two lovers robbie turner and cecilia tallis  james mcavoy and keira knightley  by a wrong decision of hers in the past a man who was falsely accused of a crime robbie turner ends up in jail and after which he goes to war during the german invasion thus getting his dream of joining medical school shattered cecilia leaves her family for robbie and waits for his return from the war brionys false and juvenile accusation changes the lives of them for which she after the realization of the truth feels extremely sorry and thus tries to atone herself by giving up her further studies and working as a nurse it is a very emotional story that would definitely compel you to sympathize with the characters of robbie and cecilia a drama with emotions it is something that tells us about the human mind how abominable it is how fickle emotions are they can obscure the truth no matter how clear things are hatred envy and wrath  they alone can bring down the world they can mess up the life of those who stand in the way and one might not even get an opportunity to atone for those awful feelingsthe screenplay was brilliant the music was equally apposite the pace of the movie was really well thought of the moments of silence really gushed in thousands of thoughts to my brain what if nothing had gone wrong  what if the real miscreant was put behind the bars  while i watched wishing things to end happily it certainly did not albeit it brought a sour taste eventually but it also came with a queer satisfaction of the act of nourishing itself though with some bitter tinge of reality attached with itthe photography was lovely the plight of the soldiers was well depicted during the time of the war i didnt find anything wrong with the movie it was well thought of and was well directed an 8 on 10 would be my rating for this flick,sad
nominated for seven oscars including best picture and best adapted screenplay is the second major literary adaptation of a novel by director joe wright after pride and prejudice in my opinion is an overrated british period romance drama just because it looks great works like a shakespearean play and boasts a strong talented main cast does not by default imply that the film is oscarworthy while it deserves nominations in the technical categories and is generally an impressive picture is not as consistent as some of 2007s best filmsis a motion picture of two halves the first hour is thoroughly enjoyable the story centers around three characters  briony cecilia robbie  whose portrayals by saoirse ronan keira knightley james mcavoy respectively are excellent the screenplay is written in such a way that it incorporates the flashback technique which is vital for the film because certain scenes are seen from differing points of view and maturity level and are such interpreted in an entirely different contextfurthermore through the use of the sound of a typewriter oscarnominated composer dario marianelli manages effectively to bring about sudden changes in pacing by varying the  tuck tucktuck tucktucktuck  rhythm along with the editing all these elements make the first half a seductively thrilling one unfortunately the second hour is a far cry from the first we witness a dramatic drop in quality of acting mainly the fault of the supporting cast a lesstightly structured storyline and a director unsure of the films final objectivesstarted its decline after romola garai took over young ronan for the role of briony in fact the role of briony is very crucial to the film to ask three different actresses especially when the final twos acting capabilities are not up to the task to take such a demanding role is suicidal if not for knightley and mcavoy great visuals and art direction would have fared worse than michael clayton which i feel is the years most ridiculous best picture nomineescore 7510 wwwfilmnomenonblogspotcom all rights reserved,sad
is the second movie which brenda blethyn keira knightley and filmmaker joe wright work together this first movie was pride and prejudice 2005 the results well quite good indeed most people dont enjoy watching drama movies i understand why but watching is something else makes us feel human it does make us cry if you are sensible enough it is a work of art and probably the best drama of the decade intelligent touching visually stunning is the closest to perfection of a movie what could we want more joe wright gives a oscar worthy direction deep in every way keira knightley is provocative saoirse ronan is the girl who gives all the sense to the movie in other words she is the heart of the movie james mcavoy is passionate vanessa redgrave makes everyone fall and cry and the soundtrack is unbelievable dario marianellis best yet it is ladies and gentlemen a must see again,sad
an imaginative and spoiled child of a rich family accuses a servant of sexual abuse leading to tragic consequences director wright brings an astonishing visual elegance to the film so much so that many of the shots look contrived but one cant help but admire the beauty of the compositions there is a cutfree fiveminute tracking shot of soldiers on dunkirk beach basically wright is showing off with this shot but its still impressive not impressive enough however to nab him an oscar nomination for best director the acting is excellent particularly mcavoy as the servant boy and garai as his accuser at an older age seeking for her actions as a child,sad
the film is ambitious terrifically acted moving and for the most part transcends its status as a historical drama on a hot summers day in the 1930s in the grounds of an english manor house briony tallis saoirse ronan a budding author aged 13 tells a damaging lie about robbie james mcavoy the lover of her older sister cecilia keira knightley the lie changes all their lives with consequences that extend beyond world war iithis remarkably lavish visually ravishing film does full justice to ian mcewans brilliant detailed source novel director joe wright skilfully evokes the atmosphere of languid lust in the first act and surpasses himself with a nightmarish evocation of the chaos and misery on the beach at dunkirk brought to life in a single fiveminute tracking shot a short triumphant coda with vanessa redgrave as an older successful briony voicing her regrets confirms as a rarity a sumptuous spectacle with vast reserves of intelligence dario marianellis lush romantic score includes a theme featuring the tapping of typewriter keys a reminder that this is a story about storytelling,sad
occasionally a film will be made with such power and emotion that it will shake you to your very core is one such film a worthy winner of the golden globe for best drama and what in a different year could have taken home the oscar i dunno if it was just me but i was so affected by this film that i barely remember even leaving the theater afterward it weighed heavy on my mind for over a week it is the story of a young girls selfish actions and the consequences those actions have on the people she loves the most it is gorgeously directed by joe wright who had previously debuted with pride and prejudice watch for the tracking shot on the beaches at dunkirk flawless the acting is phenomenal on every level james mcavoy and keira knightley sizzle as two lovers whose fates stem directly from one misunderstanding saoirse ronan who was twelve when she did this film is a revelation as the young and naive sister of keira knightleyi will reveal no spoilers here but if you want an example of what happens fine storytelling directing and acting come together to make something beautiful and heartbreaking is your movie,sad

i didnt plan to write a comment because this movie is not very good at all the rating is at 79 and i dont see a big deal about this movie so i am writing my part of commentthis movie is over 2 hours long and i can summarize the whole story in one sentence it is just that simple if it were not for the good acting and good cinematography i would have stopped watching in the middle of it after an hour or so i just started to read a book while it was playing on tvit could be easily shorten to 1 hour and 30 minutes and still tell a story it is not an epic story it is just a silly jealousy story among sisters,sad
i saw this during its opening weekend in the theaters but never got around to commenting on it until now this is a film about a girl who fabricates a lie that sends a guy to prison and tears apart a budding love and to atone for her actions she decides to wear the same hairstyle for the remaining 70 years of her life briony tallis saoirse ronan is a spoiled 13 year old rich brat who wants to be an author her older sister cecilla keira knightley and the housekeepers son robbie turner james mcavoy have a thing for each other in a sexual tension kind of way but briony likes robbie too but robbie scolds briony down at the swimming hole and gets on her wrong side spying on robbie and cecilla she misinterprets something between them and grows to like robbie even less robbie writes cecilla a dirty love letter and they finally consummate their passion in a quickly in the library this is the only romance in the movie and your supposed to believe that it sets the stage for years of undying love between robbie and cecilla as they are separated forever by prison and war a family friend paul marshall benedict cumberbatch who owns a chocolate factory visits the taliis and ends up molesting their cousin lola quincey juno temple and he comes to the diner table with scratches visible but nobody puts two and two together lolas twin brothers run away one night and a search party is formed to search the estate grounds for them paul takes the opportunity of the secluded darkness to force himself on lola briony says she saw the rapist and it was robbie robbie is the only one who couldnt have done it as he is far away from the scene having found the lost boys and is bringing them back but everybody believes briony and robbie gets sent to prison only to be let out if he agrees to fight in the front lines of world war ii and on and on this ridiculous story goes in the screen adaptation of the ian mcewan novel by hampton ramola garai plays briony at age 18 and vanessa redgrave plays briony at 80 wonderful cinematography by seaus mcgarvey and production design by sarah greenwood with art direction from ian baile but its like a decorated wedding cake pretty to look at but not much dietary value except for the dunkirk scene i would give this a 55 out of 10,sad
keira knightley stars as a spoiled young woman in 1930s england who tries to deny her feelings for the familys housekeepers son james mcavoy but when she finally gives in to her feelings she spawns jealousy in her little sister saoirse ronan leading to false accusationsi guess its just not my day for movies set in a different time as this one has left me wanting more but definitely not anymore like this one i found myself watching this with only halfinterest when the film kept going in reverse and setting up what the younger sister saw then finding myself more interested as mcavoy found himself in the war trying to safely get home although the plot was finally understandable this film was all over the place and didnt spend any time setting anything up 4 out of 10 stars,sad
theres a rape at a british estate in the early 1900s and its unsettling to see how much impact a young girls word can have this movie is about the lasting impact of such a claim it walks through the years and depicts how peoples lives are affected  most notably the young lowerincome fellow who was accused and lady he lovesi can see how this story could be very powerful but in terms of this movie its doesnt quite work the first 14 of the movie sets up the incident nicely but the rest of the movie seems a bit slow id say that its even easy to predict there is a good plot twist at the end so aside from the beginning this is the other strong point of the movieif youve read the novel its a good bet based on readers reviews that youll like this movie for everyone else theres not enough of a sustained intensity to make this a compelling watch,sad
not having read the source novel i came to this muchpraised adaptation with open eyes and ears and left at the end impressed by its undoubted polish and keen insight into the damaged psyches of its illserved starcrossed lovers played with credibility and engagement by young talents mcavoy and knightley for me there were minor echoes of joseph loseys work of the 60s and 70s borrowing a little of the multiple viewpoint technique of accident and the retrospective narrativeframing style of the gobetween not to mention the latters shared theme of the innocence of teenage children corrupted by a tooclose proximity to the physical passions of their elders beautifully if a little showily shot and excellently played the careful plotting is stylishly arranged for the viewer and to me only drags occasionally with toolong scenes involving the hapless exiled goneforasoldier robbie mcavoy winding up at the apparently shambolic dunkirk beaches before the miracle evacuation took place and 18 yearold brionys scene at the hospital with a dying french soldier well shot and acted as these scenes are the former in particular featuring a toodeliberately flashy taragone with the windtype 5minute tracking shot passing through the dunkirk site for me pointed up a detrimental stylisation at play here and also slowed down the action too much especially as the final denouement is so effective in its ingenious invention and crisp depiction prewar england is beautifully conveyed in its mansionhouse glory but beneath the veneer of manners and respectability seething passions drive the inhabitants young and old to extreme courses of action which change their lives forever although built around the strong performances of lovers mcavoy natural and humane and knightley ethereal and passionate the remainder of the acting is also completely in simpatico with the three actresses who depict the maturing touchpaperlighting briony doing so to excellent effect if in the end a touch too mannered and clever for its own good this wellmade film shows that even today imaginative period drama can entertain far better than any number of comicbook hero extravaganzas sadly ironic in a postscript that this was one of the final appearances by another purveyor of quality drama the late anthony minghella in a brief almost unnoticed part as the elderly brionys tv interviewer one suspects he would very much have approved of director wright and his teams work here,sad
this is a visually ravishing feast based on the celebrated novel by ian mcewen james mcavoy excels and there is good support work from the likes of benedict cumberpatch and harriet walter i struggled at times with keira knightly i just didnt think she inhabited the part in quite the way she should have but this is a small bit of nitpicking joe wright directed this with exceptional flair the cinematography was excellent some beautiful compositions and the colours were ravishing and there was a real sense of scale to many of the big set pieces my reservations are that despite everything i wasnt as moved by the climax as i felt i was supposed to be i felt that much effort had been made to build to an emotional resolution but somehow it left me feeling cold something about it felt a little contrived for my taste i read the novel shortly afterwards and i can see that something about the climax is more satisfying in novel form,sad
devilishly beautiful graceful well played by actors but too pretentious film the bee on a window the tapping typewriter a falling down green dress flashes of lighters soldiers on a childrens roundabout pass of nurses on hospital corridors  the most refined show for eyes and what have as a hobby offered to what this magnificence to a final scene where briony in the twenty first  novel under the account on a life outcome has suddenly decided to wash away guilt to plain true what seeming innocent the lie can turn back tragedy it will be small nevertheless about a campaign on the given film at all i am not sorry  in grains of the great movie everywhere are scattered only instead of plentifully watering them from a watering can director joe wright thought of how it with this watering can will look more beautifully looks  no doubt,sad
it all begins as countryhouse intrigue with a touch of the gobetween crucial letters being passed and a confused child gradually overwhelmed by adult carryingson young brionys initial misunderstanding of an exchange between big sister cecilia and the housekeepers son robbie seems a valid premise but when robbie gets his letters mixedup it sounds a warning note that things might not proceed as subtly as hoped for and so it proves brionys shockhorror observations start piling up quicker than corpses in a christie  sex in the library between cee and robbie hightoned and balletic another handy letter the search for the runaway boys sex in the woods dirty and grubby between a pervy guest and brionys underage cousin  and before you can say gregory peck in spellbound which also leapfrogged over a trial very glibly  robbie the workingclass scapegoat is banged up in the slammer for rape on the fevered sayso of briony whod previously idolised him the leftwing playwright lillian hellman had employed a similar device in the childrens hour dodging the finer details of an enquiry in order to pour coals on the head of her chosen target the wealthy old lady whod dared to believe her granddaughters story human understanding goes out the window when a classwarriors on the march briony here is as much a victim of circumstance  or melodrama  as the hapless robbie but the film affords her no sympathy then or later she was only a kid for gods sake  but a child of her class nuff said its tempting to imagine that if robbie had been a trueborn son of the house the film might never have been made its also tempting to consider that if he had been a true gent he might have acted less like a chump earlier on  maybe maybe not anyway the family freezes him out on brionys evidence except for cee whose literally onenight stand has blossomed into true loveextending the selznick analogy we broaden scale into a farewell to arms one world war down the line cee is now a comely nurse in 1940 london and robbies a reluctant soldier released from prison to join the army after a pained parting modelled a little too clearly on brief encounter robbies sent to france where hes caught up in the retreat from dunkirk trudging across country to the beach he has a neat chestwound and two companions the regulation bolshie cockney and a large mysterious black corporal with his head bandaged who seems to have been parachuted in via the twilight zone from some regiment of political correctness rainbow division the big beachscene  much acclaimed  is the selznicktype setpiece a technically accomplished interweaving of impressionist elements singing tommies horses being shot simulated thankfully the crowds awaiting evacuation the inevitable brenda blethyn turns up later on in a dreammoment as robbies mum who bathes his feet prior to his crucifixion  back in london the adult briony also a nurse is introduced in a hospital scene rather like maria with the nuns in the sound of music we almost expect a number or two but no such luck she wanders around in a daze seeking redemption after gradually realising she got it all wrong through a series of amazing coincidences involving some fakedup newsreel footage that are totally unbelievable and the films clearest indication that its headed for a defeat that unlike dunkirk wont turn into victory she pays a visit to the reunited lovers begging forgiveness robbie gives her a blistering lecture and sends her off again to put it all rightanother leftwing heavyweight vanessa redgrave is enlisted at the end to apologise for slavery so to speak depicting briony as finally a cracked and dying old bestselling novelist disclosing in a television interview before the shockhorrified nation presumably that the confrontation wed just seen in the film never took place robbie had died from his wound in france and cee had been killed in a gas explosion on the underground suitably spectacular as this is a big film dont forget briony will put it all right by telling their story in her final novel and giving it a happy ending ingmar bergman would have had a fieldday with all this narrativetrickery and writers angst unfortunately joe wright and his unlucky screenwriter can only adopt a relatively headon approach in keeping with the nature of the production ingmar didnt do the odeon ironically a tad more of the selznick spirit might have salvaged the cottagebythesea old hollywood was fond of ghostly lovers david o certainly was his adored jennifer played a ghost in portrait of jennie and even pearl chavez in duel in the sun was reborn as a desertflower perhaps the real problem here is that the lovers dont register strongly enough in life to become potent symbols of an afterdeath they remain brionys creatures maybe they always were,sad
i read the book a month ahead to coincide with the film release in theatres last year i absolutely dreaded the book for its annoying superfluous details some details i liked others i found painful dull and boring i really liked the aspect of war in the booknow the film upon finishing the book i felt like my time was mostly wasted so i was rather cynical about the film i thought it moved too quickly and was cheesy at some points although the ending in the film stroke deep empathy in me oppose to the one in the booki recently viewed it again second time with my gf and i felt defenseless as the story unfolded itself still too quickly but rather heart renderingly painfully i felt the pain briony had felt the guilt agony and torment in which she tried to appease herselfi gave it like a 65 at first viewing and the book a 6 upon the second viewing of the film i most say it is the best film i saw this year the plot was much more sentimental than ncfom,sad
this film is a remake and it is based upon a depressing story the thing is compared to the other best picture nominees i have seen so far this one is the best it has a story that makes sense michael clayton  no country for old men fall short on thisit has some great camera work and outstanding british location shots the acting in the film is superior to the other nominees i have seen and it is based upon a better story than the others sadly the academy did a poor job in 2007 nominating films for best picture this is the only one so far that deserved the nominationthis picture did win the golden globe for best picture it is a solid film overall id rate it as a fine adaptation of the novel finally it is much better than no country for old men aka friday the 13th jason strikes again which should not have even been nominatedof course maybe the academy just wanted to play a joke on everyone by awarding a slasher film best picture the real joke is that intellectuals  snobs think it was the best one guess these viewers are both pretty dumbed down now,sad
well just like most of the good movies i watch i had to download to watch it since the city does not approve of bringing critically acclaimed films to the theaters lets all go and watch air buddiesthat too in hindi yaaa whateverwell browsing through imdb i found myself caught onto the home page of this movie read a review liked it didnt know anything about the story except that it was set in wartime england or something searched it up downloaded it watched it wow comes from director joe wright director of the critically acclaimed pride and prejudice2005 with keira knightley and james mcavoy and is based on the novel of the same name written by ian mcewan it also happens to be the movie that kickstarted the 2007 venice international film festivalwell all of that aside the first thing that struck me while watching the very opening scenes of was the background music its hooked with a typewriter and sounds like something ive never heard before its a very very integral part of the movie mind you and is something that might just make anyone godamn now why didnt i think of that  its only that gooddoes not have an ensemble cast keira knightley shows us how much it is shes matured over the years see this and compare it with her role as a bounty hunter in domino the results are shocking and outstanding the lead actor james mcavoy is someone you might recognize butwhats his name youll go he was the one who played the fawn mrtumnus in the lion the witch and the wardrobe and was also there in the last king of scotland a known face yet unrecognized by manyto put things straight the acting is spot on from the little 13 year old brionny tallissaoirse ronan who expresses situations oh so easily it seems to her older 18 year old versionromola garai jumping to her elder sister ceciliakeira knightley whostill thinner than you can imagine gives us as much of a visual treat as one can ask for it would come as something of a surprise to me if james mcavoy is not nominated for an oscar for his role as robbie turner he is what keeps you captivated to the screen young dashing almost flawless walking through a beachcamp no words nothing just visuals created not cgicertain scenes one being the long walk down the beach the only lovemaking scene of the movie in palled darkness passionate in a library amazingly done the five minutes where brionny sits and converses with a soldier in the hospital the very opening scene focusing on a herd of plastic animals as the young brionny applies finishing touches to her play the trials of arabella twice the opening music is played the exact same at both introductions to the young tallis one when shes 13 the other when shes 18 a genius conceptthe panning of the camera the cinematography the editingallowing you to look at something you want to for an elongated period of time and vice versa everything has a high amount of graphic detail making it even more attractive the musical jumps with the typewriter clicking in the background actually i could sit and write a whole review on just the background music of the filmthe story is simple about a misunderstanding mistaken innocence and perhaps a little more the desires of the young seemingly mature yet not so a juvenile crush revenge anger most of all jealousy ian mcavoy is a master storyteller one must read the book to get the whole impact of this brilliant story it is simply rivetingthe storyline being the main driving source of the movie you will be hooked from beginning to end its just the quality of the picture it leaves a benchmark for all the others is quite simply one of the best films of 2007 its a pity that us calcuttans arent allowed to go and see films like these in the theaters they deserve some amount of attention from the central board of film certification are you listening sharmila tagore a fair 810 loved the ending a lot and do i need to start blabbing about the background score again,sad
is beautiful every scene is a work of artthe soundtrack is incredible and the actors for the most part are pitchperfectwhich brings us to the reason i did not rate this movie ten out of ten in short it was keira knightley i honestly dont know what everybodys on about i found her acting stiff and coldthe younger bryony at the start out acted herher makeup and costume is also wrong in every scene  which really confuses me because everybody elses makeup and costume fit the times exactlyif youre gonna watch it see it for the other fabulous actors and try to bear through knightleys scenes,sad
me being in 11th grade with a job at a restaurant i dont get much time to myself and what little time i do get i usually spend it with friends when one of my friends asked me if i would go with her to see my initial reaction was what the hell would i want to see a movie like when i got home that day i looked it up and found that it was a book written by an apparently very talented author ian mcewan i think anyways we went with a few friends to the theater that friday most of my friends said to hell with it and went to see some other film we decided to go seei can happily say no matter what my friends do that was an absolutely perfect movie everything in it was great the direction the pace cinematography and especially the acting kierra knightly was an absolute joy to watch the girl who plays briony while older and while younger was excellent it did such a good job at making the viewers actually feel like the people in the movie were all very real almost every single scene in the movie was an absolute landscape it left nothing out from what was supposed to be imposed honest to god i cant find anything about it that was done wrong save for maybe the length when briony tallis lies to the family and says that robbie do not read if you have not seen the movie or book raped the little red head girl lolla i think while everyone was out searching for the twins you can see the naive look in her eyes an almost sense of haha it makes you almost want to laugh at her stupidity i cant even go into the development of the characters in the movie its toooo in depth let me rephrase that its perfect each part in the movie is made so well that you personally feel attached to that individual the only thing that i would have to advise against is taking children parts in the movie can get prettyvulgar dialog mainly though its a great movie and very enjoyablehope this helps read the book,sad
java man reviews rated r directed by joe wright written by christopher hampton based on the novel by ian mcewan starring keira knightley james mcavoy saoirse ronan romola garai vanessa redgrave  brenda blethyn running time 123 minutes originally appeared in lakewoodbuzzcomoverview in this cinematic adaptation of ian mcewans bestseller the filmmakers take us back to the tallis country house in 1935 rural england here 13 yearold briony tallis ronan sees her sister cecilia knightley in a romantic embrace with robbie turner mcavoy the son of one of the familys servants blethyn because of her naivety and her confused feelings for her sisters suitor briony falsely accuses the young man of committing a sex crime the story then weaves back and forth through time as the emotional consequences of brionys betrayal echo through the decades the film follows the three characters now sadly separated as they encounter the ravages of world war ii brionyfirst as a young wartime nurse garai and later as an elderly woman redgraveis constantly trying to find a way to atone for her unforgivable falsehoodreview 3 java mugs out of 4 at the beginning of the film young briony taps relentlessly on a typewriter as she composes a play for her family the ratatattat of a typist typing continues throughout the film and is a major component of the films oscarwinning scores only win out of 7 nods though it threatens to become annoying there is a reason for it i suggest you listen to the score and make note of what is happening on the screen when you hear the unrelenting underwoodwhile the pacing of the film especially in the opening sequences seems slow it does provide an opportunity to admire the exquisite art direction and set design that reveals the more leisurely lifestyle of england in the 1930s another reason to savor these slower scenes is to take pleasure in the appeal of knightley mcavoy and ronan before their characters are overwhelmed by the harsh realities of war briony has three actors who define her complex character ronan and redgrave who are brilliant and garai who gives a more conventional less compelling portrayalthe films pace quickens as world war ii approaches in one remarkable scene director wright sets up a fiveminute continuous tracking shot at dunkirk beach as the british soldiers are preparing to sail back to england the moving camera captures the reality of war and its surreal elements as we follow robbie past bombedout buildings burning boats horses being shot and a performing choir this is one of the best scenes of the year and should take its place among such famous film feats as orson welles opening shot in touch of evil 1958 and robert altmans homage to welles in the player 1992,sad
not quite as bad as i thought it was going to be given what id heard and read here and there but still very much the english patient for the heat magazine crowd like pride and prejudice the direction is strong probably a bit earnest and the dunkirk scene was pretty amazing if striving a bit too hard i thought the story was interesting but the problem was the two leads who were out of their depth funnily enough i felt that it was mcavoy who was the weaker of the two as knightley did manage to generate a couple of acting moments but all too often it felt a bit harry enfield when they were trying to deliver their meaningful dialogue in comparison to the english patient where it felt completely natural for the characters to talk in that stylised luvvie dialogue here it just wasnt working and as a consequence it was difficult to feel the characters emotions so much so that when the emotional wrench does come it falls a bit flat if theyd have gone with leads that were a bit more mature and had a bit more presence it might have worked but i still think thered be a bit of a issue with the source material,sad
it is definitely true that is not a usual movie probably there is not a similar one story starts with little girl briony writing a play to welcome her brother this writing scheme continues through out the movie and makes a perfect combination with typewriter sound based musics of the movie beautiful nature of the summer house adds more points to movie cecilia smoking so often being sassy maybe arrogant at the beginning turns out to be a very brave woman who is going after her love with her stunning green dress at the dinner deserves to take her place in the classic woman characters of cinema finally the movie turns back to focusing on brionys compunction and makes you expect that shell find a way to change things into good somehow however movie disappoints and ends in a weird way that briony never acts brave enough and struggles for good,sad
joe wrights second feature film after 2005s pride  prejudice has its leading lady in common with his first and this unfortunately is my main bone of contention with his otherwise magnificent movie for me at least her clipped english accent is unconvincing and contrived in interviews she has herself stated that she enjoyed the reversion to a 30s40sstyle of acting and in particular the brief encounteresque bulletlike speech patterns but this is so affected that its borderline parody im not a fan of the wartime posh english accent at the best of times and it has put me off many an adaptation of a classic childrens book stand up chronicles of narnia but for a modern lesson in how to ms knightly could have done a lot worse and she did than to study kristin scott thomas performance in the english patient james mcavoys accent also seems a little confused but as his character is a social climber we can let that one slide i am not obsessed with accents by the way i just think that the casting of these two ofthemoment actors was a mistake clearly not as far as the box office and presspublic interest were concerned but just in terms of authenticity keira marmiteofthebritishfilmindustry knightlys appeal has always been a mystery to me but i have long been a fan of james mcavoys work  which makes it all the more disappointing to see him miscast here his performance is not without its merits and it utilises two of his best talents as an actor  working with children and crying  but the script at times insists on him and knightly spouting the kind of contrived wannabeclassic dialogue that only ever sounds good on trailerswhat makes these two performances all the more grating is that every other character is played spot on saoirse ronan pronounced sersha apparently is a revelation as the young briony and i was shocked to discover that shes ameicanirish  her accents better than keira knightlys for gawds sake a special mention should also go to the criminally overlooked romola garai as the middle briony her role is critical in understanding the guilt and torment that leads to the films title  and all of this she conveys with eyes and expression alone now thats acting keirathe movie though is bigger than the sum of its acted parts and so a little hammy delivery of melodramatic dialogue can be forgiven  and some might even welcome it from an epic of this stature gone with the wind would have been forgotten by now without it joe wrights direction is confident authentic sympathetic and quite beautiful even the obligatory extended tracking shot here of soldiers awaiting evacuation on the beach at dunkirk is so effective that you almost forget about the artistic contrivance of such a lengthy take seamus mcgarveys cinematography too is excellent  from the muggy sunlight of the films first chapter you can almost feel keira knightlys dress sticking to her as she tries to cool off on the damp grass to the incessant fog of war in the second the score by dario marianelli brings to mind philip glass work on the hours with its economical yet memorable melody lines sparse pianostring arrangement and evocation of melancholy interesting that joe wright chose to use that films cinematographer here but is given a sense of urgency by the use of a typewriter as a driving rhythm section at first this grated and felt a bit like okay we get it  this whole story pivots on the use of the written typed word but i grew to appreciate its effectiveness and even enjoy its punchy punctuation christopher hampton perhaps best known for his excellent englishlanguage adaptation of les liaisons dangereuses for stage and screen has written a decent script  those trailerfriendly lines aside  that works particularly well both in establishing the characters and their motivations at the beginning of the film and at the end where vanessa redgrave delivers in the guise of a tv interview an effective speechcumsummation which in the hands of a lesser writer might have felt clunky and overstatedthis film is something of a modern classic  certainly more english patient than pearl harbour  and mr wright has every right to feel proud of his achievement i eagerly anticipate the release of his next film the soloist  not least because it doesnt feature any marmite i hate marmite,sad
i wasnt sure if i wanted to see this film as im not usually into romantic dramas but this was something else its not just a man loves woman with lots of crying involved plot its a beautiful tragic story set in wwiithe story starts in 1935 when 13 year old briony not understanding the situation between her sister cecilia and their gardener robbie accuses robbie of something he did not do changing the three of their lives foreverthe acting is top notch especially james mcavoy who was fantastic keira knightly was great too and unfairly criticised i think she is a fine actress who portrays cecilia with great care saoirse ronan and romola garai who play briony are fantastic too and you really feel for her as she comes to terms with her actions but never overcomes the guilt she feelsthe cinematography and the direction by joe wright is stunning the palette of colours used are beautifulfrom the rich greens and vibrant blues of englands countryside to the blacks greys browns and sepias of dunkirk the beach scene at dunkirk was probably the best visual piece in the film or other film i could watch it over again as i couldnt take my eyes off it the beach scene was very moving having robbie walk along the beach in silence with just the chilling sounds of a small group of soldiers singing was very moving and showed the other side of the harshness of war not just from battle sequencesi highly recommended this film the acting direction and score is superb i havent read the novel so cannot comment on the adaptation factor but as a film it is a memorable one my whole family enjoyed this film which doesnt happen often in a family with such different tastes may not be everyones cup of tea but i say give it a go just for the experience of it all,sad
this film has so much going for it a 10 stars for cinematography this is honestly one of the most beautifully photographed movies i have ever seenb 10 stars for the performances i thought all the actors were fantastic keira knightley is very good as cecilia james mcavoy gives an extremely strong performance as robbie all of the women who played the character of briony are simply fantasticc 10 stars for the editing the chopped up presentation of events in a nonlinear way i thought worked very well this was an excellent way to present the varying points of view brionys vs ceciliasrobbies etc it also built tension and suspense leading to a wonderful climax in the ultimate consummation of the romanticsexual relationship of cecilia and robbie leading tod 10 stars for the love story contrary to the opinions of many others i thought the love affair of cecilia and robbie was very believable and truetolifee 10 stars for the focus on the need for i thought the middle portion of the film brilliantly portrayed the anguish that briony suffers because of her false accusation resulting in robbies imprisonment the overwhelming guilt that she endures because of the pain suffering estrangement etc that her sin of lying has caused in the lives of her family her sister and robbie as well her own life brionys acts of penance as she serves her time in the purgatorylike london hospital and her attempt to confess to cecilia and robbie all drive toward the heart of this filmstory which is brionys dire need for forgiveness  forand then the film falls flat i simply could not accept the films ending briony the nowfamous and terminally ill author writes her 21st and last novel as a confession of her sin of her lying a novel in which she rewrites history so that cecilia and robbie who both died in the war survive and live happilyeverafter the scenes of confrontation and confession between briony cecilia and robbie never actually happen they were fictitious events that briony created in order to tell her story as it should have happened in her mind this novel which we the viewer learn has been portrayed in everything that happens in the movie up to this point has allowed her to rightherwrong and she apparently doesnt feel guilty any more okayin other words  shes able to die with a clear conscience by living out her few remaining days in a fictionalized world of her own creation a false reality in which alls well that ends well that may be a nice way of justifying her avoidance of doing the right thing its certainly a convenient way of assuaging her feelings of guilt but its not by definition is making amends is reconciliation its the repairing of broken relationships brionys rewriting of history does none of that her lie has destroyed people lives and has irreparably broken her relationships with her sister cecilia and with robbie these relationships can never be mended because the second parties died before briony got up enough courage to recant confess and ask for forgiveness therefore is impossible ultimately her rewriting of history is just another lie a lie that might be able to make her feel better  but which can not and does not bring about it changes nothingbottom line  this film is an extremely high technical achievement which because of a false representation of the concept ofperhaps because of a misunderstanding of the concept on the part of the screenwriter director andor the original novels author comes across in the end as shallow selfcentered poppsychology,sad
and no country for old men the film that beat it out for the best picture oscar are both based on novels with unique and nonlinear narrative structures which probably play out more coherently on the page in the dvd special features for the director reveals that the initial script which was discarded when he came on board apparently made some effort to adapt the plots jumbled chronologies and blending of memory and fantasy into a more cinematic conventional narrativei for one wish that script had been given a chancei have not read either novel i do not enjoy the feeling that a film needs the commitment of several hours of homework reading the literary work it is based on before it even begins to make sense i felt the rashomon like multiple points of view used here came off as forced and arch as the offscreen climax in no country no amount of ravishing photography souped up music lavish costumes or impassioned acting is going to be able to surmount a garbled and annoying scripti wanted to like this movie i admire the cast and the skill of the technical crew that backed them upbut in the end my final reaction was they brought in vanessa redgrave for five minutes and expected her to be able to sew it all together unfortunately not even her absolute brilliance can work that kind of miracleit later came to me that maybe working her in at the very beginninglooking backso that the uninitiated in the audience have some inkling of what may be going on might have helpedoh well at least i enjoyed juno,sad
a young girl ronan tells a lie that literally destroys some lives as an adult she tries to atone for that liei cringe when i hear about an award type movie with britons as the characters knowing i will go see it but also knowing that i will cringe because i cannot understand what they are saying because the director has the characters talking way too fast i have gone on record to say that all british movies must have michael caine talking all the male parts and jane seymour doing all the female parts at least when those two speak i can understand what they are saying is that too much to ask apparently so the academy gave a best picture nomination to this movie because they couldnt understand what was being said also and because the movie was british and understandably superior to american movies they raved to everyone about it the kicker is the people who were raved to about the movie figured the ravers knew what they were talking about even though they couldnt understand anything either hence a nomination and there you have iti found the movie much too long the war scenes went on forever in fact i think they are still going on this could have been a more satisfying movie if the idle chatter in the beginning among the idle rich and the war scenes were drastically cut back they didnt need to be that long give the audience some credit to get the point this isnt advertising where repetition rules the day the acting was good and the cinematography was excellenti must say that the twist at the end was excellent and powerful and no one saw it coming in fact the twist was so powerful i am at odds whether or not the character who gave us the twist did the right thing did the twist atone for all that went on before you must decide i am at odds with it but without that twist there would be no oscar nomination i am sureokay bob so you admit the story had merit and that it wasnt only nominated because no one could understand the dialogue yes i admit it but it was still too longviolence yes nudity yes sex yes language yes,sad
beautifully told with a perfect cast manages to sustain its emotional core it stumbles slightly when it shifts from its engrossing and striking first act to its ponderous second act but its heart beats unabatedsaoirse ronan is mesmerising as briony tallis and is the driving force in the first act much as james mcavoy in the secondthe score is cleverly construed with the clunk of keys a lingering frustration at first but as the picture progresses it is a smooth and perfectly constructed piece of musichas is moments of conscious exuberance in particular the beach scene one of the most well executed pieces of cinematography which i consider to be one of the best takes i have ever seen it does not progress or have much impact on the story it is essentially a piece of art  but it is nonetheless grippinga strong piece of cinema is lavish but controlled and prolongs thoughts and feelings that only a wellmanaged and intelligent piece of film making could achieve,sad
even after reading a lot of good reviews for the film it actually took me a while to convince myself to even watch it basically because it is a period piece in which i am not that big of fan of embarrassed to say it but i very much enjoyed pride and prejudice as well another film starring the very beautiful and talented keira knightley while watching the film i had a lot of mixed emotions sadness disappointment disgust anger and just about any other type of emotion that can be conjured not of the movie itself but of the characters and how they are being portrayed in that case the actors did an excellent job and its certain that james mcavoy is an up and coming star it is very hard for me to describe this film in such a way to express the impact that it has had on menot that life changing type of dealbut of how it kept me thinking about it even a couple of days after watching it although as soon as i finished watching the film i thought that the film was horrible but those couple of days of thinking about it i began to realize that it was the complete opposite of that i highly recommend watching based on great performances and a great story i warn you if you cant appreciate a tragedy and the fact that there arent always happy endings then this film is probably not for you,sad
the best movies and novels about illfated lovers are gone with the wind romeo and juliet a farewell to arms doctor zhivago brief encounter and wuthering heights which is my personal favorite this movie tries to live up to those standards especially a farewell to arms and wuthering heights the film is set in three parts in the beginning we find our reallife young lovers cecilia tallis keira knightley a daughter from a wealthy family of aristocrats and robbie turner james mcavoy a proud gardener who is the son of a housekeeper on the tallis estate they develop a passionate romance over time cecilias younger sister briony saoirse ronan wants to be a novelist and she also has a crush on robbie thats when things turn nasty when briony catches cecilia and robbie having romantic interludes she develops resentment and jealousy towards robbie after a series of mishaps briony falsely accuses robbie of rape and he is sent off to prison as a result of this terrible situation cecilia starts to estrange herself from her family especially brionythe second part of the film is set during the start of world war ii where robbie has made a deal to avoid prison life and join the armed forces in france cecilia has become a nurse in london during this time period they write and try to make contact with each other the battle of dunkirk ensues and robbie must fight with cecilia on his mind every step of the way the special effects of the battle sequences which make use of cgi technology are very impressive will cecilia and robbie meet again after the war im not going to say even though others have shared additional comments regarding the end of the film the final moments of the movie are about brionys test of by this time briony too has become a nurse and has prepared a novel that sheds light over her treatment of cecilia and robbie the novel depicts a better life for the two lovers despite their actual fate the final moments of the film bring the movie into full circle where an aging briony vanessa redgrave explains the true facts of her novel to reporters this is where the audience is left hanging some people wanted more from cecilia and robbie but they get brionys confession instead ouch that hurts can you imagine if the director had shown the lovers true fate and then brionys last testament to the press the tomatoes would have been really flying at the screen i guess that it is hard for most people to forgive and even harder for some to say im sorryscore 810,sad
this is a film that has had so much care lavished upon it in the making the film has a stunning and authentic look the performances are all very good and it is intelligently written but it still does not work well for me im not especially a fan of ian mcewan and perhaps that is the problem the film does not seem to me to establish the love affair between the two main characters to be as significant as it needs to be for the remainder of the film  i think that is a problem inherent in the book also ive not read it implied from the script though i dont really care about any of these characters either bourgeois brits down on their luck so tough the mistake made by the young girl in lying and thus destroying her life as well as the lives of the lovers and disrupting their family relations is an interesting element most interesting is perhaps her continued arrogance depicted in her later years when she is soon to die for she continues to find truth a difficult concept to master it is a thoughtful movie and beautiful to watch but for me somethings missing,sad
the first twenty minutes of are perfect they play like a well crafted character drama centered around the brilliant young actress saoirse ronan this first act is beautifully shot with a perfect musical score by dario marionelli then out of nowhere i suddenly found myself watching a war movie the movie suddenly seemed to neglect its romantic feel and became instead a grisly depiction of injured soldiers and long journeys through swamps thankfuly after about a half hour the film moved back to its initial format but i was still left with a bad aftertaste from that sudden jerk to another genre,sad
a very fascinating film im kind of left still thinking about it honestly its a pretty devastating film to watch definitely a film to remember james mcavoy is without a doubt the main standout nothing against keira knightly but mcavoys performance really stood out to meim also left really creeped out by some of the characters involved especially the characters of lola  paul marshall  who was the real rapist much is said about brionys guilt and yet lola allows robbie to take the blame as well when she knows very well that it was marshall who raped her or did he of course we are only seeing things from brionys viewbut in the scenes between lola and marshall they are very openly flirting not to mention the underhanded comments about how lola wants to be more grown up and is trying to act like and adult of courselola ends up marrying her attacker marshallbriony is she nothing more than a selfabsorbed liar i was really affected by romola garais performance as the 18 year old nurse briony she really took up the young naive jealous selfish 13 year old briony saoirse ronan mannerisms the way she talked etc garai is such an underrated actress ive liked her since i saw her in i capture the castle she was also most recently in amazing grace a very subtle actress but in just one second or scene she can still manage to break your heart its all in the eyesperhaps the most known scene of the film is the onetake sequence of dunkirk which is nothing short of astonishing not just the look and feel of it but the music of the scene as well the connection among the soldiers especially when they sing hauntingly in the background tears your heart out,sad
by all accounts including mine this is a beautiful movie the astonishing attention to period detail the beautiful cinematography and the great panoramic embracing of the chaos of war make it a joy to watch the acting is almost without exception perfect in all characters completely believable and without undue affectationwhy not 10 stars instead of 8 this good movie suffers from a pacing that is sometimes too slow and some initially confusing time shifts where a key scene is played over from another perspective we are unsure if knightley is jumping into the incredibly deep fountain for a 2nd time or the scene is being replayed it is clarified quickly but blows ones concentration on the plot thats one star deductedand then there is the cadaverous keira knightly who looks just terrible like a victim of several famines her performance is fair but she has all the sex appeal of a white stick and thus makes it difficult to sympathize with her character or even mildly understand mcavoys desire for her another star deductedall in all a very worthwhile production and an enjoyable two hours,sad
i have spent the last 60 minutes reading other comments and i still havent found one i totally agree with did i like the film of course i did did i surrender to it no unfortunately not and i even feel a bit lost because i wish i had maybe the whole problem lies in the fact that i loved the book so much i remember feeling at one time inspired overwhelmed enraged frustratedwhile reading it i remember hating briony so much for what she had done that i almost felt like leaving the book unfinished because i couldnt bear the way it was going to end and when i decided to watch the film i guess i was expecting to get all that magic back but the magic only lasted for about 40 minutes the first part of the film really corresponds to the image i kept in my mind but then the poetic atmosphere sort of fades away the performances are excellent although i must say i prefer keira in pride and prejudice but mcavoy proved to be an actor with a lot to give the way mcewans novel was adapted is also beyond reproach so i guess its my own fault that at the end of the film i was feeling as if something was missing,sad
well i was torn between grading it an 8 or a 9 my wife tipped the vote you see the movies that make her cry are good movies to her the film is a snapshot of prewar england and a few scenes during the war itself the perspective of the characters changes so that we can see the different ways the story could have been toldnow what can i say the level of detail makes this movie good the acting is very nice the soundtrack is good and i especially liked the typewriter effect in the music that tells us without a shadow of a doubt that we are watching a movie based on a book therefore it has a pointall these qualities are included in my grade but my personal opinion is not you see i am kind of tired of the emotional tension between people that have strong feelings towards each other but that they cannot consume women find this romantic i find it plain annoying well of course you would say men are all about the consummation but thats not the point does one feel better of their own lives when watching the pitiful mishaps of others it doesnt work on me do i need to experience sadness from time to time in order to feel alive certainly nottherefore my conclusion is that this is a great film to see with your beloved yet not one that actually has a point  except from a historical perspective you dont get to learn any useful skills out of the movie nor do you get to see some great new story that no one has seen before its just a plain old boring drama that is excellent crafted,sad
ian mcewans novel was an astonishing achievement and both its structure and storyline presented difficulties for anyone who wanted to bring it to the screen joe wright director and christopher hampton screenplay have surmounted these difficulties with aplomb and produced a film which is not only 100 true to the original but which is a moving and creative work of art in its own right the story is in three distinct parts the first is about the tensions between two sisters and with a handsome young man  who is suitor to the elder  in an uppermiddle class english family in 1935 there is an undercurrent of unease in this story  and when the climax comes it is no surprise passions mendacity jealousy snobbery and ultimately violence bubble inexorably to the surface the second part describes how the grievously harddoneby young man from the first story gets caught up in the retreat to dunkirk in 1940 this is harrowingly complete and horrifically graphic in its gory detail the third part shows how the now adult younger sister copes with her guilt in the aftermath of the tragedy of 1935 and also with her determined effort to atone partly by training as a nurse in a military hospital a gripping plot brilliant writing and fine characterisations illuminate this movie  excellent performances both by both the principals and the supporting castis really a threehander the elder sister is played with great subtlety and distinction by keira knightly  perhaps here finest screen performance to date her suitor robbie is brought to life by james mcavoy who is quite outstanding in the war scenes and the younger sister briony is believably played as a child by saoirse ronan and thoughtfully by romola garai as an 18yearold there is also a stunning cameo from vanessa redgrave as the 77yearold briony at the end of the film the five minutes when ms redgrave is on screen is a small master class in acting that all drama students should study carefully the cinematography is excellent throughout  especially the recreation of dunkirk which is done absolutely without an ounce of sentimentality as it should be no small boats and brave brits escaping to freedom here  just blood sweat and tears the same applies to the hospital scenes which might not be suitable for those with a weak stomach but it certainly tells it as it wasfinally it is worth recording that a minor subtext of mcewans book is about the art of writing fiction  particularly about the writing of a realistic novel which is closely linked to reallife events i wondered whether this would be tackled in the film but it is and it works very well for those who have seen the film but not read the book i heartily recommend mcewans novel to you they complement one another well and you are likely to be moved all over again when you turn the pages,sad
opens with a blooming love between two young people and descends into a pit of sadness angst and loss the film is set in 1930s england and follows the main characters into wwii young briony tallis saoirse ronan has a vivid imagination which will be the death of the young loverscecelia tallis is the daughter of a wealthy business man were never told what he does for a living and we never see him for that matter robbie james mcavoy the son of the grounds keeper was educated at the same schools as cecelia by the grace of cecelias father it was fun to watch robbie and cecelia around each other with each one afraid to say what theyre thinking it was only by change they find out about each others feelings in a library nonetheless the two had their whole lives ahead of them until cecelias younger sister briony comes along and turns their world upside downthe fall of 2007 offered some of the best movies of the year some were the best movies ever made this is one film where i couldnt possibly describe in i dont think there are enough words in the english language anyway maybe ill have to use sanskrit simply put is one of the best love stories ive ever seen the picture perfect young romance is painted so beautifully that it makes you feel horrible when you find out the love is doomed to end i think its an unfulfilled love story rather than a happy ending that really gets the audience stirred up i once read that realistic films dont make money and dont do well at the box office is there a difference between a realistic film and an honest one perhaps is all about honesty there is honesty in the acting writing directing every frame of every scene the film isnt mushygushy it seemed more about devotionkeira knightley is terrific as cecelia her on screen presence and demeanor are always full of energy and life her performance was incredibly powerful but done with the utmost subtlety she completely inhabited her character and has the posh upper class british accent to go with it the film moves forward to the heat of wwii and jumps back and forth from robbie in france to cecelia and an older briony in england young saoirse ronan was leaps and bounds ahead of the older briony romola garai i cant help but think that brionys character was watered down as a result of briony punishing herself for what she did to cecelia and robbie she feels guilty for what shes done and being a war nurse doesnt leave much time for being the carefree aspiring novelist she once was or so we think brionys existence is the only part of the film that is dishonest she spends her entire life lying to herself and living a charade in doing so she findsthis film had lavish sets and breathtaking cinematography the way the colors look in some films today i forget if im watching a live action movie or cgi in the sun rises and sun sets are as honest as any of the films stellar performances one of the most stunning scenes in the film is a five minute long uncut tracking shot which thoroughly gives the audience a taste of france in wwii i had never heard of director joe wright before this film but i sincerely hope this is only the beginning of his career is one of the years best films and will no doubt take the top spot at the oscars,sad
beautiful movie amazing imagery and even more amazing music almost merged in the movies atmosphere simplicity porcelain figures such as keiras which stick to your mind for a long time on the downsidelittle emotional charge coming from the fact that most of the film is seen through the storytellers eyes at an age at which life is not understood and with a mind out of this world so be patient and give this movie the time to grow you either like it or hate it because cowardliness is in all of us and its one of our innate traits we hate most and never admit to it this is why the movie is so tense i think,sad
with the sweep of an epic and the intimacy of romance comes across as a pretty good piece of period filmmaking until its devastating truths elevate the film to even greater heights joe wright who is becoming the torchbearer to period filmmakers ivory and merchant room with a view has been down this path before with his terrific pride and prejudiceit is 1935 at a wealthy estate in england where two sisters contemplate life the older sister cecilia keira knightley is at odds with the housekeepers grown son robbie james mcavoy the younger sister briony saoirse ronan is an impressionable teen and budding writer cecilias brother leon arrives with a male friend paul who takes keen interest in some children staying at the home one evening a passion erupts between cecilia and robbie that is interrupted by briony later that night a girl is brutally assaulted by an unknown assailant the subsequent allegations will have tragic consequences the story shifts between london where cecilia is a nurse and dunkirk where robbie fights to survive the early stages of world war ii the couple struggle to be reunited from afar even as a maturing briony comes to terms with her past deeds it is only later in life that she faces her guilt by paying tribute to the undying love of a tragic couplesets out to be an ambitious undertaking of love corrupted by outside forces and those from within as it spans the decades it shows how mere words can hurt in ways that cannot be imagined in this the plot is not dissimilar to the childrens hour where a childs words hurt deeply the story focuses less about the horror and effects of war and more on the purging and cleansing of sins briony chooses to deal with her misrepresentations and redeems herself with a final act of poetic justice think titanic even if it takes a lifetime the film suffers a bit from confusing points of view as seen through the eyes of briony by replaying the same scene to depict her point of view what remains somewhat unclear are her motives is she jealous of the love between cecilia and robbie or is she making wild assumptions based on distortionsthe acting is quite good with teen saoirse ronan a standout as briony in fact all three actresses who play briony at various stages of life are a splendid tandem much like the tandems in shine or tvs life with judy garland almost functioning as a greek tragedy the film most people will compare this to is the english patient which is ironic because there is a scene that has a television interviewer played by patients director anthony minghella benefits from some good cinematography seamus mcgarvey which depicts some startling surreal imagery especially in a tracking shot that says all that need be said of the horrifying evacuation of british troops at dunkirk the editing flashes back and forth to make a point or give background and yet you wonder what is real or imagined the musical score dano marianelli is in keeping with the dramatic mood quite nicelyby the finale we get to have an ending of sorts is it reality or the fabrication of an authors guiltridden imagination one thing is for sure the feelings of longing and love are real is like reading an epic romance novel with a bit of jane austen thrown in for good measure as such its pretty compelling,sad
love it or hate it  this is one lonnnng movie it takes the better part of an hour just to get to the incident that would require and it isnt so snappy at getting to the act of contrition either fortunately the resolution is briefas for a story it is a tale of british society  nuanced and developed by the actions and relationships of people within a manor house it provides an intricate portrait of manners and repressed emotions  if such things interest you there are many flashes  back forward and adolescent  which suggest that pubescent hormones and perceptions of sex could lead one to no longer be able to distinguish between right  wrong and that adolescence creates its own realityas a morality play it is certainly unsatisfying the act of is in no measure commensurate to the gravity of the deed perhaps that is the point that a member of british aristocracy would admit to any injustice or wrong should be sufficientdefinitely for the fans of british society drama for the addict this is more than a quick fix it is a wallow in the mores and manners of a british yesteryear the depiction dunkirk and the war give great context to this period piece  ah the empire which was,sad
not a very faithful adaptation of the book and a lot of details were omitted the history behind the broken vase more of robbie turner james mcavoys horrible experiences while at war the gypsy woman and her pig what happened to lola and paul marshall why briony couldnt publish her tellall novel yet and how she ultimately celebrates her birthday at the old housethe book was a bit annoying to read as author ian mcewan did not allow readers to have their own imaginings he painstakingly dictated each detail and embarrassingly disclosed each characters private thoughts which of course is impossible to translate on screen but the beauty of the novel is the real ending not the films version when it all comes together and explains why the book was written the way it was for the better part of the storybut the film did justice to the lush backdrops as described in the book and the characters are well cast except perhaps for james mcavoy who acted superbly but needed to be a bit burlier and taller briony was taller than him during the confrontation when he was supposed to be intimidatingly towering over her the actresses who played briony at 13 at 18 and in her 70s all possessed the face and the manner youd love to hate keira knightley was beautiful and played the role of the haughty careless but passionate aristocrat cecilia perfectly paul marshall was supposed to have some disfiguring facial feature that made him even more despicable and lola quincey was supposed to be slenderer and prettier but juno temples portrayal was eerily exactvisually arresting the accompanying soundtrack and effects were also masterful but the ending couldve used a bit more help,sad
probably the best romantic movie of 2007 this is very much brimleys story as portrayed by three actresses child young adult and elderly women even the scenes where shes not in it its her imagination as what transgressed between james mcavoys and keira knightlys characters brimley is a writer established immediately in the first scene even the opening credits are in courier font and the music is typewriter noises brimley has written a play that her guests a red head and twins are very reluctant to participate in she looks out the window and sees her older sister disrobe herself in front of a handsome man and jump in the deep fountain moments later she comes out and puts her outer garments on over her wet undergarments and brimleys curiosity is completely buzzed as to what actually happenedwith a nod to kurosawa the action is repeated but this time with only mcavoy and knightly present this must be said here that they make a very lovely couple there are other characters a brother whos hardly in the movie and his friend who does the nasty with the redhair that mcavoy will be falsely accused of that fact doesnt get revealed right away because the second act is not told chronologicallyjust when you thought everything is all explained fast forward to when brimley is an established novelist being interviewed for her twentyfirst novel that she reveals whose this really is because the main character is a third person seeing the love story theres a bit disengagement to the doomed couple we know mcavoy couldnt have done the rape because he simply did not have the time he was too busy bringing back the twins he must have had a lousy lawyer because to jail he went and the redhead remained silentbut overall a very enjoyable movie great dialog scenery and performances all around,sad
before having the opportunity to see this film i wasnt expecting much i was expecting another film similar to the notebook or another film such as pearl harbor my expectation for this film was very low now i believe that is how i should see a film before viewing them in order to appreciate them more after i watched this film i was left with a bittersweet feeling never did i fully understand the tremendous power of something as little as a lie no movie before has shown me how beautiful and how tragic love can be at the same time a good film worthy of being an oscar contender for best picture although i feel that no country or there will be blood will be taking home the top honor this film is capable of holding its own against those two other great films a tremendous movie 8 out of 10,sad
this movie is brilliantacting was brilliant especially james mcavoycinematography was superb and breathtaking the story is simplenot too confusing and shorti never like dramatic movie but this time i have to make an exceptionthe script is good but not greatthe first 30 minutes is pretty boring but the movie keeps on growingit really deserve a golden globe for best picture for dramafor drama lovers this is a must watch movieoverrall it is probably one of the best movie of this year,sad
watching this film in a multiplex cinema was certainly a very unique experience i believe that it looses much of its scope on dvd or on a small screen tv i watched it on a plane ride for the second time this is one of those films that must be watched more than once in order to fully grasp the symbolism and undertones presented in it after watching one gets the impression that the director and screenwriter have been very faithful to the book on which the film is based on the continuous use of flashbacks gives the plot much needed development all in all it is a thoroughly modern film sometimes perhaps a bit too modern for the time period it attempts to portray,sad
joe wrights 2007 is a film that on its glossy surface seems practically perfect the director has constructed each scene so meticulously that every shot looks perfectly positioned every actor seems perfectly chosen and every line sounds perfectly spoken in the process of engineering this perfection the film loses part of its heart any sense of imagination or daring discarded by wrights unwillingness to put a foot wrong adapted from ian mcewans criticallyacclaimed novel of the same name is nonetheless an intriguing wartime tale of jealousy naivet and regret and it offers much in the way of entertainment despite lacking in depth its the sort of picture that is dare i say it tailormade to appeal to the academy and a best picture nomination is certainly forthcoming and not altogether undeservedly a solid cast including keira knightley james mcavoy and young saoirse ronan occupy the lavish sets beautifully captured by cinematographer seamus mcgarvey visually the film is a sumptuous feast for the eyesis divided into two distinct acts contrasting violently between the luscious sunny countryside of prewwii england and the bitter bleak crumbling london that followed the first act probably the stronger of the two takes place at a bright and cheerful countryhouse where the eldest daughter in a proper english family cecilia tallis keira knightley falls in love with the households handsome gardener robbie turner james mcavoy younger sister briony saoirse ronan aged 13 witnesses this romance flourishing from her bedroom window misunderstands the situation and steadily builds a resentment towards robbie culminating in a final selfish act of jealousy that forever wrenches the budding couple from each others arms the power of writtenword plays a crucial role in the events of the film it is brionys interception of a sexuallyexplicit letter that proves vital in damning robbie and cecilias future and in the tearful finale an older briony attempts to use written fiction as the only remaining means of correcting past mistakes and destroyed lives dario marianellis pulsating dramatic score also recognises this symbolism employing the sounds of a typewriter to augment the events unfolding on screenthe second act of the film is a lot more subdued than what had preceded it and despite numerous memorable scenes fails to entirely satisfy unlike the first act the wartime sequences seemed to be heading in no direction wandering aimlessly towards an undefined goal perhaps this was deliberate during this period nobodys fate was certain but without any narrative drive the film failed to fully hold my attention now 18 years old briony played by romola garai has discarded a cambridge education in order to become a nurse perhaps her first attempt at for what she did to robbie meanwhile robbie having enlisted in the british expeditionary force is trying hopelessly to return home to his true love the horrors of war closing in upon him at every turn the centrepiece of this section is a breathtaking longshot on the beaches of dunkirk as robbie and his comrades observe the chaos and confusion of the british evacuation certainly the most impressive shot of its kind since alfonso cuarns children of men 2006 despite drawing too much attention to itself and doing little to propel the plot the planning and coordination that must have gone into this minuteslong tracking shot is worthy of the ticket price alone,sad
i had the pleasurediscomfort of seeing yesterday at our local brand new theater after seeing a trailer or two i knew i would want to see it on the big screen vs seeing it on a future dvd release this film may be destined to be a classic i thought all the brionys were brilliantly portrayed the main characters give beautifully felt performances as all the other portraits presented were also compelling a good film leaves one entertained a great film leaves one with questions and a bit of discomfort in touching upon true life issues is truly great i would surely want to view it again watching all the credits carefully i missed the locations where the filming took place id be interested in following up on that detail as well wonderful cast fantastic recreations and some breathtaking imagery for me make this my pick for many many oscars cheers  zb,sad
the trouble with hype is it sets your expectations too high that said i thought this was a lovely film and it just seemed to whizz by in no time it was beautifully filmed and good performances were put in by all the cast  drawing you in and making you feel sympathetic towards the main characters the twist toward the end of the film was unexpected as well being pedantic  the only thing that slightly irritated me about it was that in the dunkirk scene soldiers were singing bluebirds over the white cliffs of dover which wasnt written until 1941 apart from that minor quibble i would highly recommend it but dont set your expectations ridiculously high like i did,sad
i really enjoyed this but the rather grandiose production did detract from the focus of the inner lives of the characters as an ian mcewan fan i did expect a bit better though i hadnt read before seeing it im thinking this is not one of his better novels but then again any sort of translation of stories that focus around characters and not plot is difficult i suppose my disappointment was the plot was the winner over the characters it has a nice twist at the end that saves it from being too formulaic kiera knightly is superb the beach scenes i was reminded by my friend are rather reminiscent of titanic as is the whole plot and thats not a compliment im afraid but still you do care about them and really want them to succeed in coming together in the end which they do in a way,sad
in 1930s england briony tallis saorise ronen is an aspiring writer and excitable young girl she lives with her family on an idyllic british homestead with her sister cecilia keira knightley and groundskeeper robbie james mcavoy tiptoeing around a fierce mutual attraction but then a series of events between the two are seen and misinterpreted by briony which ultimately lead briony to accuse robbie of raping her friend 15 year old lola juno temple several years later world war ii is raging robbie is stranded in france as the british army limps to dunkirk and briony romola garai and cecilia are estranged from one another serving as nurses in different parts of the country with cecilia and robbie determined to get together briony must figure out how to atone for her mistake before its consequences become irrevocablejoe wrights adaptation of ian mcewans has the feel and look of a david lean epic not to mention the english patient a tragic love story welldrawn flawed characters a wartime setting and a series of striking images are all present unfortunately doesnt live up to the aforementioned films and though entertaining it contains a number of serious flawsthe story and character of briony are what make so interesting as an impressionable inexperience young girl briony finds herself living through an extremely traumatic day he sees robbie apparently forcing cecilia to dive into a fountain accidentally deliver a vulgar message and raping her in the library before coming across her friend being assaulted as a thirteen year old her reaction is understandable and i dont entirely side with the antibriony faction of viewers unfortunately she decides that her confused version is the gospel truth leading to jail and military service for robbie and cecilias estrangement from family as shes older will she be able to fix what she did wrong or has fate taken it out of her hands the relationship between robbie and cecilia is sweet but in terms of interest the deeply conflicted briony is squarely in the foreground she is a very welldrawn character and its to the credit of both the writers and the three actresses playing briony that she works so well and even elicits a significant amount of sympathythe film has several serious flaws the most of which is hard to describe in a review pacing even though the film is only 130 minutes it seems a lot longer with many sections dragging on and on for an epic film maintaining interest for its length is essential and poor pacing is perhaps the worst thing that can happen for a two hour film to seem like three or more is a serious handicap some of the films stylistic choices are a bit much for instance showing brionys seeing an event and then showing how it really happened as well as some of the slowmotion and rewind scenes many flashback scenes are also done in a disconcerting manner that irritates rather than intriguesthe film has striking cinematography by seamus macgarvey capturing the beautiful english countryside and the horror of wartorn france the celebrated tracking shot at dunkirk is welldone although not impressive in the strictest sense but the movie has its fair share of striking images in quieter moments to compensate robbie watching a bomber plane through his skylight window the french soldier with a fatal head wound a group of executed school girls in a field a scene which recalls the cadet scene in doctor zhivago on a purely visual level the film is a masterpiecewhile i will not reveal it here the films climax came completely out of left field and in a good way its one of the most tragic conclusions to a film ever and the ending is the definition of bittersweet in my opinion it goes a long way towards redeeming many of the movies flawsthe acting is generally good briony is clearly the main character and all three actresses  saorise ronen romola garai and vanessa redgrave  do a brilliant job with her complicated character james mcavoy balances charm and bitterness as robbie and he is definitely on his way to becoming an alist star keira knightley is tolerable but this film convinces me that shes just not a very good actress the supporting cast is more or less nondescripthas the look and feel of a great epic and succeeds in being intriguing through most of its length poor pacing and a few questionable style elements prevent this from being a truly great film but that doesnt keep it from being enjoyable710,sad
a 13yearold girl living in a grand english estate watches some scenes and misinterprets the whole thing what happens is a disaster in the long run also for herthis is a movie about power the one were aware of and the one were not the first hour is tremendous and very clever made you come to think a little about antonionis blowup although this is quite another form of movie and another themewhat brings it down is the rather conventional way the plot develops its like two different directors have made the first and the second half but the first one is a great thriller in a way you havent seen before well worth seeing,sad
i thought it was a very good story with the sneaky ending but i told my girlfriend my heart basically fell asleep during the movie because of how boring it was its like i had to wait for the ending to be somewhat interested and that goes for the other two filmspride and prejudice and the notebook  to me a great very underrated love story with other also genres was meet joe black i mean that movie kept you interested through out the whole movie and yes there were a few dead spots but it picked up very quick with quincys funny lines anthony hopkins and brad pitts great acting drews way of being a jealous a hole and of course the love triangle tied in together another great one is titanic of course but back on why sit through a boring love story to find out at the end that the love really never happened and it seems like they fell in love just because of the perverted letter he sent to her is that how love starts i dont think so any reaction,sad
this is a very atmospheric adaptation of ian mcewans very moody and powerful novel set in an upperclass english household of the 1930s and in the england of the early war years there are various ways of atoning for deeds we regret and in the book writing becomes briony tallis at 13 makes a mistake affecting two people close to her which haunts her for the rest of her long life one of them is robbie the son of the familys housekeeper who has been given an oxford education by the family and the other is her older sister cecilia who is in love with robbiebriony who probably has a pubescent crush on robbie falsely accuses robbie of sexual assault on lola a visiting cousin and as a result robbie is sent to prison five years later in london during the early part of the second world war briony tries to atone for her wrong it is not at all clear whether briony acted maliciously but she feels guilty about it it has destroyed her relationship with her sister and that is sufficientas the book gives alternative views of what has happened the film makers have had to do the same and have done so rather neatly in a way which does not interrupt the narrative this is easy in prose but not so easy on film they have also done a mini spielberg recreation of the evacuation of dunkirk which evokes the desperation of the event beautifully dunkirk was no triumph merely a total disaster averted the hospital scenes are grim testament to the losses the allies suffered but this is a very personal story briony goes on to be a successful author and it is only in the final scenes we find out how she has assuaged her sense of guilt here the film departs from the book briony venessa redgrave telling all in a tv interview rather than attending a birthday party put on for her by her family the book somehow completes the cycle of brionys life in a way the film does notthere is some staggeringly good acting here by all the actors playing briony saiorse ronan who was only 12 at the time romola garai and last but not least vanessa redgrave james mcavoy as robbie and keira knightly as cecilia also put in good performances though keiras voice coach should be sacked  she was allowed to speak far too fast the large ugly mansion used as the tallis house stokesay court in shropshire leaped straight from the pages of the novel and the love scenes between robbie and cecilia were both tasteful and eroticif we do have to have adaptations of highly literary works like this one we can be thankful that here the spirit of the story is still present i dont think mcewan writes with the screen in mind though he wrote a brilliant screenplay for the ploughmans lunch 25 years ago he and we are lucky that the film makers here had some idea as to what he was on about,sad
no rhymes no embellishments no adjectives just kiddingthis film is a chick flick which i insist is not a pejorative that is not surprising but it is one of the reasons i didnt adore this film it is suffused with the kind of hopeless romanticism that i find unfortunately incredible some reasons why the kind of love displayed is plausible in this case the impending great war the ww1 environment human natures tendency to translate desire into love still it will always be a mystery why people rationalize or should i say excuse sex with love its not necessary nor is it realistic it is however a fixture of the dramatic romantic chick flick apparently people find it beautiful nicely portrayed in this film but not necessarily appreciatedfrankly the most beautiful thing in this movie  no not keira knightlys sprightly elfin body  is its photography the cinematography is excellent varied unorthodox meticulous it is delightful and masterful the scenes of war and dunkirk are particularly hauntingadditionally the pacing and sequence of the film are stupendous stupendous they are inventive and interesting unfortunately there is some amount of repetition or should i say redundancy the film could have been pared down at 123 minutes it is not excessively long but for what was presented it is a bit overdone and overcomplicated additionally it could have benefited from more characterization the dialogue is smart and tight but slightly sparse especially for the minor charactersthe story of course is one we have heard before it is cherished and treated wonderfully in this presentation acting is very fine though i will never really fall for the histrionics of the semihuman knightly all in all a very nice and even slightly philosophical and provocative movie who would have thought a chick flick could be so ambitious,sad
with all the rave reviews of i was surprised to be only mildly impressed after viewing the movie i reread the comments of others and it seems that those who read the book prior to seeing the film have the highest praise for those who havent read the book like myself the story became confusing at timesthe first third of the movie which takes place in a beautiful english house is definitely a perfect 10the sets the acting the characters etcall contribute to a sense of anticipation about whats to comepossible spoiler after one of the main characters is falsely accused and taken to jail the movie breaks down the sets and acting continue to be amazing but the story doesnt hold together there is one scene which is so confusing and nonsensical ce robbi and briony in ces apartment as to be distracting this scene is later explained by an older version of briony toward the very end of the movie but to be honest i was so distracted trying to figure out the scene that i couldnt get back into the storyi suspect the book is amazing because the concept of the story is brilliantthe actions we take can have devastating effects on others but the limited character development early on prevents a viewer from feeling complete sympathy with them as they move through their lives and through the consequences of brionys lie for example the relationship between ce and robbi is spoiler given to us as a sexual relationship with mere hints that its more than that yet the rest of the story requires us to believe they had a deep deep love for each other and were never sure why briony spoiler tells the lie that she doeswhat is her motivation was she jealous of her sister of robbi better character development and less confusion would have made this movie a 10 in my opinionread the book first and then youll probably love it,sad

voltaire wrote that history is a pack of tricks that the living play upon the dead the point of appears to be that history is a pack of tricks the living play upon themselves because it is more comforting that way we are shown the newsreel story of dunkirk as epic of british pluck and endurance compared with a purportedly real account of dunkirk as spectacular balls up in parallel we see brionys fictional tidying up of the mess she has made compared with the actual unhappy and unresolvable consequences although she knows the truth she is still trying to persuade herself that her fiction restored something irretrievably lost that it was beyond her power to restore in fact,sad
it seemed to me that the movie made allusions to dover beach by matthew arnold does anyone else see that has joe wright said anything about itespecially the lines about the pebbles being thrown back on the beach by the waves bringing the eternal note of sadness in and the last stanza starting ah love let us be true to one another for the world which seems to lie before us like a land of dreams so various so beautiful so new has really neither joy nor love nor peace nor certitude nor help for pain and we are here as on a darkling plain swept by confused alarms of struggle and flight where ignorant armies clash by night,sad
the films been compared with the english patient but it doesnt quite measure up the actresses who portray briony all turn in fine performances mcavoy delivers a most believable and harrowing portrayal of robbie turner the consequences of his overwhelming betrayal by briony tallis his gradual physical collapse during the british retreat at dunkirk mcavoys eternally hopeful yet pragmatic turner never surrenders even as his flesh and blood are about to finally fail him wright displays polished excellence in the unedited shot that he orchestrated to present the milieu of the beach at dunkirk  not only for the handling of the steadycam but for composition over the course of the shot principal characters weave in and completely out transporting the viewer directly into the midst of the confusion suffering and hope that scene is nothing less than brilliant no matter how many excellent piece parts there are in joe wrights film the whole fails to exceed their sum the first third of the film is where i find fault my suspension of disbelief was rudely broken more than once in there when a writer tells a story the reader is forced to go by the words that are on the page even when the reader reads between the lines the reader does so with the minds eye not with independent physical vision it works on the page whenever brionys version of crucial events is presented in advance of robbies and cees experience of the same because mcewan can quickly conjure up a full and satisfying enough description of outward appearances and inner states of mind mcewan can take leaps and keep us exactly where he wants us to be as readers film however is a medium of explicit vision and the viewers eye cant help but wander far and gaze deeply when wright shows us brionys mildly distorted view of things first it undermines the story of the budding love between robbie and cee it also steals momentum from the drama surrounding the three the mild depiction of brionys skewed view of crucial robbiecee events deflates those events before they are fully savored by the audience in as dissatisfying a manner as coitus interruptus the sweetness of the romance is soured before the audience is permitted to taste it a thinking audience also has to ponder how a 13 year old girl who writes pithy plays who has formed so sharp an opinion about what the foulest word ever must be could then begin to so thoroughly misinterpret all that she comes to witness one hot summer day the love scene in the library as briony saw it has nothing whatsoever in common with the later rape scene that is flashed once in real time and again as a vivid remembrance that briony later witnessed her accusation of robbie is impossible to fathom as having even a single shred of innocence it can only be chalked up to sinister motives if i am to care much at all about briony in the last third i have to have one shred of sympathy for her by the conclusion of the first third the film could have and needed to take more dramatic license these are mistakes that i did not expect wright to make is this thudding clumsiness the handiwork of the same person who so ably directed the rest of the film what i ask for could be accomplished almost entirely through a reedit of the first third of the film i would rather that wright present the robbiecee thread of events as they experienced them before we take time to revisit them through brionys eyes permit the audience to make an emotional investment in the small and intimate allow us to root for the couples success only then bring brionys mild misinterpretations into play create narrative and emotional momentum before you break it spring brionys betrayals of robbie on us in a more fully formed context briony betrayed robbie at least twice intruding on the wrong note intended for cee was the mouse trap accusing robbie of raping lola was the bear trap considerable dramatic momentum was lost between these two story beats because of a failure to more boldly reinterpret the setup in the first part of the book for the visual medium of film otherwise one way to make brionys misinterpretations more effective as the first representation of critical events in the film would be for wright to present them as being much more over imagined far more grotesque than and outofwhack with a more balanced and informed view of the same the robbiecee thread would still be sorely under served but the problem of brionys state of mind might begin to act as a more adequate dramatic point of focus the dramatic failures of the first third also weakens the poignance of the final third a much older briony remembers past events with clarity depth and more objectivity but then she spins a fictional final chapter to her story of robbiecee in her final work as a celebrated author she thinks it an when is no longer possible brionys book becomes an empty act of selfish commerce not anything noble despite what she confesses to be the truth and her motives during the taping of the interview featuring english patient director anthony minghella as brionys interviewer brionys imagination simply continues to overpower her she is still out of synch with reality even at that late stage of her life these nits of mine might not matter much to others i still hope people will go to see this film i hope that more people will also be moved enough to read mcewans book if they havent already,sad
i saw this last night and i thought it was very good i think keira knightley did an outstanding job james mcavoy was good but i still think he should have been nominated for the last king of scotland this role did not seem to stretch him as much i am betting keira will get an oscar nod the movie itself is sad but well reflected a few funny parts in it it brings a lot of emotions to the screen shame anger regret the war part was a bit long to me i liked the scenes with the nurses the imagery of this movie was dark but was accented with bright colors of red which was nice if you like romantic dramas than this is a must see,sad

then is there mirth in heaven when earthly things made even atone together shakespeares as you like itits a comfort to know that a firstrate novelist appreciates the consequences of a lie ian mcewans unimpressively adapted for film is a testimony to the power of nemesis who lamely applies comeuppance to the worthy such as adolescent briony saoirse ronan who suffers a major case of remorse after wrongly accusing robbie turner james mcavoy of raping lola quincy juno temple briony has a crush on robbie and after recognizing the considerable competition of the older cecelia tallis kiera knightly resorts to a lie that sends robbie to prison and then wwii and the rest of the characters into various stages of sufferingmcewans allegory when applied to the machinations of hitler and ineffectuality of the early allies is satisfactory for also showing the hope underlying most grand human enterprises the horrors of wwii as experienced by the condemned robbie taking an option to become a foot soldier are more profound of course than the injustice of his spending years in jail in lengthy tracking through a battlefield that occupies a sagging center of the film the homely tensions of an uptight brit family unfortunately give way to director joe wrights epic pretensions and thereby lose the drama essential to mcewans vision of brionys personal transmogrification and return to humility briony however lives her own hell as age brings maturity and a growing sense of what she has done wrong to affect the lives of so many by her liesbut she becomes a writer with 21 books to her credit the final one called an autobiography that expiates as it exposes her sin played by vanessa redgrave perfectly displaying brionys weary acceptance of her guilt and still strange estrangement from deep feelings one problem is that shes still a writer who cant restrain herself from writing fiction which she does with this story as well allowing mcewan and company to comment on the lies inherent in fiction and autobiography necessary lies maybealthough the results might prove otherwise the truths that emanate from lies may be more worthy than first thought a blessed state reached with a battlefield of victims more vicious than a carefully carefullycrafted but hollow world war landscape,sad
i had read some good reviews and decided to see the movie it was really well done an epic period film well directed with great actors it should get an oscar keira knightley was excellent regarding director joe wright he is really making a mark in cinema world parts of the movie are in french but this only adds to the wwii era of the movie the ending climax was well done music was great the hole thing splendid together as a poem its great to see something different im not a fan of war movies but this is something far superior briony played by 3 different actorsis an amazing embodiment of good acting and directing,sad

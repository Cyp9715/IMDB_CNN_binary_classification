at times i feel that humanity has forgotten or never really knew what it is to really love someone jojo moyes obviously isnt one of those people love isnt the lust we feel at the beginning of a relationship its not the thoughtful vision we compile of what the future could be like or how compatible we are its not about how financially successful a prospective partner is its certainly not all about sex although it would be hard to come to this conclusion when the media generally plays strongly to that idea its the undeniable overwhelming pull from our hearts that grows only when we really let ourselves care about someone unselfishly thank you jojo for playing this out so beautifully thank you emelia and sam for either knowing this experience or fabulously convincingly portraying it on screen this movie is a treat to watch and a glimpse of what it feels like to be a person who lives their life with a moral conscience an open mind a respect for beliefs that are different than yours and a desire to see the best in the world i feel absolutely cleansed of negativity after watching this and my hope for the world is renewed a glorious experience,sad
how can so many people get this this movie wrong especially the critics the high point of the film is the performance by emelia clarke she is hairbrained and scatty completely adorable and wonderfulthe camerawork is gorgeous and the soundtrack is second to nonelou emilia clarke gets a job as a carer to a man william who is paralyzed more or less from the neck down a budding friendshipromance develops and this is 90 a feel good moviethe criticism of the movie that it depicts a life with profound disability as almost worthless is completely mistaken the movie depicts williams life as worthwhile and precious it is williams own judgment that his life cannot go on as it is and that he would prefer to diewith regard to this the movie does tend to downplay the pain and suffering that william experiences instead it focuses on the good times and precious moments he spends will lou and as already stated the character of lou is completely adorable i am in love,sad
the movie really was adorable i knew exactly what to expect since i read the book but i loved the adaptation what helps the movie most is that the novelist jojo moyees wrote her own screenplay she did a great job transitioning the story from paper to screen little things that were left out of the novel werent really needed to move the story along both emilia clarke and sam clafin were excellent her facial expressions were amazing and her insane eyebrows deserve some type of award all on their own i thoroughly enjoyed the soundtrack as welldont listen to critics and go see this movie,sad
this film is getting mixed reviews but i really enjoyed it a very bittersweet film that will leave you feeling happy and sad at the same time i never read the book that which this film is based on but sometimes movies are never has detailed has the books they are based ona beautifully well made story it about louisaemilia clarke a 26 year old who finds a job taking care of willsam claflin a young billionaire who is permanently confined to wheel chair after an accident two years earlier the use of his arms and legs are gone at first will does not want louisia there and she does her best to put up with him but soon the form quite a friendship she teaches him to enjoy life again and he shows her to be adventurous in life but the question is will this last i like the chemistry between claflin and clarke at no point it feels forced i really bought the affection they feel for one another at times clarkes performance feels overly cartoonish but still good in most of it claflin is believable and the question is how would you feel if you where in his shoes i dont care what the critics say this was a perfectly well made bittersweet film,sad
i admit that i have read the book and so when the movie came out i just had to go see it so i drag my poor husband and we went to watch a late show that was relatively full i didnt tell him anything about the movie and i watched him watching it he actually really enjoyed it the movie was lovely the movie itself was beautiful the scenery was set somewhere is rural england there are green pastures a castle and beautiful stone walkways we first meet lou a beautifulcharming bubbly girly girl who is a strong character but maybe a little too comfortable with her current life and then we have will dashing will sarcastic funny a little mean at first they are world apart but through fate  and will disabilities they met and slowly realize what one possessed the other needs even if they never really knew it as the movie progress they falls for each other and we all fall for them i loved emily as lou and sam as will they played their roles perfectly and the chemistry between then was undeniable i think everyone should go and watch this movie if you love romantic comedy it is hilarious at times and yet sweet i assure you that youll feel every emotion out there with this movie its so beautiful go watch it and judge yourself for me this is an amazingly beautiful love story,sad
thea sharrocks film adaptation of jojo moyess is one of those hidden gems which we should all watch rather early than later first the talented british cast is impressive emilia clarke sam claflin janet mcteer charles dance matthew lewis just to name a few beautifully create an emotional journey which is more than just a heartbreaking love story challenging our life perspectives every step of the way these actors invite us to live boldly and seize the opportunities passing by louisa clarke emilia clarke a naive 26year old english woman lives in a peaceful village where nothing seems to be happening supporting her whole family financially lou has a dull life working hard without ever leaving our native city when she loses her job at buttered bun cafe her world is turned upside down desperately looking for a new job she goes to the local job center and is proposed to work for a despicable 30ishyear old quadriplegic man called will traynor his desire not to get help makes him look miserable and frustrated however with time lou pierces his shell and unveils wills true colors she starts showing him how great his life could be but one revelation changes their relationship foreverbest known for his roles as finnick odair in the hunger games series sam claflins portrayal of will is exquisite it is almost inconceivable to imagine him not being a part of this movie the physical and psychological challenge of playing a quadriplegic man who needs to feel like a man again elevates the englishborn actor to hollywoods acting alist in claflin convinces us that words are way more impactful than being good looking through his presence on the screen claflin inhabits one of the most powerful quotes of jojo moyess original story you only get one life it is actually your duty to live it as fully as possible playing opposite claflin emilia clarke game of thrones shines through with her naivety and authentic clumsy attitude on the screen her unique facial expression while crying and laughing makes us fall even more for the quirky innocent lou no one could have ever filled the role better than the mother of dragons herself emilia clarke is lou clarke from her crazy outfits in the movie to her charming personality clarke has it all will be the catalyst in her career so lets be ready to see some more of this bumble beeon a final note we should be grateful to jojo moyes for questioning us on the reality of assisted suicide and physical disabilitiesthere are not lots of writers who have been able to make such a statement and shake the status quo when it comes to life and death but moyes did it beautifully the only thing left to say is go watch this movie you will not regret it it will make laugh cry but most importantly push you to embrace life fullyps bring with you some tissues you might need them,sad
emelia clarkes work on game of thrones is the only reason i watched this movie in the first place she is occasionally transcendent in that role where she must keep her eyebrows restrained and i wanted to see what would happen if her amazingly mobile brows were set free  free as her dragonsthere are a lot of solid things about this movie the story of a young woman who cares for a quadriplegic young man is strong the direction and cinematography good though not exceptional the screen writing also goodnotexceptional the supporting cast especially janet mcteer and charles danceand leading man sam c quite good and the emotional notes it hits though all predictable and often a bit overwrought cue swelling heartwarming music ring true enough for an unabashed romanceso not really my type of movie but i am happy to say that i was almost completely taken by clarkes performance her character here is nothing like her got role but is in many ways an equally fantasybased role but with clumsy shyness and striped leggings instead of fireproof skin and dragons  and clarke manages to pull this character out of romantic fantasy into believability as effectively as she brings to life her role as mother of dragons she has the combination of charisma physical beauty characteracting chops and inner luminosity to pull a fairly nice 7of10 heartwarmer up to a 9of10 charmer,sad
all movies can be scrutinized for faults as some reviewers have done but if the movie makes a mark then those faults really dont matter do they i found the angry will traynor not completely believable not like the antisocial jack nicholson in as good as it gets but sam clafin did well with his transformation emilia clarke was absolutely wonderful and i will be on the lookout for other roles she has taken and will undertake in the future kudos also to the characters who played wills parents janet mcteer and charles dance two thumbs up for the movie am seriously considering whether the movie ought to bump another movie off my favorite 50 relationship movie list,sad
felt very derivative of intouchables i did however really enjoy the romance that was in this filmemilia clark has the most expressive face i have ever seen on camerawatch her eyebrows thats all i have to say you could almost watch this entire movie just staring at her eyebrows i had a hard time not doing thati really enjoyed her character she is a silly eccentric perpetually happy girl with a pretty eclectic sense of styleemilia clarke was perfectly cast for this roleshe ventures far from her intense power house character the mother of dragons from game of thronesat times it was hard to tell if emilia clarke the actress is just extremely expressive with her face or if it was something she was doing for the role which i suppose speaks to how well she didbecause im thinking she was exaggerating it therefore she played the part marvellouslythe male lead is sam claflin who you will more than likely recognize but not be able to place his largest role as of late is the water proficient fighter from the hunger gamesi also feel he played the part very well no complaints he has a great smile or smirk that he does through out which allows us to empathize with him a little more when he seeming unlikablethere are a lot of light moments actually the whole movie has a very light tone to it its a serious topic but with clarkes character its hard for anything to be too serious or solemn there are those sombre moments which is im sure why i was given a tissue box at the advance screeningthere were only a few editing aspects i didnt enjoy there were far too many cuts in certain scenes emilia walking up to the mansion for the first time and her conversation on the bench with her boyfriend they were distracting this was sprinkled throughout the film to greater or lesser degreesi think the film looked pretty great locations and a wonderful set really the house claflins character lives in looks very nice i loved all the walls that opened when pushed on very modern and expensive im surethere is a little treat for any harry potter fans neville longbottom all grown up and looking fit he plays the part of emilia clarkes boyfriend i hope to see him in more roles maybe even a lead one dayas for family friendliness this movie is a g it is good to go in the opening scene claflin is presumably being intimate with his girlfriend they are obviously naked but nothing is shown they are under sheetsthere is no cursing or obscenities in this movie worth mentioning,sad
i loved this movie it stayed very true to the book and i love the book i think emilia clarke was born to play her i feel like she was just playing herself cause she has a personality like that in real life it was pure joy to watch her play lou the expressions she makes the way she talks and most of all her amazing clothes i loved every single outfit she wore this film made me laugh and it made me very emotional just like the book i think sam claflin was also born to play will they had an amazing chemistry throughout the entire film and the rest of the cast is also spot on there are of course some parts from the book that were left out but nonetheless this film was still amazing i also want to point out that the soundtrack of the movie is amazing as well,sad
i was expecting the usual american love story but thats not what this is i have neither seen nor heard of these actors prior to seeing this film that said i usually dont go to see films like thiswhat a wonderful movie the acting was so well done my heart broke where it needed to break and it laughed where it needed to laugh for those who need help working on their empathy or the opening of the mind this is a very good movie to seeits very thought provoking and i would even suggest to professors philosophyenglishcultural perspectives in science sociology that they have their students write a paper on this there are so many issues involved here great for discussion,sad
one of the best romantic movies lately i am very taken with emilia clarks performance and smile she was amazing and breathtaking the music is well chosen and the acting is good and there were some very touching moments that will make the audience who didnt watch yet cry lou is a funny young woman who wants to live a simple life who wants to wear clothes and be fashionable in her own way the paralyzed man is a damaged cause looking for hope both these characters are very different yes they pick things from each other and they put smiles on each others faces a couple that wouldnt get bored giving and taking to their souls maybe when it comes to believing in love unconditionally faith is hope then live the life as it faces you then in health and sickness in the sweetest moments and bitterest ones just live your life no matter what happens to you always get back and fight to survive and be alive that is what this movie is all about,sad
i wouldnt consider myself the target audience for these romantic dramas in fact im usually turned off by the overabundance of forced clichs and unnecessary plot devices while definitely falls victim to some of those unfortunate young adult tropes theres far more charm than harm here the film stars emilia clarke lou and sam claflin will from game of thrones and the hunger games respectively ive enjoyed both of their works in the past and they both make the most of the script that was given to them their budding charisma on screen is by far the highlight of the film its nice to see clarke take on a lighter and more exuberant role than she has played in the past as it mirrors her offscreen personality as well clarkes likability as lou is put a test as she has to deal with the stern and far less cheerful will who became paralyzed after a motorcycle accident if you didnt guess it already yes they do grow to live with each others quirks and inconveniences and maybe even share some affection for each other its pretty much the basis for all of these romantic novels adapted for film but if youre film has enough likable qualities to it the overused plot points and clichs can be forgiventhe main qualm for these characters are wills questionable wishes about his future living as a quadriplegic and lous inability to fulfill her potential and aspirations due to her commitment as the breadwinner for her family the way lou effortlessly deals with these issues is what makes her so likable its also why you root for her and will to become romantically involved as the film gives us compelling enough reasons to desire it with that said i was pleasantly surprised with how the romance is depicted everything is earned and not forcedi think my only real complaints with the film involve its tendency to veer into clichd territory im not a fan of when romantic films play popular songs that tell you exactly how to feel as an audience member or when a certain character is written specifically to give us someone to dislike and is used a plot device more than anything else on more than one occasion does that but its when the film attempts to take an original and realistic spin on the romance that the film really shines its because of the ladder that i think is definitely worth a lookclarkes undeniable likabilitycharm and chemistry with the lou and will dynamicromance is earned not forcedpopular songs tend to ruin the big momentsa few clichd characters and plot devices7410,sad
so you can tell im not a fan of this film just by my title and score the movie itself is okay at best emilia clarke does a well enough job with the role because the character she is playing is pretty much who she is in real life in other words this role didnt require emilia acting much and that is a good thing because people are slowly figuring out that she has a very limited range when it comes to acting towards the end of the movie is when her limited acting range becomes apparent thanks to the crying scenes most of the scenes she does with tearless crying which help to take you out of the movie dont get me wrong her acting isnt bad until the end when she is forced to show another emotion other than bubbly i should note the director does an excellent job of hiding a good amount of emilias emotional scenes by having her hug someone and then showing mostly the other persons face i can write a whole book on emilias overrated acting chops but im not here to do that so let me carry on with this review if it wasnt for the ending where we finally learn the real message of the film i would have ranked the film about a 6 out of 10 but halfway into the film we learn the quadriplegic character made a deal with his parents that he will end his life after 6 months during the film we learn this guy is smart and etc etc someone even points out that he could go back to work if he wanted to but this guy is hell bent on killing himself for the simple reason of which happens to be that he misses his old life so he is giving up on this life and apparently that is a good enough reason to let the man kill himself great message to put out there into the world we recently lost muhammad ali we all know about muhammad alis condition and we all saw the impact he had on the world both before and in spite of his condition he fought until the bitter end and became more of a legend because of it this movie encourages people to take the easy way out now i can understand how depression can play a role in all of this but this character is a pretty boy with a sht load of money and on top of that he found the love of his life and she is more than ready to be with him forever but his reasoning is that he would only be a burden on her living her life so yeah this movie pretty much matches the materialistic and self absorbed nature of what these modern times have transformed into whatever the movie is a chick flick at best so i dont care apparently suicide isnt frowned upon when a quadriplegic is concerned moral of the story you have nothing to contribute to society once you become paralyzed maybe this movie was funded by the government as a way of reducing the cost of people with disabilities on healthcare euthanasia for the win frankly a disgusting message and an even more disgusting movie,sad
i have already read the book so i decided to most definitely see the movie i think that they did very well on a book to movie adaptation because they didnt change too much from the book the movie was beautifully made and fit just what i and others who have read it in my city had pictured for the moviethe casting was brilliant as with the portrayal of louisa and will both characters were charismatic and enjoyable and matched the dialogue of the book which i thought was greatthe movie itself was heartbreaking hilarious at points and just and lovable the story itself is well thought out and great one of the best things about this is it is not just your usual love story the real love doesnt take over the whole plot it isnt fully made to feel intimate but just to feel realso i say go see it if you are a boy or girl it doesnt matter this movie is memorable for everyone,sad
spoiler warning the acting was all outstanding give them a 10 the story missed give the writers a zero will has every thing going for him a great job a fantastic girlfriend and a rich family his life changes in a fraction of a second he becomes bitter and reclusive turning away his girlfriend until she leaves him for his best friend will is a wimp of unbelievable proportions oh poor me im rich have two living and supportive parents a job to return to and a girlfriend louisa as hot as they come who loves me unconditionally im not the man i once was my only option is to kill myself oh give me a break who is the same person they use to be this movie had an opportunity to have will realize what he had to offer his family friends and louisa where was the creative people and writer on this one i will close with one word stephen hawking,sad
repeat spoiler alert though if youre wise you wont waste your time on this moviea summary would be enter william a rich spoiled playboy who has everything he wants and does anything he wants with whomever he wants then he has a tragic accident leaving him paralyzed he decides that this kind of life isnt worth living and wants to be killed he promises his parents 6 months where enters lou the charming highspirited woman who in an effort to show him life is worth living in which is still an entirely selfcentered focused only on making himself happy she falls in love with him all seems to be going well they think he has abandoned thoughts of suicide but no he selfishly decides to throw his life away because he cant have everything his way and it is wrapped in a cloak of care and love and support to peoples decisions but ultimately it is sending the message it doesnt matter who loves you or how important you can be or what you can do for others if you dont have everything you want and have it your way just give up in a day when depression and suicides are at an alltime high here comes a story that had the potential to be a great encouragement to anyone dealing with depression and suicidal thoughts but instead encourages people to give up and throw it all awayespecially when you think of the high percentage of suicides or attempts by teenage girls and an actor like sam who is idolized by many presenting this message it is appalling that such messages are being presented as entertainment,sad
the art of movies should give people hope instead this movie is a hope killer this movie is saying live boldly unless you are are with disability  what about real people with real disability who will watch this movie the movie makers are telling them that its better to die than to struggle in life we have many incredible examples for people with disability like for example stephen hawking whose disability was even greater than will hawking couldnt even speak or move his head but he he is one of the greatest scientists in the world many moments in the movie are cheerful  touching specially lou who is hilarious funny  very innocent however the message the movie delivering is terrible,sad
this is a sweet combination of all factors in the movie the actors the actresses the choices of the places the story plot even the soundtrack i love every single of it expect to feel warm and heartbroken at the same time in the movie its been says after watching it i still cant stop thinking about this movie youd better watch it with someone who could provide a shoulder to cry on for you  my favorite which seems to be everyones favorite as well is during the wedding ceremony where will seemed so alive again my most heartbreaking scene is when will said will you be here on the last scene that is when i burst into tears a lot like a lot,sad
i never thought id watch a movie and laugh and cry at the same time i dont know how the actors were selected but i must say the combination is a miracle i wish i knew emilia clarke lou personality to figure out the gap between the real her and the character she played in this movie after watching this movie i became so emotional i felt love and loved i watched it alone and wish i did with my girlfriend although the ending got me nervous it was cool i couldnt think of something better big thumbs up for the whole crew you guys did it i wasnt a big fan of love stories but now thats where im heading,sad
this film and presumably the book on which it is based commits a triple whammy first it portrays disabled people as miserable second it perpetuates the idea that they need rescuing by a vivacious non disabled youngster third it presents disabled people as still so miserable despite being rescued that they have to go to switzerland to be euthanased prince harry must be tearing his hair out after all his efforts with the invicta games to portray disabled people positively the film is nothing more than propaganda for the really dangerous swiss death machine dignitas it is ghastly and should be banned,sad
dont get me wrong i like a weepy romantic chickflick as much as the next guy but this one is so manipulative and overthetop that i felt myself getting hostile about a third the way through it took selfcontrol not to make rude comments at the screenpart of the problem is emilia clarke he character is modeled after the brigit jones style of selfconsciously klutzy heart on her sleeve heroine that holds appeal to many viewers clarkes acting is filled with so many facial tics it almost becomes unintentionally comic if you shaved ms clarkes eyebrows shed convey no emotional range but with them shed be a natural silent movie actress her eyebrows literally stole every scene they were inthe music especially the segments used between scenes goes beyond intrusive it is downright offensive if a character is about to die and is falling in love do we really need an overwrought vocalist singing oh poor me im falling in love yet im about to die this is like a greek chorus with one eye on the am playlist im exaggerating here but the point is real we dont need treacly vocal music to mimic what weve just seen most of us got it the first time you need a break between scenes instrumental segues would work just fine thank youive given this a 2 out of 10 in every way this big budget film deserves a rock bottom 1 for its manipulative and overdone approach ive given it the extra point for the lovely location shooting at least the castles dont have eyebrows,sad
i enjoy a good romantic comedy or chick flick that tells a tale of complicated people falling in love in even more complicated circumstances when those people are actually decent people that is not the case here lou is in a relationship with patrick a seemingly nice and decent guy hes active fun appropriately funny ambitious sweet and he truly cares for her theyve been together 7 years then she meets will will is a complete asshole no really there is not 1 redeeming quality about him as a person hes dull he speaks in a completely monotone voice the entire movie hes not funny not even a little bit hes insulting hes selfish hes suicidal he does nothing to even attempt to make anyone elses life around him better the only thing that this man has going for him is that he is rich and handsome he even admits that he would want nothing to do with her if he was still able to walk and this doesnt phase her one bit were supposed to give him a pass on all of those things just because hes in a wheelchair no sorry just no she falls for this guy and you could say oh but he was sweet and he gave her compliments but no she clearly falls for him well before that everything she falls for is superficial she loves the adventure she loves the money she loves the feeling that she gets from taking care of him as it makes her feel needed there is nothing about him as a person that she falls for so she throws away 7 years with a great guy for a fling with a rich and handsome asshole wow and this was the movie that somebody decided to make wow this woman deserves to end up alone and the only redeeming quality about this movie is that she is alone in the end and i can at least imagine that this fling that she threw away everything for will torture her for the rest of her life as she tries to find another rich and handsome man that can fill wills shoes which in reality she never will this movie is a tragedy not a love story,sad
a film is a work of art an authors expression the directors creativity the performers charisma and the captivating music can embrace a person and touch some of those primal feelings hidden deep within vaults in our heart at its base is a very simple story requiring some astounding performances to make it come to life the film focuses on the feelings of innocence simplicity commitment loyalty and love how true are you with the people around you will you stick around at a trying time of anothers life the film makes you dwell on the unpredictability of life in a moment everything can change and maybe in a way which is not possible for us to beara truly magnificent piece of cinema,sad
once again emilia clarke does not disappoint the acting truly was brilliant both on her part and on sam claflins part the film reminded me of the untouchables a bit it was a very pleasant sight to the eye to see the bond forming between will and lou decent amount of humor as well found myself laughing quite often in fact it is nice to sometimes be able to empathize with the characters as well i cant really think of anything negative at this point either maybe that most of the movie was kind of predictable the ending however might not have been as predictable i didnt want to go to this movie myself but was asked to see it in hindsight im glad i tagged along because i did really enjoy watching it,sad
a very beautiful and emotional movie emilia was perfect for the role and was so adorable,sad
i realy didnt watch any movie like this its adorible i realy like clarks smile its so sweet,sad
one of the best romantic movies ive ever seenthank u emilia clark for that outstanding performance,sad

right away i felt something was off about this film it had the actors the acting and the idea and i couldnt quite describe why i felt this way i was never sure where the film was leading me and couldnt understand the characters or their motivations overall it felt very confusing that is until the climax finally came after reflection i describe this film as entirely dishonest with its audience this dishonesty kills the potential for that unrestrained cathartic ending we all were waiting for although it did spur up quite the conversations and reflections after its viewing it was not the types the conversations the writers clearly tried to push,sad
i liked this movie i like the dialogue its quite charming and the comedy bits work really well i was pleasantly surprised that there were not clich moments and the flow of the story came naturally  the 2 main characters have great chemistry and emilia clark is simply adorable its a simple story told wellthe director of the film did a good job overall however there was 1 problem with this movie and that was the soundtrack they used  except the 2 bits of classic music the rest of it was simply abysmal and it really hurt the movie  it gave that cheesy soapy feel of a telenovela episodebut getting past that i really enjoyed this movie more then i thought i would and i would recommend watching this  have fun,sad
yep i hated it i didnt find the girl super likable or well developed the fashion was so far out there it was awful it felt like there was very little character development there we are meant to take her as a chatty cathy but it doesnt seem that way shes not that quick of a talker or that much of one likewise there is little reason to believe she hated the guy he wasnt super developed either seemed like they hated  endured each other and then it switched all of the sudden the male character had a chance to grow but didnt it could have foreshadowed the ending better scenes where she walks in and he is in pain and hides it after he notices her or times when hes a little crabby to other people and she brushes it off i didnt find his decision that inline with the man that was portrayed making him a hypocrite when he tells clark to go on and live her life to the fullestthere are several themes made by the ending that i fully disagree with 1 if youre in enough pain its ok to kill yourself 2 its better to die than to be a burden 3 you can choose to die its not selfish and after a month the girl you had watch your death will be totally ok and without grief 4 if all else fails give said girl a trust fund and you can buy her happiness and she wont grieve anymore 5 death is romanticyes you can say its up to the viewer to decide to take out of it but these themes were implied by clarks lack of remorse or sadness at the end there are reviewers that say it highlights the joy of living and it is only the male that goes against them but the happy way the end was portrayed discredits the highlights giventhe few things i did like the castle and rich people house and quality of film was ok,sad
if you are disabled kill yourself thats the message of the movie packaged in a love story its just another attempt to undermine the sanctity of life and normalise euthanasia horrific real love sometimes means saying no to people when theyre wrong allowing someone to commit suicide just because they are disabled is not love disabled people arent secondclass citizens they are people,sad
i love romromcoms i love sam claflin when i saw this trailer therefore i thought it would be right up my alley i didnt read the book so i went into this viewing with no preconceptions or standards to be met i thought it was too bubbly too cheesycutesy miss clarkes crazy eyebrows shooting up into her hairline to imitate a look of bemusement surprise condolence placation and everything else was driving me batty her little girl striped and polkadotted outfits and her personality felt very contrived and forced her moving from a waitress in a bakery to a home companion for a filthy rich family is out in left field too i just couldnt i felt there was nowhere near enough chemistry in the two main characters to hold my interest enough to even finish the film,sad
i have never read the book so did not know the ending of this story which i will not give away i suggest however that nobody watch this film without at least reading the synopsis so they know how it ends  it may change your mind about watching it in the first place or at least prepare you for one of the most tasteless endings in a film ever the problem is that the movie is so sweet and monotoned that the depressing ending both assaults you and offends it is not giving anything away to say that the male character is contemplating dignatas services with no judgement whatsoever on this it is important to note that this is a compassionate organisation but according to all media far from luxurious the book may have dealt in detail with the realty of disability so deadly or degrading that the sufferer feels deeply they need release however this movie treats the illnesses associated with the male characters disability as intermittent blips in an otherwise improving quality of life it leaves such a bitter taste in the mouth because the conclusion is that a valuable life must be expansive and in an able body being close to parents loving unconditionally life unexpected are failures it is a shame as the performances are great  if the movie was a real romcom with a joyful ending or a serious drama with a tragic twist this story could have worked  unfortunately it was neither rather it was an amusing film that meandered off the side of a cliff with a thud,sad
im not sure why critics are raving about but they clearly did not see the same film that the rest of us did the one about a silly 20something yearold girl whos hired by a rich couple to take care of their paraplegic sonthis film suffers from the same ailments that many american biopics and romantic comedies do namely a lack of originality and a dull formulaic structure  regardless of whether or not its an adaptation of an awardwinning novel from the second the movie began i predicted every single emotional beat in the film and when it would happen nothing caught me off guard or left me thinking wow ive never seen that before or i never saw that coming this film is a testament to the concept of safe filmmaking which pervades our entertainment industry the main character lou clark played by emilia clarke has no admirable characteristics other than she wears unorthodox outfits and likes shoes she outright admits it herself in the film she lacks intelligence i suppose one could argue that shes an immensely compassionate individual but what motivates her compassion theres no depth to her character  or any of the characters for that matter despite being financially unstable lous sister and parents are happy as can be she takes the job caring for the paraplegic will traynor played by sam claflin to help keep her family afloat but theres never any pressure that there family might be worse off if she didnt take the job nothing bad ever happens at all in the entire film actually except for at the end when will tells lou that they cannot be together despite their love and chooses to die theres barely any conflict lou is never really put to the test she never learns anything she never overcomes any obstacles the whole entire plot is a giant pile of emotions and obsessions shoes for example mushed together into a 110 minute pile of banal oscarbait id like to mention that this film has seen the screen in a different form before a form that was much more enjoyable to watch because it didnt take itself as seriously im referring to the 2011 french film the intouchables perhaps the filmmakers behind should have taken a few ideas from olivier nakache and eric toledanos playbookwhen all is said and done i came out of the theater very sad i gave it a shot hoping with all my being that would challenge me or catch me offguard with some serious wit or humor despite knowing it would not but instead it was just another average romantic drama to be filed away with the rest it did not impress anything upon me i did not leave the theater wondering about all the symbolism and imagery in the film and what it could mean because there was none even the production design was lazy and trite  a sad misfortune indeedmy advice to the average joe going to see this film go into the theater with zero expectations sit down with your popcorn and your significant other and prepare to shut off your brain like you do when you watch hgtv sports or sitcoms you wont be carried away on a mystical thoughtprovoking journey no not all if thats the kind of experience you expect you will be sorely disappointed,sad
is an outstanding adaptation of jojo moyes novel about louisa taking care of the moody and pretentious will traynor the book itself is very detailed and gives you all the specifics about their relationship and this is also seen throughout the movie i had waited a long time after reading the book to find out that the movie is coming out featuring sam claflin and emilia clarke what more could be better than finnick from the hunger games and daenerys from game of thrones their chemistry for one another is astounding even though some may see this as a clich movie where louisa finds will love and expresses it throughout the movie whilst adding a lot of humour its the ending of this movie which changes a lot of views and perspectives for me especially i found it very emotional as did many who watched it because you expect there to be a happy ending even though the ending was still very good i feel as if the movie is very rushed and youd expect there to be more i feel like a whole lot from the book could have been added to give the audience more awareness as some things were confusing and youd have to read the book to understand nevertheless the movie was amazing and heartbreaking to say the least and i do think it is a special thing for everyone to watch,sad
i get it that the rating isnt that great i get that the movie did not receive a lot of appreciationi was even hesitant to watch it but i thought of giving it a tryand i was amazed what a movie the happiness she propagatesthe sadness she faces when she fails to do what she wants toshe wearing the yellowblack socks wow and longbottom looks very cool in the jealous boyfriend lookthere is no way any other actress could be cuter than emelia clarkebrilliant moviea must watch ,sad
first time i have written a review but just too say a movie has never made me cry so much that i started to laugh and every time i kept looking at the screen i would start balling againim a 47 year old male who loves action movies and yet this film hit me like a grenade i gave the film a 10 purely on how the movie made me feel emilia clark was a joy to watch throughout the filmyou were so believable to the point that when you cried i couldnt stop myselfif a movie can make someone react in this waythe film has done its job with entertaining an audience i never read the book as i dont read booksso i saw this movie without any knowledge on what to expect,sad
really good movie first one to made me cry great performances from everyone emilia and sam have a good chemistry people are saying that he should not have done it but i think it was is choice and everyone should respect it but however he should have give it a harder try in conclusion is a great great movie well casted and beautiful environments too i cant possibly imagine what people whom are disabled go trough sam gives a solid performance as a disabled person in the begging is a smartass but then he becomes really cool which means that sam is a good actor and emilia is great with that goofy look on her face and always chating and smiling,sad
this has got to be the worst movie i have ever watched i dont know if im being overly critical due to having recently read the book but i genuinely feel that this movie has got to be the worst book to movie adaptationi thought that nearly every scene was over dramatized too much emotion where it is not neededthe relationships between several key characters were awkward there was no chemistry between them in particular the relationship between lou and will was terrible i partially thought that maybe it was the actors that created the poor chemistry although i thought that individually their acting was brilliant and i love emilia clarke but together they did just not work in fact i was kind of embarrassed for them lou and treenas relationship was also all wrong poor casting of jenna coleman as treenai was absolutely appalled by the errors in the story line there were too many changes that effected the way that the characters are portrayed key ideas and events were often squeezed into the same sentence where in the book the same ideas were spread throughout some events were left out entirely multiple events were merged into one things that were done or said by a certain character were then said by a different character and there were characters missing all together wills sister georgie i appreciate that it is probably difficult to fit a whole book into the time of a movie but i feel that in this case it has been poorly done vital information is missing that would have been critical to character development and would have helped refine the whole moviei had high hope for this movie after reading what turned out to be an absolute page turner of a book but i have been left miserably disappointed,sad
this is my first review on here so bear with me please i actually dont view this as a romantic moviestory for me this is a movie about life choices and the influence we have on one anotheri understand that the main topic in the story is sensitive and controversial to say at the least i also get that some people will be offended by the outcome of the story however i do think that as much as those people are entitled to their own opinion as am i and anyone else who has seen or read the story so is everyone else in life in general which proves the point that will is entitled to his own opinion and choice in lifefirst let me start off with the fact that i read the book when it came out and it had a huge impact on me and the way i thought about the value of life you see  everyone has dreams goals and to some extend expectations of the life we want to lead when for some reason all of that is taken away from us i can understand that it would be difficult for a person to find a positive way of viewing an impossibly negative adverse situation i love really love the fact that there always will be people like lou who find a way to make any negative into a positive and that they will do their utter best to spread their love of life and positive attitudeeven if theyre not aware they do it i also love that will even though his mind is set to end his life appreciates and respects the effort lou is making to make him stay and appreciate the little things or the big ones like her love for him in life what really got me thinking is that everyone would think that will is selfish for wanting to take his own life generally speaking if someone takes the easy way out it would be viewed as a cowardly thing to do or a selfish act however this is not really that simple because will is in a situation most of us will never be able to comprehend yes there are definitely examples of people stephen hawking who have found a motivational way to live through such a tragedy but not everyone is the same not everyone is able to move past their feelings the physical discomfort and the limitations placed upon the person by such a situation come to think of it isnt it selfish for everyone else to want will to stay alive for them while he is in pain and has no way to live the life he has always wanted to live isnt it just as bad to not respect someones wishes when we can never know how it feels to be themgenerally i believe that the story had a positive outcome for everyone involved even though will chose to let go of life something positive remained something that will have louisa pursue life in a different way than she had ever thought of beforeanyway  i can go on and on about the different themes motifs  symbols in this story its rich and it certainly gave me plenty to think about i hope that many people will get to fall in love with the story just like i did even though its heavily loaded and most definitely hard to take inthanks for taking the time to read this,sad
was great but the main attraction was emilia clarke she is beautiful the movie would have been terrible without her i loved ever single second of this movie it was by far a triumph you have to see this movie to believe it is a great masterpieceparents this is a british love story so there might be some things you may not want your little ones to see but they will probably see it anyway it was stupendous you will fall in love with emilia clarke she is wonderfuli have seen a lot of love stories but never one this good before it is just mind blowing thanks to emilia clarke she will just wipe you off your feet she has a gift and that gift is to actyou and your family will love this masterpiece,sad
this is one of the best romance movies i have ever seen i highly recommend it to everyone,sad
this movie should have been called mad weak what a terrible concept for a movie a strong privileged man turns into a huge crybaby his parents characters should worn big pink shirts with pictures of vaginas on them throughout the movie because they were such giant psies for supporting his decision to end it all what a joke his girlfriend is a true disappointment for not toughloving him into waking up from his egoinduced selfish ego maniac pathetic worldview trance terrible movie even worse message to send younger viewers,sad
all of the reviews that i have read about this movie in the secular press have been artful lures to suck people into watching a movie that comes to a despicable conclusion it is very very difficult to find a review of this movie that includes the fact that the film is an advocacy piece for assisted suicide for disabled people my wifes friends from church took her to this movie thinking that it is akin to a chick flick they wanted to help her see a lighter side to life a mere 16 months since our older son took his life as a result of his mental illness needless to say this movie is not the right antidote for that but who would have known the truth from reading the reviews of the movie no one it is as if the producers and marketers of this movie were in a cabal to hide the real intent of the film diabolical to say the least,sad
greetings again from the darkness who doesnt enjoy a good cry in a dark movie theatre the first feature film from director thea sharrock is taken directly from the tearjerker novel by jojo meyes who also wrote the screenplay although i try to avoid using the term very often its very much a bythenumbers chick flick  complete with the heartofgold working class girl trying her best to save the handsome rich guy to whom life has dealt a tough hand for fans of the book and the genre it should deliver the desired effect  the studio even provided movie logo tissues for the screeningfor most of us the effectiveness of this type of movie comes down to the characters luisa is the effervescent working class girl hired as a personal assistant to the extremely wealthy quadriplegic will traynor emilia clarke game of thrones does everything in her power to make us and will traynor like luisa to describe her as optimistic is like saying eric clapton can play guitar calling her perky would be like saying donald trump has hair both statements are true but hardly capture the totality of reality in stark contrast sam claflin the hunger games mockingjay purposefully underplays will  the one time cliffdiving james bond birthday video type now confined to a wheelchairlu is a constant toothy smile complemented by expressive and active eyebrows that somehow overshadow her chatty bedside manner and kaleidoscopic and geometric clothes and shoes  all encompassed with an everbouncy step that would make tigger envious lu mostly shares the screen with will and the personal nurse and therapist nathan played by stephen peacocke the camera certainly loves all three of these faces and director sharrock wisely adds janet mcteer and charles dance as wills parents they bring a regal presence to what otherwise could have played a bit too cutesydespite the heavy dose of awww the story deserves credit for touching on the right to die or dying with dignity debate while those closest to will selfishly proclaim they dont understand his plan to head to switzerland its nathan who says it best  who am i to judge while a full on discussion of the topic would be out of place here the film does a nice job of not shying away from the processother recognizable faces in the cast include jenna coleman doctor who as lus sister and confidante and matthew lewis harry potter series as lus fitness freak boyfriend who isnt very understanding  of either lu or her job theres also an odd but welcome wedding cameo from joanna lumley my biggest issue with the story is that i just never understood how or when lu fell so deeply in love with will sure i get the appeal of the castle the concertos and the tropical vacations but where was the real personal connection was it simply that she thought she could charm will into changing his mind on the big decision thats not really love another piece thats difficult to take  the numerous musical interludes seemingly designed to make sure viewers are in the proper state of melancholy there was another segment that i found not just ironic but actually annoying however discussion of the live boldly advice would give away the films ending  something im not sure even matters since its made pretty clear throughout but it still goes against my movie code,sad
might be some spoilersi loved the whole story it is brilliant well it is standard story hating the whole world disabled person and the charming and cheerful one who takes care of another but wills will to choose that way of the remaining life was crushing both mine and louisas hearts he shouldve found strength in himself to live doesnt matter if in pain or constant agony at least he shouldve lived for her all of us saw that they fell in love i hate people who choose to be selfish to make themselves priority number one because they are tired the world and life doesnt work that way you must want to livei have been sobbing my ass off for an hour straight i would have given an a but wills decision made it to the damn f even the name of the movie says it all how he loves or loved himself before the accident and later her my tears are out of fiercenessanyway worth watching but be prepared and prepare some tissues for your running nosecheersbupd i slept really bad the night after seeing the movie woke up crying like a baby and cant stop doing it it is infuriating,sad
i tired to watch this movie i really did but i quickly realized that emilia clarke cant act and made the movie unwatchablewhat i do with movies is skip through them a bit just to get a feel of what the movie is like too many movies i sit through about 10 mins and i feel like i wasted 10 min of my life i will never get back never again so i skip and within a few minutes can tell if i should even bother watching the whole movie i did this with this one and saw there was nothing worth watching just a pile of dung reallyso basically as most people can tell by the current state of cinema that its not really the movie that is important its what is behind the scenes like take the recent suicide squad hyped as all get out and it turned out to be a dud i have not seen it yet but i am not shocked the reason that movie was made was to cash in on the popularity of superhero movies avengers justice league batsuperspider man etcnow to the reason this movie was made this movie is a vehicle to try and launch the career of these two actors emilia clarke and sam claflin emilia clarke is famous for the same reason sasha grey is to put it lightly emilia clarke appeared totally naked in the basically soft core p0rn tv show  gore that is game of thrones that is all really the only reason she is in this movie is to make her look like a seriousreal actress nope sorry girl you are just a piece of meat you wont fool me and sam claflin sorry you can act but you just cant carry a movie you will always be only a supporting actor sorry i thought we learned that lesson in the failure that was love rosie 2014 lily collins also cant carry a movie why are we making the same mistake in this movieit was painful watching emilia clarke try to break her type casting as the hot girl playing a nerdy girl really painful to watch just painful she cant act and the movie is just trash the story as well i mean its like insult to injury imagine a sick old hobo just lost control over his bowels and bladder in a dumpster where he was digging for food and you throw a dead body on top vomit throw some dirty diapers in there and top it all off with medical waste that is a good way to describe this movie from bad to worse 1 bad actress 2 no leading man 3 bad plot 4 bad well you get the pointgood movies are just good movies there should be no ulterior motives just make a movie i dont even know what i fung expected from this movie it was so bad a nice little rom com at least nope just a pile of tripe stop making movies for reasons other than making a good movieps her eyebrows were emma watson level bad,sad
indeed the story was moving and the actors did very well but the story itself is extremely disturbing regarding the value of human life i can see potential for a few interpretations about lous takeshe might still disagree with will about his decision but shes supporting him because its what he wants but thats not really the question there are definite politics here about the right to live andor die with dignity that are very disturbing how can we call ourselves civilized when weve come to the point that we can accept and support someones decision to end his life simply because he cant enjoy it to the fullest as he once did his parents were very loving and he definitely could afford to go on living his mind was alive and well and he was positively contributing to his society why are we supposed to accept this as his right to choose unbelievable but thats not all the other disturbing thing is the pushing of the notion that one cant accept life unless its full of exotic and costly adventures lou wasnt free to live her life until the end when will left her an inheritance of tons of money think life is worth living even if youre in a wheelchair even if youre going through hard trials even if you dont have much money even if your mind isnt as sharp as it once was even if you cant do a number of things boo,sad
as an aspiring movie producerdirector i was amazed by this film yes 1010 is very presumptuous of me and may be a slight exaggeration but personally i loved every second of the movie and was anxiously dying to watch it all over again the second it ended this movie makes you think in different ways and to think in their shoes which i love i also might love this so much because i can relate due to my brother having a born disease where he cannot walk when people see this film some of wills ways of thinking are very unorthodox to some and viewers may think the character is crazy but understanding the life that handicapped people live i thought it was perfectly executed this film was a fantastic movie the location the actors the music scorer etc it all blew me away and i loved it 1010 would recommend,sad
you know when you actually feel gratitude to hollywood and incredible talent this is it after laughing and crying this film left me feeling like id actually experienced something for a change emilia clark is an absolute delight sam claflin was perfect i cant remember the last time ive seen such a movie that left me feeling so emotionally drained  in a good way emilia is so animated and she is now one of my favourites the script is amazingly well written  one of those that makes you forget there even is one the actors deliver the story so well from the production to the directing to the editing  i cant see how they couldve done a better job a mustsee for sure,sad
ok so this movie started out pretty good i thought it was going to be the typical boy meets girl and falls in love story with a twist of the paralysis thrown in never did i think it would end the way it did awful spoiled rich party boy winds up in a wheelchair and cant accept that his life will never be what it once was so he selfishly ends his pain and suffering by assisted suicide thereby transferring his pain on those who love him for the rest of their lives what a terrible message to send to anyone facing trials of life awful,sad
what a horrible message not even tackling the issue with euthanasia here what terrible superficial characters so whats the idea the simple working class girl not having access to proper education and decent future finds her mission in serving a rich paralyzed guy who throws her some money before dying because she allowed him to stick his nose in her breasts and kiss her watch carefully young girls,sad
so what does the phrase mean does it mean i will be unselfish and put myself and my wishes before yours not from the context of this filmfor most of this movie i tended to be with it it was refreshing to see emilia clarke as a vulnerable emotional goofball and then came the point of decision and she pours her heart out to him revealing the depth of her feeling for him and yet he resolutely chooses death and then after what seems like it might have been a chance to ruminate over the meaning of life she is convinced very easily that the most loving thing is to be by his side at his chosen end and he dies plot spoiled but you really should know this now before you see it and she gets scads of money to follow her heart and and a goodbye note telling her to forget about him fat chance at the point of decision i thought to myself if he chooses life even with his pain this would be a pretty good romantic movie but then i thought if this story takes the road chosen by the obvious media proclivities of the 21st century hell choose to die but hell give her money sure enoughand the moral to the story is this each person lives alone love is figment of the moment nobody changes their minds and to try to do so would be morally wrong what is most important is to follow your dreams any serious lessening of the ability to do that would be to live so poorly that only death is a cure so he can no longer follow his dreams and though his existence clearly helps and changes her life for the good that is not good enough reason to live with serious pain and since she gets to follow her dreams everything is ultimately for the bestwhat utter bullshit it is really time to start questioning the assumption that the meaning of life is to follow ones dreams especially since it is clear that this is the fondest wish of the commercial establishment upon us it is only the illusion of choice now seems to mean im before you in line and you arent cutting in it becomes the complete statement of selfishness,sad
the actors do a wonderful job in their roles and portray their different walks of life very well the hard thing about this movie is the people are nice the story line is plausible but the ending is totally unrealistic pie in the sky unrealistic fantasy this movie created a huge tension at the end one that most people would want to see end in a different way the message this movie conveys is raunchy bad because of the ending those of us who have lost a loved one to suicide dont have purely happy memories of one who took their own life losing a loved one to suicide is like surviving a terrible car crash there are scars and wounds that never go away it is absolutely ridiculous to think that this lovely young lady lives her life at peace and happy after having her heart won by this charming young man who chooses to end his life another reason the content is raunchy is because it gives a horrible message to those facing such a dilemma with their life circumstances it doesnt offer them an alternative or hope come on get real such hard circumstances require answers that are outside of our selfa massive clash of values is expressed by this movie for those who do not value life and see humanism as their religion and framework to live by the movie expresses it extremely well summed up humanism is after all all about me and what i want and what i dont want dont tell me what to do or do anything to impose your limitations on what i want to do with my life i am after all the captain of my fatein real life a lovely young lady went through a heart wrenching experience when she was seventeen and became a quadriplegic she has been so courageous gracious and vulnerable to share her struggles her pain her hope setbacks and successes she has written a book joni the unforgettable story of a young womans struggle against quadriplegia  depression it also became a movie she shares her suicidal thoughts anger frustration etc her accident happened in 1967 she has persevered and touched hundreds of thousands of lives for the good her life message touches  challenges those of us who have the use of all our limbs as well as those who have physical limitations she has accomplished far more in her wheelchair than most of us without one she is a positive example of how someone with quadriplegia can live overcome and reach out on a daily basis,sad
i was avoiding this movie because i knew how horrible emilia clarke is as an actress but this wasnt just bad acting it was also horrible melodramatic sappy writing emilia clarkes eyebrows contouring into weird spaghetti in every scene is the grossest thing ive ever seen worst movie ever,sad
this film is one of those rare instances where a novel by jojo moyes is adapted for the screen by the novelist and finds a sensitive director such as thea sharrock and the result is a story that could have been sanguine but instead is an enriching emotional journey to discover this film among all the crime and killing and morbid vampire or other undead creatures stories and overblown cgi comic bookfairy tale adventures is a breath of fresh airthe story takes place in england and in a very subtle way shares an insight between the wealthy and the poor  emphasizing that richness is truly in the spirit rather than the bank account lou clark emilia clarke knows lots of things she knows how many footsteps there are between the bus stop and home she knows she likes working in the buttered bun tea shop and she knows she might not love her longterm boyfriend patrick matthew lewis her family brendan coyle jenna coleman samantha spiro and alan breck needs money and insist lou seek employment when lou loses her job it is out of pure fortitude that she finds one  as caretaker of a young wealthy quadriplegic  a job that ultimately keeps her sane will traynor excellent sam claflin knows his motorcycle accident took away his desire to live he is supported by his male nurse nathan the superb stephen peacocke as well as his loving parents janet mcteer and charles dance he knows everything feels very small and rather joyless now and he knows exactly how hes going to put a stop to that  a planned death after fulfilling his parents plea for a six month reprise what will doesnt know is that lou is about to burst into his world in a riot of color and neither of them knows theyre going to change each other for all time until lou concocts a bucket list of events that brings light into her life as well as joy into wills final dayswithout becoming morbid the interplay between lou and will is a transformation and due to the splendid script and sensitive direction and a cast of superb actors in every part this little film makes a lasting impression restoring our faith in what friendship and love can achieve in short this is a brilliant little film worthy of at least one watching if not multiple highly recommended,sad
it broke my heart seeing this movie it is so beautifulwill and louisa they should have been together,sad
i like how realistic this movie is i am not into silly happy ending we always hear people preaching how to be strong against disability cancer and such no one knows what its like except the affected person i dont see a negative message in this movie great acting nice music i give it a 10,sad
many people are unfairly rating this movie very low based on being their moral pomposity this movie doesnt speak for every paraplegic or disabled person but guess what just like in real life some disabled individuals both physically and mentally as well as some seemingly able bodied decide that their quality of life or rather lack of is not the way they want to continue living it is their individual choice we dont get to decidemost of those same reviews also note that hes some selfish billionaire that wants to die because he doesnt have everything he wants how shallow it implies if hed been a working class joe hed of been more accepting of his disability not necessarily my impression is that he would have given up the riches to be able bodied again as an able bodied person i dont dare judge his decision to decide his own quality of life given his severe physical disability i would hope quadraplegics understand that not all people are willing to adapt and overcome i have told my husband i would not want to live in a vegetative state its not a quality of life i envision for myself but i respect the families that maintain their loved ones in that state its an individual choice and we need to respect that this movie isnt advocating suicide for the disabled but rather advocating individual choice which i believe is an inherit right,sad
emilia clark and her edgy looks makes this movie so cute  fun to watch i hate the ending tho ,sad
cried the first time i watched it now its the 6th time ive seen it and i noticed that the more times i watch it the earlier into the film i cry lous character is so beautiful and so is their relationship which makes me cry because i know how it endswould recommend if you want a good cry and if youre a fan of emilia clarke shes so cute in this,sad
very good love storygreat story great acting just a perfect movie,sad
where to begin alright emilia clarkes eyebrows are atrocious as for the story rich boy has an accident ends up with a spinal cord injury and paralysed and fails to accept his fate and sticks to his decision to kill himself at the end because hes missing his old life my issues with this stinker of a movie 1 there is absolutely no depth to the main characters one dimensional materialistic morons who are absolutely unrelatable 2 what is the message of this movie 3 id find it easy as well to smile at the end in memory of the person i loved if that person would have left me rich after passing away 4 one of the points if not the point of this tripe seems to be once you are in a wheelchair you are out wow this kind of rubbish in 2017 however as far as this movie goes the before the injury and after the injury was not teased out kinda essential if your main character kills himself at the end and you want your audience to either understand his decision or to root for him 5 if the audience would have had a chance to relate to both before and after injury it would have been a better movie 6 if the actual struggles and challenges of living with this injury would have been portrayed in a realistic enough way it would have been a better movie 7 if the main actress would have been able to actually act it would have been a better movie 8 if the main character would have been portrayed as a human being capable of making decisions for himself and people respected and supported him regardless if they agreed or not it would have been a better movie this movie is so one dimensional it is not even comical it utterly misrepresents living with a spinal injury and relations to personal assistants,sad
if the director of a movie has stirred an emotion in a viewer does that make it a good movie i think yes because the viewer has been touched within and the story connected with that person on some level unfortunately for director thea sharrock and writer jojo moyes the emotional connection for this viewer me was negative and borderline angry but the movie is a good 6 or 7 stars worth to me because i found it well scripted acted and photographedthe plot is so british class oriented i was gritting my teeth we have will traynor an upper crust society rich boy who is able to afford any indulgence he so desires he lives in a mansion and owns an ancestral castle has had top line education and was a multitalented sportsman and is exceptionally handsome mr upper crust will is arrogant self centered and oh so superior then there is lou clark a working class former shop girl living in a small bungalow with her family her father is currently unemployed and cannot find a job the family depends on lous income to make ends meet she looses her shop job and applies as a companion aide to the now disabled quadriplegic will traynor his mother is so charmed by miss shop girl lous cheerful and quirky attitude she hires her so theres the first problem  a working class person having to survive by being in service to an upper society family what a good little brit she is and of course the traynors feel its their duty to provide for the lower classes so they hire lous father as a castle facility technician  read grounds keeper for the castle then there is the ever available nathan who supplies the muscle to move will from bed to chair and back plus keep account of wills borderline health its never explained how nathan is always  on call cant keep the superiors of society waitingthe title is also an issue with this viewer we are never given a definition of this title which of the two main characters is me and which is you think about it  as the relationship between will  lou warms up the easy answer is will as the me because of his death wish and to hell with the now close emotional bond between will  lou bytheway if will so wanted to die why didnt he give in to his lung infection when hospitalized it surely would have easily killed a quadriplegicon the other hand its not too difficult to take lou as the me because she has dedicated her efforts to change will and bring him out of his self imposed reclusiveness and bitterness toward life lou is determined to make him change his mind on being euthanized so theres the conflict  neither one actually respects the emotional bond  love that has developed between them will hates his physical existence and wants death as a release lou can only focus on how happy she is being with him both are not thinking about how the other one feelsmy other problem with this story is very simple to grasp will has everything a person could want and the intelligence to create a new life for himself but chooses death because he cannot live as he did before his disability the producers of this story are implying a disabled person is less of a human due to a disability is permanently unhappy and not capable of contributing to society thus death is their best option if will was fine physically but emotionally depressed and wanted to be euthanized would the viewing public be as enthusiastic about this movie definitely notthe subconscious messages in this story are shameful but go completely unnoticed because they are wrapped up and hidden in a sweet  tearful tragic love story,sad
when i found this trailer months back i fell in love with it straight away i love how everything in the film fell in to place louisa is a funny and loving girl that just wants to have make people smile care about everyone will is your typical man love to travel and is bloody hot after will having a accident his mum decides to hire louisa after losing her job and had some bad times in other jobs after his accident will become very cold and angry at the world for making him how he is now but louisa comes along and changes him very slowly louisa finds some information out and wants to make will excited about life again and so then she plans lots of different trips and days out for him finally get out of his house the film goes on and this is when your tissue become handy the 2 fall in love and louisa doesnt know what to do because months back she found out that will promised his parents 6 months and then wanted to end his life to end the pain the film really shows that if you meet the right person time doesnt matter and sex really mean anything to a relationship if you love that person so much louisa thought by doing all the trips and days out she would change his mind but she didnt however he said he would go on one last trip and really have the time with her the last couple of weeksthe film goes on and gets even more emotional when louisa gets really upset on there last trip because will wont change his mind and after they land she leave straight away she finally take will decision and goes to see will at the clinic in switzerland and spends his last couple hours together with his parents the film ends with louisa in paris where will told her that this was his favourite place in the world with will over the top reading the letter he wrote for heri really do love this film and shows so much that i didnt know about how life is in will shoes and how people that have the same struggles live the actors were perfect for the film and played the characters so so well i would totally say to anyone to see this film but take your tissue because youll need them,sad
is a romantic drama film directed by thea sharrock based on the novel by jojo moyes with the same name the film stars emilia clarke sam claflin jenna coleman charles dance matthew lewis ben lloydhughes and janet mcteer the movie is about a girl named lou clark who is desperate for a job and so the goes on to take care of a recently paralyzed man from a rich family who she slowly creates a bond with this is a well made movie with amazing performances all around especially by the amazing emilia clarke who gives a wonderful performance on the leading role by her side is sam claflin who plays will traynor and he does a very good job too it is a movie filled with heart breaking emotional scenes very good cinematography and a brilliant score by craig armstrong that makes as a whole one of the best romances there are sure it has some problems and the ending will leave some people confused and angry but overall this movie works on so many levels that those flaws are hardly even noticeable as the good outweighs the bad by a lot,sad
i went for an unplanned movie in the cinemas yesterday and chose because the trailer looked good and i wanted to see emilia clarke star a whole different role at least once since everyone including me knows her from the game of thrones series on tv playing a real warchick its hard to imagine her playing something so delicate in the first 30 minutes of the movie i already saw this was going to be great emilia can show so many emotions in her face without even trying which makes it clear why they chose her the way she lived lou in the movie was just amazing real and definitely sincerethis is a mustsee movie not only today but tomorrow next year and in 10 years as wellrating  1010 for sure,sad
my wife and i were very impressed at the beginning of this movie and through the middle we grew a bit uncomfortable when the young girl finds out the fellow in the wheelchair has decided to kill himself through assisted suicide at the end of the movie we both felt very let down not only did she not succeed in changing his mind she actually becomes happy about it as if life is only lived for moments when you can really experience somethingsad sad commentary on life and very narrow minded first i know a couple people who have been injured and confined to wheelchair quadriplegic or otherwise they took the time to adjust and one has been that way for near 40 years and has a wonderful life he did not quit or give up on life just because his life before the accident was so tremendous or whatever it was the wimpy dude said in this movieif you want to make a movie about someone with redemption or about overcoming adversity then you had best not have the person quit at the end like a whiny crybaby and try to convince everyone out there that the world is better off without me because i hate my life now but loved it before thats a cop out totally and completely its not an ad for assisted suicide its just a dramatic interpretation of a dude who gave up and let everyone downwe gave it 810 for acting but the overall movie is a 2 since the premise and the interpretation are so wrong so it gets a total score of 410 compromise from us,sad
i thought it was beautifully produced and it was an excellent filmi cannot help but think that we all of us see things differently this is obvious when i read some of the reviewsi am really glad i watched the film and i found it uplifting and inspiringemilia clarke reminded me a little bit of a bridget jones type character and i will definitely look out for more things she is inthere were some notable other performances but emilia clarke really stood outi will be recommending this film to my friends,sad
i loved this filmive seen it twice in one dayits just amazingi still crying after 2 daysi cry even with the song photographi recommend this movie to everyonei learnt so much from this moviei absolutely loved itit has been my favourite movieemilia clarke and sam claflin were just amazingi believe it is a film which has very much to teachand another important thing is that it is very realisticthe end is just amazingi confess that i didnt wait this endbtw i dont think that i could see a similar movie againits just something rare and speciali loved every momentthere arent words to describe iti just love iti must say congratulations to the cast and firstly to jojo moyes for this excellent plot,sad
i saw this movie today and was not disappointed the acting especially from emilia clarke who played lou was brilliant i also thought sam claflin who played will traynor did a very good job i note that someone has commented that it wasnt as good as the book i disagree there were a couple of small parts that were left out but they certainly did not detract from the movie it has been a long time since i have seen a movie that i have loved as much as this one and would recommend it to anyone who wants to have a laugh but also be prepared to have a cry as well i also noted that from an ethical point of view someone gave it a one star rating i find that very unfair because the movie was excellent that is the persons view because of their religion,sad
i didnt know anything about this movie when i agreed to go and watch it with a group of 8 friends well what can i say amazing acting by all involved in a deeply thought provoking story line an absolute emotional rollercoaster the movie is done so well you can literally see it from all perspectives although we all had a massive cry in the dark every single one of us loved this movie i noticed for the first time in a long time a huge amount of people remained in their seats after the movie finished just regathering their thoughts and emotions thats how powerful this movie is if you hadnt read the book and didnt know what was coming as in my case then you really dont see the emotional bombshell coming and which direction this movie is going in not your usual predictable happily ever after story which in itself is brilliantly refreshing highly recommend however remember to take some tissues with you as i believe even the toughest of you will shed at least a tear or two,sad
is a romantic drama that paves a lightheartedness throughout a confronting profound context luisa emilia clarke is breathtakingly charming as caretaker for a recentlyparalyzed will sam claflin while the story has its predictabilitys it also surprises within them notable nuances by clarke and claflin shift this film from tolerable to pleasurablethe standout performance would go to clark with her vulnerability palpable due almost exclusively to her extensive engaging facial expressions and mannerismswhile some are calling this film controversial in regards to the underlaying topic of euthanasia i simply see it is as an account a version of a story of a characters mindset and their decision regarding their own lifein a society so quick to take offence while being so offensive  i conclude that it depends on your intent as a moviegoerif youre open to characters making their own decisions in a film im sure youll find that puts you firstby rocio belinda mendez5,sad
i was sadly disappointed with this movie i feel that there was an agenda to make killing ones self romantic or heroic clearly this movie is an attempt to making an emotional movie that softens and dumbies the general person watching the film whose feelings get in the way of hard realities of life and trying to find positive endings there was no positiveness end only a glorified death so instead of helping a disabled person see that they have so much to live for and see their value as a human person we instead see a depiction of a disabled man who would rather kill his self than live with what inner joy and dignity he possessed a film like this does not contribute to the beauty of all people regardless of their ailments i found it sad and over done with a manipulative story line the acting was good but not great the filming was very good definitely will not see this again no hero just a movie to isolate further those with disabilities i wish i could get my money back,sad
the twentysix yearold waitress of a cafe louisa lou clark emilia clarke is a charming woman that lives with her parents bernard brendan coyle and josie clark samantha spiro her sister katrina treena clark jenna coleman and her grandfather alan breck in a small town in the united kingdom lou supports the whole family since bernard is unemployed and treena is a student when she loses her job she applies to the position of caregiver of the wealthy banker will traynor sam claflin who was hit by a motorcycle two years ago and became tetraplegic wills mother camilla traynor janet mcteer supported by her husband stephen traynor charles dance hires the unexperienced but happy lou to take care of her son together with his nurse nathan stephen peacocke when lou meets will she finds a bitter cynical and depressed young man that had lost the will to live further she learns that the handsome will was a successful athlete and banker will she lift his spirit is an adorable dramatic romance in the directorial debut of director thea sharrock the central subject euthanasia is not discussed but it is easy to understand wills attitude based on his athletic and sexual performances before the accident the chemistry of emilia clarke and sam claflin and the beautiful locations in the united kingdom are enough to grant a wonderful entertainment my vote is eighttitle brazil como eu era antes de voc how i was before you,sad
i watched this movie the day after i finished reading the book and was heartbroken by how shallow the movie was obviously no movie will be able to contain all of the detail a book can but was lacking most of the gravitas that emanated from the books pages i have no idea how anyone who watched the movie without having read the book had any idea what was happening because it jumps from idea to idea without segues or explanations and i had to fill in most of the information from what i had read i love emilia clarke in game of thrones but goodness she was illfit for this role the lou of the book evolved from a quirky shy smalltown girl to a young lady who surprised herself by falling in love with her employer and working up the courage to try a myriad of new things with his encouragement and help the lou of the movie is trite and goofy since emilia seems completely unable to express any emotion except exhilaration i spent the majority of the movie cringing at the cheesiness of her acting especially when crying was involved the ending which was supposed to tug at our heartstrings and leave us emotional and sentimental was completely ruined by emilias performancenathans character and wills fathers character for me stole the show they were the only actors who really convinced me of anythingdo yourself a favor and read the book  skip the movie,sad
ive seen the intouchables and i feel that this movie is just a copy with a touch of love story and a dude with a poor mentality great acting crappy writing as some others in here has pointed out and the rest blah i kinda feel the same way as mentioned by others i mean he has so much more to fight for a great family great resources and a lot of money that i can basically do whatever he wants in life that said i feel it sends out a poor message to those in the same situation just with the lack of family resources and money that this guy have 310,sad
please tell me how i can remove from my mind the image of emilia clarke while playing this movie her face seems in each single frame a stop motion playdough effect her eyebrows move in an uncontrolled way and the result is so horrific damned but how in 2017 is possible to play in such a devastating totally notcredible way not even for one second i entered the illusion of reality thanks to the jokerlike smiles of emilia and it was really a torture for my mind to reach the closing titles and the plot can you imagine a more ordinary and trivial euthanasia tale no really its impossible everything is so easy plain slipping towards the more predictable of all the predictable ending pls while watching this movie dont use a single neuron its not necessary this is clearly just food for romantic teardrops sprinkling ladies but definitely cannot be defined a movie,sad
 warning spoilers below this is not a story about love its a story about selfishness the selfishness of the lead female character who treats badly her 7 year boyfriend for someone she only just met the selfishness of the disabled lead male character who despite having the love of his family and carers money and means to have a life chooses not to sacrificing the feelings of the girl he just met with a crass financial payoff at the end of the film the selfishness of the parent who thinks this is the only way forward the selfishness of the boyfriend who puts his fitness ahead of his relationship if this film was attempting to show selfishness and greed and above all that money is the most important motive to happiness then it succeededthis is not a story about emotion its a story full of stereotypes and shorthand signposts with predictable results we know the lead female is ditsy because she wears a different bizarre outfit in every scene despite having no money we have the grumpy lead male character she tries unsuccessfully to thaw the heart of we are made to feel ok about the way the boyfriend is treated because he buys her a not so great birthday present in fact the one scene with real emotion involved the boyfriend calling into question the whole moral of the film what little chemistry is there between the lead characters seems only made possible through money  expensive concerts and holidays if the disabled lead male was poor this may have been a better film but that would have involved trying harder so was avoided finally the incessant use of the lead females surname by the lead male when talking to her is annoying and an unnecessary attempt to be cutesy that doesnt work or its a clever signpost that to the lead male the lead female is ultimately still an employee of his rich family despite what the story is trying to make us believethe film is watchable and for that its awarded a 4 rating but know what not to expect,sad
one of the most romantic films i have seen for some time of course its a weepy and how i blubbed though i have previous in this regard but it also swells the heart and leaves you with a beautiful warm glow this should make real stars of the two main players with claffin excellent as someone whos life has been destroyed by an accident leaving him not just paralysed but also without the will to carry on but the true stand out is clarke whos unquenchable cheerfulness and sunny outlook on life in the face of his depressed hostility has to be seen to be believed and maybe starts to turn him around a lovely film with a beautiful ending,sad
i loved this film first of all the characters louisa clarke is just the best character ever seriously i dont think there can be a person who has watched this movie who doesnt like her she is just adorable she is sweet and funny with a cute but very quirky dress sense the relationship between her and will is so beautiful and inspiring this movie also introduced me to quadriplegia a condition i had never heard of before watching this movie it makes you think about some pretty deep ethical questions toothis movie was kind of like a much less cynical grown up version of the fault in our stars,sad
is a bit of a queer fish of a movie it never quite decides whether it wants to be a romantic weepy a drama or a rom com and as such ends up rather falling between all three stoolsemelia clarke game of thrones terminator genesys plays lou clark an invisible plain girl with potential who is trapped  due to unemploymentled poverty  living with her parents in a provincial castle town a picturesque pembroke though notably hardly a welsh accent in earshot her boyfriend patrick harry potters matthew lewis is a running nut that doesnt play to her romantic needs in any way circumstances lead her into the job of a carer for a quadriplegic will traynor sam claflin from the hunger games sequels who also happens to be the son of the local millionaire couple played by charles dance and janet mcteer they own the castle a large mansion and most of the surrounding countryside toowill  previously a sports jock  is paralyzed from the neck down after an accident and is a frustrated and suicidal mind in a useless body can the quirky and vivacious lou bring him out of his morbid shell and find him a life worth living againfrom this outline you might think the story almost writes itself and for most of the film it does but the writers have a number of twists and turns in store which  depending on your sentiments  might entertain or appallas her first leading actress role in a nonaction feature its a bit difficult to sum up emilia clarkes performance at face value it could be described as an advanced case of overacting with an extensive array of kooky looks and gurning facial expressions on the other hand she does it all with such vivacity and charm  and notably in a manner so in keeping with the character she portrays  that it is hard not to be enchanted by her i certainly wasclaflin plays the brooding and resentful traynor well and matthew lewis shows he is growing into a really professional jobbing actor as he enters his mid20salso radiant she always is sorry to break it to the wife like this but i am basically in love with her is the evergorgeous jenna coleman dr who victoria in what is to date a rare outing for her onto the big screen she previously has only had a small role in the first captain america film coleman and clarke make a very credible pair of sisters with the bed discussion scene being very touchingelsewhere a number of other wellknown faces crop up including brendan coyle downton abbey as lous father and joanna lumley as a wedding guest with a handy line in referencesthe soundtrack by craig love actually armstrong is top notch with pleasing songs from ed sheeran imagine dragons cloves and we the kingsthe production quality is as professional as you would expect from a britishmade movie although the mallorca and paris locations are not particularly well exploited since for a large chunk of these scenes i was convinced they hadnt left pinewoodso a bit of a mixed bag but enjoyable nonetheless a guilty pleasure if you like a romantic piece of escapism this is one for a wet sunday afternoon provided you have a box of tissues handy for the graphical version of this review or to comment on it please visit bobthemoviemancom thanks,sad
i have watched very little of the movies which were based on any romantic books like the fault in our stars but this movie is and will be one of the greatest and one of the best romantic movie i would have ever watchedi have watched emilia clarke playing the role of lou clark in some great movies and of course game of thrones it was good to see change in the type of role she played in this movie i and many audience has made an image of emilia clarke as a strong and bold character playing actress well according to me only as she had the recent movie of terminator genisys and the famous khaleesi mother of dragonssam claffin on the other hand did a tremendous job he did his homework very well according to me he painted the perfect portrait of will traynor as a person who was full of life and how his life suddenly changes because of the accident he also acted well as we can certainly see how a person gets cranky when something he had lost in his life which he cherished and loved,sad
i have read the book and i will be interested to talk to my friend who hasnt my only criticism is could you not have used one of our great kiwi actors  seriously you had to use an australian pretending to be a kiwi badly however the movie is lovely i dont think i have seen a theatre in masterton new zealand as full as the one tonight and every one of us was thrilled to see it they have kept the movie pretty much to the book which was great although i treat a movie as different from the book well done sam claflin i didnt see a single movement out of character that must have been a tough thing to do so an impressive effort i dont watch got so i had no preconceived ideas about emilia clarke and i thought she was greata difficult subject and one that we have had several notable kiwis go through well done jojo moyes,sad
first thing i should emphasize is  when you compare this film with walk to remember really not up to catch that caliberfilm fails to attach the viewer emotionally during the play time story is distant from the viewer hence there will be no solid connection built between the film and the viewer story line is almost predictable  but so as walk to remember but this story fails to add those tiny little spicy things to the story which will really really hurt the viewer at the end film ends but viewer will feel alright that hewill died but at any stage they did not want him to die director should create those small small moments which makes the viewer in tears when the character dies acting is not good its average from both loise and will as well it may have cost the luxury of a good chemistry between them as well,sad
for people who read the book please ignore the movie i definitely should have but i was too curious to the rest of you ignore it as well read the book first of all this is a beautiful film beautiful people beautiful scenery beautiful beautiful beautiful theres just one problem wills life isnt so effing beautiful neither is lous where jojo moyes uses humor to lighten up the dark of wills accident the movie tries to gloss over everything it made me sick lou is so cute but annoyingly so and i understand that will is supposed to be handsome but the characterdeveloping is flat compared to the book and the whole point of their acquaintance is lost a major point in the book is excluded completely its one of the things that makes sense to lous character jojo moyes books are quite realistic in a sense because of her characters flaws it makes you relate unfortunately this does not come across in the movie and there goes the humor as well i had to force myself to finish this one as it felt like the movie was strangling me with cotton candy,sad
featuring the strange proposition of the mother of dragons living a life where she cares for the tragically paralysed son of tywin lannister is 2016s attempt at becoming the big romantic hit as debut director thea sharrock adapts jojo moyes well liked book of the same name which is in turn a rejigged version of the 2011 hit the intouchables into a totally over the top and highly overdone romantic dramain whats her highest profile gig outside of the 6 seasons of playing game of thrones beloved dragon mother brit star emilia clarke goes next level of loving life as the seemingly carefree and unflappable stocking loving lou clark who takes up the job of becoming a friend to the hunger games sam claflins quadriplegic will traynor that will in turn see the two fall tragically in love as will contemplates ending his now unfortunately paralysed lifeits an intriguing idea if not totally original and theres potential here for many tears laughs and smiles but everything within sharroacks film feels either forced full of fakery or misjudged emotional manipulations as clarke in particular suffers from her role in the film that allows her to go completely wild with her unfortunately annoying and coy lou and it really does beg the question of how much of a career she may have outside of the got universe if she continues on in this fashionlou clark may just be last years most intolerable creation as while we all love someone that sees the brighter side of life this is something else entirely as clarke and her eyebrows over extended smile and genuine adhd tendencies trample the films chances as lou and wills relationship turns from forced friendship to genuine loveclarke needed to dial back her role especially as claflin gives his all as will even if youve never seen a quadriplegics body looked quite this toned before and while the film clearly connected with its readymade target audience as evidenced by its respectable worldwide box office and audience ratings its unlikely that many will be remembering the hard fought romance of lou clark and will traynor as wed remember the noah and allies or edward lewis and vivian wards of the movie universea refreshingly kind spirited movie that just never connects emotionally or engages thanks to a soso structure and a completely misguided female centrepiece will be a favourite to those that loved the movie before they even saw it but for the rest of us this sappy cringeworthy and forgettable romance just doesnt cut the romantic mustard2 fit neville longbottoms out of 5,sad
i always look for movies that have everything a romantic movie should have the romantic and chemistrybetween the cast the touch to the viewersmaking us feel we are with them the comedy to make us laugh and smile and the most important partthe big momentwhen we feel the love between them and we get all the smiles out of us with our hairs going up making us feel everything for them and wishing that this love is real that we could all once feel it with someone else the part where they show you its possible for everyone to find their special one the moment when you look at them and just say smile with hope hoping that they stay together foreverfrom all of this i am saying that this movie is one of the best romantic movies out there having everything in it and that watching will not disappointing,sad
this is a really sweet movie i already fell in love with lou clark in 30 min of this movie i havent watched games of throne not a big fan but i really loved emilia clarke in this movie she is the most beautiful girl with very original acting i love the way hollywood makes very original movies not like bollywood movie in which hero could have saved himself miraculously i loved the way writer kept it real in everything from showing emotions to showing anger trust me this movie gave me chills having someone who loves you this much is not more than a miracle today really a nice piece of movie keep it up emilia clarke we love you,sad
a question that often goes around is what is art and looking throughout history what was considered art it seems we are far away from the consensus on this question but most people would agree around a general notion that art is something that makes you feel that makes you think that sparks a fire inside you that transforms you and this movie in my humble opinion does all of that therefore deserving to be called a piece of art in the age of information overload where we usually forget what we had for lunch two days ago this movie will stay with you for a long time after you leave the cinema and thats the best recommendation i can give,sad
reasonably this film based on jojo moyess book and screenplay is indeed romantic drama more than romcom which is not to deny its comedic elements but all should know that there is a powerful demanding current capturing this film which draws in part on the case of disabled british rugby player daniel james and the question of his parents being charged for accompanying him to switzerlands dignitas clinic in the end they were not in the full cinema i was in there really were few dry eyes in the house ill concede that mine stayed dry not always the case though i still find the piece affecting and thoughtprovoking and unquestionably worth seeing2 big questions concerned emilia clarkes chances of getting beyond and above danaerys and sam claflins ability to portray someone who combines neartotal physical disability with marked vulnerability to infection  the double whammy that convinces our hero that his life really and truly and literally is not worth livingto my mind both questions can be answered affirmativelyclaflins character will traynor is goodlooking rich and still influential he has a commanding personality if mostly initially grumpy and arrogant a sharp mind and a capacity to develop clarkes character louisa  clark yes really that begs a lot of questions not sidestepped about the contribution he can still make not least because he has support moral and financial from loving and welltodo parents  nicely done by janet mcteer and charles dance and of course not least because he makes lou clark love him even though she at first has a relationshp with patrick played by matthew lewis which is not getting very far but is genuine affectionate and definitely physical if also sustained by clarks decency and supportive nature patrick is by no means a failure hes been entrepreneur of the year hes a bit dull but not stupid or unkind and of course hes a triathlontype athlete yet he cant quite offer lou what traynor can a huge and demanding thought in itselfand emilia clarke does indeed offer a convincing and oftentouching portrayal of that growing love as mirrored in her characters personal development in terms of interests and style and maturity  though emphatically not basic kindness decency humility and optimism with life given that this is manifest from the outset and never waversthis is actually then a demanding role so much emphasis is placed on clarks eccentric dress sense that one might start to write her off as a bit oafish but that does not pan out clark is over loyal to her family helping out financially and so taking jobs below her potential but she does what she does with conviction and optimism puts all her heart and soul into each of her jobs and she does know who she is hence her metamorphosis in the film adds new dimensions but not at the expense of the old onesemilia clarke is great at all this and she proves well able to portray inner beauty increasingly augmented by outward beauty in the more conventional sense and when clark looks at  and touches  her nearly immobile charge an audiencemember not made of stone is going to feel the power of the affection and also the restraint associated with the inevitable nonphysicality and asymmetry of the bondat at least one point in the film a comparison with stephen hawking is made and this is not an idle one there are also references to my left foot and that films reallife irish hero christy brown hawking steadily lost abilities yet espoused technology to fight back and contribute he wanted to understand the universe and he has lived longer than anyone else ever with his disease christy brown taught himself to do great and wonderful things with the limb he could still control hence the title of the story at first glance traynor has fewer aces than brown whose story in fact ended unhappily with his death aged 49 in 1981 though more than hawking whose amazing story continues yet traynor wants out and is committed to that idea with a devotedness that even clarks love cannot shiftin spite of the chocolatebox pretty pembrokeshire buckinghamshire and mediterranean locations this is not forgettable moviecandy one does indeed return to the subject and the person i saw it with came back at me a while after with the suggestion that traynor and clark could have married had a kid not necessarily even adopted and been worthwhile and useful and good parents making a contribution to the next generation all the more so given further years of support from his parents and also her family portrayed sympathetically enough by the familiar brendan coyle samantha spiro and jenna coleman and while that would have involved sacrifice and risk given traynors endless susceptibility to disease that would presumably have done for him soon enough it would have left a legacytheres really no answer to that given that traynor chooses to eschew such options and  as the film emphasises again and again  thats his sovereign decision in regard to his life one gets the feeling that clarks mother would not accept that choice but the other characters come round to the idea  with great reluctance but neverthelessthis is then a modern and radical film in a pretty and often traditional setting but  as the above nuanced references in it make clear  it is not judge and jury at least not 100 that role therefore falls to us and this is as always a precious thing a better film can offer its audience,sad
so at first i thought it was going to be another pretty predictable movie and i was only watching it because i love emilia clarke but i was actually pleasantly surprised the movie was not predictable at all and really was special for a lot of reasons also the acting performances were very good emilia clarke did a great job at playing an adorable clumsy sweet girl and sam claflin too did a great performance as a disabled young man the movie did really hit me right in the feels cause it could really take you away and the actors had a great chemistry on screen the music was good but not the best soundtrack ive heard and would personally have made a completely original soundtrack for a movie like this,sad
it would be hard to hold back the tears once moves along the emotionallycharged course of its unevenly laidout entirety imbued with charismatic flair and some ravishing sentiments the emilia clarke and sam clafflin starrer is every hopeless romantic dream it is bound to recreate the familiar heaven and earth trope with all its utter predictabilities and tiring cheesy clichs but here the tears are mostly rightfully earnedclarkes lou emerges as the brightest asset of this manipulative drama her buoyant demeanor creates an affectionate atmosphere for this whole fairytaleish attempt whose often leaning towards emotional tragedy is ever screaming at every turn of the proceedings her sprightly charm makes an indispensible compensation for the largely stale performance pulled by clafflin who plays here a quadriplegic near reallife prince who enlisted the service of clarkes caregiver character but together they conjure magic enough to sprinkle their often predictable storyline with heartcrippling charmthe biggest flaw of this film perhaps is how it seemed written to manipulate that is not to say it isnt effective because in fact it often works but you would still think and wonder how more beautiful it would have become had it been written with pure authenticity be that as it may youve got to give it to those at its helm for molding an extremely poignant drama that even if its often undermined by its easily recognizable motives isnt devoid of wit humor and charm and jawdropping glamor from two of the most beautiful faces to ever star in such romantic tragedy,sad
i hate how people are treating it isnt glorifying medical assisted suicide and it has nothing to do with god it is about a man who even though he found love it wasnt enough to fill the void and depression he constantly felt is he selfish for doing it yes but at the same time he saw the potential louisa had to go out and do something with her life and he didnt want to hold her back because he knew that she would contently sit in a room with him for the rest of his and her life his decision to end his life has to do with the fact that he had control over the situation since the traumatic event took away most of his ability to make his own decisionsit is fun to watch them fall in love and it is heartbreaking to watch him make his decision but it isnt about to medical aspect of things it is about the fact that he is able to make this decision his on,sad
rating  out of 5   this film is not recommended   in brief there are disabilities aplenty in this sappy screen  adaptation mostly in its politically correct thinking  grade c  synopsis a beautiful caretaker falls in love with her handsome  quadriplegic patient   jims review there have been much talk and many catchy phrases about  the subject of love that have been set to music love will find a way  love hurts love makes the world go round love will keep us together  love the one youre with true love never runs smooth these pop  ditties are never heard in the insufferable tearjerker of a movie  entitled still they do form the basis for the  relationship of two mismatched beautiful people who become soulmates  amid loves many obstacles   the story goes like this recently unemployed louisa emilia clarke  becomes a nursemaid and companion to handsome but clinical depressed  will trayor sam clafin once a rugged sportsman and successful  executive the whole package and now a disheartened quadriplegic will  has no will to live but louisa or lou as she is lovingly called is  little miss sunshine personified a kooky supposedly adorable waif and  perhaps the perfect antidote to wills bouts of suicide at least  wills rich parents hope that lou will be the cureall to lift wills  spirits and change his mind and mood swings it didnt change mine  with an abysmal screenplay by jojo moyes and based on her bestselling  novel which i fortunately did not read but am told the book tackles  more serious themes the film shies away from any semblance of reality  and settles smack dab in the soapiest of waters i guess every  generation needs its own love story but is it too much to ask for some  darker moments to help us relate to wills physical condition one only  hears of but never sees wills pain and suffering  yet will isnt the only one suffering here any moviegoer in their  right mind would want to pull the plug on this claptrap truthfully  the whole ethical issue of patients rights and euthanasia deserves a  fair better and more honest treatment that was done in a film called  the sessions view that excellent film instead dear readers  but this is suppose to be a love story the equivalent to a pulpy  romance paperback novel and on its own terms and genre the movie  fails miserably mostly due to insipid directorial debut by thea  sharrock who searches out for the tritest of images and succeeds in  making the bad even worse laughably outrageous exotic costumes by  jill taylor and the hammiest performance by one of the leads   try as he must mr caiflin does bring some poignancy to his poorly  written character how he was able to keep a straight face throughout  this film and watch ms clarke overdo her acting in the most ridiculous  of outfits and hair styles would be challenging enough for any actor  the actress is not helped by her director or costumers she is seen in  the most garish of garb from fuzzy colorful sweaters and busy ugly  prints in outfits any fashionable 13 year old would instantly reject  her hair styles range from braids and pigtails to frau brucher germanic  updos which telegraph more emotion than the actress can muster we  are suppose to be enamored by lous quirkiness but the overall effect  is an offputting goofiness who could blame will for ending his  lifesuicide would be anyones choice after experiencing ms clarkes  cutesy performance  if nothing else there is fine supporting work by charles dance janet  mcteer and brendan coyle all distinguished british actors who would  be wise to omit this film from their resume also stephen peacocke  resembling a young hugh grant literally does some heavy lifting and  delivers a nicely nuanced performance as wills fulltime doctor  nathan one of the few subtlest contributions found in this film by  the way in retrospect everyone is so inexplicably darn goodlooking  in this movie  with all that is said and done here writer h l menckens ultimate  quote of the subject of love may succinctly sum up everything that is  wrong with this silly film love is a triumph of imagination over  intelligence has neither of those valued commodities,sad
a girl in a small town forms an unlikely bond with a recentlyparalyzed man shes taking care of its easy to be cold and cynical these days but we should never lose sight of the simple cathartic pleasure of a good cry at the movies at first i didnt want to review this novel  nor the movie  because i knew i would want to reread it which might seem perverse if you know that for most of the last hundred pages i was dissolved in tears based on the bestselling 2012 novel by jojo moyes who also penned the screenplay this story will feel familiar to anyone who sniffed through love story or the fault in our stars surprisingly its better than both is a love story a family story and above all its a story of the bravery and sustained the effort needed to redirect the path of a life once its been pushed off course this is also a story that is eloquent not so much in its delivery as in its humanity the set up is the same as many of classic and nonclassic romance a poor but cheerful young girl meets a rich grumpy gentleman and begins working for him but what makes different and quite interesting in principle is that will traynor is physically broken as well as emotionallyyoull forgive the movies clichs because of its surprisingly winning performances as the film goes on and the frost between both protagonists melts both actors give their stock roles unexpected emotional layers on a basic level it is engaging watching lou enter this new world for which she is entirely unprepared game of thrones emilia clarke stars as louisa shes like love actuallyera keira knightley crossed with a hello kitty doll clarkes sincerity doesnt just win wills heart it wins ours too will traynor since hes played by sam claflin whose finnick odair was one of the best things in the hunger games series isnt just killer handsome or impossibly good looking even if his condition has left him bitterly depressed and cuttingly sarcastic in a wheelchair the actor is good as will working well with the physical demands of the role and even bringing a gentle flirtatiousness to his character as he develops his relationship with lou in fact his grin with its slight touch of a smirk  creates an unmistakable echo of a young hugh grant sam claflin makes will a broken man with a powerful life inside him plus wills character makes me think of mr rochester in charlotte bronts jane eyre with his rudeness and temper while louisa is so jane eyre one of the invisible lou has never lived will has but no longer can you dont have to be nicholas sparks to know where this is heading  that these two opposites will end up attracting and that love at least for a while will prove stronger than death lou is not heroic and her male counterpart may be nobodys idea of a leading man or prince charming and yet with both of them jojo moyes created an affair i will always rememberis a heartbreaker in the best sense employing emotional truth to bring the reader to tears and yet unlike other novels tears are not gratuitous some situations the author forces the reader to recognize really are worth crying over furthermore people can take an awful lot of sadness if you can be funny about it jojo moyes is a literary stylist just a storyteller and a really good one she manages to draw on the skills she owned as a journalist to create a clear candid picture of the practicalities of wills situation while the novelists mind casts an illuminating light on her characters reactions moyes makes them coming together extremely tender both sweet and real but theres a deadline one that haunts their love story haunts the novel the author is masterful in not shying from the complexities or shading the agony of choosing between life and death its achingly hard to read at moments and yet such a joyscreenwriters choose to lose the maze scene when lou recalls a sexual assault when she was younger often when you read about rape in fiction its the defining event of a story and cutting it from the movie i think was a good thing because the scene is very opaque in the book and putting it on film would have given it far more weight than it has in the book plus it would have eventually change the mood of the story however the birthday dinner scene at louisas home hits a particularly high note offering the most poignant moment both in the book and the movie  its soul really  as well as a pitchperfect hilarious one finally my favorite part of both the film and the book is when will and lou go out on a date to a concert she wears a dress of sexiest scarlet and as they are in the car ready to go home he confesses in a very hugh gratian manner i dont want to go in yet i just want to be a man whos been to a concert with a girl in a red dress i know a good british romcom reference when i see oneoverall doesnt try to reinvent the genre weve all seen some version of this movie before but that doesnt make it any less effective it knows what it is and embraces it tell me something good will says to louisa at two transformative junctures of the book this story at its heart is about two people who properly listen to each other it is something good now if youll excuse me i have something in my eye its allergies i swear,sad
is the best movie of 2016 im not kidding ive waited so long for this movie after the trailer was out and im glad to say that it was way high up my expectations ive watched this movie 2 times in the cinema first time with my friend second time with my family and they all loved it not a single dry eye out from the cinema i swear its so touching funny and all in all it was awesome and the best movie ive seen in 2016 no best movie in terms of romance touchingness after the fault in our stars seriously this movie reached the deepest place in my heartthe cast the sceneries and also the storyline just blew my mind there are beyond words on how great the performance of sam and emilia was really if you havent watched it i strongly recommend you bring your love ones and also a box of tissues to the cinema and watch it it wont disappoint i swear,sad
from the very beginning grab my attention and engaged me in its well presented drama it is amazing how emilia clark is able to be light funny and very real at the same time her acting is superb in every way she goes into the seriousness of the story convincing us with her authentic performance my youngest daughter michelle was born without her left arm she has 30 below the elbow missing from birth my experience with her change the way i saw individuals with disabilities for ever movies with individuals with disabilities touch me very deeply caught me by surprise because i went to see a comedy and the impact of the depth of the story push me to the moments when i was dealing with my daughter darker moments which were a few if you are sensitive to the pain and suffering of others go see this movie it is entertaining and it gives you the opportunity to see two young actors reach a level in their careers which place them in a category with great performers,sad
okay let me start with the positives this firm is well acted and is on one level a reasonable weepy romance however the relationship between the leading couple seems unrealistically intense because the actors are not given sufficient screen time or dialogue to develop it that said my biggest problem with this movie is its messageat this point i should briefly explain that i was born disabled and i am unable to walk i will remain this way for the rest of my life i cope with this in one very simple way i focus on what i can do and not what i cant what i have got not what i have am without so i found the fact that the leading man in this film decided to take his own life due to a paralysing accident hard to accept he had so much to live for a supportive family a great house that had been adapted to suit his needs a specially adapted vehicle and loads of money however this was clearly not enough as he is still really unhappy and has a massive chip on his shoulder as he waits counting the days until he can end his own life then this gorgeous kind lovely young lady comes into his life they fall in love she practically begs him not to go through with it but to no avail this is such a negative message which is offensive to people living happy lives with disabilities it also serves to reinforce negative stereotypes surrounding disabilities i wanted to see the ending in which she made him realise his life was worth living now that would have been living boldly,sad
amazing movie from start to end the movie was absolutely awesome emilias style was adorable and those heels were stunning the chemistry between the two main actors is absolutely dreamy sam claflin is so beautiful and emilia is a great girl the movies nonsexual attributes make it even more deserving to watch i mean one can watch this movie with family members and even children the movie did justice to our culture and traditions too the praying part before the meal on emilias birthday was beautiful it has become really hard to find wholesome movies to watch with loved ones nowadays we truly need more movies like this one great job and i truly hope more movies like this are going to be released soon,sad
the first thing i had in mind after watched this movie is that money can buy love im not sure this one is made by hollywood or not cos if its made by hollywood then i need questioning them how they can make this creepy movie like this the story line was just so standard it just remind me of soap opera from south america the actors and actress just have bad performance the dialogue was so standard no words that show the feeling of loss hope or joy the only thing that good was just the soundtrack it so wasting my time i really dont understand how so many say thats a great movie if i would have known it would end the way it did i would never of watched it,sad
stars emilia clarke and sam claflin and its the story of a woman emilia clarke and her story of how she falls in love with a man that cannot move either his legs and his arms emilia clarke is amazing as her character she completely became her character i cannot think of another actress that will portray her character well daisy ridley can because emilia clarkes performance did remained me of her sam claflin was serviceable he can easily be replaced the story is really what drives this movie to the top the relationship between lou and will is great you really believe that they are in love the music is used appropriately only one time it annoyed me but it was once and it did not take me out of the film the cinematography was great as well as the production design the biggest problem i have with this film its is 3 act it is really cheesy and makes the clich that one person gets mad with one another and you know theyre gonna get back together and its just lazy writing its not awful but it aint good either also since emilia clarke is so fantastic as her character its really distracting when she is not in a scene and you kind off get lost in the story other than that i found that was a great film about love relationships and letting go beautiful visuals and an unique script made this film the best love story of 2016 so far 810,sad

i saw this film without any premise of what the book was about however i did watch it with someone who had read the book and was able to compare and contrast the two mediums though the scenic locations and setting for the movie is iconic this movie was so unbearable to watch based on the relationships alonefirstly the whole movie pays so little attention to exactly how bad lous boyfriend is that any sane person would take his side therefore the entire film is about cheating halftruths and seduction rather than romance lous shallow character archetype of the quirky girl in bright tights serves only to reinforce the idea that she is naive and selfish after being in a relationship for 6 years with her bf  who at this point trusts lous support in his fitness dreams  lou suddenly drops it all for a hidden love affair with a broken heart throb the birthday scene alone was so unbelievable that she would pay so much attention to this mysterious man rather than her boyfriend across the table that it left me wandering how come no one warned her about what she was doing oh yes her sister talked to her about itbut suggested arranging lap dances for her patient instead doesnt her sister know she is already attached to her boyfriend patrick what lousy advice thereno more than 20 minutes into the movie every romantic scene turned into a scene of betrayal and hidden intentions the book may have gone into more detail regarding exactly how much of a douche lous boyfriend patrick really was but this movie glazed over it so superficially that i ended up feeling sorry for the poor guy he did not even lose his temper or have a big dramatic scene his character was just swept under the rug for the conclusion of the movie to happenhorrible movie unless you are a romantic sap who condones betraying those who care about you or you are easily impressed with emilia clarkes goto scrunched up sad face and dancing eyebrows,sad
this is the first review that i write because people needs to be seriously warned of how bad this movie is i decided to see it based on the good scores and reviews it had here plus hearing someone saying that it wasnt the typical hollywood chick flick let me tell you that is not only the typical chick flick is just a compilation of corny fake clichs the script is awful the actors are terrible and emily clarks acting its the most obnoxious thing i have seen in years on the screen her acting skills are moving her eyebrows with this annoying stupid face which is a mix between i want to cry and i want to go to the toilet if you want to spend your money in entertainment seriously dont do this i even left before the end cause i couldnt stand so much crap together i really dont understand how so many say thats a great movie,sad
i read the book twice four months before the movie was release loved it highly recommend it i went to see the movie with the highest expectations and let me tell you i wasnt disappointed to say the least right from the start just from seeing the title of the movie on the screen i began crying with excitement loved every bloody minute of it this movie will make you laugh cry lose your self in the room and most of all pray for a goddamn sequel movie there is a following book named after you highly recommend it i cried like someone god forbid died or something trust me some will say its a classic chick flick but i say screw it is the best romantic movie ever to exist the actors were wonderful the screenplay was the same exact lines from the book which i loved for the fact that it kept its authenticity and the choice of background music made it even better definitely will watch it again in a dark room with a box of tissues,sad
is a simple yet beautiful film emilia clarke captures the heartclarke has taken on various roles without a blemish she is an excellent actress sam claflin is believable in this role as well a quality soundtrack accompanies the film many dislike the ending but not me as the film is about lou and it allows her to move on with fondness and opportunity ahead they always go overboard when it comes to the current boyfriend being a complete jerk i didnt see an accident or a mistake i saw carelessness in regards to wills circumstance,sad
when my mother clicked on this movie on our tv i was more than unwelcome oh great another sappy love story but as soon as i started watching it i was hooked it gave me another idea of love clark made me laugh and traynor made me agree and nod in reason this quirky heartbreaking movie is something special,sad
i thought it was beautifully produced i am really glad i watched the film and i found it uplifting and inspiring this is absolutely amazing movie if you interested in romantic sad love story then this movie is definitely for you the story of the louisa clark who unfortunately lost her job and will who devastatingly paralysed after a motorcycle accident when louisa enters his life as his new care she brings a new light to his life and the movie covers how their relationship develops this movie seems that our life became changed when we met right person and you will understand how we love each other i understand we must say love you and thank you for the all time if we did not tell them one day we regret it the acting especially from emilia clarke who played lou was brilliant there were a couple of small parts that were left out but they certainly did not detract from the movie a lovely film with a sad ending now i am reading this movies book,sad
this movie is a copy  remake of french movie the intouchables released in 2011 which was also remade in tamil language asthozha in march 2016 correct me if i am wrong i will remove my comment  reviewthe tamil movie had nagarjuna the telugu super star in the lead role as a rich disabled man kathik the leading hero from tamil as being a convict of petty cases in the province of tamil nadu being a care giver by chance he falls in love with the lady who is managing the affairs of the billionaire then the story spins around how the rich finds his email companion and the care giver finds his love realised and blessed by the rich this movie resembles the same let me k ow whether my statement is true,sad
a fairly good story by jojo moyes gets deepsixed by awful awful music cuts and transitions infesting scene shift after scene in what couldve been a good albeit maudlin script of fault lies mostly with editors and director thea sharrock for completely overindulging singing music cuts sorry sharrock in editing with film when it comes to music and audio less is more kumbaya might be ok for campfires but not for stories of paraplegics or cinema mtv is its own category theres a time and a place for it but not in supposedly serious subject matter clarke and claflin are not at fault and do a good job in this movie too bad directors and editors cannot fathom or recognize their own tacky and poor soundtrack editing 510 cannot recommend,sad
i have to say this is one of the best films i have seen in a long time ignore the critics and see this film i cannot express how good it is and how heartwarming the story is i have seen some heartbreaking films in my time like beaches for instance but this film from the beginning to the end was truly pulling at the heartstrings top notch performances from everyone this film is definitely a must see if you want a sunday afternoon tear jerker look no further than this film i would give it more than 10 if i could sam claflin was by far fantastic in this film along with emilia clarke the soundtrack goes great i dont want to say anything about the film or spoilers but see for yourself how amazing this film is you will agree it is really a top notch film for 2016,sad
louisa clark is played by emilia clark of game of thorns as a funny and fun loving free spirited who lost her waitress job and has to find the money fast as her father is unemployed and encouraging sister going back to schoolplus stuck with an controlling boyfriend very health conscious named patrick but her life and the man she is suppose to take care of named will trainor played by hunger games sam clafin who used to live an active athletic lifenow is paralyzed over a road accident and is bitter and angry at the vegetation state he is in at first working for him and his rich family get off to a very tough startbut she manages to win him and his parents over with her positive attitude as he slowly yet surely begins to open up as both fall in love they have to face lots of hurdles and something that will wants that neither his parents nor louisa does not want for him really a love story and a tear jerker go see it,sad
in the south of britain near wales a young businessman will sam claflin has just kissed his girlfriend goodbye on a rainy morning he tries to hail a taxi but unhappily he is struck by a motorcycle meanwhile louisa clark emilia clarke has been a waitress in a nearby caf for six years where she proved to be a friendly asset unexpectedly she is given a pink slip and a months wages at home the clarks hear this news with dismay for papa clark has been laid off and lous salary has been supporting them all undaunted the fetching zanydressed young gal goes to the job center for new leads theres one promising one it seems a mother camilla janet mcteer is searching for a nurses aide to help her paralyzed son yes its will from the movies beginning who is now confined to a wheelchair with little motion below his neck wills family the trainers are the richest folk in the area and live in a modified castle in short order louisa gets the position for she is chatty and gregarious despite her lack of nursing experience but wait will greets his new caretaker with undisguised rudeness asking her to not talk to him and stay out of his way as much as possible a roving nurse nathan though tells louisa he is delighted she is there and assures her that will is rude because his situation is so bleak in time things change will does become more communicative and is cheered by lous weird clothes and infectious manner when his former girlfriend comes to break the news that she is engaged to a man who was once ws best friend louisa is there to help will from falling to pieces in fact lou and the nurse decide to put forth a list of outings which will hopefully change his view toward life this involves going to the horse races and a symphony concert indeed will does seem cheerier but oh no lou overhears will state he agreed to give himself six months of living for his mothers sake at which end he hopes to go a euthanasia clinic in switzerland can this really be when lou has started to love will and he seems to being feeling the same way about her this sweet sorrowful movie will have its viewers in waterfalls of tears yes there are moments of humor and fun but the tale is always a story of a wheelchair bound man formerly very active who struggles to accept his new reality the cast is great with claflin clarke mcteer charles dance and all of the others doing fine work mr claflin who also appeared in love rosie will hopefully not be confined to roles in love stories although his handsome face is swoon worthy then the setting is superb a lovely glimpse at a little known part of britain louisas costumes are sublimely ridiculous amid a well clad cast and the script from a novel by jojo moyes is carefully poignantly written finally the direction is somewhat slow at times but hits all the right marks for its presentation as stated above some viewers will not like the films stance on euthanasia as it strongly supports personal choice therefore listen to this caution however most viewers especially fans of romantic drama will welcome the opportunity for a sweet sad cry,sad
spoiler in the end he kills himself under the pretense of dying with dignity we apparently have no other reason to live but for ourselves we are told there is no god so what other purpose do we have in life other than to serve ourselves this movie is pathetic in its attempt to justify and make light of the fact that he is committing suicide the world has gone mad she falls in love with him but he has his mind set to kill himself his parents who claim to love him are going to aid him in his suicide he thinks of nothing but himself it truly disgusted me to watch i wish i would have read more about the movie before i watched if i would have known it would end the way it did i would never of watched it what a waste of my time skip it,sad
i loved itone of best movies ive ever seenjust the last part was sad,sad
lovely movie i cried so much this movie is one of the best the actors were amazing and makes you feel sad because of the ending i loved it,sad
love you both of you specially emilia clarke your smile is  it isnt explain in word my english is not too good but i try to say something this movie,sad
the kind of movie i dindnt liked at firt but after that i started to think why will would do that and when you try to put yourself at his situation you kind get it and i think most man will understand him better than woman,sad
impeccably done what a heart wrenching storyline the film is beyond beautiful and the aura that it creates is beyond feelings admired every scene the reality of it was eye opening and the imagery was absolutely stunning overall is a rich and powerful movie featuring incredible performances,sad
i think it was the best romance that ive ever seen ,sad
this movie is such a heartache cried so much that i could rate this movie more than 10 im just torn on wills decision thought love can heal him movie was so great but i still wish they end up happy together its a relief to know that clark mightve given him new rays in his life to go and continue living,sad
most beautiful love story i love this movie because this films idea so interesting i cant stop watching this movie so exciting too watch again and again one thing everyone should one is no matter how you looks no matter you have nothing or not just if i love you no matter what ill choose you till i die love it,sad
thoroughly love the film and i consider it a must watch for any romantic probably not a good one to netflix and chill with the film is an emotional rollercoaster so buckle up,sad
is a pretty good take on the romance film its not a romantic comedy by any stretch but more of a sort of drama that has something to say and whichever way you feel about the issues presented here even the main characters share conflicting and ambiguous views about them you will certainly enjoy thiswhat makes it good is that its not too cheesy like so many other films of its kind admittedly it feels a little cheesy toward the start but it never crosses the line there are some good laughs and you may even cry too the acting is great as is the script and the directing i feel like the roles were perfectly cast its hard to imagine another group of actors would do as good of a job recommend,sad
a ten plus film and acting work no question emilia clarke is an outstanding actress and a wonderful star all the actors direction script and production details are exquisite,sad
i havent read the book yet but i knew i had to see it i cried a lot at the end this movie has to be one of favorites,sad
i am sorry to say this but either emilia clarke is not a good actress or the director sucks at directing her performance was a little too exaggerated and almost comical i dont think this was meant to be a comedy but maybe it was possibly so at least lou and patrick seemed like they were supposed to be funnythe storyline was okay but not believablemaybe its better to read the book it could well be that they edited out too much information but i wasnt convinced that will absolutely had to make that awful decisioni did love lous fashion  it kind of reminded me of amlie  colorful and corky i also loved to see tywin from game of thrones and lovely mr bates from downton abbey hence one extra star,sad
this movie was initially promising im cramping its a cold winter evening and raining outside i want a feel good movie so i find this and the trailer is quite promising the scenery and landscape just beautiful the main characters outfits colourful i would actually wear all that she was great her attitude her personality and positive outlook on everything her smile is just stunning i actually didnt mind the crazy eyebrows lol i think shes a beautiful girl and she portayed the character in excellent fashion not much comment on the other actors she certainly stood out to me the most because her personality was as colourful as her outfits it was great to see her bring will out of his funkloved the location too like i said great scenery the castle was just amazing especially aerial views of it the whole small townvillage feel made me almost want to live there as well despite it seeming constantly cold it was greathowever although it was great to see will transition from a miserable meh excuse my lack of better terminology it was irritating to have him keep referring back to his old life everything was better when i had full use of my limbs and i was in paris seated at a cafe and all the ladies paid attention to me and only me now i cant do that and other rich boy activities with my snobby friends who marry my ex girlfriend so life cant go on how dare he then allow this poor young lady to fall in love and make her see in him someone she wants to be with she was willing to change her life for him and then the nerve of him to tell her to find someone better you are the someone better duh and you feel the same way about me if you claim you are the happiest youve been in a while since meeting me why then must you live me in perpetual anguish of losing someone that didnt have to die but chose to die anyways because his circumstances changed its clear his parents would do anything to ensure his happiness and he would have been able to live a full life despite being a paraplegic sure theres difficulties and thats understandable i couldnt imagine having my life change like that nevertheless it doesnt mean that it becomes impossible to live clearly in all the acivities he did with her it was possible to live just in an adapted way but noooooo homeboy was too caught up in his james bond pasti was very infuriated at the end of it absolutely infuriated and will be forever infuriated a different ending would have easily given his movie excellent reviews from me,sad
let me start by saying this movie was good enough that it made me want to read the book i dont think this movie would have been good if it didnt have the lovely sam claflin his character saved the movie for me relatable and loveable he is an excellent actor and played his role equally well the overall british theme of the movie was brilliant i loved it i like emilia clarke but the character she portrays wasnt my favourite just my opinionlouisa clark seemed joyful kind extroverted optimistic and william was the opposite he was sarcastic dark and pessimistic opposites attract but i am a person very like will and i would not fall for somebody like lou again thats just me i love the couple a few lines in this movie really made me laugh for examplelou i dont like superiority will you must hate me thenthe movie was enjoyable and kept me watching it however it was definitely predictable i think everybody who has watched these kind of movies before can agree with me i knew what the ending was going to be before i watched it i definitely preferred the second half of the movie than the first the comedic aspect quickly dropped it was heartwarming and very sweet it shows love is worth fighting for but some people cannot or dont want to be saved i liked that some people are so sure of what they want that nothing can change their minds a nice movie,sad
is a film full of emotion through this film thea sharrock shows us that life does not always go as we want but it must be lived fully make the most of the fact that will still decides to end his life despite all louisas efforts to restore a taste for life shows that even love can not change the way we see things because deep down he knew that nothing would change but because he loved her he changed louisas life so that she could live it as she pleased love takes many forms and even paralyzed or dead we can continue to bring happiness to those we love so yes i really loved this movie,sad
its impossible not to love this movie it is a love story although very different from what we usually see im sure ill be crying for a month thats how good emilia and sam are not only it warms your heart but it makes you think about free will and unconditional love an amazing love story  specially for the ones how dont usually choose romantic movies,sad
a beautiful and unforgettable love story great acting great chemistry between the lead actors i love this movie one movie you just cant watch once you want to relieve the experience over and over again as sad as it is cant watch it without the tissues there is one other love story very similar to this that i found as beautiful which was dying young julia roberts and campbell scott this is definitely a must see,sad
i knew emilia clarke from game of thrones doing like serious acting but when i saw her she was like most adorable thingif you love feel good movies then you will really love this one because it makes you feel happy by seeing them together and it makes you cry by not ending up with each othera great movie to watch and just see what love is ,sad
basically i didnt like to watch romantic movie but when i listened to the soundtrack of this movie i got an view that this movie kinda looks not that bad or different from the other romantic movie yeah its right and the end of the movie is leaving me a shocked like not what i thought in my head he committed suicide  and its the first movie that made me cry for the romance genre,sad
firstly i read the book an amazing book which made me feel lots of things happiness love and mostly sadness secondly i watched the movie marvellous movie with superb actors i cried when they were crying i laughed when they were laughing everyone should watch it just for understanding how much someone can love a person,sad
not to sound cliche but the book is so much better than the movie ive read the book twice years apart and i loved the emotion that it brought out in me both times the first time reading it i hated will traynor at the end because i thought he was some selfish prick who was accustomed to getting his way and couldnt see the beauty amongst the ugly the second time reading it i empathized with will traynor and realized i was being the selfish onethe book makes you confront the right to die decision from the perspective of many characters and you feel for each one i cried laughed felt anger and many other emotions in my opinion thats a sign of a great booktoo bad the movie didnt bring out the same emotions the storyline was flat the characters boring with the actress playing louisa clark being downright annoying it was as if she was forcing herself to be lou clark trust me the louisa clark in the book isnt so cheesy sam claflin and emilia clarke also had no onscreen chemistry so you never get to feel the depths of how their relationship developsthe movie also leaves out details from the book that are important for both the characters and story and adds scenes that are completely unnecessaryin the book louisa clarks family isnt so cheery about their financial woes which is one reason why we see louisa clark not stray far from home so she can financially help her family another reason being the maze incident a scene the movie left out to wrap it up if you want to really get the meaning of the book and a more in depth feel of the characters skip the movie and read the book,sad
based on the great female author book jojo moyes has impacted millions of viewers worldwide directed by thea sharrock as her forth work after call the midwife one can call the movie a pinch of moyess book there are numerous fascinating facts about this movie that we can point to such as the professional author performing cast and decoration and costume design and etc however it let down many readers as they expected a masterpiece there were numerous deletions in the movie which can lead to misunderstandings and wrong judgements for instance while one is reading the book she is constantly bothered by the way patrick treats lou many book sections are removed which was dedicated to the pat and lous relationship which let the reader sympathize with lou and give her the full right to break up however in the movie lou just breaks up with pat to be with will that was absolutely not fair plus georgina wills sister is removed with traces not only the deletion is irritating but also the whole picture of a depressed quadriplegic rich kid falling in love with a poor lively girl is a teenage drama the question is what if will was poor did the whole thing happened at all now that will has decided to end his life does lou help any other person with this condition just for the sake of it the hero and the heroine of the both film and the book lacked glorifying characteristics despite the director and authors attempts to show them unique although lou and will were no supposed to be the role model of the world they could broaden their horizons apart from their own small self the traces of moyes emotional style of writing can be vividly observed in the movie specially the way awesome ellie clarke appears as lou and handsome sam claflin as will while book is unable to present its readers with live images movie makes it a piece of cake the use of colors in the movie transmits the full sense of emotion which is provoked while reading the book lous house is full of emotions life and color while the traynors house is just a cold building which is later brighten up by lou the great costumes also represent lou only through vision however no one can deny the fact that an author in comparison to a director has more time to elaborate on the story and break the limits and this justifies the claim that a film is weaker than a book despite the fact that technology is making it easy day by day to produce noble films,sad
the weepy stars sam clafin an actor so photogenic had movies not been invented before his birth they surely would have developed once he hit puberty just so he had some way of sharing how handsome he is thewestchestarian wonders how he didnt get the 50 shades of grey lead ahead of deadontheinside jamie dornan sam also brings a delightful englishness to the role overshadowing the campbell scott original dying young despite her london upbringing emilia clarke please consider that final e when pronouncing her surname americans doesnt bring that same underlying seriousness and gravitas that english actors contribute the two work well together although you can see clafin dictating the relationship and clarke reacting to him more than acting the story they act in is a bit what you would expect wills life basically went from the top of human experience to some area below average although he remains very wealthy and can afford every accommodation a quadriplegic could ask for he deals with justifiable anger and suicidal thoughts which lou holds eases but ultimately doesnt relieve any interesting aspect of the story is the personal growth lou undergoes through her association with will and perhaps to a greater degree his upper crust wealthy family the movie doesnt shy away from the obvious class differences in english society in short you largely know where the story is headed and much of the direction is aimed at jerking forth tears but it is worth the ride,sad
this film shook me quite a bit and i might be a chick but usually im not one for chick flicks they can be good to pass the time at their worst theyre flat out offensive using serious themes to pretend theyre more than they really are like the misery of the third world  see beyond borders or cancer see the fault in our stars so when i hear of a chick flick dealing with war or death or sickness thats what i fear flat mindless characters that are there just to fall in love in spite of everything because you know love conquers all but for one for all you could say about emilia clarke shes never flat shes lovely shes a topnotch actress and i cant imagine anyone who would give this role this much warmth and steadiness people like lou  grownup children with both childlike innocence and more wisdom than the rest of us  are a rare breed but they do exist and she captured this perfectly her eyebrows are a gift from god she was the first good thing about i still wouldnt remember much of it if it wasnt for the second one  the ending ive read a couple of reviews for this film and people seem to get the live boldly slogan as its message they miss the fact that its also a movie that debates assisted suicide and actually argues in favor of it as a person who has gone through a debilitating illness i appreciate the fact that it doesnt maintain that any life is worth living or something along those lines this is something that only people who dont know the first thing about being sick can state  and that i see mainstream cinema argue much too often i still dont think its a good movie i give it a 6 because most of it is calculated just to repeat the success of the fault in our stars and such but there was something visceral in it that cracked through the hollywood facade and that cracked me in turn because i didnt expect it there watch it somehow its worth it,sad
2016 when i read plot line ofi was surprised to find it exactly similar to the french classic intouchables which was remade in telugu as oopirionly in the other way aroundthe only difference is they have given a female lead in the caretaker role and as usually love blossoms between them even with such physical differencesbut the only reason i watched this movie is for my princess khaleesi aka daenerys targaryen aka her off screen real name emilia clarkeplot louisa clark emilia clark is a small town girl who knows a lot about the people around her will sam claflin a quadriplegic man who hates everyone around him louisa is hired by wills mum to take care of him for six months although they have a rocky start their relationship grows over time going for hate to like to lovewhat i felt with exactly the same plot and almost same type of scenes like intouchables mostly works on emilia clarkes charming performanceother than thatthis movie has very few feel good moments but mostly the screenplay is totally predictablethese movies would only work if it has lot of feel good moments which can bring tears but this movie has none literallythe dinner ate clarks home and the scene where clark and will dances and the scene where they watch a movie are the scenes which are the highlight of the movieas said earlieremilia clarks charming screen presence helped the movie a lotbut her expressions with eyebrows are weirdit felt like she can even move her eyebrows downwards to oso apart from that she really is charming and i never even imagined khaleesi being cute like thissam claflinwhom i have seen earlier in loverosie is very good in his role of a quadriplegic manmusic also helped the movie in lot of scenesbut the major surprise in this film is its daring climaxmost of them would not accept this ending including me to an extentbut as a fiction we cannot blame the directorwriterbut he could have tried other options because this may affect lot of such disabled persons ideologysoworks mostly because of emilia clarks charming screen presence and few moments but its climax is shockingmy rating 6510,sad
ive heard so much glorification of this movie that i was eager to watch it as soon as possible and enjoy its magnificence but then disappointment on many levels to be clear this movie is not a crap but its just slightly different from high budget south american soap opera with hollywood productionacting is satisfying scenery and landscapes are sometimes breathtaking and production is on the level that would be all i can commendstory this movie doesnt have o of originality and it is predictable from opening scene to ending credits theres no single surprise or twist everything in it has been already seen and thoroughly verified hollywood clichs are carefully wrapped in decorative paperwill is successful businessman from wealthy family who ends up in wheelchair after traffic accident on that fateful day he would go to work on motorbike but his wealthy and beautiful blonde stops him same second he gave up on his motorbike i was sure what will happen next while he was crossing the street on his foot he was hit by you wont believe this motorbike of course in this type of story the one in wheelchair is usually male and rich and he hires someone poor to care for him at the beginning he is cold and grumpy but in time he starts to show his warmer side am i the only one who saw the intouchables  slight touch of beauty and the beast maybe  though here we have poor girl that gave up on higher education to take care of her family instead of black petty criminal she irresistibly reminds me of ugly bettywills relationship with his blonde falls apart after the accident and she marries his best friend his new caretaker is seven years in relationship with egocentric sportsman until time with will opens her eyes and she realizes she is not happy so she falls in love with will author is trying to catch us on cheap patheticcharacterization is lousy we see twodimensional characters who are not well developed not even close how did will win her love  what is that she falls for  fact that he is good looking and rich  i doubt author had intention to send that message but except for his looks and money we see no other positive sides of will she gets money from his parents and organizes luxury dates and travels in attempt to awake desire to live in will or maybe she provides herself a chance to experience things she could only dream about before she got access to his money i understand what author wanted to present but also i can not stop myself from seeing whats obvious i did not make up any of this i just point out the obviousthey go out they travel exotic destinations they fall in love will has good time with his new girl she loves him unconditionally he is offered to get back to his job his family provides full support and he is rich but thats not worth living and he decides he should kill himself yes he planned this way before he met her but not even love of his life can change his decision what message does it send to us that people with disabilities are useless dead burden to their surroundings that they have nothing to give professionally or emotionally that good job supporting family and true love are not worth living for  somehow stephen hawking pops up in my mindsure no one can stops you from killing yourself but having health institution to help you  if you are in continuous unbearable pain and your life comes down just to pure survival in endless agony then maybebut lets ignore moral dilemmas and stay in limits of this movie if you already decided to kill yourself and nothing not even true love can make you change your mind why the hell did you mislead innocent girl give her false hope and broke her long term relationship just to make her sucker at the end and leaver her emotionally destroyed that seem selfish and cruel to meat wedding on the dance floor he openly admitted that before his accident he would never noticed girl like her let alone fell in love with her and after accident his life is so worthless that even their true love is not worth living somewhere i saw that perfectly put in one sentence i cannot live and love you because i refuse to live and love as any other man than the man i was however if i were the man i was i would not have loved you but she does not mindand so on they fall in love the time has come to go she gives up her believing and needs and escorts him on last voyage movie ends with epilogue he is dead and he left her with fat bank account and she did not even had to get married and a letter that sends her to paris his favorite place on earth with detailed instruction where to go and what to look for ps i love you anyone dont get me wrong movie is more than watchable after reading my review you would probably think that 610 is too high but if you avoid to analyze just grab your popcorn and sit comfortably in your sofa to watch the screen with half a brain you will enjoy two hours of stereotyped hollywood romance drama and maybe it will even make you laugh or cry once or twice,sad
 major spoilers  i thought the acting was great i adore emilia clarke and sam claflin my objection is it seemed to me to be promoting the assisted suicide movement i am strongly opposed to that way of thinking people have the right to make movies about it i just didnt agree with iti was hoping for an uplifting message of true lasting love overcoming all of lifes possible challenges this had the potential to be full of inspiration i loved the relationships with family and other characters and how their lives unfoldedi hope to never have to be a part of anything remotely near to wills situation i am vehemently against taking ones own life god brought us into this world and we must rely and depend on him in all situations to the very end if will had faith in his heart the outcome would have been different and he and louisa could have led a live filled with love,sad
i initially went to see this in order to kill time on a rainy sunday afternoon and also because even the worlds oldest comic book fanboy can get overloaded on superhero movies but to my surprise i actually found myself liking thisfor starters it has a male lead whos actually a complete unknown to me sam claflin as will trainor a 21st century aristocrat with an mba who becomes quadriplegically paralyzed in a traffic accident his gradual transition from selfpitying fatalist to relatively cheerful charlie over a period of six months is due mostly to louisa clarklou as shes known to family and friends is played by emilia clarke picture the looks of a prewitchblade yancey butler with the emotional range of moira kelly from the cutting edge and the lovely accent of rachel weisz from chain reaction and the first two mummy flicks but with the fashion sense of reese witherspoons character during the first ninety minutes of legally blonde its this arsenal of qualities that brings will out of his morbid funk even if only temporarily i refuse to spoil the rest for you suffice it to say any guy wishing to impress his girlfriend with how sensitive he is will succeed beyond all expectation if you take her to see this film fair warning though if you make the mistake of not bringing a whole box of kleenex then youd better bring at least two of those otherwise useless boutique cubes of them because youll definitely need them,sad
i completely disappointed by the movie i am really crazy about these types of movies with a heartbreaking love story but as a fan of romantic movies the message of this movie is so negative there are two bad messages in the movie first the movie is saying to people with real disability that its better to die than to struggle in life problems and their disability there are many examples of successful people such as stephen hawking and paralympic winners even with a worse disability which proved the world that disability is not a limitation for them i cant believe how they showed that a disabled person with a great love and very good social situation killed himself second another bad message is that money can buy love they fall in love when they used lots of money and i think it is not reasonable as a pure loveon the other hand as a positive point i can mention that the movie is well acted specially emilia clarke and her facial expressions were excellent and amazing,sad
was made to appeal to the lowest common denominator in spite of myself though i was moved by and i enjoyed this film is a romance between a perky poor not spectacularly beautiful girl and a rich suicidal modelhandsome quadriplegic you may have begun gagging already i understand and believe me everything that you fear may be wrong with such a film is wrong with this film it talks down to its audience its play with dangerous ideas is a child playing with matches and yet i cried i think two things save in spite of all thats wrong with it sam claflin plays the part of will traynor the rich handsome suicidal quadriplegic claflin is young ripped and handsome enough to be in a toothpaste commercial he is really good i believed everything he did i was right there with him i felt his pain and desperation janet mcteer a multipleawardwinning actress is the soul of the film she plays wills mother she is given very little to do but she pops in and out regularly there is an infinite sadness and terror in her eyes im a former nurses aide and im very familiar with dealing with family members of afflicted people janet mcteer is superb she shows the exact strength vulnerability and hoping againsthope of the loved ones of the wounded and doomeds plot doesnt do anything you wouldnt expect it to if you go to the movies to be surprised or intrigued stop right now but you already knew that when you saw the movie poster of the perky girl sitting on the lap of the very handsome man in a wheelchair as they gaze lovingly into each others eyes takes place in the england that exists only in the imagination of fans of masterpiece theater jane austen adaptations and merchant ivory films this is very much not the england of sadiq khan and brexit or even of royal family scandals there are very rich people who also have good taste there are poor people who are warm simpleminded and humble not at all resentful or bitter about their place sort of like hobbits there is sweeping green countryside defined by rambling stone walls and trout streams there is a big fat castle  yes really  overlooking everything weather its either blue skies burgeoning lilacs and hydrangeas or gently drifting snow outlining the castle battlements or perfectly formed autumn leaves thomas kinkade is the meteorologist louisa lou clark is a cutie pie poor girl emilia clarke who plays louisa telegraphs how adorable lou is in every scene she is constantly dimpling her cheeks and wriggling her eyebrows as if they were migrating caterpillars looking for a leaf to pupate on look if you wanted to smack emilia clarke during every scene of could you please send me a facebook friend request does the word subtlety appear in emilia clarkes dictionary or teamwork in every scene she demands attention actors should never work with babies animals or emilia clarke lou is supposed to be really poor lou never wears the same item of clothing twice her clothes are unique designer finds her shoes alone would go for a few hundred bucks oh but shes this noble poor girl yeah right the filmmakers here keyed their film to teenage girls who love clothes more than life itself and who have short attention spans my utterly subjective estimate no scene in the film lasts for more than ninety seconds you think theres going to be a serious discussion or even three consecutive lines of dialogue about the issues at play here can afflicted people live worthwhile lives is suicide ethical will this film encourage the handicapped to off themselves but that never happens its safe to guess that wills quadriplegia is to the filmmakers merely a plot device tweener girls find guys attractive but are anxious about real physical intimacy and all it entails also tweener girls dont want to be obliterated by masculinity they want to exist in a world where they are the center and tweener girls are anxious that they arent pretty enough thus gives tweener girls a very handsome ripped hero who couldnt engage in physical intimacy even if he wanted to and he is so needy and so isolated that the tweener girls cuteness and spunkiness and fashion choices become the center of his world and she doesnt have to be beautiful to be the center of the universe to this handsome guy who if he were not a quadriplegic would be the hottest date in town yes it is all pretty awful right down to lous boyfriend who is an endurance athlete obsessed with his physical performance but insensitive to lous emotional needs  he is meant to contrast with the lovable quadriplegic one man can run but cant feel one man can feel but cant walk oh good grief and yet i cried while watching this film in spite of everything claflins and mcteers performances opened my heart,sad
i first saw the trailer and knew i really wanted to see the film but kept putting it off as i was worried the trailer had shown all the best bits and the movie would be disappointingbut was i wrong the movie was funny in some parts serious in others as well as sad in other parts emilia clarke is hilarious in this movie and i absolutely love the characters dress sense in which will traynor likes to mock sam claflin plays the part amazingly which reduces you to tears by the end of the movie clarke and claflins onscreen relationship is one of the best things about the movie in some parts it makes you laugh others cry and a lot of the time you have a smile on your face when theyre together the movie overall was so much better than i thought i and cannot wait for the release on bluray i will definitely be buying it i dont understand all the negative reviews this film was absolutely brilliant it was so good that when i heard there was a book i instantly bought the ebook and ive started reading it do not listen to the negative reviews and do not hesitate to see this movie go and watch it while its still in the cinemas or if youre reading this after the dvd release go purchase the film and give it a watch you wont regret it,sad
when taking a beloved book from page to screen its tough to recreate the magic on screen well the movie version of is the perfect adaptation of jojo moyes book emilia clarke and sam claflin simply are lou clark and will traynoris going to be your new favorite romantic movie the movie will make your laugh cry and smile from start to finish thanks to jojo moyes lovely book and emilia clarke and sam claflins stellar performancesis the film adaptation of jojo moyes 2012 novel lou clark emilia becomes a caregiver for will traynor sam will was once action man who sought out adventure each and every day however he was paralyzed from the chest down after a shocking motorcycle accidentlous job is essentially just to cheer him up lou is bright and shiny while will is brooding and dark despite a rough start wills hardness begins to fade away with lous help together lou and will discover new adventures and experience life in a way they never thought possiblelou falls hard for will and she believes she can make will happy will who will never accept his new limitations thinks hes keeping lou from living her best life but thats not how lou sees itim just telling you now the ending of will make you uglycry lou and wills starcrossed love story will break your heart in half i didnt think it was possible to love lou and will more but emilia and sam did it when emilia smiles you smile when she cries you cryemilia and sam gave their heart and soul to the roles of lou and will emilias lou is nothing like daenerys targaryen and the role shows a new side of emilias incredible acting skills sam embraces wills physical constraints and adds even more layers than were present in jojos booktheir chemistry is electric and its bound by something more than just sexual tension because of their marvelous performances emilia and sam elevate the emotional complexities of their characters even more on screen works on every single level even if you havent read the book youll inevitably fall in love with this movie and you should its that good,sad
emilia clarke is awful in this not real acting herewho else agrees with me on this her eyebrows are crazy and so are her facial expressions very amateur fakeish acting couldnt even watch the movie tried watching it right after i read the book tried watching it again on the plane today just could not finish it there is also no real chemistry or good portrayal of some sort of chemistry between them all the other actors are okay ishnot too interesting she cannot play innocent and docile much better as the mother of dragons in got,sad
i get that the movie was supposed to portray something real and remind us that these things do happen referring to the ending but lets face it  the guy was a selfish prick he had commodities others in similar situations would never have or would have to struggle to get not to mention he was surrounded by people who loved him and yet all he could focus on was himself and this vision of him as this grand failure because hes in a wheelchair sent out a pretty bad message in my opinion he didnt even bother to try a little bit more for his life you tell me hes in a vegetative state or in this incredible agonizing pain 247 okay i dont like to judge a persons reason for choosing such an option but i think people need to be reminded its not the solution this film seemed like it was condoning suicide it makes you think he made the right decision in choosing himself and that he had that right to not be sad anymore,sad
before commenting on this movie i would like to comment on imdb anyone noticed how the majority of the reviews in the first pages are written like paid professionals praising all the aspects of the movie it almost look like you have to start reading from the ending page of reviews to get a real review i will be very curious to see if this review will even see the light of day and if not then i will never trust or even come to imdb for movie reviewsas for the movie i had great expectations after seeing the trailer but was such a disappointment first there is no love story in this movie the whole movie is about a rich paraplegic man who is so immersed in self pity about loosing his tremendous past life that is incapable of any emotions for the people around him ok and a girl who gets attached to him but settles for some money reward for her broken heart the movie is predictable pathetic has no real drama or message the actors have potential but are not believable due to the lack of a true love story in the script what a missed opportunity i could close my eyes and imagine how this movie could have been written to be one of the best a real dramatic struggle between love and physical pain rich and poor life and death,sad
to be honest i went into this film expecting a wannabe version of the notebook that would frustrate me with cheesy and cringeworthy characters and romance and at least for the first half hour thats exactly what i got however the great thing about is that it gets a hell of a lot better with every scene ending up as a very enjoyable if not generic romantic dramahowever before i get into the best parts of this film im going to start with the first act roughly half an hour wrought with problems that i expected to continue on through the whole movie first off this film is a textbook example of a bad first impression in the form of louisa played by emilia clarke with the benefit of hindsight and her character arc i can see that clarkes performance at the beginning wasnt her own bad acting but rather a symptom of simply poor writing and directingas the film begins louisa is presented as a nice but pretty clumsy and dim young woman who lucks into a job caring for the rich will traynor however despite all the smiles and brightlycoloured outfits her ridiculous luck in the first act meant that she just wasnt a particularly lovable character for me leaving me continually frustrated for the best part of half an hourthat combined with all the inevitably cheesy and insanely generic chick flick tropes meant that i had no hope going into the second act of the film however as the story develops we get some great character development for both the leads and thanks to emilia clarke and sam claflins excellent chemistry the film becomes very charming pleasant and simply enjoyableim not going to ignore the fact that the story follows an very formulaic route from start to finish but what i really enjoyed about the film was watching louisa and wills relationship develop simply because the two lead actors worked so well together and gave very convincing performances that especially in the case of emilia clarke got less and less cringeworthy as the film moved alongput simply i eventually came round to really enjoy despite an awful start the films pleasant and positive atmosphere combined with clarke and claflins fantastic chemistry had me smiling and enjoying myself by the end its by no means the emotional rollercoaster of a love story it aims to be but as a simply enjoyable and pleasant watch does the job pretty well,sad
omg i was so excited to watch this film i have loved the books and the louisa clark i was so disappointed by this film by how quickly it moves and how bloody awful emilia clarke is i love her in game of thrones who doesnt but she is so wrong in this part if you read the 3rd book the character is so different and only 2 years older ,sad
the story is exceptionally moving and made me empathize will and lou very much after watching a film one question has torture me how is it living full life and then all of a sudden become enabled all your life is separated into two parts  before and after how do the relatives and friends feel when they see that person suffers every single day its awful and scary really really scaryundoubtedly the movie is mawkish though there exists a clear line between soppy drama and sweet girlish melodrama of course there are lots of ridiculous moments and stupid dialogues strange behavior but everything is so harmonious that you may forgive all the flaws sam claflin was brilliant he coped with role easily the actor managed to convey all the difficulties faced by the paralyzed people both moral and physical emilia clarke was too eccentric i realize that it was so according to the script in order to show her the immediacy and ease however as for me she looks far too sweetin general the movie turned out bright and pleasant i think i will reconsider this story more than once and get a maximum of emotion the same i had in the dark cinema hall,sad
well sure it is a sweet loving and touching story but i was totally surprised by clarkes performance i found her giving a lot of effort to be a sweetinnocentnaive little girlwoman during the film she never stops smiling sometimes it gets really awkward her relationship with that other guy is far away from any other 7year old relationship according to her choices and generally how she deals with itclaflin is wandering from scene to scene and i truly found it difficult to feel his situation he is also  oh yeah  smiling inexcusably throughout this film and i overall thing that this movie came to an end with a really immature way in a point that the film really underestimated any viewers sense of logicjust give it a try on a sunday evening but in my opinion its inevitable for you to attach yourselves with these characters feel any sympathy or a feeling for cry just a blunt mediocre film pity for clarke i was expecting far more from her,sad
judging by the trailer for you already know the kind of ride youre in for its a tearjerker about a quirky girl who takes up a job looking after a cynical paraplegic its not long before they fall in love with one another despite their differences and it either ends happily ever after or in tragedyi wont reveal which of these endings are true however i must say that despite the predictability of this film there are certain themes in the movie that i wasnt expecting to delve into without exposing too much the issue of euthanasia crops up and whilst its a polarising topic i think the film deals with it in a very fair and twosided way both sides of the coin are justified and its a very complex theme that doesnt have a simple answerthe acting is effortless and real between the two main characters lou clark is played by gots mother of dragons emilia clarke and sam claflin plays will traynor who you might recognise from the hunger games franchise and love rosie the film is actually based on a new york times bestseller by jojo moyes who also wrote the screenplay im a big fan of novelists writing their own screenplay adaptations as i believe that no one knows their own story and vision like the person who wrote the original textthis isnt a film that you can expect big things from but it tells a sweet story thats funny sad and inspiring in some ways too with many a lesson to be learnedmotherofpopcornwordpresscom,sad
warning the film deals with heavy themes that may contrast with your religious or personal views or be personal triggers such as suicide assisted suicide emotional and physical disabilities and the inability of coping with said disabilities its bound to rankle feathersthe film is charming quirky and depressing its definitely a film to watch with the girls the beau was only mildly interested like many romances follows the basic formula but hits the right notes to sucker punch you in the feels rich boy meets quirkynormal girl girl attempts to fix boy they fall in love but theres a twist girl cant fix the crippling pain and massive amounts of selfloathing boy experiencesverdict glass of wine tissues and a girls night in kind of movie nothing more,sad
i enjoyed much more than i had anticipated i was originally interested upon its trailer release and i mean it is easy to sell me when you attach an ed sheeran song to the trailer but that is besides the point but now that i have actually seen the film i am more satisfied in the result of my viewing than expected and also very interested in reading the book series to start sam and emilia were excellent i see a very strong transition from tv to film through emilia clarke especially going from playing a role like daenerys from game of thrones and even the strong personality role of sarah connor in terminator genisys to the sort of ditsy sarcastic soft and kind role of lou clark her character had me honestly laughing in multiple scenes as she had hilariously awkward interactions with some other characters on top of her constant sarcasm sam claflin was nothing short of hilarious as well his equally sarcastic character of will traynor was frequently sparking laughs among the crowd as well as his relentless strong personality that transitioned from his ablebodied self to his handicapped self on a different note the chemistry between the two worked very well nothing ever felt forced in my opinion everything was smooth and easygoing it was very entertaining to follow and the story as whole was something elegant yet heart rending all the same for a romanticdrama i enjoyed this film very much so i recommend this for all audiences as it is much more than the typical romantic feelgood movie,sad
im in a book club where this book was very well receivedi didnt expect much from the movie but was totally engrossed emilia clarke was perfect in the role she didnt over act and was terrific as the 26 year old somewhat klutzy caregiver of the quadriplegic young mani was never bored for a momentas only the brits can doit was totally realistic the screenplay acting music cinematography all contributed to a beautiful movieit never descended into being too schmaltzy i thought the casting was right on  although it dealt with very serious issues still i found myself laughing in many scenes especially at clarkes antics every character in this movie played their role to the tee no under or over acting for a lovely movie experience this summerwhich deals with current issues  will provoke discussiondo yourself a favour and go see youll be glad you did,sad
im guilty again of not reading the book of which this film is based on written by jojo moyes so i cant compare or discuss irregularities or about the comparison of the adaptation but i can say jojo did write the screenplay so we can be rest assured its how the source author should have wanted it on the big screentheres not much about director thea sharrock apart from a couple of tv series and this being her first main feature she does a great job really capturing the moment and atmosphere of a very british backdrop the picturesque pembroke castle in wales being very much the central locationsam claflin famed for playing hunger games flamboyant charismatic finnick plays the larger thanlife suave business man will traynor who after a brief motorcycle accident unfortunately becomes a quadriplegic confided to his parents mansion in the welsh countryside faced with a completely different way of life we see the frustrations and the bitterness that takes hold of himin walks in lou clark a colourful cheerful and sweet local lady played by emilia clarke whos down on her luck and becomes unemployed looking for her next vocation with little else out there she reluctantly accepts employment from wills parents played by janet mcteer and fellow game of thrones star charles dance as carer for will whose sole duty is to cheerup the depressed and angry mister traynorshes met with hostility in the form of blunt sarcasm and general unwantedness but slowly and surely a relationship forms between the two and its only her perseverance and pretty positivity that managed to eventually break down wills stubbornness and get him out the househarry potters neville longbottom matthew lewis has come a long way and does good playing clarks current fitness freak boyfriend and henchhugh grant lookalike stephen peacocke is great support as wills manual handler and i suppose friendcraig armstrong does a good score as he usually does love actually world trade center far from the madding crowd but its the soundtrack that is quite outstanding with a mellow remix of x ambassadors unsteady and tracks from cloves ed sheeran and jack garrettits a great britromcom with all the same ingredients sitting next to hits like love actually and about time but it isnt the tearjerker i was expecting though hearing a lot of sniffles in the audience it didnt quite hit me as hard theres some great scenes its superbly structured and well paced its touching but not quite the emotional trainwreck i thought it was going to be even with the controversial ending which seems to gloss over the debate im not faulting the film because its probably most likely menow the big controversial debate as this film has caused quite a stir within certain groups and i can understand why but its not about a people nor does it represent a peoplebut be about a relationship betweentwo people and nothing else and i think it boldly tackles real life issues without damning or belittling anyones life disabled or not regardless of circumstance we all face lifes hurdles with different approaches and attitudes and to reflect badly on this is to assume all people never face such thoughts of suicidewhich with currentstatistics i find very hard to believe and euthanasia would not even be a word im not saying if it is right or wrong just acknowledging the fact it does exist and is real and is a thought that haunts many people regardless of circumstancerunning time9 the cast9 performance9 direction9 story7 script7 creativity8 soundtrack9 job description5 the extra bonus point 10 emilia clarke is simply amazing beautiful and funny shes such a joy to watch on scene her smile and glossy eyes just gleam wonderment and excitement ive said too much82 810,sad
this was advertised as an emotional chick flick drama sucks to find out its just a letdown that glorifies euthanasia how twisted,sad
great movie in my opinion it didnt lack anything and was very funny in some places i think the actors did amazing as well i definitely felt the chemistry between them if you want to watch something real and heart warming watch it you wont be disappointed and you will most likely cry a bit,sad
i would i like to tell that the movie goes in a very good manner at the end of the movie i felt like this is a romantic advertisement for dignitas i dont feel a motivation was given to the guy to live his life facing challenges i understand that guy couldnt do anything but it doesnt mean he has to die okay anyhow thats how the movie goes advertisement of dignitas,sad
my daughter is the most beautiful girl in the world the best second choice is miss emilia clarke same agewhat a wonderful girl is shewhat an excellent and charming actress is sheyou may say english movie and it says it alla thousand thanks to all the participants of this film for the extreme pleasance and enjoyment you offered to meand i swear ill not miss a film of miss magic emilia clarkegod proves his presence in many strange ways,sad
i loved the book and have read all in the series the movie does not disappoint this is definitely a chick flick my husband would hate it and if thats your thing youll love it great performances beautiful scenery,sad
a very beautiful love story without needing to cringeloved it,sad
it is hard to appreciate a narrative that can only skim the surface but then again emilia and sams chemistry makes you buy into their cozy world,sad
its a mixture of the intouchable and many love stories which produced before noting new,sad
the thing about this film is that it makes you wonder about the title who is me and who is you a very nice plot and wonderful cast,sad
loved it right up until the endingthe performances were good there were heartwarming moments and funny momentsbut will be allowed to end it all just cos he couldnt go back to his fabulous old lifestyle was indeed a terrible message and unexpected to be honesti really thought lou had changed his mind,sad
i knew nothing about this story until i saw the movie obviously did not read the book i loved it all the actors were great the chemistry between claflin and clarke was undeniable and made the moviehonestly i dont understand the criticism of those who said it was saying that disabled peoples lives are worthless really it was completely the opposite everyone wanted will to live but he didnt want to the movie really made me think about how i would feel in the same situation i totally understand how will feels i cant imagine living like that but at the same time im not sure i would want to die either the point is this is wills decision what will he decide how will the others react to his decision can they change his mind or can they live with it if he doesntwhat really irks me is the whole politically correct aspect of folks these days what a movie isnt allowed to show a disabled person who doesnt want to live all movies showing severely disabled people must show them happy at the end with their predicament this isnt a commentary on what makes a life worthwhile this is a movie about one particular man who cant imagine living like that its not meant to tell the world that if you are disabled you should kill yourself pleasethe movie is lifeaffirming but we dont get to choose for someone else they get to choose for themselves,sad
still to this day i wish he would have changed his mind she couldve kept her happy but then we understand his point for missing things he used to do and who he was there was a hole in his heart and didnt wanted to live with the burden,sad
really think you should read it before you watch think the book and film complement each other really well dont think id of loved it so much if id not read it first they dont have time in film to do full backstory of everyone it would end up longer than lotr but think id of felt it rushed if not had the knoledge together though gorgeous 3,sad
we loved this movie i loved the characters they had chemistry i hate to be sad and this movie was full of emotion but it was fantastic,sad
i love a story that doesnt pretend to be a documentary that says what it has to say in a straightforward manner but with considerations of the heart leading with every step the scenarios and outcomes it depicts are realistic  not that they would play out in the same way in ordinary life where the details of daily life are far more pressing than they can ever be in fiction i am often turned off many recent movies as they are trying to depict real situations in convincing ways which really only relate to the screenwriters manner of being convinced or else movies are so far into the liberty of fiction you end up in animated specialeffect nonsense land whether it be the acting the script or the sheer visualslove conquers death this is a movie of hope the hope is not a laundered hope and that contrasts wonderfully with this well laundered filmi would have given it 10 stars but there was a little punch or something missing to it ill probably find it in the next viewing,sad
sorry for my bad englishi think its a nice movie personally i didnt expect much and while watching it i didnt thought they are promoting any kind of wrong message about disability maybe because ive seen wills character as a person and not as a disable man for me there are two diffrent personalities trappted in situations they dont want to and somehow they help each other to free themself on one hand we have will a guy who was always strong confident rich and handsome and because of these characteristics he refuses to accept his accident by taking this decission he was able to have the control of his own life and get back his dignite on the other hand we have lou a nice sweet and dreamy but timid girl who never refuses anything who stays in a relasionship knowing that they have nothing in common who always helps even if she has to set her dreams asidethrough their connection she gave him the love and care that he might never had so he left in peace and complete and he pushed her as she is health and able to chase her dreams and put herself firstthe movie is more about the feelings of the persons the way they want to see themselvesshe dresses in crazy outfits he cares more about his image to the world the dreams they have he had many but hes unable now she had few but she is scared and how they accept whatever life bringsto tell the truth if the end was different it would have been very obvious so love and money cant always bring the happiness the way we expect it,sad
sam is excellent in his acting what a nice romance movie,sad
so im a sucker for reading the books first and although this is comes so so close it doesnt hit it all the way but i gave it an 8 because i love sam and i love emiliaand their chemistry is so bittersweet,sad
the whole plot of the movie got some sense so i cant say its a bar movie but the of patrik was really upsetting if i was patrik i would have done the same if you love someone you make expectations from them so im sorry about him,sad
to me a huge glaring flaw in the movie concerned the main characters wardrobeshe specifically stated that she needed the money for the jobher father was not a rich manyet in every scene she wore a totally different outfither fashionable outfits and boots and even her 200 umbrella didnt fitwhere did she get 50000 for all those clothes and accessoriesi really dont like movies that have this big of a disconnectits really an insult to the viewer,sad
its disappointing to watch this movie rush towards the end it failed to capture the essence of novel the energy and the situational seriousness louisas character is made more of a joke she is shown only as a laughing and smiling idiot which is not the case in the novel the acting is forced and it looks as if someone has made a summarised recap of complete package screenplay is the only part that justifies itself other then that everything is just rushed to the finishing line its not actors but the director who ruined the moviei am not sure if jojo actually was happy to see this kinda potrayal of her beautiful writtendrafted novel,sad
movie was ok there was nothing unexpected from this fairly standard plot and although i didnt necessarily dislike emilia clarke in her role her facial expressions were way too exaggerated i mean whats with the incessant eyebrow raising it was actually distractingbut good acting and casting in general and beautiful scenery shots,sad
its been ages since i saw such a wonderful wonderful amazing beautiful movie i was literally wishing that the movie goes on and one and never ever there is a finishingthis girl has stunned everyone with her performance outstanding outclass superb snd so many such words,sad
as other reviewers have said the message in the end is that even with love and money one rich ahole cannot bear the thought of living bc he is physically disabled so dumb it had me laughing in the end just how dumb the idea is dumb and offensive to all disabled i gave it a five star bc you should watch it just to see how insane it is and bc i do like emilia c,sad
this movie is beautifully heartbreaking  with amazing performances by the quirky emilia clark and the devilishly handsome sam claflin and a soundtrack that fully represents the real love and pain of an amazing couple this movie is one of those that youll watch over and over and cry about for daysthe entire cast and directors deserve a huge round of applause for the emotional story they put to screen and youll fall in love with this amazing romance over and over again and yes the ending will leave you breathless,sad
in any love movie there has to be a tragic event happen but soon be resolved by the prince or man of the entire story in many cases romantic films have someone who is disabled and ends up falling in love with someone the protagonist tragically has to tell their partner the challenges they have to face and they resolve the problem and live happily ever after is definitely a movie to rewatch because each character has significant traits that compliment the rest of the movie shifting perspectives and giving a jaw dropping finish director thea sharrock does a phenomenal job in making the personalities of each character very realistic and believable a cheerful town girl named louisa clarke got fired from her job at a cafe near her home that she has worked at for 6 years and is in desperate need of employment she then finds the job of caregiving for a 35 year old disabled man and decides to take the opportunity hoping to get the job louisa is very happy and outgoing with a very strange sense of style while will is the complete opposite when louisa was introduced to will he had already started with a bad impression and gave louisa a bad vibe making her job difficult will being disabled has the stereotype that people in wheelchairs are weak and sweet people considering that they have experienced such a terrible accident however will comes off as rude and offensive not caring about where his life is going louisa has the stereotype that shes calm and nice because she is the caregiver and he is disabled however she is very honest and blunt with him which he respects considering that everyone treats him like a baby and is unable to think for himself for example she was fixing some frames he had destroyed after he was invited to his ex girlfriends wedding and he insults her while doing so resulting in her telling him that she does not deserve the treatment everyone else is receiving because she is only trying to do her job as best she can it is very obviously to see how two completely different personalities collide and how the stereotypes of these certain people are quickly flipped and you get a sense of reality she changes the idea of these two personalities and makes it seem like something like this would really occur in real life and it is one of the biggest factor in any movie viewers always look for how realistic the movie is and if it makes sense and sharrock did just that  sharrock gears the attention towards the disabled man with his point of view to really see how people like him feel about themselves and what they have to go through everyday throughout the movie you see how will feels embarrassed about his situation considering that he needs extra help from other people will traynor had an amazing life before the accident he was a businessman with many interests in sports a very active man once the road accident occurred he became his own worst nightmare he hated himself every minute when louisa would want to do something with him he makes suggestions which is really just sarcasm because he wants to be left alone and unbothered sharrock really shows how frustrated he gets with himself and its what ties the audience in you never see how a disabled person can feel about their lives when no matter how happy or fun your life is for some moment you still go on every single day hating it  one of the biggest make or break moments in any movie is how it ends and in this film it is done exceptionally well when louisa finds out that will is planning to end his life in 6 months she makes a plan to try and change his mind by showing him how his life can be with her she takes him on a trip and they do many activities together building a romantic relationship as the trips show how happy they were together you would think that he would change his mind and stay with louisa because she has clearly shown that she will do anything to be with him no matter the circumstance however the last night at their romantic getaway she admits that she knew about dignitas a society that provides assisted suicide and how his parents only had six months she begins to talk about how she can make his life better and show him what a great life looks like even if hes paralyzed the saddening truth was that he knew no matter who it was no one was going to change his mind his mind was set and there was no going back he knew that no matter what came in his way they would never have to go through what he goes through and never understand what its like to be in a wheelchair paralyzed from the neck down  the ending is the sprinkles to the cake the way the personality traits are set up will makes us believe he is having a great time with her on the trips louisa plans and soon coming down to keeping his decision the same before and after all the fun had occurred it all ties together perfectly because in the perspective of a disabled man you see how he truly feels and everyday he feels like a burden and doesnt want anyone else doing anything for him making it difficult on everyone the ending wasnt a typical happily ever after or a he fell in love and knows that he can be happy again sharrock ends with a completely different twist that will leave you with tears running down your face,sad
i read this book and became my instant favorite i dont think like others do that encouraged or mystifies euthanasia i think it makes you aware of what some people chooses right or wrong their choose not my personal one though now the movie lacked of that insight given by the book but had scenes in the wrong order she never went to live with patrick we never knew she was going back to school we never saw wills sister and his dads mistress the movie moved so quick that didnt give you time to fully understand the process of falling for each other and such im mad after watching the movie emilia clark did a great job except for her excessive facial expressions it became upsetting,sad
a flawless movie honest touching beautifully photographed at picturesque locations warm tender performances from a stellar cast excellent writing with dialogue that flows effortlessly a perfect balance of gentle wit romance and emotion without ever being heavyhanded really theres nothing about this film that could have been done any better i found it charming and captivating from beginning to end,sad
the most notable part of this movie is emilia clarke it is always fun to watch fine actors in something besides their signature pieces that you knew them from in the old days john wayne was always john wayne here you can barely recognize emilia clarke a high compliment she has nothing of the game of thrones queen there is nothing of that characters confidence arrogance and presence she is wholly transformed there are many other recognizable faces in the cast for fans of contemporary british actinglike one of clarkes got colleagues brenda coyle from downtown abbey and jenna coleman from doctor whobut only clarke becomes a completely different person it is worth watching this just for that transformation for most of the movie she even looks puffier and plainer not exactly the image presented in got whether deliberate or not the moviecharming and bouncy at first with a poignant and increasingly sappy overlay ultimately is not as interesting as the cast but it is well worth watching and nicely paced to be sure there is a certain inevitability as to where it is going but for most of the movie the tone is light and it refrains from wallowing in despair until it does those last 20 minutes are the least successful unless you just enjoy a good cry,sad
this movie is typical for those who like soft romantic movies with a new ending i enjoyed watching it and i liked how the characters had really strong emotions and opinions its simple and that type of movie youll try to hold your tears from falling while watching it i did expect more of the story but as a whole it was lovely,sad
flash reviewlou is a quirky young woman much like amlie whose family is struggling financially takes a job as a daily personal helper for a quadriplegic young man this young man just happens to be handsome intelligent successful in business before a tragic accident and extremely wealthy and of course his name is will traynor as with many typical romantic story arcs the two start off with opposing personalities but learn to soften as it is her job to help him will the she look past his limitations will he allow her connect emotionally or will she remain his professional helper there are some cute and unique plot points that drive this story in unique ways along with an unexpected twist or two set in picturesque locations this is very visually appealing along with quality dialog this is a nice twist for the romdram category,sad
im so glad that i was able to finally watch this lovely film ive seen some rather harsh critiques however this film came along at the right time with all the glare and harshness going on in the outside world its nice to escape into someone elses world i remember listening to my grandparents tell about going to grand movie theaters during the depression as an escape from the everyday theres a true compassion in this film and it seems to have been done with the lot of love as for the issue of the film allegedly condoning assisted suicides because of the perceived burden is just a bunch of moose caca ive been a caregiver for many years and whatever faith or moral view one has we all have to accept that it is the choice of the person and ferfuxssake give them dignity make judgments when you find yourself in that position and not until people need to stop sharing what they feel and take action upon what they think,sad
this is a jolly refreshingly delightful movie the british do this sort of thing very well indeed miss clarke reminds me a great deal of audrey hepburn in many waysincredibly engaging i highly recommend this moviewhat a wonderful departure from the usual hollywood fare cheers,sad
emilia clarke is cute and totally lovable in this film portraying a quirky character who is all heart and i can understand why girls might swoon over sam claflin even when spoiler alerts wheelchair bounddespite the tragic background this is a delightful film that while raising very serious issues focuses on the personalities and how they interact the result is often very funny but also very movingconsequently i am saddened by the reaction of some people but it also helps me to understand the trumpist backlash against the thought police in american society because unfortunately there are some people who are not content to allow others to watch a film and form their own opinions about the issues portrayed they want to tell them how to feel and how to think and it is heretical if the film allows the viewers to come to conclusions that may differ from their own if the film does not specifically embrace their own views and values then they will try to harm it at the box office by driving people away through their rabid criticismfortunately this film is way above that putrid level and can be enjoyed both as entertainment comedy drama  romance and for the meaningful questions about life that it raises i found it comparable to whose life is it anyway and even better than the intouchables,sad
i definitely consider this movie part of the chic flick genre which i usually avoid but i could not stop myself from watching emilia clarke it was so refreshing to see her doing something besides the mother of dragons dont get me wrong  i love the khaleesi as much as every other strong woman and game of thrones fan but in this movie i found her personality likability and sometimes playful quirkiness delightful it was mesmerizing and enough to make me glad i had watched the movie of course sam claflin is brilliantly handsome so there was no hardship there eitheri found the movie somewhat reminiscent of the fault in our stars but without the waterworks that movie elicited i would have preferred a different ending but we dont always get what we want i wouldnt recommend watching this movie with a boyfriend but if you have a free night or want a slow night with a gal pal and a glass of wine this movie might be worth a watch,sad
a wonderful movie even for people who are not fans of romantic films its not groundbreaking or particularly challenging for the viewer but its definitely entertaining and sweet both sam claflin and emilia clarke are charming as will traynor and louisa clarke and they do justice to their book counterparts although they do get a little cheesy towards the end but i think its just the writers fault anyway the film is beautifully shot the soundtrack is perfect and in general the writing is good and adequately smart so i can forgive a few cheesy lines here and there as far as the controversy that arose over the way the film ends and its treatment of the disabled well if a man choosing to end his life on his own terms is offensive then so be it i personally think it fit the characters arrogant and stubborn personality even though id prefer an easy and satisfactory happy ending but then again if there was a happy ending there would be a whole new bunch of complaints about the stupid loveconquersall clich or how wills parents and lou would be patronizing him or any other crap that someone might think of i do agree that representation of people with disabilities should be better but that is not this movies problem,sad
is a definite contender for the most known romantic drama of 2016 but first things first this one here runs for 110 minutes and was directed by thea sharrock while jojo moyes adapted her own novel for the screen here and the result isnt shabby at all as this one scored a decent deal of awards recognition that turned the film into by far the most known work for both writer and director and while male lead actor has already starred next to the likes of kristen stewart jennifer lawrence johnny depp and other pretty big names from hollywood there is no denying that he plays only second fiddle here to female lead emilia clarke the latter is of course known to millions if not billions from game of thrones but good news is that thanks to the different hair color it is very easy to not see her daenarys character this time which may have hurt the film overall i think she did a very good job her energetic sparkling presence was one of the best aspects about the film and makes it easy to forgive her for occasional moments of overthetopness for example when her boyfriend arrives on her birthday and she tells everybody that somebody rang the doorbell they also really tried to make her look not as gorgeous as she is which was a huge challenge as even in these strange clothes she was obviously still a huge stunner claflin did a very good job too and he had the difficult task that really all his acting had to take place above his neck because of the characters disability i found him memorable other known names include charles dance oscar nominee mcteer or matt lewis from harry potter but honestly those were just in the shadows of the two protagonists because their material simply wasnt on the same level in terms of both quality and quantityas a whole i thought this was a really good film the writing was smart on many occasions and it is always a success for films closer to 120 minutes than to 90 minutes if they drag as little as this one here it also manages to stay away from the pretentious side and there was the danger it could enter this area on several occasions but it managed nicely the film is also not trying to make any political statements as it really is all about the tragic story of the two protagonists here some scenes stay in mind especially like when he reveals his suicide plans to her because his body was a cage or also the scene in which she is watching an old video of him before the accident the film included exactly the right approach to romance too in my opinion they did not have to go for a huge love story or anything in order to have the tragedy work here if you enjoyed this film as much as i did then let me recommend you a walk to remember or griffin and phoenix or the notebook although i am sure you have at least seen the latter already back to this one here i do share the praise and i think it is an achievement that feels both real and touching maybe it is generally more for women but definitely not exclusively if you manage to open yourself up here to the fate of the two protagonists i also quite like the title i am not a game of thrones fan at all so i guess this makes up for a slight emilia clarke fanboy tendency and turns me into a neutral observer a good no a great watch for people curious about game of thrones stars in other projects and actually for everybody else too this film is among 2016s very finest and i highly recommend checking out,sad
admittedly i clicked this movie mainly due to sam clafflin thinking it would just be another cheesy romantic dramedy i wasnt able to account for the tears rolling down my cheeks at the unexpected ending this is definitely one of those stories that will leave a mark on me and join my other top 3 romantic films amelie jeux denfants and man upwhat set this ending apart from all the others with forgettable fate was how it balanced out the themes of redemption and sacrifice wills pre accident lifeprelouisa encounter was perfect he was happy successful and on top of the world in everything lousias prewill encounter life was ordinary she had a stable boyfriend and a generally good life but was unable to really explore the world and find herself due to financial and self imposed obligations wills preaccident character would never have noticed louisa their worlds were too differenttheir encounter gradually shifts the scales towards equilibrium now theyre with each other every single day their worlds opening up and slowly colliding as they share their experiences with each other she learns about different cultures through french cinema classical music horse racing he learns about the joyful simplicity of being carefree through her eccentricity and quirk their perspectives slowly change as they develop a mutual affection that transcends common romantic love the type that always seems to hinge around lust and sexual attraction of course there are selfish elements to their love she needs the job for money likes to feel needed and he needs her companionship but all of that is massively drowned out by the rich unconditional affection and care they develop for each other through their shared adventures the relationship blossoms organically and never once felt forcedthe ending ultimately rebalances the karmic scale it didnt give us a happily ever after ending because that would be massively unbalanced you cant have your cake and eat it too he dies because in his view however warped and cowardly you may think that is its the only way out of his pain but his death symbolically paves the way for her new life shes no longer trapped because more importantly than the bit of money he left her her meeting him opened her mind and eyes to the amazing possibilities in life it wasnt the fancy vacations french bakeries or luxuries being associated with wealth it was the raw feeling of living and taking any experience to its fullest like the unnervingly beautiful thunderstorm they watched togethermeeting him in essence freed her spirit and she is now able to live her life to its full potential in the same way he had lived his perfect life before his accident and similarly will died happy and as contented as he could be one would argue more content than before his accident because he found for the first time as brief as it was a glimpse of love and affection stemming from a rare acceptance so deep as she was willing to put aside her own feelings accept his lifeending decision and be with him until the end they saved each other inspired in each other hope and even though it wasnt enough to change wills mind and even though they didnt end up together their encounter left a mark in each other one that transcends time and death its really the purest form of loveon a macro level i love everything about the themes they echo my own philosophies on life and love even on the granular level the few standout emotional performances more than made up for some of the predictable writing and tropes in particular the scene when will revealed the pain of living in his current condition to lou that he cant accept her love and be with her like how he wanted so much kudos to sams stunning performance it was not one bit under or overacted and i really felt all of the characters unspoken pain in those few minutesi can understand controversies the ending created some say it sends a bad message but similar to louisas reaction to the ending of of gods and men where she cried out incredulously how she didnt agreed with it and how the main character should have stayed but all the whilst admitting she still loved the movie thats how i felt about this ending i didnt agree with wills decision he should have stayed but i didnt take it as something negative and definitely not preaching an antidisabled lifestyle moral either people cant fathom why this mega rich prettyboy wallow in so much self pity and decides to end his life when he seems to be on his way heading out of the trenchesof course if you were to look at this without immersing yourself in his shoes its tempting to say nothing about his decision makes any sense and thats pretty trueample psychology research tells us that the future self we envision ourselves to lead is often very far from what actually happens what likely would happen is will adapting to this lifestyle and living happily with louisa but that wasnt the point of the story he couldnt see past his disability no matter how much love there wasthis wasnt meant to be a findinghopeaftertragedy type of movie and frankly it would have fallen into the same vein as dozens of others with similar story lines if it played out that way i took this movie as a coming of age story love was just the undertone ultimately it is about finding your inner spark and igniting that spark in others youve met but regarding the romantic aspect it was more than successful in its attempt to portray an ephemeral but pure unconditional bond between two people who never was meant to be together in the stark bitterness of reality,sad
well i like the romcom genre and this started off looking good clarkes big big grin and big big eyebrows did actually work in this poor girl takes a job to look after rich handsome throughly disabled and suicidal guy will traynor claflin the story had the potential for an lot of depth traynor plans to go to switzerland to be euthanised but promised his parents to wait 6 months to see if his outlook on his life such as it was changes clarke is brought in as a mindersuicide watch person there are issues that the film could have covered much much better rich versus poor euthanasia disability etc i couldnt help but wonder if the roles were reversed ie the poor person was the wheel chair bound quadroplegic  but no that would be far too miserable instead the makers chose to go for cheesy and safe mushy love story where even the poor arent that poor etc a rather disney wash on what could have been a serious but funny tragic thought provoking movie the acting was ok but i could not say anyone stuck out as great if i had to pick anyone it was stephen peacock as the male nurse he did give an air of gritty reality to what otherwise ends as mills  boon romantic slush watch once probably twice if you feel like a good old mills  boon boo hoo dont forget your tissues,sad
at the heart of this movie is an emotional political issue but first let me say something about how well done the movie isof course emilia clarke does a wonderful job and is quite lovable in lous quirky way sam claflin has a difficult part and does it well also janet mcteer and charles dance as wills parents also play difficult roles and help us get drawn into the emotion of the story i am a jenna coleman fan and had to wonder what she would have been like as louit becomes clear about half way in that this is not going to be a happily ever after story no matter what happens in the endas to the politics i am against any kind of suicide for moral reasons i dont believe that the choice of when a person dies lies with mortal man more importantly i am concerned that in a society where assisted suicide becomes at all common it also becomes very easy for various forces to take away the choices of those who want to live insurance companies already are very close to taking away that choice in some cases will and his family did not seem to have the financial pressure for people with a family that already lives on the edge financially a medical condition like wills could threaten to destroy it for everyoneon the other hand i can sympathize with the way will felt while i dont condone the result i can see how the hopelessness especially the day to day hopelessness can lead a person to think that wills choice is the better onei thought this story dealt with the issue respectfully and gives plenty of reason for thought and discussion,sad
a good movie doesnt have to be either bad or good at the end of it this movie show me that sometimes a movie just need to end the way it is thats just how it should behow lou react to wills explanation about ending his life is not right what could you expect from a paralyzed man that already live the awesome life before dont be a selfish movie viewer we can enjoy love story about will  lou for 2 hours movie but imagine how wills life if he need to continue his next 50 years of life that way thats why i think the movie ended the way it shouldbe grateful with your life live it,sad
absolute and totally loved it i was not disappointed with how the movie came out although some stuff were eliminated from the book but it was amazing sam claflin and emilia clarke did an awesome job portraying will and lou the ending got me sobbing even though i tried not to but those goddamn emotions were too strong i understand both of louisa and willi truly do and wouldnt want anyone to be in such a positioni lost count how many times did i read the book and watched the movie i know most of their dialogues by heart my favorite scene was definitely that in the wedding where will told louisa shes the only reason that makes him get up in the morningwill is a sweetheart im telling yall,sad
i never mind what critics think of movies i turned this on to watch because of emilia clarke this is a totally different turn from game of thrones and she is marvelous sam claflin is beautifully tragic as a man who has lost the ability to be who he was not willing to settle for who he is the chemistry between them was sincere not forced a growing affection laughter joy there is always a chance for joy in any circumstance that should be the tagline for this film it was set in breathtaking scenery and the music at various moments set a frame perfectly for that instant i loved this film,sad
emilia clarke wow in fact the small but amazing cast was all the right fit not sure where or what the critics are barking about the sweet fresh story saddled up with the right cast issues plot and whats going to happen next is literally a perfect composure the musical score is not just spot on its quite impressive the film takes the stance of being in two difficult places one from a quadriplegic and two an endearing young british lady who just needs a job  but is as bubbly cute color and inexperienced as you could possibly be the story here makes great sincerity and now i really wonder if the book could be as good as what was depicted shot and showed clarkes facial expressions are spot on and you clearly see the vastness of such a bright actress she shows more in this film than in got and obviously in terminator in fact she slimmed down so much and looks amazing that in this physical form she fits the youthful and vibrant stance of the character to perfection with her bright smile will traynor is played perfectly and you believe he is  a quad his attitude is spot on not to mention it feels realistic no matter what your background may have been eloquently the two become interested in each other and this is where the story becomes even richer as you wish for a certain outcome very well written if not one of the best films i clearly was going to overlook the critics are shamingly very wrong on this one itll darn near tear on your heart and the scenes and locations were the right fit im struggling to find negatives to identify but honestly if there are theyre very far and in between as your mind stays with the plot and keeps you moving loved it completely loved it and i do not like endearing love style of movies there is a plot twist that shows itself midway and for a unique step it challenges the writing well done i praise the script and those that approved it itll leave you in a torn spot among movies in the past for it truly moves the soul here simply loved it cheers,sad
this movie is not about suicide or doomed love this movie is about two people learning to see and love life because they focus on someone besides themselvesi thought the movie wonderful i smiled all the way through and though i disliked how it ended with will dying a main point of the story would have been lost,sad
i dont watch game of thrones  i know that in itself is a crime  so i hadnt really seen anything emilia clarke had been in prior to watching this film however shes so good in this its ridiculous warm funny engaging its not to say that she carries the film because of course sam caflin who i only knew from the horrible love rosie does his fair share but she shines in her rolethe film itself is much better than i thought it would be its heartfelt without ever being sentimental its full of engaging moments i dont know why the critics werent more positive about iti didnt start watching this film with high hopes but i was very pleased to be proved wrong,sad
this movie treads a tricky line both infuriating and charming viewers emilia clarke tries to fill the emotional vacuum with fullon kook as a carer for a hunky quadriplegic in thea sharrocks wipe clean romance the charm can be chalked up to star clarke she makes lou the type of beguiling creature weve seen in films before whos often known as a manic pixie dream girl  quirky irreverent and usually irresistible which is also where the infuriation comes in the mpdg usually serves the function of making a male protagonist feel lightened and leavened without experiencing much development herself fully enjoyable movie sit with popcorn and enjoy,sad
after reading the book i really wanted to see the movie i knew adaptations are never the same as the original and i was curious what they have changed but this movie left out a huge and very important information that gives a whole new level to the relationship of lou and will now the movies lesson is that if you have money you can leave your comfort zone  while the book showed how a young and healthy woman can be more paralyzed by her fear than a man with quadriplegia i was a bit disappointed and i highly recommend everyone who loved this movie to read the book as well they will see what i missed so much,sad
three and a half stars out of fivea romcomdrama about a paralyzed former banker thats planning to kill himself who falls for his new caregiver the movie stars emilia clarke and sam claflin as the two leads and it costars charles dance janet mcteer steve peacocke matthew lewis brendan coyle and jenna coleman it was directed by first time feature filmmaker thea sharrock and it was written by jojo moyes adapted from her 2012 novel of the same name the film has received mixed reviews from critics and some negative backlash from the disability rights movement over what they perceive to be a very negative message about people with disabilities despite the negative controversy the movie was a huge hit at the box office making over 200 million worldwide i do understand how some people could be offended by this film but i also think its a well made and sometimes very touching movielouisa clark clarke had worked for a local caf for six years when shes unexpectedly laid off from it desperate to find work she responds to a caregiver job opening working for a wealthy family named the traynors will traynor claflin was a successful banker before he was paralyzed two years earlier in a motorcycle accident hes now very cynical and hes not very welcoming of louisas assistance after some time though the two begin to get along quite well despite the fact that louisa has a boyfriend lewis when louisa learns that will is planning to kill himself she tries to come up with a list of things for him to do in order to make him love life again will feels like hes too much of a burden on others though to keep on living despite his strong feelings for louisa i definitely think that the will traynor character in this film has the wrong outlook on life and his views definitely shouldnt be encouraged or promoted and it does seem like thats what the movie is kind of doing so i understand why people are offended by this film but if you look at it just as being the way that this specific character sees life though than i think its something that could possibly be overlooked despite this major flaw the movie is very well made the main characters despite their flaws are very likable and the film is quite moving at times the two lead performances are both good and its great to see another strong female empowering role like the one that clarke plays as the central character in a big movie like this its also nice to see both a talented woman director as well as a gifted female screenwriter behind a major film like this its just a shame that the movie has that one major flaw to it thoughwatch our movie review show movie talk at httpsyoutubeslo5gyrmps,sad
his movie has definitely the potential to be characterized as a good movie good acting by most of the actors nice scenes direction and musical score still after watching the whole movie i was kind of disappointed okay the makers wanted to give a tragic finale to the story but in the end whats the meaning of the movie 1the protagonist indeed suffers a lot cause he is paraplegic  but in my opinion thats not a reason for what he decided to do many people in a wheelchair out there continue fighting with the difficulties they face without losing their desire to live 2 perhaps its cynical what i will say  but if you think it from the beginning of the movie the story is about a poor girl who is stacked with her life  that makes her paraplegic employer to fell in love with her  despite the fact she seemed to loved him back and after he dies to leave her an amount of money i can find many reasons to like the movie but the more i think about it i find equally enough reasons to dislike it,sad
i havent read the novel this is based on but as with anyone else i could also tell where this was heading its not really hard to tell so its not about the finish line itself rather than how we get there and its a pretty entertaining while also sad movie experience if you let yourself into the romantic world that is clich ridden to quite some extentalso some paper thin characters and two people who desperately needed each other even without knowing that we knew but you know im talking about so while one has a partner that does not seem to be a big obstacle especially when that person isnt the one ah the simple structures hidden in very tragic events and personal stories but this has a certain suave to it because of the main actors who really do carry this although it doesnt have too much to ride on if you are into these kinds of movies youll laugh youll cry and youll have a movie watching experience you were yearning for,sad
as a disabled person with cp i kept putting off watching this film due to the backlash from the disabled community however i felt that given that the content of the film reflects my everyday experiences working with personal assistants and also that i have a keen interest in the topic of euthanasia i had spent too much time avoiding the issues that are explored in before watching this film i was already aware of the fact that the character of will was being played by ablebodied actor sam claflin i can see why others have taken issue with this for me it felt like it sent out the wrong message i found it uncomfortable to see an ablebodied actor portraying a disabled character because it would have been more genuine and relatable had they chosen one of the many talented disabled actors out there for a start it would have been beneficial for the disabled community to be put in the media spotlight in a positive sense in addition to this the content of the film would have been less negative because we ultimately watch will choose to end his life whereas if will were played by someone with a disability then we would benefit by celebrating disability through a successful public figure who has managed to overcome social barriers and has built a career as an actor sam claflin in the role of will reinforced the sad message of the film that disabled lives arent worth living i strongly disagree with the premise that living life with a disability is less valuable it is a different way of a life but not a meaningless one wills perspective was warped as he failed to embrace an alternative way of life and instead lived in the past he focused upon the things that he could no longer do because of his quadriplegia he wanted to live like he did prior to his accident and therefore could not accept himself as a wheelchair user this negative view reflects how society too often views people with disabilities as incapable or a burden wills unchanging decision to go to dignatas reinforces the incorrect view that the prospects are bleak if you become less physically able i myself would dispute this narrowminded outlook despite my reservations about the overall impact of this film i did enjoy watching the relationship between will and lou develop in the beginning they were unable to relate to each other as will was uncooperative in allowing lou to become a part of his daily life preventing lou from becoming a real part of his routine was a form of denial because allowing her in would make his current situation real it seemed he was afraid of becoming codependant on anyone and wanted her to be merely an extension of his limited physical capabilities the breakdown in communication was portrayed well by both emilia clarke and sam claflin as the awkwardness was evident on screen the dynamic changed when they started connecting with one another and understanding each others lives in more depth what was evident from the outset is that both characters had something that the other perceived as important in living a good life for will that was freedom but for lou this meant the financial stability that will took for granted unfortunately there was nothing that convinced will to choose his new life over euthanasia not even now having lou in his life however i would suggest that spending so much time with her was in fact counterproductive because she represented everything he could no longer do perhaps if will had spent more time with other wheelchair users who had accepted and embraced their lifestyles he could have achieved a more positive state of mind ultimately i would still recommend this film because it provides an insight albeit exaggerated into the motivations behind euthanasia and opens the debate in popular culture the are parts of that i found inspiring and uplifting which is more than i expected,sad
i loved the plot and the characters its the kind of movies that stays with you long after you watch it even though i dont agree with the mercy killing concept but this movie was so full of emotions that you end up feeling the pain and joy of its characters emilia clarke and sam claflin were amazing lou or clarksemilia clarke character was very easy to relate to and no women in her right mind wouldnt fall in love with willsam claflin i also couldnt help falling in love with williams father charles dance and lous father brendan coyle this movie was not just another love story it makes you think about life and death its highly recommended and youll want to watch it again,sad
louisa lou clark emilia clarke makes a cup of tea to solve every problem shes 26 living at home with her mother unemployed father senile grandpa sister treena jenna coleman and treenas son tom she loses her waitress job and the family needs her to get another job her boyfriend patrick is more interested in running than interested in her the traynors are the rich family in town and the former lords of the castle camilla traynor janet mcteer hires her for six months to assist her paralyzed son will traynor sam claflin who was run over by a motorcycle two years ago will is bitter at losing his globetrotting outgoing lifestyle with his girlfriend alicia and highfinance friends he is cold to the quirky lou at first alicia announces that shes getting married to his former best friend then lou overhears camilla arguing with her husband stephen charles dance about wills plan to get euthanized in switzerland in six months lou struggles to give will a reason for living as male nurse nathan helps her to understand his painthis is a sappy romance theres nothing wrong with that but its really uninspired in its execution the best thing in this movie is emilia clarke being allowed to be her natural goofygrin self this version of her is really charming and winning the infuriating part is wills refusal to live his new life nathan explains that will really tried the first year and that hes hiding his painful existence from lou the movie does not do a good job portraying that idea and therefore leaves wills reasoning barethread they need a scene where will is actively trying to hide his pain his reason cannot be a lack of a james bond lifestyle,sad
this film is another of my favourite films i have watched i love the story between these two characters they are so romantic with each other there are lots of emotions in this story love loss happiness sadness in this story some parts of so upsetting that i started to cry and i dont normally cry at movies other parts of the movie were filled with happiness they made you smile and wish that you were in that film i think that emilia clarke and sam claflin were perfect together in this film and so great chemistry thats why the film was so good people that didnt like this film must have a cold heart film critics are always writing about the film so they cant get into the film and follow the beautiful story line that has been created,sad
based on the novel of the same name directed by a new lady filmmaker this british film has two young sensation sam claflin and emilia clarke in the important roles the story of a young man who was paralysed recently meets his new caretaker initially they both wont fit for each other but after some time everything changes when they together do some outdoor activities while the film progress it only gets more emotional besides its fun watching the first two acts particularly the performances from both the lead strikes stronglyafter a very long time i watched a good tearjerker but not that strong it is a simple story theres no big adventure or romance in it thats right it is not a romance film and if you decide to watch expecting one you will be definitely disappointed also slightly it delivers a bad message like the negativity for being one seriously ill and alive this issue is only on the humanity ground but afterall everyone entitled to do what they want because its their lifeanyway the film avoids the usual clich like theres no scene that you had seen in other similar theme repeats here deliberately avoided to make it a fresh piece basically if you observe closely the both two lead characters they had a different agenda about their life particularly the caretaker never ever tried anything seriously to accomplish her undertakingon the other hand those parts were very realistic but still gives us a cinematic experience due to the fancy screen presentation surely a good watch i think everyone should watch it because theres no drugs sexes or nudes or even the strong kissing scenes only the main theme is something disturbing particularly for the tenderhearted people other than that i hope you watch it if you havent yet710,sad
includes lush cinematography and a variety of exciting locales for a wellphotographed romantic film the story is about a pair of starcrossed lovers who sadly met at the wrong timewill traynor played stoically by sam claflin is a wealthy playboy who was paralyzed when struck by a motor bike his wellintentioned parents hire a young woman to help care for will hoping that he will not choose to end his life with an assisted deathlouisa clark is the helper who desperately needs the job to support her unemployed parents of course money is no longer the issue when it becomes clear that will and louisa are falling deeply in love the major dramatic question is whether that bonding will be enough to restore the life force in willthe actress who plays louisa is a perky performer named emilia clarke while there may be moments that are overthetop in exuberance the actress nonetheless conveys a bubbly brimmingoverwithlife quality that makes her a scene stealer throughout the film if her ebullience is not enough there are jawdropping quirky costumes worn by louisa that add to her colorful characterthe scripting of was somewhat bland without truly scintillating dialogue it was the standout performance of emilia clarke that made the film special it would be difficult to imagine any other performer in this memorable role,sad
this is the best movie i have ever seen and believe me i have seen hundreds of movies but nothing is compared to this oneeverything about it is perfect from acting to the story line and the soundtracks ed sheeran part kills me every time i watch it x ambassadors unsteady is breathtaking as well i have watched it three times and i feel like it gets better and better each time i hope there will be a second movie just like there is a second book after youi have to mention that the trailer is also one of the best ones out there i literally know every single word and line they say in the trailer i just love everything about it,sad
my wife and i watched this at home on dvd from our public library set in england sam claflin is will traynor young successful businessman from a wealthy family as the movie starts we see him going out to the street momentarily distracted and he is hit by a large motorcyclethe movie doesnt dwell at all on the accident or its immediate aftermath instead it switches to two years later will is now living back with his parents he is mostly a quadriplegic and confined to a motorized wheelchair he has a professional caregiver who comes in especially for the medical and personal care issues but will isnt happy or even faking happiness he is always in a rather sour moodemilia clarke of game of thrones fame is ditzy lou clark a 26yr old with a job as a clerk as we meet her near the end of her days work she is given an envelope with her last pay she has just lost her job she is from a working family and with an unemployed dad she needs to find work to help with expensesthrough a placement agency she is presented a job unclear what exactly it is but it would be working for wills parents she would be a companion of sorts for will drive him places find ways to keep him entertained even though will himself doesnt want any part of that plan will is dour lou always dresses colorful and funky and is always upbeatso the story here really is to see if somehow lou can break through and get will to better enjoy his handicapped life things are complicated quickly when lou learns that will is planning to travel to switzerland for assisted suicide he has promised his family he would give it 6 months before making his final decisionso the story is both funny and painful both main actors do fine jobs with their roles life is seldom simplespoilers in the process both will and lou fall in love with each other lou even lets go of her existing relationship she desperately wants will to stay build a life with her but as much as he would like that he cant forget his former active lifestyle and he doesnt want lou to be burdened perhaps for many years with him in his condition so he goes through with his plans and in his will leaves a handsome sum of money for lou as he says not so that she is fixed for life but enough to allow her a fresh start and a real career,sad
i urge anyone who has or knows someone who has suffered spinal cord injury to not watch this movie it is accurate maybe 30 years ago but not today though true that spinal cord injury does not have a cure it is not a death sentence for everyone and would not have been for a man of willtraynors injury or income the one factual thing in the movie was made a joke and that is clarks boyfriend recommending exercise and rehab its not funny im worried folks with injuries will see this and relate to his negative attitude and thats unfortunate its hard but not impossible or even boring to live with spinal cord injury and you can have a family the movie doesnt rule this out directly but hints at its impossibilities which is wrong wrong wrong,sad
such a strong cast clarke claflin and dance and they did an amazing job throughout whole movie you have cheerful and funny scenes as louisa and will get to know each other they start to feel very comfortable and tend to have a great time together opposite at the beginning when will treated her like sht then louisa find out truth that he is only going to live certain period of time and then decided to take his life out she keeps trying and loves him even more despite all that but his foolishness and selfishness is beyond every limit we are humans and we tend to life no matter how hard it will be there so no human with right mind to kill himself because he cant do something and doesnt feel valuable anymore and that is just unacceptable and probably all people need to agree with this and see that there is a problem with taking your own life only thing that will happen you will bring pain to other people twisted and disturbed thinking of individual like will should not be accepted as right despite all that ending was somehow peaceful with mixed feeling that were tending to happiness 254,sad
so consists of a very sensitive subject and for that has received a lot of criticism putting my own views aside this film is so charming and touching  really one of the most moving films i have ever watched cant remember one as emotional as this lou the main girl is daenaryus spelling from game of thrones and her role couldnt be more opposite but im glad that it is  she is a total nerd quirky yet witty and lovable all at the same time spoiler one of my favorite scenes was when she opened her birthday gift from will and was absolutely shaking with excitement at the bumble bee tights he gave her her reaction was seriously heartwarming and hilarious and not to mention the beautiful smile it gave will was enjoyablewill the main guy is so believable  from his depressed bitter and sarcastic attitude in the beginning to the inspiring and witty man he becomes after meeting lou he doesnt smile often due to his unfortunate circumstances but when he does boy it lights up an entire room honestly love that guyi bawled my eyes out in the end almost sobbing uncontrollably it was so moving this film has stayed with me long after id first seen it and will continue to long after i move on i only discovered it last week and have watched it three times already of course this is my favorite genre and so its very appealing to me i also just got my eyelash extensions done and have had to be very careful in how much i cry lovers of the romanticcomedy drama will not be disappointed and will absolutely fall in love with this film,sad
im a guy and by definition i will act as one meaning no movies about complicated love ever but if you have to watch one watch this one thats what i did and i dont regret it for a single secondwhy ill tell you why emilia clarkes portrayal of clark is amazing shes sweet caring and above all she makes you feel peaceful her role as daenerys targaryen in game of thrones prepared me to anything but not to this you laugh with her cry with her and most importantly live with her her eccentric dresses her smile and especially her eyebrows radiate so much sincerity that it makes my heart ache with happiness pace by pace step by step you follow her difficult journey through her life as the caretaker of a young rancorous disabled young man who just wants to stop living shes able to give him a taste of what life good be and what good it still could bring this movie moved me with tears but the good kind the kind that leaves you wanting more of those movies the kind that takes your breath away the kind that will make me watch all of the next emila clarkes moviesi sincerely hope youll enjoy this movie as much as i did because it was magical and unique,sad
i watched the movie first then read the novel and watched the movie again as i was about to finish reading the novel i really love the author jojo moyes i love her writings and it is a great combination of humor romance and life lessons there are many scenes that would just make me burst into laughter i love the casts sam claflin and emilia clarke is a wonderful match they look so great in this film i think one important part in the novel that shouldnt be left out in the movie is when lou decided to move in with patrick i think thats quite a big point where we could see will wasnt able to hide his feelings anymore i think it can build more tensions bw the characters and the tattoo part probably should be in the film as well its really adorable anyway really enjoy the movie,sad
i loved every second of this film i cried and i smiled and i laughed  just the way i like romantic films i will recommend this movie to everyone i meet the story caught me and i think the actors in it was amazing i loved the character lou clark and emilie clarke was stunning in this role she played so well the expressions she made and the fancy clothes i especially love the way lou fancied bumblebee tights it was not only serious i liked the way they made fun of each other and the music was amazing so many good songs in this movie i also liked the way the debate about assisted suicide is portrayed it gives you something to think about a must watch for everyone who loves romantic movies,sad
im not much for romance but so many people complained they didnt like the ending and emilia seemed charming enough to watch yes it suffers a few clichs but i enjoyed it you might say the pain was downplayed but we saw the story from lous perspective and not wills and as someone who has recently struggled with severe depression i connected to it i connected to that strange feeling of enjoying some of your time laughing enjoying a person you love and at the same time feel horrible i saw my boyfriends reactions and pain in clarkes reactions to his pain i felt this movie on the other hand sams performance was a revelation i vaguely remember him from the hunger games found him very boring and bland in it but here he shined i believed him in his blank stares happiness pain not many actors pull that off for me and of course emilias and sams relationship is great they worked wonderfully togetherit has problems of typical romance films but the story that looms behind it and pops out is very strong and well done we are taken off into the charming romp com world only to be snapped back to the reality of his disability and pain he is in,sad
emilia clarke was amazing in her acting  she showed all the potential she have and took me by a stormthe writing was astonishing and the director relies very much on closeups and reaction shots in witch emilia excelled with her facial expressionsher smile and her tilted gaze always seems to want to say something the british touch in the movie was clear and distinctin the other hand it wasnt good enough for a romantic movie and not an emotional tearjerkeri give this movie a 810 because of its good actors story line the settings and of course giving you a great amount of emotions,sad
wellit was a very cute and pretty movieand need not to mention amazing performances by actors but since i have already seen a 2010 bollywood movie guzaarish wwwimdbcomtitlett1438298the didnt appeal to me that much since both movies have a quadriplegic lead and a caretaker  a hospital appointed nurse in case of guzaarish both asking for euthanasiaand budding romance between them they are almost similar but guzaarish is very beautifully shot and romance actually feels very real and other character are also well established and there is no way u wont cry 3 or 4 during this movie so after watching guzaarish it wasnt a very money worthy experience for me since i kept on comparing both movies and me before u wasnt better even though it has 6 more years of advancement in filmmaking,sad
when you start watching the film you cant help but let this beautiful castle and its greener than green lawn get into your eyes its an iconic image of wales as legendary as the man who made it build william marshal the best knight that ever lived if you are not familiar with uk history i strongly suggest you go and check on him because im sure you wont be disappointedbesides that the movie was for kids but nice with many gentle feminine touches lous clothes lous feelings mrs traynors maternal love mrs clarks maternal wisdom clark familys attitude towards jobs luxury and unemploymentdirector thea sharrock and screenwriter jojo moyes a female author not the jojo from tucson arizona did a good job they walked too close to the edge of self hedonism for my tastes but they didnt plummet down and i liked it,sad
there are a bunch try and get it done using this formula and dont come anywhere near close to succeeding what makes this production work are a couple of terrific performances from its leads and a very decent job on all other levels of production we all know where it should go but in other hands we have to realize it might not get handled in the same manner so many other similar films just do not come off with the level of care this one does its only 110 minutes long but plays longer but none of it seems forced or protracted its just a charming little film with a great bunch of actors with a very basic and well developed screenplay,sad
i do not care what anybody says this movie was life changing i saw this movie on a rainy tuesday with my good friend and i was expecting to see any other chick flick but took my breath away i didnt feel like i was at the movies i felt like i was apart of the story i could not tear my eyes away from the screen okay maybe i did once to wipe the tears that were streaming down my face like a waterfall the actors did an amazing job with their characters and the producers and director did an amazing job with the film i think everyone should see this movie because it makes you not only appreciate life but it also makes you feel like you are apart of an even bigger world and makes you see things in a different light i would recommend this movie to every and anyone without a doubt my new favorite film,sad
i dont usually go for this type of film im a superhero film type of guy but because the beautiful emilia clarke starred in it i forced it onto my screen and boy im glad i did some people say bad things about emilia clarke and her acting but yet again unsurprisingly she was perfect through my heightened sense of empathy i could imagine how a paralysed man would feel and sam clafin performed the role to perfection for a soppy romance movie this was great 810 its missing two for the silly reason that it is a romance film i rated the flash a 10 so rating this 10 would go against my core values in conclusion even is this movie is not something youd usually watch because of its genre id give it a chance anyway becauseemilia clarke even in her dorky dresses was absolutely sublime and its worth watching just because of her well it was my reason anyway,sad
big expectations waited of the bestselling book adaptation of jojo moyes on the big screen attributing it the label of dramatic film of the date after the emotional the fault in our stars broke hearts around the world surely you will require a box of tissues nevertheless the film does not provoke enough tears for utilize more than one the romantic film goes through a fatiguing period tired of the renowned clichs of the genre implausible is find feature romance films like the stories written by the talented nicholas sparks   the choice  his last invention does not achieved good receptions  apparently this film genre will be condemned to the adaptations or reboots of hollywood nevertheless occasionally small underutilized gems come to lightemilia clarke  yes the blonde girl of game of thrones and sarah connor of the massacred terminator genisys last year  plays louisa lou clark a eccentric young lady who lives with her working class parents lou loses her job in the coffee shop of the village which puts her in a delicate matter lack of money her only employment opportunity is to be caretaker of a 30yearold man suffering paralysis of the shoulders down  owing to a motorcycle accident  that handsome man with sense of black humor sarcastic attitude million euro in his bank account hardened heart and possessor of a perfect smile is will traynor sam claflin has acuity to make to cry  remember to finnick odair of the hunger games with a black and white striped coat dresses with butterflies and vegetables psychedelic heels and other strangenesses of the fashion lou invades in the life of will to superficially transform his thoughts thoughts decided to practice his assisted suicide at a clinic in switzerland striking cloying and sentimental plot dispenser of laughs tears and doctrines do not focuseddoes not get away of the habitual absurdities of a romance novel perfect for lovers of the genre but tedious and repetitive for the general public despite the exhausted use of romantic elements moyes neustadter and weber know to place and represent every triviality harmoniously the first kiss clark shaving to will a powerful storm behind the female lead role and even avoid some recurrences to innovate with own circumstances and phrases bumblebee tights repeatedly we have seen impossible loves owing the difference of social classes and although the difference of status is present the film is focused in another type of differences the script fulfills the demands of any woman in love with chocolate and popcorn nevertheless objectively it violates the real context with impossibilities and events of tales of fairy hiding the suffering with the beauty the reality with pink unicorns e hippopotamus and until certain point is refreshing and requested for the genre nevertheless it is its sensitive subject in the ending which be really affected by the strategy  and therefore it affects the film in generalthea sharrock  writer and film and english theater director  follows the story of the book to the letter neglecting necessary and original ideas who do you wish to listen to ed sheeran while you are on the verge of tears pop music atmosphere is profound and even memorable not today by imagine dragons unfortunately these are located in incorrect times destabilising the balance and the process of the scene furthermore of its youthful soundtrack the performances hold firm progress of the story clarke does not exaggerate her character and if she does it has satisfactory effects and thanks to her beautiful and infectious laughter development gets a decent progress caflin is a bit more discreet and without clarke as lou it would have been a matter of seconds nevertheless it is the swift development of a controversial issue which absorbs the negative criticisms in the plot will is decided to die with dignity spoiler and he did it the film portrays the life of disabled people as different and in certain part it is nevertheless the lightness with that they deal the ending is as necessary as negative necessary because they do not turn to the romantic drama of the path towards death but negative because they insinuates that the days of a disabled person are useless and the best solution is suicide has the function of telling a love story the film did not want to meddle in dangerous waters but unfortunately it did itbenefits from the chemistry of its protagonists the idealized environments and some lines worthy of spark but the futility of euthanasia in the film destroys the built and paves the way for finding some errors more with the quality of the romance films of today is a tempting and sentimental proposal full of cornyromanticism teaching rewarding lessons as go on live each moment and question the unexpected turnaround of life,sad
i dont care what anyone says i loved this movie the movies always miss things out when they are based from books so i will defiantly be buying the books toothe cast where the perfect pick i dont think anyone else could have played the roles to well the soundtrack also was really nice defiantly on my download listi personally thought the movie was amazing and utterly heart breaking at the same time i was an emotional wreck close to the end its a movie everyone can relate to in same way or another and at the same time was very thought provoking it has humour romance and everything you could want form a tear jerkerofficially one of my favorite movies of all time,sad
i watched it more than 6 times dont you believe it the reason why i watch this movie because of the song of ed sheeran i didnt think id love it so much the movie has one ending but i try to find out another one by watching it many times i think im so stupid i think you will buy the book when watching it or something crazy that you will search for the bumblebee tightsclarka few weeks will have passed by the time you read this even given your newfound organizational skills i doubt you will have made it to paris before early september i hope the coffee is good and strong and the croissants fresh and that the weather is still sunny enough to sit outside on one of those metallic chairs that never sit quite level on the pavement its not bad the marquis the steak is also good if you fancy coming back for lunch and if you look down the road to your left you will hopefully see lartisan parfumeur where after you read this you should go and try the scent called something like papillons extrme cant quite remember i always did think it would smell great on youokay instructions over there are a few things i wanted to say and would have told you in person but a you would have got all emotional and b you wouldnt have let me say all this out loud you always did talk too muchso here it is the cheque you got in the initial envelope from michael lawler was not the full amount but just a small gift to help you through your first weeks of unemployment and to get you to pariswhen you get back to england take this letter to michael in his london office and he will give you the relevant documents so you can access an account he has set up for me in your name this account contains enough for you to buy somewhere nice to live and to pay for your degree course and your living expenses while you are in full time educationmy parents will have been told all about it i hope that this and michael lawlers legal work will ensure there is as little fuss as possibleclark i can practically hear you starting to hyperventilate from here dont start panicking or trying to give it away  its not enough for you to sit on your arse for the rest of your life but it should buy you your freedom both from that claustrophobic little town we both call home and from the kind of choices you have so far felt you had to makeim not giving the money to you because i want you to feel wistful or indebted to me or to feel that its some kind of bloody memorialim giving you this because there is not much that makes me happy any more but you doi am conscious that knowing me has caused you pain and grief and i hope that one day when you are less angry with me and less upset you will see not just that i could only have done the thing that i did but also that this will help you live a really good life a better life than if you hadnt met meyoure going to feel uncomfortable in your new world for a bit it always does feel strange to be knocked out of your comfort zone but i hope you feel a bit exhilarated too your face when you came back from diving that time told me everything there is a hunger in you clark a fearlessness you just buried it like most people doim not really telling you to jump off tall buildings or swim with whales or anything although i would secretly love to think you were but to live boldly push yourself dont settle wear those stripy legs with pride and if you insist on settling down with some ridiculous bloke make sure some of this is squirrelled away somewhere knowing you still have possibilities is a luxury knowing i might have given them to you has alleviated something for meso this is it you are scored on my heart clark you were from the first day you walked in with your ridiculous clothes and your bad jokes and your complete inability to ever hide a single thing you felt you changed my life so much more than this money will ever change yoursdont think of me too often i dont want to think of you getting all maudlin just live welljustlivelovewill,sad
for full reviewhttpthatdisabledmomi do wish story wasnt about him choosing to die but choosing to live but then that isnt very romantic just like my real story isnt but maybe someone  like one of us or someone who get us can romanticize our stories and have us i dunno live awesome authors that tackle disability with romance kody kepliner ava jae leigh bardugo  francesca lia blocki want more stories like mine out there i want them made to be romantic without death or the old tropes i think this can happen when we look at why the tropes that hurt us or offend us exist and then work on changing themso where does this lead this this rare glamorous and romantic depiction of what i and others live through with disability and chronic pain i dunno maybe emilia clarke will win an oscar hopefully because you know i hear shes so short and almost ugly it was so nice of hollywood to give her that role maybe they hollywood can stop congratulating themselves for hiring nonsupermodels and start hiring disabled actors writers directors and they really feel morally superior like the 90210 kids  as for me ill be watching game of thrones this mama loves the mother of dragons she is literally a guilty pleasure this tiny blonde girl that mostly rescues brown people i know there are people of color that hate this about game of thrones they should we all should keep challenging writers about the harmful tropesbut i will end with a game of thrones plot point last week was probably the third the queen of dragons khalessi burned rapists and demanded liberation for all women and slaves i literally cry like a girl at a romantic date movie every time because im so moved,sad
is a forgettable romantic comedy drama that really doesnt make its mark though it was a good attempt for a story like the fault in our stars it doesnt quite stay with you nor stand with the success of its book after so many skipped important scenes and dodgy actors for the mother and father of lou i found myself feeling quite frustrated that the book was so lovely and could not compete emelia clarke was such a true match for lou but unfortunately will not so much does have its perks you will find yourself laughing here and then and you may even find a tear trying to escape heading towards the end overall is enjoyable but you probably wont find yourself falling inlove with it as much as you did with the novel by jojo moyes,sad
yes this cruel and harsh review does contain spoilers stop reading any further if you have not seen this movie otherwise proceed look i love romantic movies to end the way i like books to end with that happy feel good ever after and together forever style i stay away from movies and books that end otherwise for me movies and books have always been a way for me to escape the real world real life doesnt always have happy endings thats why there are books and movies to offer escape from such times so how did i end up watching this particular film my dad picked it out he wanted to see what it was about when i heard the word switzerland come up i had this feeling in my stomach that it was going to be one of those movies where the hero and heroine werent going to get their happily ever after i looked it up online and sure enough i was right i didnt spoil it for my dad and kept my mouth shut but for me i was loathing the film from then on out why is hollywood glamorizing suicide its a cowards way out to think there is no other option no possible hope for a better life its selfish which makes the title appropriate he was definitely thinking of himself before her and what she was willingly offering to him to open yourself up to love like that is not always easy and to love someone the way she did most people shy away from it because it does take a lot of work william could have chosen a life with lou sure there would have been hard times but like she said in the movie he wasnt even giving her a chance what a way to say i love you youre just not enough of a reason for me to live on aces sorry but im not going to recommend this movie to others ball was dropped on what had so much potential for being a spectacular film with a tremendous love story,sad
according to the average of more than forty thousand people on imdb this movie got the rating 76 and for what first its pathetic and thats not a quality it plays cheap on peoples emotions and thats not an artistic value or any value at all im not the kind of person that likes only those movies which are artistic or make you think i dont mind amusing cheap movies sometimes as well  but what is amusing about this one to me this movie is like a perverted twist but not in a good way on hollywoodstyle fairy tales and thats nothing new for the movie industry  making you feel good on the account of an unworthy but good spirited girl who in need of good money becomes a cheerup doll for a prince in the castle who lived through tragedy trying to give him reasons to live while being payed for it because  why shouldnt that make him feel good about himself to be in a situation that parents have to buy him female companionship and since the ending can not be too sad and god forbid any different from all the rest of the hollywood soapies at least someone has to have a gain at the end of the movie since it was too unrealistic for the writer himself that the guy in such a bad state of the body could still have a good spirit driving him forward to survive he still had to make at least somebody happy at the ending and so we get a princess out of the ashes congratulations on keeping your stereotypes up to date successful and popular in the modern world hollywood,sad
the film is thought to be an inspiring love story revolving around a caretaker trying to motivate a disabled to begin a brand whole new chapter of life but sadly it turns out to be the other way round focusing more than half of the running time in glib romance there are some funny moments between the main characters that are enjoyable but the development of the plot has wasted several important thought provoking themes  controversy of the suffering between the disabled and the people around struggle to live and find courage to regain confidence with physical impairment sensitive subject on committing suicide and self willingness to survive as well as care support and inspiration from a true love both emilia clarke and sam claflin deliver their performance well while the choices of songs are pretty beautiful including the powerful scores composed by craig armstrong yet all these are unable to compensate the poor character and relationship developments perhaps the story should have reorganized by adding on more depth into the sufferings of the handicap further converting into some positive inspirations rather than just steamrolling the value of life,sad
apart from movies literature and music my other great passion is theatre and around twenty years ago i saw janet mcteer star as a memorable beatrice opposite mark rylances benedek which is more or less one for the so what department except that in this movie she has a featured role as the mother of the male lead which is yet more so what until we remember that benedek and beatrice were the prototypes for all the great movies in which a male and a female began by disliking each other and wind up as an item that is not quite true of this movie the man certainly begins by resenting the girl but then he resents most people as for the girl she is in it for the money as she is something of a kook its not to hard to see why he eventually falls for her  this is one of those parts that slightly offbeat actresses can score big in  think audrey tautao in amelie  but then cannot really replicate but its more difficult to see what someone in a steady sevenyear relationship should forget it virtually overnight and fall hook line and sinker for a quadriplegic well again not quite did i mention that not only is the guy very good looking but also seriously wealthy just once it would be refreshing if not a tad more like the real world if the girl fell for someone who looked like arthur mullard and lived in a council flat and especially in a film like this that is addressing a serious subject assisted suicide but trying to have it both ways by giving it gloss of a doris dayrock hudson romcom of the 1950s the two leads both turn in fine performances and the manipulative writing and direction does in the majority of viewers attract the hopedfor tears but it would have been nice if we could lose the chocolatebox elements and trust the audience to respond to the situation rather than the budget,sad
if it wasnt for the brilliant performance of clarke and clafin my rating would be zero jojo had the ability to send many horrible messages in just one book  about euthanasia about disabled people about love  in the end i got the impression that he resorted to euthanasia even admitting that life can be good after such an accident because it was no longer as it was before and in the meantime he had fun with the poor girl kind of a diversion in the last days after a decision that was never in doubt which he kept secret until the last minute even after knowing her feelings and her total surrender to him  the film ends with a message and a sum of money to give her a little help  and saying just live  wich is the oposite from the film messagemeaningless this story is not worth our time i didnt know jojo before seeing the movie and i certainly will not read anything from this source,sad
this movie will have you running through most of your emotions plainly put  its a good story with good actors,sad
the beauty of the love story is if two person are meant to be fall in love with each other no boundaries can stop them from loving each otheri rarely cry during watching movies this move is a true definition of love i cried a lot during watching this movie,sad
this story shows us what love truly is and makes us want to me more like the characters in the story it shows us that to love someone is more than their appearance and more than what their disabilities are it shows that love is when we care about someone so much that when we have to let go it takes makes every single part of us hurt but we still let them go because we love them jojo moyes is also known for the trilogy to this book the movie head full of honey and coming out with her new movie last letter from your lover this movie is sort of similar to the notebook or the fault in our stars it is also sort of similar to the new movie the upside however this story is its own i think that older teenagers to adults should watch this movie it has a great story line that sometimes requires a little bit of reading between the lines and having a little bit of background information i also would recommend reading the book and then watching the movie because the book adds a little more information that sometimes isnt explained in the movie so then by the time you do watch the movie it makes more sense,sad
what have i watcheda drama i wish it never endedi havent read the novel but watching this i think its one of the films where performance of the characters blow you away whatever the storyline isbut wait the story was a masterpiece as wellid give an oscar to emilia clarke and claffin as well was left only with facial expressions due to quadriplegia he nailed itdialogues throughout the film keep you hooked to the screenan absolute favorite of mine watched this on 2016 and again on last night like my favorite songs i felt like i can watch this movie many times without getting bored,sad
i created a account just to say how much i love this show it was so emotional and sad and beautiful and i cried a lot please do watch,sad
you watch a movie like this to feel the love i didnt feel theblove between that characters well i felt it from emile like a young school girl but never from will so it lacked because of that he never loved her because he was too hung up on his old like that obviously sucked if his girlfriend ended up with his best friend i dont know for me this movie was a waste of time and quite depressing emilie was cute but some parts were cringy  ie dance on the beach i wouldnt recommend this to anyone,sad
so will looks nowhere near a real quad two years after the accident hes still buff healthy looking and wayyy to happy to be a depressed man who wants to go to dignitas they couldnt even bother to make him look less like a marathon manclarke is just way too animated and silly most of the time im really bummed out they didnt make more deep characters and challenged the actors and shes supposed to be poor right for a part of the book shes the sole provider of both her parents and granddad and shes still walking in really fancy detailed and hard to get outfits yes the book points out her colorful clothes but these film makers appear to have no idea what youd really look like if youre poor or maybe they do and theyre pressured into never making a chick flick that is realistic ugh makes me so pissed its like watching sex and the city where they magically are just wealthy because who wants to look at poor peoplethe book delves pretty good into the miserable life of being depressed and paralyzed  but this book doesnt even scratch the surfaceit just feels like a money movie  to quickly go over all the events in the book and none of the actual emotionurgh im so disappointed,sad
oh my goodness out of all the movies ive reviewed  this one is the oddest i started out loving this movie then ended up hating it thinking about the movie now there were parts i loved and parts that i hated im 44 years old ive been on disability since i was 26 years old i know what its like to go through disabilities and chronic pain and different situations to where you want to end your life at one time it was so bad in my early twenties i did try to in my life thank god i did not succeed at it even today times are tough but i have a strong support system i made a pact with my sisters brother and my son that i would never try to take the easy way out of here again and theres no way in hell my family my mother especially would stand and let me say mom after 6 months let me die no way in hell thats happening so i tried to watch this movie from everybodys perspective and i understand why so many gave it at 10 i understand why so many gave it a one down to zero i gave it a 5 because i like the movie half and half  the love and caring that others had for this man was beautiful and yes i agree he was most selfish on his end at the same time i understand that is his choice and his right do i agree with his choice no i do not to me love conquers all and i also agree it does send a message out unintentionally im sure that if youre disabled or not as you used to be your life isnt worth living that is simply not true if that were the case i would have been gone a long time ago if you want to make movies like this send better messages especially to young viewers people that are disabled are discriminated against enough i even have a special needs son whos 22 and theres no way i will ever tell him hes not equal theres nothing he cant do even if he has to do things different then so be it love life live life so many people wish they could have and could not bless all those who are disabled and feel like they dont want to go on at times you can go on and you should,sad
schlocky sappy romantic dramas are a dime a dozen nowadays and most of them follow a similar story line just swapping out a few elements circumstances and characters in we get to know the story of a young man named will trainer who loses his sense of freedom due to an accident that leaves him paralyzed sam claflin and a young unemployed woman named lou who gets a job as his caretaker emilia clarkeas expected you is as formulaic as they come at the outset will and lou are at odds with each other but they soon begin to tolerate and then love each other and then a wrench gets thrown into things before everything ends melodramatically while that is the general flow of events there is a hope that something about the film is differentiated from the rest of what weve seen before unfortunately that is not the caseas solid as claflin and clarke have been in other work they come across as hollow wooden and appear to be less skilled actors than we all know they are there are some supporting performances from janet mcteer and charles dance that are okay but they are nothing to really write home about so when the plot is below average and the acting is forgettable its hard for a film to be enjoyable unless there is are amazing visual effects soundtrack etc while the best element of you is its soundtrack this is not enough to carry the filmif you like film adaptations of nicholas sparks novels and this is not one of those but it sure feels like one then you will probably enjoy if not resist the temptation to give it a chance,sad
love stories are so hard to make authentic most of them end up being completely recycled using the same plot material that never goes anywhere is set up in a way that would usually lead to a failed film it beats the odds this is the kind of film that keeps you entertained and attached for its entire runtime and leaves you walking out feeling something emilia clarke daenerys targaryen on game of thrones plays a smalltown girl who ends up caretaking for a paralyzed young man yes they fall in love yes their love is tested dont be fooled this film is authentic in the sense that you care about the outcome of this couple you root for them theres lost of sweet and tender moments that make work well emilia clarke is adorable and makes the film special this isnt a best picture worthy film but a gentle love story that tests traditional rules,sad
if you want to watch a story about love but in a way that make your tears come up  that is your moviethe story is simple rich guy with lost soul and a poor girl with a full hearth met and helps each other to find what was lost in their lives until noweverything was going on tracks until the moment when the reality took place and the strong said word had the final dot but as we all know nothing ends and anything keeps living even after deadsimple movie but with a lot of drama you will like it for sure and if you dont please watch it again and take the deeper meaning enjoy,sad
recently released out   film adaptation by thea sharrock of jojo moyes book became really popular these last few months at first sight the cast seemed interesting and the trailer looked like a typical dramatic love story we are all used to see hopefully i was wrong about that because it was really different and i recommend you to go watch it if you havent done it yet the story takes place in england in a small and peaceful town louisa clarke 26 years old works at the coffee shop to help her parents financially but when she looses her job she needs to find a new one as soon as possible after going to the job center she is proposed to work for the traynors quadriplegic son william traynor a job she struggles with because of his bad temper the situation gets better when they learn to know each other and the colorful louisa becomes the only thing he lives for buta big decision changes everythingsam claffin and emilia clarke both well know for big roles have been well chosen to embody the mains characters i seriously couldnt imagine it could be someone else instead of them they convey so much emotion i couldnt stop watching and i felt like if i was with them in the film during the whole film they made me laugh because its not only a drama like i thought they have a really funny relationshipthe landscapes and decors in the film are really impressing i particularly liked the scenery around the castle and also the island where they spent their holidays if you like romance and funny movies i recommend you to watch the film its sure you will cry but its so beautiful its worth it,sad
one of this summers biggest romances stars emilia clarke and sam claflin as two people who come together despite having very different backgrounds thea sharrock directs this film based on a book of the same name written by jojo moyes who also provides the screenplay while this movie isnt a breakthrough in any way and is host to many flaws its leading characters chemistry and sincere tone carry it past mediocrity the premise here is quite simple will traynor sam claflin a young man with an amazing life and everything he had ever wanted is tragically injured and left as a shell of his former self louisa lou clark emilia clarke a young woman who has recently been fired from her job and is struggling to support her family is hired as his caregiver this incredibly simple premise is nothing new and does little to break the formula thankfully emilia clark and sam claflin are great they have amazing chemistry that ultimately carries this movie claflins traynor steals every scene he is in and his performance as a quadriplegic is believable while at the same time not overbearing clarkes lou performs admirably but at times she comes off as a little too odd and outlandish nothing bad enough to take away from the movie yet at times distracting both of these actors come together to form a pair that is addicting to watch on screen and the best parts of the film are when these two actors come together to form a sincere bond other characters including lous boyfriend matthew lewis and traynors caregiver stephen peacocke are quite likable and provide some great humor despite being criminally underdeveloped lous boyfriend is a lovable buffoon yet their strained relationship felt unnecessary in the film the caregiver provides some comic relief but fails to provide more than an unnecessary third wheel to the overall story the relationship between lou and her sister jenna coleman tries to be heartfelt but ends up feeling completely unnecessary in fact the relationship could be cut out of the movie completely and viewers would never know the difference the story here is incredibly clich yet there are some surprising elements other than a few surprises the plot here plays out exactly like any other romance movie however this isnt necessarily a bad thing due to the fact that most viewers are not going to see this movie for its groundbreaking storytelling rather audiences will flock to it looking for a heartfelt and passionate romance film and that is exactly what theyll get the soundtrack of the film fits the film quite well and some big moments are only amplified by some impressive music choices subtle yet sometimes quirky tones and pacing in this film work fine in most instances though the film feels rather sincere in the way it presents its story though people who have seen the trailers which unsurprisingly shows far too much of the story can pretty much tell how the movie is going to unfold there are some surprises waiting the biggest surprise of the film lies within its ending which tackles a real life issue in todays world amazingly does a fantastic job of presenting this issue with respect while at the same time not shoving it down audiences throats the film does such a good job presenting this subject that viewers will have fresh in their minds for a long time despite running into a myriad of romantic film clichs does an admirable job of telling its story claflin and clarkes performances and chemistry are undeniably what carry this movie despite being surrounded by weak supporting characters the way it tackles a real world issue with grace and class are quite impressive and leave a satisfying impression ultimately is a simple film that achieves what it originally set out to accomplish it is a sappy yet clich romance that provides an interesting look at a real world problem score 710,sad
the movie talks loud about the subtle love we feel with each others company the way we get close to someone in no time and we end up with the fondness of the person well the film reminds me of guzaarish a bollywood film starred by aishwariya rai and hrithik roshan the movie is based on similar plot is a film about a quadraplegic manwill traynor a successful young rich man meeting with an accident and losing the ability to move again ends up being terminally paralyzed lou clark who takes up this job of taking care of will and serving and spending time with him she is chatty funny and shabbily dressed yet quite simple sweet and adorable they both find affection for each other but they cannot continue it the climax is arguably practical where will takes a decision about his life according to what he had told his parents cant say the ending was perfect but there is one thing to learnno matter how small or big how ugly or beautiful poor or richif you spend time with someone and feel for himher and the other person reciprocates feeling the same you certainly weave few things into each others heart spending time with the one you love is the best thing one can do be it few months few weeks few days or few hours those are the moments,sad
in a beautiful welsh town complete with a castle and moat a young waitress becomes caregiver to a wealthy handsome young man who has become a quadriplegic due to a traffic accident he wants to end it and she comes to care for him more than just as a patientthings are kept restrained and light hearted for most of the movie so that when more dramatic parts arrive it is much more effective during the wedding of his ex girlfriend his pain is quite moving the emotional climax in their tropical getaway is one of the more effective scenes in recent tear jerkersemilia clarke gives an effervescent likable performance with her quirky costumes her character is likable and one that could easily have been annoying but she avoids that sam claflin does a good job considering he can only move from the neck up for most of the movie he manages to convey all his character is going through the relationship between the two is believable and not over sentimental charles dance and janet mcteer plays his parents liked the contrast with her working class family and their simple pleasuresif you can remember the julia roberts movie dying young shows how to take a theme that has been done before but do it betterthe issue about assisted suicide is handled well it doesnt preach but you feel alright with his choice at the endthis movie deserved to be a success worth watching,sad
this is one of the most beautiful film ive ever seen ive had read the book before seeing the movie so i was expecting a lot from the adaptation and i can say that thea sharrock the director of this movie have done an outstanding job the cast is really good and matches perfectly we can notice a connection between the main actors that provides more credibility the the story in addition emilia clarke and sam claflin give us a moving performance during the whole film the plot is something that i had never seen before and its something very serious i think that one of the best part of this movie is the amazing soundtrack the crew have chosen indeed the best songs to express the atmosphere and the emotion that gives this movie one thing is clear you can not be untouched after having seen this movie,sad
what would you do if your life wouldnt be the same if you shall be totally depending on another person this is the tragedy that the protagonist has to face when his life is devastated by an accident movie with good rhythm deeply sad i couldnt hold back the tears i didnt read the trailer and for the first 30 minutes you dont really have a clue of where the story if going eventually incredible expressiveness for emilia clarke she can really make the difference with her touch even if her character is a bit too emphasized and her story isnt thorough in the end eventually we all should be glad of what we have in our life,sad
not a bad movie per se but a little too thin on depicting the more thorny aspects i can see why some found reason to get annoyed about the aspect of the girl winning big time from him having so much money and being able to help her hey i used a dt adjective for those on the wrong side of the atlantic her choice of a rich paraplegic makes it too tidy the burdens on the characters were conveniently just of a personal attachment dynamic the truth is that for most paraplegics the carers are also often suffering a great deal and not just emotionally they could be exhausted physically emotionally socially excluded and even financially depleted it could have more interesting if it had been realistically complex one person may have selfish reasons for even wanting him to die there could be many pushpull factors from both the paraplegic perspective and from the motiveemotions of their friends and family and even layers within this the film is quite planar so flat and uncomplicated that it really doesnt live up to the potential of a good thought provoking storywhat annoyed was how it sanitised trivialised and glossed over the issues related to being paralysed it was a bit too fluffy i am not saying the director should have ken loachd it and i am pretty sure the director didnt intend to preach educate or takes sides but there were some obvious and probably deliberate omissions that if they had been included could have made the story more compellingit puzzles me why the director has so deliberately glossed over nearly the nitty gritty bits the scene where lou sees the bathroom commode chair and her body language says she is shocked by the implications of this equipment this much rings truewhen she asks the nurse what if he needs tocrap she is rescued by the the male nurse who says no dont worry your not here to do any of the physical stuff almost like the director was coppingout of dealing with all those issues and telling us so at the beginningby not facing any of these issues in any depth the audience are never in the least enlightened about the plethora of little problems that add up to despair the fact he is extremely rich and handsome enables the director to compartmentalise these issues and to shelve the more difficult subjects for most carers there are very limited resources carers usually spouses have to deal with everything from medication to changing diapers what about if the genders were reversed and the person paralysed was a womanparalysis and consequential heath issues anyone who has experience of being a carer will know that if you cannot move yourself it can lead to bedsores and other problems related to immobility the nurse mentions some of the bodys regulatory issues but not any of the other day to day stuff these issues could have been a very good counterpoint to her naive can i make tea question only once do you see her adjusting his pillow i am sure his buttocks would have been much more sore than his neck a paralysed person who can feel but not move their legs may need them to be moved constantly just as we constantly adjust ours when we are sittingdaily routines he is always seen in a bed or the wheelchair what about cleaning his teeth washing eating shitting drinking or just trying to get comfortable there is plenty of room for humour and depth in these subjects that could have added to portraying the suffering that a paralysed person facesamong the matters not portrayed is how hard it is to get dressed to be washed the complete lack of privacy in going to the toilet etc even the period of adjustment from the time of the injury to having no privacy at all and having to be washed and dressed by strangers or even worse by an exhausted and frustrated spouse unhelpful advice the was very lightly covered by the boyfriend offering advice on physiotherapy over the past 12 years i have had advice from so many well wishing people who have heard of a miracle cure a relative who had a remarkable recovery from the same condition and so on and so on even i have done the same to others it is in our human nature to want to help but boy does it get depressing to be on the receiving end of often useless advice one matter was dealt with subtly and quite well was the issue of people talking over the person in the wheelchair as though they were deaf or incapable of deciding anything for themselvessocial capital mother please dont speak over me i am can speak for myself this very lightly covers the issue of the potential for a vastly diminished social capital not being able to get out and about and contribute to any project or engage in activities with your able bodied friends slowly isolates you this is hinted at by the issue of the previous girlfriend but again not dealt with in any deptheuthanasia the right to choose when you are dealing with a subject as sensitive and as unexplored in cinema as this i think it comes with some sort of burden of responsibility in this matter i think the film has missed many opportunities and almost trivialised the core subject in the process the parents are very well educated and liberal too easy what if he were married and had a religious wife more complex alternative scenarios would have made this more thought provokingoverall it is a well manicured but very hollywood nobrainer type movie which doesnt really do anything to educate or stimulate thoughtful discussion in the general able bodied public,sad
imdb says this is a drama  romance they are sure right my wife had tears streaming from her eyes from the middle to the end in some places she actually sobbed for me that settles it this is a drama  romance she has never cried at one of my scifi moviesso here we are somewhere in the british isles i believe that the old castle is actually in wales the scenery is sometimes breathtaking wills family compound is an amazing stately mansion will lives on an upper floor which is his apartment and very modern for something that is a few hundred years old the castle is really authentic right down to the oyster shells mixed in the brick and mortar walls will is a sad case since he is a quadriplegic along comes klutzy louisa aka lou clark she in desperate need of a job since she is the only working soul in the family of a half dozen she comes to the traynor home for a job interview she stumbles stutters sweats and fumbles her way through the interview with mrs traynor who by the way is the epitome of a british rich living matriarch with all the hijinx by our heroine madam traynor sees something that causes her to give louisa the job right then and there the true adventure of drama and romance now starts with lous first meeting with will it is the same story we have seen a couple million times from the hollywood folks that fact does not mean that this is another hohum offering there is a lot of psychological undertone just shooting around all of the main characters that is not much different than watching the pleiades meteor showerssam claflin did a fine job at a tough role it isnt easy playing a quadriplegic it is as hard as it must be to actually be one emilia clarke is wonderful free spirit known as lou remember the girl in your high school class that couldnt even breath chew gum and walk at the same time well here you areto top this off she has a fine sunny persona that does not allow anyone within a days ride to be somber remember i have not said anything about her crafty and sometimes brilliant strategies i will give you one more bit of info lous friend patrick mat lewis really irritated me he was such a jerk that i wanted to throw him into the north seathis movie is the kind of stuff you watch on a rainy sunday as you sit and sip wine while watchingeven i liked it and i hate romances wfhbear,sad
this film tells the story of a young woman from a socially disadvantaged family who gets a job as a carer for a wealthy young man who suffers from quadriplegia after a traffic accident they develop an unlikely bond until things take a terrible turnis rather strange because the main character clarke is rather strange she has a very unusual fashion sense yet she wants to study fashion fortunately the guy will is very amicable and likable their acquaintance and the subsequent bond is actually quite convincing and engaging it has a touching plot and it made my eyes well up i enjoyed watching it,sad
its sappy and forgettable so much so that i watched this movie about 10 days ago and i am having a really really really hard time figuring out what the movie was about that tells you how memorable it is not is the story of a girl in a small town that forms an unlikely bond with a recentlyparalyzed man shes taking care of he is dreadful to deal with in the beginning but the girl needs a salary and the guy is really well off so she sticks it out and surprisingly enough the man opens up little by little to her soon they find themselves behaving as if they were inseparable i again have to admit i remember little more about it so i give it a 5 due to indecisiveness,sad
its really hard for me to not spoil the surprises of a movie like for general moviegoers theyll be expecting another love story about two people who fall in love until one of the characters has a dark secret that could tear them apart for fans of the book they will love the fact that its incredibly faithful to the jojo moyes novel see the fault in our stars the perks of being a wallflower and other truetothebook movies for details but they will also get so much more out of it i recently read the novel last month before the film came out and i found the book affectionate funny and surprisingly uplifting i think the key to any bookbased movie is to find the right actors to have not only good chemistry but to make sure that audiences will remember the characters in their hearts boy have they lucked out with two immensely charming actors in this terrific film tells the story of louisa lou clark emilia clarke a 26yearold happygolucky woman who has been trying to find the right job to support her workingclass family that is until she unexpectedly finds one by working as a caregiver to will traynor sam claflin will was the man that guy who had everything at the palm of his hands until an motorcycle accident left him an quadriplegic now hes sarcastic bitter moody and thinking of really dark thoughts how did his heart turn to ice anyway lou refuses to be put off by a man who lost everything and gave his friends and everybody as lou calls it the crappy treatment suddenly it starts off being an antagonistic relationship to a rather healthy one as lou with the help of her sister treena jenna coleman tries to help will understand that life is definitely worth living for and yes they do start to fall for one another until will has that secret that could end it all i like the movie but i do have a couple of minor problems the first one is that the movie is not exactly as deep and sometimes dark as the book was however i give it points for letting the book and the movie asks the two questions can you fall in love with a person but disagree on what their opinion of life is and can that same person change your life even when its least expected the second one is that firsttime feature film director thea sharrock moves the film a little too fast without giving us a moment to understand wills plight and lous cheerful earnestness while trying to get to the best parts of the story but those problems did wash away with the help of emilia clarke and sam claflin clarke best known as the mother of dragons on game of thrones shouldve been a breakout movie star with that last terminator movie here that title suits clarke well as the character of the quickwitted but sometimes vulnerable lou claflin in his first movie outside of the hunger games series has the most challenging role so far but he is remarkable as the stubborn but sincere will their chemistry together is amazing the supporting cast is also good too with janet mcteer and charles dance also from game of thrones as wills parents who are constantly worried about him and his safety stephen peacocke as wills nurse nathan matthew lewis hello neville longbottom as lous boyfriend who is completely uncomfortable about lous job brendan coyle and samantha spiro as lous parents and theres also a really funny cameo from the absolutely fabulous joanna lumley credit must be given to jojo moyes who adapted her terrific book to the screen she also wrote the sequel book after you with some witty dialogue tender emotion and sometimes dealing with real themes although its not as deep as the book is a simple story sure but while it probably wont be in my top 5 of the best love stories ever i still found it to be in the same old tradition of tearjerkers the one where you laugh you cry and youll come out feeling good by the way its a lot better than the choice,sad
the movie tells a classic love story of a town girl falling in love with a paralyzed rich boy the girl is like a ray of sunshine penetrating the boys cave bringing him hope and laughters and joy but instead of miraculously coming back to health and marrying the girl the boy chose to end his life and inherit a fortune to the girl so she can go to collegei disagree with the religious talks such asfragile people dont get to make their own choices or artificial death is no better than murder everybody is fit to make their own choices especially people with high intelligence and iron determination like will to decide someone elses life or death is the worst kind of arrogance forced life with give will endless pain and desperate torture that is enough to drive him crazy steven knows that and camilla understands that despite the struggle if not for lou wills life will serenely and naturally ends like a ripen apple falling to the ground lou is the alien factor that is added to an originally balanced equationlou has potential but her mind is simple and straight and pure and beautiful because i like him i will try to save him it breaks my heart to think that will have to die after the seed is plant she arduously plans all the trips trying everything she can to cheer him up insulting the restaurant waitress for him ordering an hotel with him falling in love with him and even running home like a seventhgrade when she finds out that she cant save him she reserves nothing lou packs up all her guts and livers and heart in a box and presents to him but nothing will change the fact that will is doomed it is absolutely heartbreaking to watch lou going through the process of finding out wills death cannot be changed by any of her efforts but the hardness makes this a spectacular movielou comes to life thanks to emilie clarke and all the dramas in her eyebrows nobody can play lou better than the mother of dragons,sad
i didnt read the book before watching the film i was glad that i didnt read it beforehand but now im eager to read the original novel too while watching the movie i was thrilled and fascinated at the same time emilia clarke as lou clark makes the movie wonderful with her outstanding acting all the eyebrow mimics she uses arent too much but fit perfectly with her character i am of the opinion that her role in this movie is precious and far better than her role in got the clothes are carefully picked for lou and her lovely cheerful style the landscape of the wales switzerland france is well pictured apart from the excellent visuals i enjoyed the flow of the movie some people dont get the fact that in a movie not everybody has to act really well whether it is a side character or a man walking in the street acting overall was okay one thing i didnt like about the movie is it was supposed to be a romantic comedy although there are some scenes that got to me the alltoosudden love isnt really convincing the romance is fairly weak and sometimes awkward nevertheless this movie made me smile and cry it is very well entertaining yet emotional however the ending was a bit obscure there is a second book called me after you so ill be waiting for the second movie,sad
i decided to read as soon as i watched the first trailer of the film pop up on my news feed i was excited boy never had i been so eager to finish this book it was simply marvelous however i cant say that the film made me feel the same way emilia clarke and sam claflin did a great job dont get me wrong they fit the characters perfectly and shared wonderful chemistry unfortunately i thought they sugar coated some scenes way too much with light jokes and puns and in my opinion they took away so much of the tense drama buildup the book provided it was more like a sweet romantic comedy with a twist of drama in the end rather than a straightup romance like the book please excuse the overload of metaphors that are to follow but theyre important as i make my point they invested so much in keeping it lighthearted and sweet while keeping the worst part to the end but the book doesnt work that way the story is hauntingly realits a masterpiece butthe film is far from a replica it made me wonder how harry potter fans felt watching the movie distort the books and now i know how its quite gut wrenchingi shed tears of course during the movie but the book broke my heartits devastatingits an emotion that drowns you and makes you believe theres no way to safetyit takes you momentarily to sweet cotton candy like cloudsjust to break out in lightning and thunder and rain on your heart all over againits bittersweet yet life changing the book gave me a certain purpose if you willit made me feelit brought out a type of sadness i had never even known to existto feel completely lost and miserable and confused and flabbergasted and simply torn apart it ruined me in a good way i supposeand i cant believe someone author jojo moyes could have that much power over thousands of women who read the book the book is and forever will be the winner any time of the day do yourself a favor read the book beforehand you wont regret it,sad
i mean the main human story was beautiful though the girl was exaggerated and luxury too but this is a terrible thing now people can end their life such easy if they are not any more satisfied of it a little more provocative in some way they could even have kids just to say something that is not all about sex in this world i have seen it to end just hoping he is not gonna die but in fact he is i am furious i have cried also about the love story and about the warm humanity in this movie but there are people who are facing a catharsis on a stuff with no ethical content  on the contrary it has a self and social destructing meaning that is very clear that would be good if art was like once it used to be so that it would teach something i know this is all over but i needed to write this now i could share my opinion at least,sad
sorry but this movie has several problems story is about a paralyzed man who falls in love with a young local woman hired to be his companionhelp mate however he wants to commit suicide because of the pain and inability to live normally the trainers are supposedly the most prominent and wealthy local gentry family and yet they appear to have no servants at the manor house really i mean people like them would have at least a few flunkies doing chores it was laughable that mrs trainor would answer the door herself to let the shop girl in to interview for the companion to her disabled son job normally when people are interviewing for a job like this with well to do people a maid would let them in and allow them to be seated in the hallway and go in and tell the lady of the house she had a person to interview for the job the local upper class upon calling would be shown into a sitting room and then the lady of the house informed of their presence also in a small village the trainers would likely have found someone by word of mouth and not gone through the employment office at all furthermore it was mentioned in passing that the disabled son had been a corporate raider in london prior to his accident and yet he shows no compassion nor remorse for the jobs he has cost working stiffs nor companies looted and destroyedit is hard to feel sympathy for such an unrepentant sleaze ball one last point was it really necessary to jet off to switzerland for voluntary euthanasia in real life a hefty overdose of morphine or bottle of sleeping tablets and whiskey together would have done the job with much less fuss and trouble and trauma and upset for the parents apparently the handicapped young man really did put himself before and above everyone else,sad
first of all the book was amazing i literally cried throughout the entire last 50 pages jojo moyes is truly an incredible writer and i love every single one of her books i was super excited for this movie and i guess i had high expectations for it as well i am a moviefreak and i watch a lot of movies so my standards are pretty high yet i was deeply disappointed louisa clark was very different from the book her role in the movie was like a nerverack and her behavior just seemed very fake to me the intimate scenes between her and will traynor was really amateur and weird it all felt unnatural and like a staged reality show if you know what i meanunlike the role of louisa clark i loved will traynor sam claflin was pretty much absolutely perfect in his role and he did an outstanding job his pain and sarcasm felt so real and natural just like i imagined him from the books if youre a moviefreak like me or youve read the book youll understand what im saying im unfortunate to say that i really didnt enjoy the movie at all i cant exclude the fact that ive read the book something that might influence my perception,sad
the book wasnt greatbut i liked it anyway shame on me d  and so wanted to check out the movie the movie is disgustingly bad the pacing feels unnatural and rushedthe love story somehow feels forced the use of music is so sooooo bland and tasteless the acting of both main characters is embarrassing especially emilia clarkesi kind of thought she would be a good actress since shes on game of thrones but she was atrocious in this movie trying to make big puppy eyes smiling big and raising her eyebrows to oblivion did not make her adorable it made her punchablei will never recommend it to anyone will never rewatch itbad movie will forget it inyep already forgot,sad
jesus christ this is terrible point 1 emilia clarke is possibly the worst actress of all time including in game of thrones i get it shes a lovely likable real girl from the real world but she cant act and this needs to stop pleasepoint 2 another problem with this movie the disabled character is a 30 something year old man who acts like a 12 year old boy is filthy rich completely spoiled and point 3 makes the job of care giving look too easy i think this movie is pretty much insulting towards the care giving profession,sad
well sorry to say that but emilia was sucksif you want compere this movie to others in this genre like the fault in our stars its not worth it its just good to watch once the female charactore was horrible but at least you could accept male actor,sad
it is a great movie but the ends with a pessimistic message everyone has a life and everyone has problems but getting rid of problems by getting rid of life is not a solution i believe movie could have ended with hope and showing how beautiful life is,sad
the concept of a caregiver forming an unlikely bond with a quadriplegic man who has suffered an accident and in a wonderfully humorous and unsentimental way both the french intouchables and give a warm peek into what can happen if the right caregiver accidentally pardon the pun comes along and emilia clarke is absolutely disarmingly charming as the bridgetjonesclumsy girl with the funny clothes and the big heart however where intouchables have a slightly dark undertone which gives more facets to the plot becomes a little too much of a banal love story in spite of the subject of euthanasia i was entertained but the film certainly lacked some je ne sais quoi,sad
the most innocuous of mills and boon love stories ends with the romantic colead topping himself and expecting his new found love to come and gaily see him off everything thats wrong with the world is here insulting to people who face pain and anguish with courage and the loving help of partners and family,sad
the disability shown by this ego centric man doesnt seem to effective him being a prick he just has a small accident yes he cannot walk but thats not grounds for suicide especially when you are mega rich and have the support of parents and a girlfriend sam claflin only playing a disabled guy to attract the ladies yet the only girl he can get is his carer who has an odd personality to make munters think they can get a fit guy,sad
instead of courage and strength in the face of adversity this movie displays weakness and cowardliness was glad for the voice of reason the mother gave towards the end euthanasia truly is nothing short of murder very upsetting the movie makes light of this terrible and selfish act portraying it to be the best thing wow how far we have come to applaud choosing death over life it seems the main agenda here in this flick is to desensitize the audience into thinking we should just idly sit by and watch our loved ones kill themselves if he had used a gun would they have held his hand as well sickening,sad
this film literally just legitimizes euthanasia and is a complete waste of time one hundred percent predictable plot no reason to watch,sad
the whole story was a beautiful classic love story filled with happy memories for will so he would find the value and beauty of his new life and not to take it for granted first of all the whole story was brilliant and it couldve been pictured in a way better scenario emilia clarck was trying too hard to picture the clark character and her making all those faces and playing with her eyebrows in every scene not only made it ridiculously unnatural but it also made the viewer confused about her face expression by the end of the movie i was confused if shes sad for losing will or happy or even so sad that shes smiling nervously to cover her painshe had the wide smile with those funny wavy eyebrows im not a professional but i found the direction very amateur there could have been way more beautiful scenes where usthe viewers could actually feel the love is being build up between them and at last the ending was not my favorite i loved the tragic ending but it could have been finished in a more loving way ive said all the negative points but theres no doubt that the love story was perfect and sam claflin did a marvelous job picturing wills struggles and pain nice job sam ,sad
just saw this didnt like it that much it was odd i dont know none of the characters felt realistic will was super monotonous throughout the whole film louis was so cheerful it felt overdone and fake louiss boyfriend felt like a kids tv show kind of guy it tried to be touching but it wasnt whatsoever and the soundtrack was bad i love ed sheeran but using such popular songs kind of ruins it and photographdidnt fit in that scene at all and that romantic comedy type of music didnt help some of the camera work felt odd as well it left me feeling kind of empty this could have been a really good movie it just wasnt movingand doing some research i found out there was a huge backlash against this movie i mean people actually protested with placards because the message and blah blah blah why would you protest against a movie seriously and i dont think the movie delivered the message of being better off dead some people just cant overcome their disability it doesnt mean all disabled people are like will,sad
i watched this film and really enjoyed it which is strange for me and it being a chick flick and it wasnt until the end that i realised she was daenerys targaryen in game of thrones because she is so different in the rolesgreat script with lots of both funny moments with the humour and serious moments with the story behind it it was well put together brilliantly cast and beautifully filmed in all the various lovely settingsi might not be oscar material but nonetheless it totally captivated me and entertained me which is why i watch a film in the first place,sad
i understand why he wanted to end his life it is awful to be sick  but seriously  why make it a movie andbreak our hearts in such a cruel way i dont believe in happy endings but this was way to cruel  but i have enough drama and sad things in my life  i cried and had a really bad mood even in the next dayi liked the actors i liked her clothi like the places he has a really sweet laugh so does she,sad
this was shaping up to be a realistic and powerful story especially when louisa told will that killing himself was selfish she was right then the film veered into the realm of fantasy where will was portrayed as finding peace in an act of utter selfishness he threw away the gift of life and love there can be no peace in that there can be no peace for those who witness that i am reminded of the young woman who wanted to kill herself because her mother had never loved her because she was a girl instead of a boy those who were so caught up in the culture of death though it was such a wonderful thing that she could be free to end her life all that this woman needed was someone to affirm that her life was worth living this film distorts reality and is a symptom of a narcissistic and individualistic culture that summed up in the title of this film,sad
this movie was decent  definitely a big tear jerkerwill his parents and his carer were all very good characters  so well acted but lou to me she just seemed wet and a constant pushover i wasnt a fan of her or her family it bugged me how she couldnt just tell her boyfriend why she was doing all the things with will she was doinga lot of people say this is a feel good movie  to be honest i just finished watching and i feel kinda depressed by it  he wanted to die and nothing was changing his mind thats it really nothing feel good about that still if you want a good cry  watch ititll do the job there,sad
this was one of these movies that you find yourself trying to constantly remember that this is just a movie and that this is not happening in real life although this story is revolving around the serious injury of a person its really light in the beginning and it actually gets more than some laughs out of you and i think that when everything climaxes towards the end this is the reason why you feel even sadder clarke was awesome as was her coprotagonist all the cast was brilliant if you ask me the questions set forth by the movie and the morals that are promoted are irrelevant if you ask me ok its always about living your life etc in movies like that doing things while you still can not wasting time etc but the thing that stuck with me in the end is the feeling of this otherwise energetic young man when he wakes every single day having dreamed his life as it was before just to realize that hes still in his bed not able to walk or take care of himself i think that for me that was the punch in the stomach and with all this going on to fall in love with a girl that embodies life itself in such a unique way his attitude and how he held together till the end was the most touching part of the movie for me the movie was brilliant if you do decide to watch it make sure that youre not in a really bad mood cause if you are i can promise that it will really get you,sad
im not a fan of emilia clarke or sam claflin dont get me wrong they are talented performers but i didnt watch the movie to see them jenna coleman is the only woman both in the acting world and in my own relatively boring life who can make me feel scared excited and nervous all at the same time i think she had far too little screen time and katrinas story was only very vaguely hinted at apparently she has a son but they never explained who the father is or how she was coping and judging by how young jenna looks shes thirty but i think she looks at least five years younger i wouldnt be surprised if treenas son was the result of a teenage pregnancy assuming he actually was her son treena wanted to go back to college but thats only mentioned in one scene despite having too little screen time treena and lou really did seem like sisters it wasnt as good as anna and elsas beautiful bond in frozen but that was only because the story didnt give treena enough attentionthe ending was sad but i knew will was going to die before i even watched the movie with that said it does lead to questions about whether one should assist in a suicide and it was brave to tackle this controversial matter is it murder when one wants to die i dont know and while lou and treenas mother stated that it basically was that is just one womans opinion the film itself doesnt really say whether its right or wrong i also noticed something else actually from a trailer before i even watched the film lou said she became a whole new person after meeting will and her dad said that you cant change who people are some could see that as inconsistent writing but when i think about it i think it works because lou and her dad are two different people with different points of viewas someone who appreciates subtlety i should also draw attention to the scene where wills parents are discussing his condition while lou is listening something about the way charles dance spoke and held himself told me that wills dad knew that lou was listening charles himself must have known that emilia was there but i think he was implying that his character heard lou approaching and was intentionally giving her information about the situation hoping that she could change wills mind of course lou was eavesdropping but i like that its left to the viewers interpretation about whether wills dad knew she was there or notwhile its a good movie the only reason i wanted to watch it was because jennas in it if it werent for her i wouldnt have written this review ive had similar feelings about doctor who ever since the casting of the talented but overrated peter capaldi now that jennas left doctor who has lost most of its charm for me with that said i mistook treena for clara at one point because jenna can disappear into her character when shes playing clara to the point where for a moment i saw clara playing treena instead of jenna playing her it was like jenna was playing two characters simultaneously the problem is that treena was only in a handful of scenes so i never really got to know her shes supportive playful a little inappropriate at times katrina clarke and more intelligent than her sister but due to her lack of screentime i couldnt get to know her as intimately as i got to know clara oswald or queen victoria i dont know what her quirks and flaws are with that said jenna always has a powerful presence despite her size heck i think they should have switched her and emilias roles around because jennas the only reason i watched this movie in the first place also shes better at subtlety than emilia but can still be happy eccentric and energeticdespite this movies strengths it also has weaknesses the most notable one being that its predictable and there are no real surprises with that said its also passionate and heartfelt many movies are lazily put together these days  the film industry has been corrupted by money and seems more concerned about cash than making art  but this one actually had some effort put into it so it deserves to be acknowledged wasnt really my kind of movie but for what it was it was good if jenna wasnt in it and i still watched it id give it 6 but im giving it 7 because i freaking love her and hate that i love her and im driving myself mad over her,sad
its a very beautiful love story about the connections that people make over their lives its actually funny how the movies premise is about how short life can be and that it should be lived to the fullest yet it tells a story about how certain people can have an effect on you that can stay with you foreverand what i love especially about this movie is that its not a traditional formulated love story that usually is spoon fed to the mainstream ill take a guess that a lot of that has to do with the star power of emily clarke in the lead role i heard some people did not like the idea of her doing the role i can see that after all she plays a strong female character on game of thrones the movie gives more of a stereotype of what a strong female character is especially for a romance film but clarke is so good in it shes just so cute and its wonderful to see the energy she brings to the role on screen plus she had good chemistry with the guy from the hunger games films so you cant beat that i tell people im not a fan of romantic films but i did like what was going on here its not going to bring you to tears but it does touch you with its message on life,sad
in movies as in life appearances can be deceptive the trailer for 2016 promises a sweet romantic comedy but the film is an emotionally challenging confrontation with the moral dilemmas of assisted dying it is a beautifully sugarcoated but tragic story with a deep message that increasingly demands a societal response full of fairytale allusions including a castle with a fallen prince and a poor girl in strange clothes together with brilliant casting and tearinducing imagery the film is one of a growing number that address euthanasia themesthe storyline is simple working class girl louisa clark emilia clarke takes a sixmonth contract to be a carer for quadriplegic will traynor sam claflin he is under the guardianship of his wealthy parents who want a fresh bright face for will and louisa is delightfully quirky chatty and absolutely zany in her dress sense despite a fractious beginning they soon become deeply attached as she learns of his plan to end his life in a swiss euthanasia clinic within six months in the time they have left and within the constraints of his condition they do many of the things that young lovers do including a tropical island holiday the most painful part of this film is the absolutely finite nature of its impending finale and the respectful resolution shown in particular by wills parents and the transformative effect this has on louisaemilia clarkes performance is the beating heart of this film as louisa she is simply beyond gorgeous her face can speak volumes without opening her mouth while her eyebrows alone have a vocabulary spanning all human emotion will is her perfect match with an expressiveness that glides seamlessly from brooding stoicism to irascible charm no doubt many audiences will be happy to enjoy a bitter sweet love story told well without dwelling on the deeper message of assisted dying others however will be struck by the force of three words that are repeated several times in the film its his choice they will grapple with how a person can reach such an unbearable point in their existence where they find absolutely no reason to live as a tearjerker romcom this film is right up there with the best of them but it is so much more than that sure the narrative arc is laid bare right from the start but sometimes you just have to let a movie have its way with you as this one did with me,sad
romantic dramedies of this sort rise or fall depending on the chemistry of the couple it is a foregone conclusion they would fall in love but they will have to earn the right to fall into each others arms there is no need to give me new twists to the familiar turns just sell the couple to me and hopefully make me tear up at the end on that note scores beautifully i love watching emilia clarke the mother of dragons her goofiness allout spunk total honesty awkward behavior and gaudy sense of fashion lift the chick flick slightly higher than it deserves it took me 10 seconds and suddenly i dont see the queen of meereen khaleesi of the great grass sea the breaker of chains and the mother of dragons i couldnt take my eyes off her twitching eyebrows which have a life of their own sam calflin plays his character with the right amount of sarcasm and levity he is believable as a quadriplegic a man who knows he couldnt ever be the same man again both of them turned in authentic performances the story goes through the usual paces and there really werent any surprises but who cares the theme of euthanasia wasnt handled with a searing depth but the theme of living life to the best of your ability rings true yeah we cried but we werent a mess like we were with the fault in our stars isnt breaking new ground nor did it try to but it just felt like good comfort food sometimes i long for that,sad
i had braced myself to expect the movie not to live up to the book i was pleasantly surprised the casting of the main characters was the best i have experienced in a film in many many years the screenplay is a seamless adaptation of the novel keeping the focus on lou and will the minor characters get enough exposure in the film to tell the story so that it all makes sense lous quirky style of dress and personality was superb while the performance may not receive a major acting award it is nonetheless engaging and movingthe interplay between will and lou is balanced and nuanced the ending will haunt me for sometime to come,sad
i liked this movie  i gave 8 to it in the rating section but much more because the last movies available my god what a bad vintage of movies someone ought warn hollywood that the earth has been invaded and destroyed by aliens from space nonstop since maybe the 50s moreover it also seems that the exorcist has been reincarnating in other 100 movies too last one the conjuringplease come on anyway back to i usually take these movies with a grain of salt  maybe two grains first of all the clich of a millionaire goodlooking guy whose life changes after an accident it is romantic it is ok but it is clich secondly the movie is too predictable i watched it today and today june 12 2016 it is valentines day in brazil  i am brazilian i live in the usa though my wife read the book and of course the book was much better the movie is by the book indeed but not literally got it it is a romantic by the book type  happinessdramajoydramahappinessdramalovely message in the end enjoy but dont expect too much,sad
loved the film great screenplay great cast great soundtracki absolutely love emilia clarkeshes a total sweetheart and an amazing instagrammercumqueen of meereen mother of dragons um actorhowever sam claflin was the shining light in this film for me i know everyone will hate me for saying this but i felt like emilia despite her adorableness was trying too hard to be lou clark while sam was just flawlessly naturally fantastic as will traynor dont get into the controversy news and all that jazz if you like romantic films just go run get your ticket and enjoy this film,sad
one of the few romance films ill make it to this year is based on a novel of the same title by jojo moyes the story tells of a young woman who struggles to find consistent employment to help her family and is employed by a wealthy son of an english family that was paralyzed after being struck by a motorbike in the street emilia clarke continues to attempt to branch out from her starring role in the hit hbo series game of thrones and the failure of terminator genisys and plays lou clark sam claflin play will traynor the moody male lead after several roles in movies like the hunger games and the fourth pirates of the caribbeanclarke is better as the goofy smiling caretaker than as the queen of dragons she sports her natural brown hair in place of the targaryen blonde in which she achieved her fame claflin is moody and sarcastic as he is upset with his circumstances the supporting cast included charles dance who unfortunately will never encounter emilia clarke in the world of westeros but runs on and off the screen for a few parts here as wills father janet mcteer plays wills mother who hires lou to take care of her son matthew lewis appears as clarks boyfriend a fitness buff as he looks for work beyond his days as harry potters neville longbottomcheck out more of this review and others at swillikycom,sad
this movie isnt about the normal love stories although it includes some clichs but overall it was good the storyline is amazing and people would love this movie this movie contained a strong message to all people as well and the ending although unexpected was dedicated to the message of the movie now the casting i thought that emilia clarke tried too hard in this movie and when she laugh or cry it almost seems that its fake but her character is the most likable out of all in the film sam claflin was decent as will traynor steve peacocke was alright as nathan although his accent seemed hard to understand at first for myself and some viewers the rest of the casting was not that important because it was basically revolved around those three characters book viewers honestly this movie kept up with the book although they missed out on a lot of things they took out huge parts of the book and thats why the movie doesnt care about characters such as camilla thomas and katrina etc its like they dont exist in the movie viewers who do not read the book will not know who thomas is to the family and why katrina is so important to louisas life they also do not include wills sister patrick was literally no one in the movie hes louisas boyfriend in the movie and thats it they didnt explain why louisa dated him for years and how he was before he became that selfish prick so overall the movie get a b  it was not as good as i expected but its worth the money and time to watch it ps if youre a crier bring some tissues cause this movie is a tear jerker,sad
as a fan of romantic comedy drama movie the story is way too predictable it was like a typical genre of asian films but without originality the plot is way too simple add a script on how they met then you just add the sad part the end the story composition is too effortless easy and plain also the major problem in the whole movie was the acting of emilia clarke  it was way too cringey im sorry but i think she needs more practice for being an adorable jolly clumsy gal i literally skipped the part where she acts that way because i really cant take it or watch it her eyebrows wont make any difference you know even my eyebrows were almost stuck together while watching her that kind of appearance and attitude are so common in japanese anime and manga and emilia clarke has the worst impression i wanted to ask the producers of this boring and uncomfortable movie why did they picked emilia clarke to play louisa clark just because shes famous how obtuse the movie has good places a nice atmosphere the lighting was perfect and the other casts are talented they did an awesome job yet on how the heroine portrays her role was so unadorned undecorated and will really make you feel awkward or uneasy i dont hate emilia clarke but i really love romcom movies i love how romcom drama movies play my emotions it made me laugh giggle with cheesiness fall in love with the characters and cry but this movie is so terrible i feel very sorry for sam claflin too bad he was good,sad
if only stephen hawking could have seen this film 50 years ago he wouldnt have been bothering the world with his stupid cripple physics for more than half a century cus dude theres no dignity in living unless youre handsome and rich to all the handicaps  there you have something new to dream for getting enough rich to pay a professional swiss killer to end yousuch a meaningful film,sad
i wanted so badly to like this film but emilia clarkes facial expressions ruined what could have been a lovely piece of cinemabased on the novel by jojo moyes is a supposed unconventional love story about a wealthy paralysed man and his relationship with newlyemployed carer louisamy first criticism about this iseyebrows emilia clarke is a poor actress who seems to only be able to convey any sort of emotion with her eyebrows and goofy smiles in some scenes she is overacting to the point of making me cringe it meant that any realism of the film was totally ruined in fact the character of louisa on the whole was unlikeable unrealistic and unrelatable she is supposedly from a workingclass family and has little money though wears expensive looking clothes lives in a beautiful area and is extremely eloquent she came across as nothing more than a middleclass woeme im so quirky and misunderstood girlsecondly is will traynor initially he is a cold character who treats louisa with disrespect but as the story unfolds he becomes warmer and more likableall in all isnt terrible it has some lovely moments and has stunning scenery it is worth watching but the poor cast sadly lets it down,sad
this movie benefited by the halo effect of game of thrones clarke and hunger games clafin because it is not really a good movie imdb readers rated it a 75 but i dont understand why so i assume it is because everyone loves game of thrones and hunger games and the actors in them except for me ms clarke is annoying the movie is overly long it is predictable and i have little sympathy for any of the characters clarke does not stand up to her unemployed father and sister who wants clarke to work to support the family so the sister can escape and although clafin is horribly injured and one should empathize with his plight it is not easy to forget that he got injured soon after leaving his girl friends bed and was hit by a motorcycle while absorbed by his smart phone while crossing the street moreover he and his family have more money than trumpthe story is an old one quirky young woman cares for person with physical problems it was done much better in dying young youre not you and passion fish i recommend these three especially the latter two and forget,sad
im going to be clich here and say as usual its not as good as the book emilia clarke is a great actress but i just couldnt take her seriously with her crazy eyebrows i understand in the book that shes a little over the top but it took any serious scenes away from what it should be focusing on the key element for me is that they left so much important information out i know they have to cut it short but there is vital things that watchers should see 1 there was no real pressure in the film from the parents to take the job as in the book the finances are so bad she has no option than to stick at it 2 in the book will is very rude not just a little sarcastic as he is in the film he is down right rude to lou in the beginning and this should have been portrayed so you could see exactly how he changes and grows to love her 3 it shows will as being abit of a child pre accident with the daft video clip they played in the book you grow to imagine him being somewhat of a christian grey sort of character very masculine and very important he lived life to the brim and travelled the world 4 it fails to mention that will tried to kill himself prior to the agreement it also fails to show wills argument with reference to his decision you begin to sympathise with him in the book as he has a vital argument this doesnt shine through in the film there is still so much anger with him in the book and this is lost it totally skips when she reveals about the maze and when he opens up to tell her how scared he is of how his body will be 5 mrs traynor doesnt take to lou in the book shes angry at will shes a soft character in the film and thats a shame one of the reasons we take to lou is that no matters what obstacles come in the situation she sticks with him 6 finally where the hell was the empathy in the switzerland scene this is meant to be the man she loves but i couldnt see a single tear in the film i bawled at the book because that love really shines through and how devastated she is that she has thrown her love at him and it still isnt enough it could have been done with much more taste and got the viewers going a little more its a bit of a shame as all the big names are there and the book is great maybe its the way it was directed or how it was written in the script there was a lack of chemistry there for me with them both also which didnt help i didnt feel like they were in love at all its worth a watch if you havent read the bookbut if you have be prepared to be disappointed,sad
i dont usually write reviews but i thought i would for this one my wife and i saw the trailer for this film months before its release and were very excited to see it because the trailer makes it look like a very sweet love story we were lied toi have not read the book and so i dont know how similar it is nor do i know if this was based on a true story but if the movie is representative of the book i probably dont care to read it why because this film is not a romance nor is it a tragedy its a strange mix of both the girl gets the guy but not really here is what i mean the story is all set up to be this cute romantic film where a girl comes to the rescue of a torn disabled man and they establish a relationship fall in love sound like beauty and the beast and live happily ever after right wrong he has his mind set for killing himself because he lost the ability to do so much of what he loves instead of him fighting the odds and accepting his changes and living life the best he can he gives up and ends his life and leaves the girl behind what the f who does that i spent a long time as an aid for a disabled man and i had to feed him dress him brush his teeth shower him and so forth and i watched him go through a similar process i dont know what its like to live like that and chances are neither do you the reader however i know what its like to watch someone like that fall into a deep depression i had to keep him from trying to kill himself every day i get that its hard very hard i get that it feels as though it would be better to die but i do not believe that that is the answer we love stories of hope and stories of triumph they inspire us to beat the odds and to never give up so if this was meant to be a true romance i think he would have chosen to stay with her and have a wonderful life together lets say that they went with a true tragedy then i think he outcome would have been different anyway i think its a fun movie to watch but it just ends in a terrible way i think it would have been a huge improvement if they would have stayed together haters gunna hate but thats just my opinion,sad
this is not a guy friendly movie but its not so sappy that it cant be tolerated emilia clarke is in fine form but miles from her role as mother of dragons in game of thrones you can barely recognize her but shes effective as the always cheerful companion to a rich but paralyzed young man played by sam claflinit was actually claflins performance that i found the most interesting this guy starts out briefly as a young stud enjoying his lively life but then he is paralyzed very convincingly he even seems slightly thinner as if he hasnt gotten out of bed for months as a guy i tended to sympathize more with him while my wife was more taken with emilias roleanyway its all fairly entertaining and next time its my choice what we see,sad
you know you are not going to get a hollywood ending and its not because they are in england not hollywood a we havent seen them before cast does a great job the clothes and shoes are interestingbasically its a right to die story so who is more selfish the afflicted person who cant live like this anymore or the people who love him and dont want to let him go if youve seen the trailer you know where this is going you know you are going to cry and you willthe movie stands up well against others in the you know where this is love story is going genre the right to die issue gives this a bit more of an angle while the movie looks good on the big screen it will play well on a platform in the comfort of your home enjoy it and be sure to have the kleenex handy,sad
ill tell you something good i really enjoyed this movie now ill tell you something not so good i probably should not have is all about encouraging young adults to liveboldly and share with the world what they value in life done in the fashion of the fault in our stars and paper towns this romantic booktofilm adaptation becomes this summers great tearjerkerit all starts with our male lead 31yearold william traynor played by sam claflin who is living the great life of water skiing and highdiving but then disaster strikes at the blink of an eye he comes face to headlights with a motorcycle and he becomes struck with a lifelong condition called quadriplegiaquadriplegia is a condition that permanently paralyzes the spine arms and legs causing all sorts of symptoms such as loss of bladder and bowel control pressure sores blood clots respiratory problems autonomic dysreflexia muscle spasms it is a very limiting condition that bounds you to a wheelchair and forces you to rely on others for aid in all the little thingshere is when his new caretaker enters the picture will seems to be living fine in a wooden apartment with an assistant for his wheelchair but he needs someone else to help with minor tasks such as eating and getting medications her name is louisa clark played by emilia clarke louisa is 26 and desperate for work this job requires no experience so she is quick to accept the positionhere is the films greatest strength the way the relationship between these two is developed both players are beyond exceptional in their roles emilia puts on the sweetest most adorable facial expressionswatching her wide smile and nervous eyebrows will leave you tumbling in laughter sam isnt as strong as his colead but he beautifully contrasts from her lively exotic personality with his slow debbie downer attitude which gradually opens up more as he becomes more comfortable with his caretaker even when hes just staring at the castle outside his window like a senior citizen he makes it so easy for you to connect with himeverything else that happens to these two is just pure sweetness he talks her into watching a foreign film with him she helps him to shave off his facial hair she tells him about these ridiculous bumblebee tights she always wanted she struggles to get his wheelchair out of mud she attempts to get him into a highclass dining restaurant that he doesnt even like and best of all they get their moment to dance at a wedding its purely believable to see their relationship grow from distant to intimate over six monthsthat being said the story needed major alterations the books original author jojo moyes adapted to the screen and its clear she doesnt know how the process of an adaptation to screen goes her intentions for the emotional aspects of the script are in their proper place but many of the important moments particularly in the beginning are skimmed over and barely given any detail and it shows more in the rather clumsy third act in addition the pictures editor john wilson simply did not let various scenes last long enough to get the full emotional effectbut thats not the worst part no the worst part of this film and the book in that matter is the message without spoiling anything for those of you who havent read the book the overall theme justifies suicide as a path to freedom from lifelong suffering suicide is often talked about as if it were a decision to live an alternate lifestyle saying that if someone chooses to kill himself you just have to let him do it but how much truth is there to thiscoming from my own experiences my autism has been an enormous stumbling block just like will with quadriplegia but what i learned over time is that what i thought was holding me back was actually setting me up for something better such as my book on growing up autistic that currently has a 45star rating on amazon but it doesnt end there do you think stephen hawking would have inspired others had he decided to end his life after losing his muscular capabilities do you think that roger ebert would still be remembered as a wellrespected movie critic if he killed himself after losing his jaw what about abraham lincoln would our nation still be a slavefree country if he chose to end it after meeting a failure on the job the devastating thing is this movie proves that people dont quite understand the value of a disabilitynow jojo moyes is right about one thing you cant change people or the decisions they make if they choose something beyond the extreme youre not responsible but contrary to what moyes is trying to say in her work life is always worth living in the very end even if certain things may momentarily make you feel otherwise thus i probably wouldnt recommend the book or the movie for this very reason but you can go ahead and read and see each of these highly enjoyable works if my praise entices you just be aware that no matter what crap you may go through life is always worth itoverall grade c,sad
having absolutely fallen in love with the book my expectations for this movie were somewhat high it did not let me down it felt very different from your generic romantic chick flicks and it stayed so true to the book the characters were cast well  i find emilia clarke a little cringe worthy in got but she was excellent as lousia and the chemistry between her and sam claflin was great really believable as a whole the film flowed very smoothly nothing dragged on or felt too rushed there are also some laughs in there which add a little bit of lightheartednessa beautiful story with packed with emotion and a bitter sweet ending if you loved the book then i would definitely recommend be prepared to cry,sad
director thea sharrock directed the movie about will traylor sam claflin from the hunger games will born and brought up by rich and stylish parents camilla and stephen is a handsome happy man who meets with an accident and is paralyzed emily clarkegame of thrones as lou clark takes up job offered by camilla to keep her son will happy and to bring in cheer to his gloomy bitter and angry personality stephen peacock as nathan  wills therapist is caring and professional the story is beautiful and the title is perfect life is a journey and if not happy from within the course has to be changed enjoyed the conversations between camilla and lou clark there is perfect understanding between employer and the employee lou clarks conversations with her sister katrina jenna coleman makes sisterly love and caring very precious samantha spiro as lous mom is emotional stable and caring my favorite scenes include lous birthday celebration with will as a guest and the restaurant scenes where seating is for premier membership only lou handles disappointments well and takes advice from her loving family for her happiness will enjoys one day at a time and knows what he wants from life i enjoyed the simple and realistic script needed a little editing perfect title,sad
having read the book before knowing there was a movie coming out about it i knew the whole plot and knowing the whole plot made this film unexciting to watch for me i just didnt feel like it was anything special it might also be because of the story itself ive outgrown romantic comedies and though this does have a ending that isnt usually in romantic comedies it still progressed as one the characters are typical and not that interesting though having said that clarke as louisa does a good job of bringing out her characters quirky and bubbly personality clafins character on the other hand is your typical rich boy with lots of baggage and its up to the girl to make the boy whole again not my cup of tea also movies like these perpetuate the idea that boys and girls cannot remain in a platonic relationship if they are in close proximity to each other while the characters are typical the acting did the film justice enough the characters were brought to life and there is good chemistry between clarke and clafin although it was somewhat awkwardthe cinematography is well done as it does a good job of showing the landscapes in the area the sweeping and aerial shots of the castle gives audiences the impression of how big the space actually is also wide shots of cities like paris is nicely done however i did not like the many closeup shots of the characters i felt too close and intrusive im not sure why people cried while watching this ok i mean i am quite detached from emotion when watching things but i did not feel that there was much emotional buildup could have just been me overall this is a well made film but was a little boring to me,sad
i did not read the book when i saw the trailer i thought the movie was going to be boring but i was wrong to regard it as one of the best romantic films of its time is a mistake but to say that it is bad is not exactly right either while there isnt something breathtakingly new about the film i could however easily recommend it to someone whos tired of watching films with endings which only aim to satisfy most of the audiences desireone quirk of emilia clarke that kind of distracted me with her acting is her overly expressive eyebrows she is beautiful and lovely no doubt about that but her eyebrows stole the show in some scenes from time to time im not entirely sure either if it was meant to be that way but the wardrobe they had for lou emilia clarke was terrible i mean i get that her choice of clothes was supposed to make a statement about her personality yet i was hoping for them to achieve that without making the character look sillywith regard to the ending others find it ironic that will sam claflin is instructing lou to do something that he himself intends to defy but what i think these people fail to realize is that will and lous life conditions are not the same the challenge lou faces in her life is not on par with the difficulty being suffered by will i believe the lesson to be learned from is to do something significant with your life and if you pay close attention to what happened in the ending you will see that both characters were able to accomplish just thatbetter than the fault in our stars,sad
many times we have seen this in the past a successful author teams up with inexperienced director add some wellknown faces and you are in for a insignificant piece of film making the story for this one i been told is much more believable and interesting on the pages of the best seller book by the same author that wrote the script and thats a bit confusing as why would a successful piece of literature would turn into a very sloppy cheesy inconsequential film the main problem i have with it is however the amount of clichs that keep coming one after other i found myself guessing all the time which clich would be the next which scene would show that this film was no more that a collage of clichs that murder the narrative the scene when luisas boyfriend tells her about his plans for a holiday that include all his friends just sums it up and then theres the characters  small town girl from working class parents that talks with a public school accent an has an infinite wardrobe when i look at the characters i can only see the actors and thats not good in fact some of them charles dance jenna coleman joanna lumley and diane morgan seem to have been signed up only to add well known faces to the cast list  they add no value as actors to the film and theres more that i could add that can explain the disappointment of watching these 109 minutes without feeling that you are wasting your time but i leave it here in summary  sloppy story telling questionable casting poor acting clichs clichs and clichs avoid,sad
i had high hopes for this film whilst reading the book a friend had tried to get me to watch the film as she said it was fantastic i refused and continued with the book i grew to love the characters and hate some of them  patrick for one and i cried at points throughout when id finished i sat down to watch the film i know i knowfilms are never as good as the booksbut wow this was shocking there are lots that cant be put into a film that are in a book but if youre going to go to the trouble and the expense to make a film do the author justice so much was left out of the film lous sister played a large part in the books but she was hardly present patrick as annoying as he was in the books was a complete arse in the film and it felt like that was done on purposei have no idea whyto make will seem more likable bizarre large parts of the film would not have made sense without having read the book  eg the holiday of a lifetime that lou had to cancel there was no mention of it at all i felt really let down with this movie i loved the book and am about to read the sequel read the book and really dont bother with this as a side note emilia clarkes eyebrows must have had their own script lordy they put me off a lot of it and i love her in got,sad
i got to be honest here ive watched this film two times now and at the first time i cried and cried and shed even more tears towards the end the story is great its based upon a book which i havent read yet and the story line is great its about this smalltown girl getting to know the world a little better through the eyes of someone who has seen it all but its also about a young man who deems his life worthless and him getting to see the world through the eyes of someone who hasnt seen anything i thought the relationship between lou and patrick was acted out a bit over the top and i can not stress enough how much emilia clarkes eyebrows annoyed the frickityfrack out of me its like she has two worms on her face performing a mating dance all the time dont get me wrong she is a great actress but chill out with the eyebrows we can already see every single emotion clearly written on your face without them,sad
i was totally ready to get into this story and enjoy it im afraid this movie is terriblethe first thing is emilia clarke which did a terrible terrible acting job she always had the same smirk on her face in any situation sad happy annoyed the director did a terrible job of directing heri also did not buy for a single second their supposed love story the third act is not working at all you dont understand her motivations her feelings and it just didnt work you dont understand why she does the things she does actually the movie progressed in a way for the first 34 of the movie that i could not see them fall in love in anyway and it was not clear if she fell in love and if yes why etc etcvery disappointing movie,sad
in the first half an hour youd think that this is a changed version of the intouchables but as you move on it makes you wish it were progress is very predictable like if it was written with a recipe its really hard to believe that this movie is based on a book its even harder to believe that this is a british comedy the boyfriend character in every five minutes the author points out how stupid and selfish he is everything is told by yelling in this story everything is exaggerating emilia clarks awfully overreacting probably the best proof that her career will go down as soon as game of thrones over cant keep up with sam claflin if you havent seen the intouchables better spend that 2 hours watching that,sad
truly awful film with the production values of a cheap soap opera episode from the 80s clarke with no direction relies on facial ticks to cover up the fact she cant act the message of the film is sickening and every actor in the movie will not want this horrifying accidental comedy to be on their resume i can only imagine that the 10 star reviews are from pre teen girls who some how think this is what a love story should be and as millennial smart phone addicts they have never seen any proper love story film made before they were born awful film but when watched while reading the outstanding negative reviews on here it actually becomes an amazing comedy,sad
i mean the story is weird i dont know how to feel about it but i really feel sorry for her boyfriend he did nothing wrong and yet she ditched him over a vegetable6 out of tenjust because emilia clarke is hotand her acting was goodand cause i felt sorry for the guy at the end of it,sad
emilia clarke is a bad actress sam claflin clearly didnt read the book before accepting the job because he nothing like the brilliant bitter cynic will in the book,sad
i hate the movie so much that doesnt even real love,sad
i really liked the book ive reread the book a couple of times and loves it i was so exited for the movie but honestly it sucked the whole part why lou and will fell in love is just bad you dont really see how will get louisa to live and start exploring ger own life while you dont understamd wills pain at all and how much he hates hus life natan is not a character that is even necessary in the movie while he is inte of the mist important ones in the book the only good thing about this movie is the actors they did a great job to catch the characters personalitiys,sad
the stage curtains open has a glorified madefortv kind of flair but manages to keep you invested even though the subject matter is treated lightly and without the due thats deservedwhen louisa lou clark loses her job unexpectedly she is forced to try and find income to help out her family during tough times she is twentysix has a steady boyfriend of 7 years and not very ambitious in fact she is quite happy and content being a small town girl who has no designs on ever leaving and becoming anything other than what she already is but when she is hired on to help will trainor a young man involved in an accident that leaves him paralyzed and confined to a wheel chair she begins to have a new outlook on life when she does her best to try and brighten hisi cant say that this film is predictable  but at the same time i can there are only two definite endings this story can have my reviews are spoiler free so i wont divulge the ending other than to say i didnt care for it i really dont like the message that it leaves behind as the end credits begin to roll but enough about that this is just okay nothing special it is endearing cute in parts and heartwarming in others  but overall it is rather plain emilia clarke was adorable in her role but just a little too pretentious and cutesy sam claflin didnt sell me at all in his role he was just a pretty face for the girl to fall for and there were no raw emotions or struggles displayed on his part this is not a recommend  maybe worth one watch but nothing more,sad
as others have pointed out the messages in this one are so bad that it borders on actual nazi propagandaworse still the message isnt presented in a controversial way with a dialectic but just as something the main character has to accept if it at least was presented in any way from a balanced point of view the excuse that its a difficult topic could have heldthe characters when examined closer under the criteria of what they do how they do it and what they get for their actions are all awful peopleabsolutely disgusting and lacking redeeming qualities apart from nice cameraworkawful and condemnable i dread to think what sort of influence this could have on a developing mind everyone involved with this should seriously reevaluate their life perspectives,sad
this movie is ablist trash and honestly im surprised that the author got away with never interviewing an actual person who has quadriplegia and main source of information on the subject cams from a family who helped their child with quadriplegia commit assisted suicide which wow is maybe a little bit biased no this author is speaking on a subject as an able bodied person who wants to romantise other peoples realities and basically glorifies a handicapables suicide if this story was about an able bodied man and his depression his suicide would be tragic but because her leading man has quadraplegia his death is hailed as a necessary sacrifice for the people he loves this movie is trash the love story is trash and jojo whatever her name is uses degrading language both in the book and the movie using terms like quads which news flash isnt how people with quadraplegia refer to themselves which she might know if she ever bothered to interview one as someone who works in the medical field this movie is a nightmare and i would hate for any of the people i know who have similar medical needs to watch this movie and think that what sam did was something they should do for the sake of their loved ones if i could rate it 010 i would have do yourself a favor and go support people who actually are fighting for the rights of the handicapable community and not trying to kill them off for a plot twist,sad
as someone who does not actively seek out soppy romances mostly because i like to live in solitude i found this quirky british love story to be sweet and endearing it frequently immobilises itself with eye rolling moments however once the prickly subject of euthanasia takes hold of the script it drives itself to the finish line with a tear or two maybe louisa a young woman desperately looking for a job becomes the carer of a stubborn quadriplegic initially a salty meanie who relishes in his own selfpity her eccentric personality soon starts to win him overso if youve ever seen the untouchables youll notice this film plays out almost identically to start with two strangers from different backgrounds forming a close bond after spending plenty of time together its a rather predictable affair with this script struggling to inject any sense of heart during the first half clarke was wobbly as she forces this eccentric personality by wearing odd fashion choices constantly babbling and trying her hardest to come across as awkward the consistent use of ed sheehan songs and other romantic pop tracks made the film feel cheap and disposable appealing to the demographic of radiolistening mumsbut then something happened about halfway through it dawned on me that this may not have the happy ending i predicted euthanasia makes it way to the forefront and surprisingly packs an emotional punch clarke and claflin begin to exhume believable chemistry and i found myself falling in love with them dont get me wrong the script still has many stumbling blocks and overextends its sentimentality consequently leading to melodrama however the film remains sweet throughout and i appreciate the direction it took whilst adhering to its source material you understand both louisa and wills perspectives on life without the film forcing this upon you also shout out to lumley who literally only has one minute of screen time worth it,sad
it has some heartwarming scenes but the whole movie is a typical romantic drama that ends with a dramatic death it is continuously trying hard to show depth and meaning but it is just a plain oversimplified story clarkes acting is exaggerated and not convincing most of the times however the ending is just disturbing so a handicapped persons life with many achievements caring and supporting family and loving girlfriend is not one worth living,sad
i watched about half of this film from the middle to the end i was even more unhappy with this movie after finding out how the story beganthe cast are all fine actors but the movie sends out a very dangerous message never watched a love story where i felt so uncomfortable it didnt make me happy or sad  just angrythe movie made lots of money but to what endthere is more out of life than,sad
dear lord pleasethis was not a good movie i think either it should have focused on being a sad story about death or a love story because of this conflation of moods the happygolucky over the top acting seemed so out of place i feel as if this was not made for a british audience like it was too british and everyone seemed to be caricatures of themselves the main lead actor thankfully did not overact but seemed to have no real depth nor did i believe for one second the chemistry between the two leads or the relationship with her boyfriend for a matter of fact it was just stale i didnt hate it but i didnt feel anything for anyone if you want a film with essentially the same storyline but just better overall check out rory oshea was hereinside im dancing where a carer falls in love with her patient,sad
this film is so so beautiful i love it emilia clarke and sam claflin do the roles so well and they are just as i imagined them to be when i read the book,sad
is one of the film that attracted my attention it was produced by jojo moyes on 5 january 2012 in the united kingdom its a romance fiction film  the castings are the famous louisa clarck  william traynor  camilla traynkr  steven traynor during 2hours  evolves around louisa clark knows as lou  is an eccentric girl who does many jobs to help her family  her good humor is put to the test when she becomes the caregiver of will traynor  a young and wealthy banker paralyzed in a accident two years ago little by little with the help of louisa  will loses his cynicism and regains his taste for life to sun it up  i really love this film  because it touched many topics the most important of them is that we should never surrender even if every thing is complicated  we have to cling to life no matter how lost we were  life is unfair  so we must enjoy our life ,sad
not worth watching no plot at all dont bother watching its such a waste of time,sad
i would rate it 1010 if the ending wasnt like thatim sad about him dying at the endit show you how much life can be hard sometimes its really meaningful i love itand the director did really great job shooting the scene with all that nature ughh it was so goodalso i loved the songs they played it most of them are ed sheeran which is my fav,sad
after losing her job at a local restaurant lou desperately seeks a job in order to support her family thus she accepts to take care of a fully crippled young man who seems to have lost hope in life much sooner than expected her job will be taken to the next level as she gets emotionally involved but will it actually be enough to make a differenceits a movie which left a big impression on me and i have to say this from the beginning its plot managed through its apparent simplicity to generate so much emotion that i was left breathless many times its so dramatic and romantic that it can fill you with you joy but also make your eyes water it has such unique and charismatic characters that you simply cannot avoid caring for them everything they do and feel gets sent straight to you as you were part of the action thus the emotion it generates is simply breathtaking it manages to alternate drama laughter and romance in such a way that i honestly havent seen since the fault in our stars another similar movie which i adore you might find it a bit predictable from time to time except its finale which is everything but predictable but i can easily forgive this small flaw after seeing it as a wholethe actors it has are simply marvelous they are able to impersonate their characters in such a way that they make you believe its reality their charisma plays a very important role here making themselves likeable and also making everything credible and as a result more emotional and dramatic the dialog is another plus as its complexity helps a lot especially when facing a more difficult situation which simply implies it their british accent is also worth mentioning as it brings some sort of flair to this filmi cannot emphasize enough how much i like this movie its plot its characters its actors and especially its atmosphere are so good but the way it makes you feel is simply one of a kind it starts slowly but it builds up pace and ends up in style you can see by far that these people truly know how to make a movie of this genre and the final result is simply great its simply a wonderful achievement,sad
i dont like romantic films but this one inspired me the film feature emilia clarke and sam claflin who also starred in games of thrones the film was an adaptation of a book written by jojo moyes with the exact same name but i learned about the book after watching the movieits a story about love of a two different people from english countryside louisa clark  emilia clarke works in a local bistro and dated with patrick whom she probably doesnt love after losing her job at a local cafe she got a job in the household of traynors she was supposed to be a companion and a caretaker of will traynor will traynor sam claflin is a successful young man who loved his life but it quickly changed after a heavy traffic accident he becomes paralyzed wills mother was desperate because will got depressed and she couldnt do anything on her own so she tried to find caretakers who would help him and persuade him that life is worth living after a few months full of crazy activities they became good friends until love aroselou is funny optimistic kind and she wears crazy clothes on the other side wills character changed during the film at the beginning of this story will was depressed cynical but over time his character grow and he became really funny and sweet yet still calm and mysteriousthey were like sun and moon different but they were meant to be together in my opinion this film is very romantic funny and dramatic i really liked it and i recommend it to watch,sad

it is absolutely brilliant moviei just like the movieit really taught the value of lovethe acting of both the main characters is absolutely stunningpls watch it guys u would really love iti am damn sure about that,sad
it was completely based on the book since ive read it emilia perfectly played her role i enjoyed it,sad
greatand i cant say anythingbut also i hated the end,sad
such an amazing love story absolutely broke my heart yet warmed it at the same timei heard about this movie years ago but never got to watch it until now so glad i didsam claflin is unbelievably talented i have seen all of the movies hes been in and i have to say that his performance in this one i just out of this worldemilia clarke has great facil expressions i could feel every single emotion her character was feeling just by looking at her face wowgreat movie to watch when you just want to cry your eyes out,sad
a truly loving and endearing feature with a talented cast in good use and very well meaning intentionsi enjoyed this film greatly most upon which lay in the interesting premise and wonderful performances one immediately points to emilia clarke and sam claflin for their chemistry truly drives this film and scenes where they are separated have great weight as one can genuinely feel the disconnect and worriment felt by the characters which is a great achievement on the part of the actors screenplay and directorthe films screenplay is worthy of praise however is also the root of some of the films flaws the motion picture is an adaptation a novel both were written by the same individual jojo moyes the screenplay builds upon the characters highly successfully in the first two acts of the picture and delivers the dilemma with clarity and respecthowever the third act i thought to be weaker for i believe for wills motives to not have been explored as deeply as could have been for it was told and not necessarily shown and what was shown didnt hit the emotive mark as well as it could have therefore when he chooses his final choice and lous subsequent decision it feels a little premature a bit too out of the blue the twist isnt as convincing as could have been thus this weakens the third act although by the final scenes between the two is of great emotional impact and rectifies many of the problems by the narratives endthe supporting cast was of particular importance to how the story unfolded i felt that some were stronger than others i felt that charles dance and vanessa kirby were the most impactful upon the story and delivered as such in their performances however i felt that wills mother played by janet mcteer could have been stronger and had a greater part to play in the narrative although the performances from the actress and the aforementioned actors were all splendidon the other hand i believe for the doctor called nathan to be a very telling character to the film in that he spoke and delivered what he had to say and then left as a expositionary source that his impact was minimal and could of had a much more emotive arc and relationship with will and louhowever i must not forget the wonderful use of colour in this film with particular praise for the costume design and cinematography the costume designers for this film did a splendid piece of work in endressing emilia clarke in all the happy striped and multicoloured costumes without ever coming across as silly but as loving friendly and caring the cinematography further highlighted this interesting colour palette and helped to compliment it without the film descending into looking like madness or a fairy world apart from that the angles are clear and fairly standard but yet deliver upon the dramatic function to a fair and adequate quality overall the cinematography aids and enhances from the film and doesnt detract from it as it could have very easily fallen into more silly territoryin the end i did very much enjoy this film i particularly liked the performances and the very loving and jolly atmosphere sustained thought the feature which brings a fun and entertaining film though the screenplay at times hindered certain aspects of the film and some characters it played to great strengths in other areas thus i give the film a healthy 710 i would recommend this film particularly to people looking for something romantic or for quiet evenings and slow days,sad
i was totally lost in the momentsreally i cant lmagine how some peoples rate this beautiful piece of art under 8,sad
what a movie this is i love this type of movie forever,sad
the last 5 minutes made me hate the whole moviethe movie before those 5 minutes was a 7 to me it was querky and kinda refreshing but no i cant stand that message no one ever has the right to end his life no matter how hard he live this movie should have give people hope what a message for people with disabilities they have every right to livei wish he lived happilly ever after with lou or died naturelly by complications or mayby died in that accident in the first place and not making that booki was in the middle of reading the book i wanted to read the book before watching the movie but thanks god i watched the movie first cause i really disappointed with the story it is all wrong in every aspects the problem is you cant find out until the endhow do you describe this as romanticand how all this compliments and rating for the movie and the noveldisappointing,sad
sucks donkey dong the main girl only likes fashion and has the personality of one of the bricks on my fireplace in fact i would rather hold a conversation with one of the bricks on my fireplace than with her also they insinuate being paralyzed is so awful that will decides to off himself life can still be enjoyed for other reasons but i would have offed myself too if i were him getting stuck with that bumblebee tights freak loser mcpoopy pants whatevs i forced myself to finish the stupid movie and then sat and reflected on how deeply disappointed i was that i wasted my few hours of free time not at work or doing errands on that piece of rat crap movie,sad
what kind of a joke does louisa do with patrick and will that is kind of a btch move i am totally dissappointed she already had patrick as her boyfriend she refused to be a part of his life but a part of wills life i know patrick doesnt know lous favors but the reason she ditched patrick is ridiculous ,sad
i found the characters and the acting appealing but was appalled by the ending the american and modern mindset of ill do it my way or i wont do it all ends up being a self pitying bromide that trivializes the real courage demanded to live any life at all let alone the life of someone with quadriplegia i personally am ambulatory but i have worked more than 30 years with special needs individuals of all ages shapes and sizes there is not one of them that i would have said geei think the world wouldve been way better without you we are faced daily with things we do not want in our lives please understand that i am not comparing breaking a shoelace or dropping my favorite teapot with an accident that leads one never to be independent in ones own care again but no one is better off without these lives unless you view life as important only when it is convenient and painless which any fool can see is pretty rare i am also not attacking those who decide for whatever reasons to end their own lives but make no mistake it is not dignified it is not better we are given the gift to live our lives whatever lives we have been given the protagonist got one thing absolutely right we have one life one there is only one of each of us one with those odds one out of billions may each of us offer ourselves for others for the entire time we have been given,sad
i thought it will be beautiful romantic movie that glorifies life but at the end euthanasia happens beautiful romantic euthanasia in switzerland cynicallyi wrote this from my point of view i spent 9 months helping people with tetra and paraplegia people that embrace life,sad
this is a a movie mixture of happiness joy  end with sadnessi didnt expect its ending this way bit sad but a complete enjoyable romantic movie ,sad
emilia clarke is magic on the scene and her chemistry with sam clafin is undeniable from the moment you see emilia in the tea house to the last moments in paris it is an amazing performance her quircky ways and sparkling eyes keep you mesmerized what a talent the story centers on a girl who takes a job as a care taker to a man who has been paralyzed from the neck down the journey of the relationship from strangers to people in love is amazing you laugh you cry some people may call this a chick flick but i just call it great cinema it is a must see for anyone who just wants a great movie i have watched it over and over 2 thumbs up and 10 stars in my book,sad
simply amazing words cannot describe how great this film is such a good story line sad to think that things like this happen in our world,sad
i had never read the book that this film is based on and yet it seems i should read the book now,sad
who would have thought there were so many laughs in a tale of someone paralysed from the neck down emilia game of thrones clarke encounters sam hunger games claflin while involved with matthew harry potter lewis in a film which has nothing to do with any of those fantasy franchiseslou is a tea shop waitress in a small rural english town on losing her job she applies to become a carer for will traynor paralysed in an accident she doesnt realise what a moody unpleasant person he is nor does she realise he is determined to commit assisted suicide at dignitas in switzerland but as feelings start to grow between them despite their intentions could it be that will might change his mindto be frank this isnt my sort of film a feeling which was reinforced within the first 10 minutes as lou turned out to be unbearably cute endlessly compassionate towards the quirky old lady patrons of the cafe possessed of an apparently massive wardrobe of unbelievably eccentric clothing and to cap it all convinced that all problems could be solved with a nice cup of tea she was a character drawn from the wacky and loveable young thing box of clichsand sam claflins immobile moody young man was more credible but no different in essence mr rochester on wheelsbut the two of them turned out to have decent chemistry and the film turned out to have far more laughs than i expected so i stuck with it and im glad i did it used humour to soften the edges of what in many ways was a very brutal story despite the late christopher reeves sterling efforts in support of stem cell research there is still currently no coming back from catastrophic spinal cord injuries something which lou does not initially realise and something which lies at the heart of the once athletic wills decisionwhether the burgeoning love between will and lou will be sufficient to overrule his decision is the dramatic focus of the story and i would not want to spoiler the ending but i will say that the circumstances and issues of quadriplegia and assisted suicide are presented unflinchingly and without any moral judgement in either directionthis is an easier more accessible film than whose life is it anyway the only other film im aware of which addresses this issue but it doesnt draw conclusions any more easily than that film didafter being a bit queasily saccharine to start off with emilia clarke settles in to the role and both she and claflin provide an effective emotional heart to the film janet mcteer and charles dance as wills parents are also touching the main location pembroke castle is gorgeous and clarkes wardrobe is deliberately awful there was only one wrong note i felt mild annoyance at the traynor familys wealth the ability to load will onto a private jet and fly off to the caribbean added a glib tone which i would have preferred to have been absent the very end of the film fell into this category toooverall though this addressed a difficult subject in an entertaining and credible way,sad
this movie was heart touching sad and absolutely lovely all at the same time it tells the story of a beautiful romance and a blossoming love this movie has and will be in my heart it has reached out to me to put others first before pleasuring yourself wonderful movie the storyline is absolutely brilliant and amazing,sad
i usually stray away from romances with seemingly heartbreaking endings but after watching i was washed over with so many emotions spoiler alert when will decided to die it broke my heart i cried for 5 straight minutes because my hopelessly romantic heart couldnt take it but after seeing lou seemingly happy in paris i realized will left to escape his pain and regardless they still fell in love and cherished their time together this really is a must see they may not end up married but they still loved each other till wills end after i stopped crying i was happy and content with the ending the movie has wonderful actors an amazing script comedy and romance everything a movie with such emotions needs please check it out its worth the watch,sad
one of the movies you cant get over after one watchportrayed in the best possible way this story could beyou get every reason to judge will for being a meek to opt for euthanasia instead of accepting the way his life was but a lot more reasons not to for this was not the life he planned but he made sure he made clarks life a better one and through this he lived though he died at the end,sad
there were a series of romantic stories where i came from called threeroom dramas ie storylines following living bedroom and dinning rooms so i intentionally avoid watching such movies however this one stroked different tunes i am not against it and actually enjoy itit is a cinderella story which undoubtedly inhabits minds of young girls since the dawn of civilization but in a unconventional way it typically starts with the wealthy handsome young male meeting with a simpleminded fairly good looking struggling female coincidentally of course this white knight with shinning armors had to rescue the supposing cinderella eventually this one is no difference nevertheless this white knight was not with her physically but spiritually in the end also cinderella indeed tried to rescue him instead but failed to prevail the writer did so unorthodoxly instead the version of them getting married and living happily ever after which might be preferred by some audience in my opinion it indeed kept the integrity of cinderella story cleverly  the white knight even in the wheel chair in this movie had to rescue the girl that is the essence of cinderella tale its a warm and enjoyable movie it also slightly touched the base of assistance suicide i am not totally on board with it however we all can put some thought into it,sad
very underrated piece of art right at the beginning one thinks is another stupid and cheesy love story buy thank god i kept on watchingyou would expect from this movie to have one of those repeated and cheesy love ending and its certainly one of those but not in how one would call a standard one what i rescue from this whole movie is how love can be felt and experience differently for all of us and respect for our one decisions is an expression of the deepest sign of love which is respect you really have to watch this movie,sad

the haters of this movie are the ones who are already glued to what they believed in this is a very well made movie so far one of the best of those bittersweet kind of movies i fell in love with emilia and sam that i have to watch it 2 times,sad

an outstanding performance of the cast the story is very touching and heartmelting i would totally recommend watching this movie if you want to travel through the amazing lifetime journey of lou and will this movie is honestly one of the most heartbreaking oneson the other hand includes some hilarious moments that puts the scenes closer to the reality,sad
this movie was beautiful louisa clark takes a job as a caretaker for a suicidal paralyzed man whom she feels compelled to help but as it turned out it was him who actually helped her it was just an amazing film and i watched several times and cry each time i see it im only sorry i didnt see it with someone because you have to talk about this movie after you see it because its so deep,sad
a quality romantic story except the ending an ordinary girl fell in love with a rich handsome paralyzed guy rich guy will had a bad temper from his car accident paralyzed an optimist girl became his home aid the girl always stays happy and positive and did a lot silly things with time the guy was affected by her happiness too they experienced new things from each other started wheelchair adventures they were in love then the story turned into the rich guy wanted a marcy killing the marcy killing was his original plan because he couldnt find his life meaning after paralyzed it is ironic he wanted to die even after he said he is in love againhe didnt want to live because of a paralyzed body he born to be rich grow to be handsome and tall all these appearance gave him the confidence and abilities to play around he cant bear to live as a pitiful paralyzed patient in others eyes he couldnt find his meaning to live even true love cant help i put a quotation marks on true love because i dont think will was really in love with a normal girl he probably just attracted to her energy bodyanyway i dont like this dead end so passive accident always happen but it is difficult to be rich and be loved what a pity,sad
i had to see this movie because you know emilia clarke i gave it a chance and by the end i was crying along with her she is totally adorable i will date and marry her in a second i love everything about her in this movie super convincing i got the pain the sam claflin has and his own personal reasons nobody should decide for him i wouldnt somebody deciding for me i thought i knew how the movie was going to go based on old movies but that didnt matter at the end emilia can act and that is what i expect from an actor,sad
i cannot even believe the bs being written about the subject of this movie it is not about romance or at least that is a very distinct secondary subject not a single synopsis anywhere mentions that the outcome of this grand romance is suicide if i had had any idea of this incredibly blatant baitandswitch i would have never watched it i cannot even believe that people refer to this as a romance wth it is about supreme selfcenteredness playing god a girlfriend with a savior complex parents who ultimately believe that their son killing himself is loving how accepting and downright joyful family and friends are and how absolutely wonderful it all iswhen someone decides to kill themself wth if you want to see whats wrong with our society today then watch this movie but dont believe its cute or funny it is horrid,sad
there are not many things in this world that evoke such conflicting emotions in me yet in this tragedy i find beauty beyond what words could ever say these are the musings of a mad woman after watching this movie there are some things which were a bit rushed in my opinion but i have to say that the ending did it for me had it been the opposite i would have hated the movie,sad
this movie to me was a sad but amazing love story now i have never heard of sam claflin until now but he was great as will traynor in the beginning you see him with his girlfriend in bed then you see him leave its pouring with rain he ends up getting hit by a motorcycle while crossing the road thats obviously how he was paralyzed and ended up in the wheelchair then you get a bit of background on emilia clarkes character louisa clark and how shes hired to take care of him from there they slowly start to warm up to each other and fall in love when she finds out that will has attempted to commit suicide that he wants to die she does everything in her power to change his mind even takes him on vacation with him and his nurse but there is a scene the last night of their vacation this is closer to the end so this is a huge spoiler dont read any further if you have not seen thisshe finds out that shes failed and that all her efforts were pointless she had fallen deeply in love with him by this time he tells her that he still wants to die and nothing will change his mind that he is leaving for switzerland with his parents his intention was to die there she starts to cry calls him selfish and tells him she wishes shed never met him now this was probably the most emotional scene in the movie for me apart from the ending which i wont spoil i had to physically force myself not to cry i really did love this it was beautiful this is the 2nd movie ive seen with emilia clarke i havent seen her in anything else except for this and terminator genisys which i also love now im not sure if the director of this is british or american but wherever hes from he did a great job with this movie and i applaud him for it i hope to see more movies like this in the future i really think emilia clarke should get herself out there more because im not sure that she has done that much but i think shes an amazing actress even though ive only seen her in 2 movies i highly recommend you watch this if you havent yet i give it a 1010 to me it was perfect,sad
i absolutely loved this movie it keeps getting better as it goes along wow this is going to be one of my all time favorite movies i loved everything about this movie the casting the story emilia clarke is stunning captivating and versatile a sweet kind dream of a love story a real love story,sad
having never read the original material its based on i cant say how it holds up against the book however as movie on its own its what you pretty much expect from just having watched the trailers its clichd emotional predictable youre not going to get anything new here the story is beautifully told and theres great chemistry between emilia clarke and sam claflin they both give strong performances despite the cliches if you like romantic dramas then i think this is something you will like,sad
spoilers just in caseit made me cry the boy doesnt get the girl of his dreams and the girl doesnt end up marrying the boy of her dreams sometimes life is like that and it was very refreshing seeing emilia clarke play a quirky fun character,sad
when a critic cant find words to describe a movie thats says a lot im not considering myself even amateur critic so im even more speechlessjojo moyes brilliant script every aspect of the movie is create with perfection there is 1 error tho the shoes of emilia clarke were way too loud in order to hear all the conversation between the parents without getting detected by thememilia clarke good as always that eyebrows man that eyebrows perfect face muscle control she can act every emotion perfectlysam claflin he could be better he need to develop his talent furtheras for support role i give my gold medal to stephen peacocke his acting was without a doubt the best from the support crewjanet mcteer she get my silver medal especially on the scene from the airport when they returned from the vacation brilliant act hands down,sad
i have not read the bestselling romantic novel by english author jojo moyes but i have to assume that the film adaptation of the same name is faithful to the original story since the script was written by the author herself some might regard it as a female movie since as well as a woman scriptwriter we have thea sharrock in her debut role as a film director certainly there are elements of bridgets jones diary and love actually but has a harder edge and a tearful endingit is a very british story in that in it is shot in some quintessentially british locations most notably pembroke castle in wales and it involves class  lou clark played by games of thrones star emilia clark is a young woman from a distinctly working class home with limited knowledge and experience while will traynor sam claflin is from an upper middle class background and has had a stellar business career but unusually it is a story about disability since will is a quadriplegic following a traffic accident and lou is his carer she is reluctant to take on a role for which she has no relevant experience and he is even more reluctant to have someone hired essentially to bath him in her huge smilethe film has been criticised by disability campaign groups for what is claimed to be an unfair and unhelpful position on disability but really moyes is not presenting a moral stance on severe disability in general but one possible outcome in one particular fictional story the stars are very engaging especially clarke in manic pixie dream girl mode and there is humour as well as sadness in a work that i feel deserves to be seen,sad
i remember a few years ago having a discussion with a friend on the bollywood film guzaarish 2010  a film that holds 95 similarities to it his opinion was that a film or a filmmaker to be precise is under no moral obligation to show the right thing the right ending or showing something that matches the common standards of rightness and that a film is just a recording of a story  right or wrong doesnt even come into the picturealthough he did make a very solid and thoughtprovoking point the point remained in my view that this too depends on the gravity of the topic and how sensitive it is and making a film about physically challenged people is a sensitive theme just like rape is i asked him whether hell stick to his otherwise very intellectual point if someone were to make a film about a habitual rapists who and end the film on the note that he goes on to lead a very wonderful life full of happiness he got stuck there and this remained my standard to judge films in short the topic its gravity and sensitivity is all that it depends onso that remains a problem with this film and i can fully understanding the reactions that its getting from physically challenged people and such organisations id still give it seven stars because it was otherwise a very sweet cheerful and funny film i understand one isnt supposed to behave that rudely with anyone but wills witty replies were really hilarious and highly engaging too with its theme revolving around freedom and being yourself being true to yourself despite a bad ending the last scene with louisa walking away with those striped socks was really heartening and again despite that i couldnt help praising the film because it was incredibly sweeti remember i blasted guzaarish back then but the reason for that wasnt only the topic but also the fact that the film was dull and boring beyond words so theres a difference between the twoas a footnote i thought louisas exboyfriend got a harsh treatment he wasnt at fault too much and was neither a bad guy showing him as a the other type of guy couldve actually pressed more on the freedom angle but alright they didnt show something that isnt possible falling in love with another guygirl than your boyfriendgirlfriend it happens whether that is alright or not or whether it qualifies as cheating is a debate for another day and placemost of what ive written in criticism of the film applies to the book too of course that it is based on,sad
is more of a downhill romantic sojourn where you are bound to feel sorry and good at the same time for the protagonists the movie banks on an unvarying jocular theme with witty conversations and gradually budding love all of it tries hard to put romance in perspective however in its blithe tone overlooks a fair chunk of gloom that necessitated a part of vantage that was crucial in nailing the bond between its characterschoice of characters sam claflin fits like a glove into will traynors character and there is nothing that you dont like about his demeanor emilia clarke au contraire beams so much that it sometimes becomes too much her face doesnt look concerned rather oddly in sync with the mirthful theme of the movie it leaves her as a slit open flaw her way too much expressive countenance does create a different character altogether no doubt but it leaves her scampered in a gravitydeficient worldbelies despair and tries to wrap it all in the hilarity of lous life when the truth is a lot more darker meaner and horrible it is good that we dont see the ending upfront from our pedestal the culminating point of the movie is very plausible and thats what tries to help it get back onto the saddle again it avoids hitting those shallow waters againplot of spoilers ahead the novel by jojo moyes finds thea sharrock to define it within boundaries of time though the screenplay is pushed more by humour there is little that it feeds us on depth a mishap leaves will traynor paralyzed that renders him useless in another world lou clark struggles to find a job after her threads cut she lands one by chance as the caretaker of the affluent will what gradually develops from thereon is written in happy feels where she toils hard to bring will back into the world of the living but the pointlessness of it all nibbles at his soul and despite all the good times he gets to live with lou he chooses euthanasiathe score of the movie is abounding with songs aptly put at various intervals but you begin to feel its banality when there are less thoughtful notes sputteredthe final verdicts story remains a gorgeous one nevertheless putting yourself before someone selflessly is worth an ovation the fact that love can happen at unusual places lets us have faith in it thats what counts,sad
i loved this movie  so much so that ive watched it five times so fari am usually very critical of movies but not this one it is a bit formulaic at times but i think the director also shows a great deal of restraint for example will traynors mother and father janet mcteer and charles dance start out as caricatures of british aristocrats  stuffy aloof unfeeling even a bit mean but as the movie progresses you see them more and more as human beings with deep feelings and you see that they love each other and their son very much and that they struggle to do the right thing by their son they are also very kind to louisa and despite the class difference they never betray the kind of snobbery you might expect to see in a less sophisticated treatment there seems to be some criticism of louisa clarke emilia clarke as a bridget jonestype character  kind of silly offbeat chatty and so on i find her utterly charming but then i also find bridget jones utterly charming louisa is a believable character and not one dimensionali love the chemistry between lou and will traynor sam claflin wills transformation is not sudden he actually is intrigued by louisa from the getgo but doesnt realize it  hes too busy putting on his act and being sullen and angry and selfabsorbed  so its only when she snaps at him that he begins to be pulled outside of his emotional bubble its actually shocking for him to see this other side of lou  that shes not rigidly upbeat but is capable of anger  and so this moment triggers the start of a deeper connection i think all the characters are well done and the only character i found a bit cartoonish is the boyfriend patrick matthew lewis its a beautiful movie and i highly recommend it bring lots of tissues and ignore the naysayers,sad
no disclosure of the endingspoiler but just to say i think some people like me will probably have problems with what is the essential underlying message of this film which is what brings my rating down from a 7 or 8 these ratings would be justified purely on the basis of the acting particularly the female lead who easily steals the show while the other main roles are also occupied well too and the gorgeous location filming plus great sound track if you want to enjoy these aspects and view a classic modern weepie without going too much into what the ending of the film seems to me really to imply then this is definitely one you will enjoy,sad
this romantic film pulls all the heartstrings and it is impossible not to respond enthusiastically to the overwhelming charm of the young actress emilia clarke who infuses the entire film with her warmth humour and quirkiness apparently she is well known from game of thrones but that kind of thing is not my scene and i would never watch it so for me this girl is one big delightful surprise the film is a triumphant first feature film by director thea sharrock best known for her affiliations with william shakespeare and the wonderful shakespeares globe theatre in london she certainly has a big cinematic career ahead of her because she has made a film which is so finely directed sensitive and wellbalanced that any producer with a grain of sense must be chasing her now the film is also the first written by as well as based on a novel by a woman quaintly named jojo moyes it is difficult to imagine a man either writing or directing a film like this so we are fortunate that women took over and made the movie even the producers were women well done gals actress janet mcteer is also excellent as usual having now become very much a national treasure and then there is sam claflin his surname claflin being a truncated form of the original mclaughlin abbreviated by a forebear in america where everything gets shortened i have already praised sam claflin before for his brilliant performance as the young logan in the wonderful tv series any human heart 2010 see my review here he is once again brilliant all that talent in someone who can barely move yes claflin plays a man who is paralyzed in all his limbs after he is struck by a motorbike in the street since this is based on a romantic novel it is necessary for claflin to live in a huge castle which he obligingly does and it is equally necessary for emilia clarke to being a cinderella figure which she certainly is with gusto she is hired by claflins mother janet mcteer to look after claflin and try to cheer him up as he sits daily in his electric wheelchair which he can operate with his one hand which has some capability of movement meanwhile he has resolved to go to dignitas in switzerland and end his life by monitored suicide and the question arises as to whether emilia clarke can stop this for she eventually falls in love with him this is where things get difficult for me because a very dear friend of mine went to dignitas and allowed his suicide to be filmed for television he only had two weeks left before his motor neurone disease would render him unable to make the trip having delayed as long as he dared his wife sat beside him while he drank the poison i made a speech at his memorial service these events are very painful and tragedies of this kind are nothing to treat lightly in this film the matter is handled with great sensitivity which was not an easy thing to do i shall not reveal what happens about this in the story because one is not supposed to for imdb also appearing in the film as claflins father is charles dance who is very good as usual i can rarely watch him without wincing slightly at my recollections of his exwife at crickleaze trying to knock me out during her boxing practise in the middle of their drawing room one takes risks sometimes visiting people and trying to be an obliging guest this film too involves some risk for viewers who may need a safe space because of its beautiful sadness but it is a marvellous success and a very fine film indeed,sad
   we were delayed in the bank parking lot so much that we missed the first three previews by a young chick walking slowly in the middle of the road in front of us right next to a perfectly good sidewalk yakking on her cell phone totally oblivious to the extreme danger caused by her solipcistic sociopathic behavior naturally we did not beep her with our car horn since it was impossible to predict whether such a highly warranted caution would elicit a psychotic episode of phone rage on her part perhaps involving her launching herself into our car causing hundreds or thousands in damages by an uninsured pedestrian warner bros has released me to warn america that maybe cell phones were fun while they lasted but they must be outlawed immediately fortunately for us it wasnt raining this afternoon the motorcyclist who gets traumatized and totals his bike in the drizzle against cell phonetoting will trayner as me begins was not so lucky some women may go through a box of kleenex during me but most guys will see through this flick as a case of fifty shades of gimp meets eyebrows writhing like snakes,sad

well i dont have pretty much to say just that hats off well done i got to know about this movie from my teacher at school german school we talk about this theme and she suggest me read the book i didnt got time for the book and today i just found on facebooks page the thriller and said to myself lets look for this movie on google by my surprise i found it online hd and straight away look on it was mesmerizing outstanding couldnt keep my tears to not fall down its really a lesson of life and still cant believe it about the end of this story  i wish was a happy end but like real life sometimes we dont get all painted in rose thank you for this opportunity guys and god bless you,sad
says the truth about life events romantic love movies tend to end with happily ever afters but this movie was far from that saying is a well written tragiclove movie from its characters to the director thea sharrock sam claflin plays the role of william traynor a rich 35 yearold who is paralyzed after an accident years before william decides after another six months he will commit suicide by dignities his newly preppy caregiver louisa clarke played by emilia clarke tries to understand wills wishes to die but instead takes him on a journey to understand lifes worth living for over the period of their sixmonth journey louisa and william fall in love the movie ends with the tragedy of william deciding to die and leaving louisa sad and alone sharrock decided to give the audience the real truth about life we would want to hope for the best and think that there are such things as happily ever afters but truthfully that isnt the case typically in a romantic movie we are left to believe love can conquer all but truly its all false hope many critics would say this movie is terrible from its false hope and the sad ending i beg to differ saying this movie is brilliant in some point in life we must realize happily ever afters arent real thea sharrock presented a great film deserving 5 out of 5 stars for the idea of a romantic movie with the truth of reality,sad
i heard about the controversy about this movie before watching it so i was prepared for death with dignity propaganda i then read what the one star reviewers wrote and they hated the movie because of the message it supposedly conveyed disabled people are miserable depressed and the male protagonist claflins will was selfish who had assisted suicide in a glorified death despite having wealth loving parents and a carerthis movie showed one mans wish to die because of his quadriplegia it showed the life he had before where he was active and a thrill seeker his disability took away his freedom and independence he was also taking a list of drugs for his constant pain and depression and it was also told that he had had four pneumonias in a two year span the last one nearly killed him because of a severely weakened immune system he also tried to kill himselfyet somehow the haters managed to conclude that the director implied that wills misery represents all or most disabled people or that anyone with an illness or disability who commits suicide is selfish this is just one mans story and until critics step into his shoes and experience what he feels they have no right to judge his wish to die its a personal decision and if there is no dignitas then loved ones would possibly have to do it as shown in sister cities where jackie weaver begged one of her daughters to help her die it may have been filmed in colourful scenes made by clarkes louisa whenever she walked into the room or with her clothes but make no mistake will was suffering  there were scenes and dialogues that showed a bleak prognosis throughout the sunny days or lovely snowy nights he may have had material wealth and love but he was trapped in a body that he could no longer controlwhat bothered me about this movie was clarkes acting her eyebrows as some have mentioned were very distracting her acting also seem very limited apart from her ever smiling and goofy eyebrows she struggled to show other emotions especially towards the end where it mattered claflin did a decent job as did everyone else it also felt a little rushed towards the end and some scenes reminded me of bbcs jane eyre the dialogue at the beach was similar to the scene where rochester proposed to eyre under the oak tree the editing was also poor and unnecessaryoverall its a light movie about a controversial subject despite the good acting sans clarke there wasnt much chemistry i sensed that the director didnt want the movie to be grim because of its core topic and she was right to do so because death doesnt have to be awful it is the fear of it that makes people angry and confused especially if its suicide however it could have delved deeper and be a little more courageous rather than playing it safe,sad
thea sharrocks production of is getting mixed reviews but i think that it is by far the best movie of the year and you need to see it is a romance that leaves most viewers in tears but still satisfies the watcher giving them that warm and satisfied feeling the acting by emilia clarke louisa clarke aka lou and sam claflin will traynor louisa is a hard worker who works many different jobs in order to help her family when she loses her job at the local coffee shop she realizes that there is an opportunity for her to become a caretaker for will will is a wealthy young banker who was recently paralyzed wills reaction to having a new caregiver is as expected he doesnt like her and ignores her existence however they begin to bond over little things and the adventures that they took on together as they bond they fall for each other and their chemistry was real and they showing raw emotionsoverall i thought the movie was spectacular the acting was onpoint the plot was perfect the setting was lovely and the soundtrack was amazing i think that everyone needs to see this movie especially if you like romance moviesreleased in june 2016 the dramaromance film directed by thea sharrock shows the audience the life of a paralyzed man who decides his state of living must end as he puts himself over the girl of his dreams,sad
this is not my first choice for cinema type of movie but it was end of the month and had to spend last movie club ticket or losing it i went out shocked about casting because i was used to see him as finnick and she was something like ive seen her before but not sure where wont tell you exactly because she has a great looked change after her previous work specially her colorful role in this movie the story itself its well a known one with some modern notes that brings it close to our reality and i meant it because her boyfriend style of man any similarity with someone you know its on purpose how she reacts to that leaves room for discussion undoubtedly the sister paper is key to her decision making process kind of a fairy role landscape and situations spots are a must have for the story as usual requirement of a love comedy also completely covered the steps of such an illness and character reactions to it technology is also a fundamental key on this part i proudly say i almost cried at some point despite i knew i would and resisted to and thats exactly why i recommend this movie,sad
theyre called wheelchair ramps but you rarely see people doing jumps off themhopefully the paralyzed person in this romance gives it ago after their melancholyyears after a road accident left him wheelchairbound exfinancier will sam claflin continues to suffer from depression over the loss of his former lifestylelou emilia clarke is an unemployed waitress who agrees to become the primary caregiver to the posh playboyalthough her pep and his selfpity dont mix when she learns of his suicide pact she plans to dissuade him by showing him the beauty of life with or without mobilitywhile the leads have enough chemistry to pull of the lovehate angle of this adaptation of the british bestseller it comes off as craven and insensitive when faced with the touchy issue of euthanasia nonetheless its still hard to tell if someones dating a handicapped person just for the parking privileges red lightvidiotreviewsblogspotca,sad
the film was not bad but nor was it anything new it was by the numbers with a script that could just as well have been written in the 60s and at times it felt sothe biggest stars of the film are of course emilia clarkes eyebrows i dare anyone to give me any other reason why they chose to see the movie either it was khaleesi or maybe dr whos companion that drew you to watch it it certainly werent the 5 seconds of screen time that charles dance had and it wasnt the age old story of the poor girl that falls in love with the quadriplegic princewhile the film ends on a bitter sweet note i didnt find it terribly entertaining while the characters had an infantile morality that made me unable to relate to any of them absolutely average in every respect except of course clarkes eyebrows,sad
hey clark he saidtell me something good i stared out of the window at the brightblue swiss sky and i told him a story of two people two people who shouldnt have met and who didnt like each other much when they did but who found they were the only two people in the world who could possibly have understood each other and i told him of the adventures they had the places they had gone and the things i had seen that i had never expected to i conjured for him electric skies and iridescent seas and evenings full of laughter and silly jokes i drew a world for him a world far from a swiss industrial estate a world in which he was still somehow the person he had wanted to be i drew the world he had created for me full of wonder and possibility,sad
when i saw the trailer of i bought the book when the book got delivered i immediately started to read in a few days i finished reading the book and begin searching on the internet when the movie came i was so in love with the story line that i counted the days tonight it was finally the day that i could watch this movie i saw the movie together with my mom and it believe me when i say that it was absolutely beautiful the book is so different from the movie but it was still so good to watch i smiled and laughed during the movie and cried together with my mom like a little baby at the end all i want to say is go and watch this movie because you dont want to miss out on this one,sad
definitely one of the most epic films that ive seen in this gendergreat acting both amusing and touching loved it it makes you see and feel the heroes feelings lets you get into their roles their lives and wonder what would you do if you were them the title of the movie captures in 3 words this impossible love storyyou definitely should go and see  dont miss outits lovely to see emilia play a part of a laughing woman  after her well known acting in game of thronesi dont know what more to write except that i loved it a lot one of my favorite moviesenjoy and go live life to the fullest,sad
many of my friends suggest me watching that film and i feel like wasting my time with it the story gives a good lesson of love dont let somebody force you to be shehe wants you should choose the way you want to live even it very hard to accept i actually dont like any costumes for emilia except for a bee tight and mint glasses a cameraman should be review himself how he destroyed that film by his stupid records like while we need to see how characters feel each other and th viewer only can see their back acting by emilia is not good enough i cant feel the hurt that she should have voice of main male character should be more improved it sucks all moments of love i let this film be in 7 due to the story and the background scenes no for the characters,sad
this is a movie that made me cry almost at the beginning when the protagonists have met the girl is so kind that it makes me think of an angel but there is nothing wrong with it since a movie is supposed to teach us the way we should be and what we dream of instead of who we really are the movies and art in general teach us the best of who we were meant to be in the first place it is a sad movie if we take it from the perspective we are used to look at life but if we are able to get beyond all the happy ever after and understand that life is just a passage in the most truthful way it is supposed to be seen we understand that the very concept of the movie is showing us the best we can do with our lives everything is meant to last just for a while and we should do the best with what we have thats all life is about if there is something after it its just an unexpected prize or incentive but then lets do the best with what we have now tomorrows another day,sad
i went to the movies recently and saw the film based on the novel with the same name by the author jojo moyes it is about the eccentric girl louisa clark who lives in an english village with her working class family after getting fired from the small caf she works in she desperately accepts employment as a caretaker of the paralyzed young man will traynor he is a wealthy ex business man who got paralyzed when he got hit by a motorcycle will is bitter and unpleasant towards everything and everyone around him is directed by the relatively unknown thea sharrock and this is her first feature film emilia clarke known from game of thrones plays louisa and sam claflin mostly known from the hunger games series portrays the paralyzed willfirst i want to say that is really a british film working class meet upper class they clash and break down social barriers i also think that louisa is a pretty typical british film girl she wears extremely colorful clothes is constantly happy a bit weird and often quite oblivious to the serious situations around her when she meets will it is at first very tense he mostly ignores her and she desperately wants to get out of there they of course soon become attracted to each other because they really are each others opposites she is fascinated by his world his personally and also in my opinion a bit by his disability she in turn for him becomes a happy clumsy and carefree girl like no one he ever met before in his organized and sterile worldthe director thea sharrock relies very much on closeups and reaction shots this is good and sometimes not so good too much closeups on a face can easily remove the body language and also make us interpret every single facial expression as something very important sometimes we stay to long on louisas face her smile and her tilted gaze always seems to want to say something and i wonder if that really is what they were aiming for however they succeed very well in a certain face shaving scene i consider as one of the best ones in the filmis a very heavy film and touches a very sensitive subject that shall remain unknown because it is a major spoiler i do think that the filmmakers take this too lightly and offer a very simple answer that in reality should be a lot more complicated also the film doesnt go all the way and actually chicken out during what i believe was a very defining moment a bit weak actually but the film and especially the author should have credit for daring to speak about it the overall impression is that they actually manage to finish the film in the way they planned our entire emotional register is played out during these barely two hours we laugh we get angry confused and we cry not a dry eye in the theater but for me to become more involved and drawn to the story it would require more focus on the sensitive subject offer no direct answers ask us the audience questions and let us sit by the end of the film with our heads filled with thoughts that would according to me have given the film more depth also the clichs and the music would have to be toned down the music was at times very bombastic and tiresomedavid lindahl  wwwfilmografense,sad
that was a amazing movie a men who got paralyzed in a accident and he is totally paralyzed his legs not working hands not working only he can move head and speak and some finger still working so he wants dead and he gives six month time to his patents if they can change his mind so they hire a take care a good girl who try to change his mind she try all ways and falling love with him but he doesnt change his decision well how can he change when nothing he have left to live body is very important and when you are a big traveler the men was i just hoping the girl can make him unparalyzed with her love but that is old type story this is new specially that dead in last girl quit that job but in last day she came and just thats it after few week ago she in peris that men too fall love with her so she gives his will to her and just want she lives a better life amazing movie,sad
this was my first time ever to have seen emila clarke in a film i still have to see game of thrones because she is such a brilliant actress also it was good to have seen janet mcteer watched the songcatcher recently matthew lewis harry potter and jenna coleman doctor who you wouldnt suspect such a underrated cast like them would be appearing in this but it was a great to know it actually happened anyways onto the movie it was very good and no i didnt cry as i thought i wouldi liked clarkes and sam claflins chemistry throughout the movie although i wouldve rather if they made clarkes character more sympathetic when claflins character announced he wants to die legally to switzerland as he doesnt want to spend the rest of his life being sick and handicapped i felt they gave clarkes character too over the top she shouldve been acting more caller its not emila clarkes fault but the way the character was developed was a little bit ridiculous to be honestthats just only my criticism to this movie but other than that it is really flattering to watch and even though its sad it gives you that feeling of hoping for the best with your own loved ones thats how ive seen it but other people may have a different opinion when they do get a chance to look at it i give this movie a 810 because of its good actors story line the settings and of course giving you a great amount of emotions,sad
the story that jojo moyes produced is certainly a unique one i appreciated how truly realistic the situation was that unfortunate things happen and not every love story is a fairy talewhat i mostly enjoyed was how the love story between louisa and will took a backseat to their developing friendship and the hardships everyone had gone through within those six months the relationships that lou has with the other characters are also relatablei had binged the book before watching the movie which now that i think about it i probably shouldnt have im one of those people that want to read the book first before watching movies anyway much like many book adaptations huge chunks of the book were not included in the final cut knowing there were more indepth scenes that would have further developed some of the characters took a little of the wonder from me id gone from viewer to criticthe buildup to the climax wasnt as dramatic or smooth like in the book admittedly there were many tears shed however in the end i felt that although both book and movie were executed beautifully in their own ways was really too overhyped,sad
is it just me or are we all sick of the rich handsome guy always wooing the girl with his wily charms his full head of hair and an allowance that exceeds most peoples rent granted in the case of the man in question is will traynor claflin a quadriplegic with a death wish if the movie was in the hands of people who actually knew a thing or two beyond weepy romantic tropes and clichs they could have come up with something worthwhile unfortunately makers of this film seem to think that simply replacing hugh grant with a younger faster model and reciting the hackneyed romantic dramedy formula for the umpteenth time makes for a unique experience ummnopethe film takes place in a quaint little country town in england and concerns the life louisa clark clarke shes a bit of a flake but amiable enough to follow around for two hours thus when shes left unemployed we feel her exhilaration when she manages to stumble into a job as a professional caretaker she then meets will the local blueblood who after a tragic accident is in no mood for friends and family let alone a person whos pretty much hired to be his friend oh yeah will also has a nurse peacocke thus guaranteeing that the messy realities of having to take care of a severely handicapped person is left off screen after the first halfhour to fortyfive minutes the pair grow acquainted all while the audience sits patiently waiting for the actual plot to kick inwhen it finally does kick in the story devolves from being harmlessly predictably enjoyable to being a contrived traveloguebucket list that feels less tethered to the story than an attempt by director thea sharrock to visit exotic locales the message of the film live boldly and follow your dreams are laudable ideas thus the film repeats them either visually or comes right out and says them again and again just in case you missed them personally i found such lofty ambitions a little hard to swallow coming from a man who inherited a private jet meanwhile the personification of those same ideas the obligatory rival played by matthew lewis is the dimwitted pack animal to the storys muleskinnerfor their efforts both sam claflin and emilia clarke do a good job filling their roles as lovebird 1 and lovebird 2 clarke especially has a certain way about her that can emit pure giddiness without trying too hard too bad her character is stripped for parts by the story and deprived of her very agency and character growth by virtue of an expense account if anything is confirmation that the young ingnue can have a successful career beyond game of thrones 2011presentfor the sake of filling seats claflin does well based solely on the power of his chiseled cleft chin and naturally toned physique hes the dreamboat genre fans have been clamoring for ever since dylan mcdermott and patrick dempsey became too old to play leading men but lest you think his casting decision is a shallow attempt to placate fans while undercutting the characters handicap he does sport a beard and a nasty flop sweat on more than one occasion to insure he doesnt always look like supermanno matter how you slice it is a predictable and boring film that wears its cutesiness like a badge of honor in the hopes that no one notices our leading lady doesnt evolve and our leading man doesnt know how good hes got it it adheres to an old formula with little regard for changing tastes and its one attempt at uniqueness is treated more like a plot device than a genuine attempt at characterization if thats what youre looking for in a movie take a stab at frankly i think it should have been titled me bore you,sad

castle context is not used adequately just as a quick surf of the frame on the screen i wish lou lust strayed into the castle to feel the loneliness in wills heart because obviously the castle and my soul has many similarities the empty broken lifeless  snowfall it has to be closed when wills heart when snow falls i longed so much to be hugged strangle lou will rather than talking to will but nothing more when spring returned his mood had changed why do not i see a flower blooming in the garden now i find it wasteful context there really is a waste of context or because the authors want to advocating the right to die im not saying that this right is wrong to mention i want to talk about the other end do not regret viewers lou as cinderella meets the prince to the castle she did not need to leave any glass shoe can still see him what a pity when she had lovers  and she was not patrick soon realized that the two were incompatible when nathan told her about wills condition on the night he suffered in pain she did not seem to mind worthy point she needs to have a night with him overcome the pain if she wanted him to continue living she helped him to see that he still can participate in activities before such as listening to concerts to a party watching horse racing to a sea  this is wrong worth reason she should give him clear his life was changed from 2 years ago and he has many new choices will love with lou but he loved her enough to keep her life together i wish his fingers stroked chances of her hair her face i have not read the novel so when green leaves fall from the branches i wanted to cry before this time i still think there will be a good end do you think like me will i not object to the choice of death i respect but if im lou im going to paris alone follow the instructions of the will then ill jump into the seine ,sad

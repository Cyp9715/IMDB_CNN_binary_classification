having watched so many korean movies and dramas that end with someone having a terminal illness autumn in my heart im sorry i love you remember those i thought id discovered all the tearjerker tricks nothing however could have prepared me for this one unlike the previous deals the illness doesnt so much kill you physically as it does mentally and trust me that is much much worse first of all id like to commend the screenwriter for hitting the right spot with the first half i thought the history between the couple is presented really well i dont know why some people think its too fastpaced cos it is possible for people to fall in love and get married in that amount of time and i thought the use of elliptical editing was just right not so excessive that you feel like youre seeing a trailer the second half is the one that i think felt a little bit rushed but the story is so mesmerizing that honestly you dont really care and cheolsoo is one heck of a husband i dont know if id ever be able to do what he did and let me warn you girls that guys like cheolsoo exist only in movies and i didnt think the ending was ambiguous more like openended the last scene is guaranteed to make you shed buckets the cinematography is beautiful as others have mentioned they did a lot of closeups with both characters in the same frame which i think is really endearing and also panoramic shots of the land where they wanted to build their house which were beautiful my favorite thing however is the soundtrack the spanish songs are right on target but my absolute favorite is when they played nessun dorma from turandot my favorite aria of all time during the wedding scene i cried and it wasnt even the sad part yet all and all fabulous fabulous movie 1010,sad
im not the kind of guy who likes a romance movie very often to be honest there have been only a few movies before this in the genre which i thought were great enter a moment to remember unofficial english title which swept me away with its amazing characters decent story and tear jerking tragedy romance though the film is definitely has a lot of commercial elements to it it still has a certain charm that is lacking in todays hollywood films the story may be simple but its the direction that is well done and sets the pace nicely i also loved the musical score in the movie which was very well done especially during the last scene when its about to endsimply an amazing movie though not perfect is right up there in my top movie list in this genre a solid 910,sad
this is another great production from korea korea have really made a name for themselves producing love stories just like a moment to remember son ye jin absolutely suited the role which was to be played and so did jung sung woo at the beginning he was seen as an arrogant man with little feelings and yet the way son ye jin taught him the way to love and treasure life was so touching until tragedy struck for her it was a great movie it was love at its highest level i would recommend this movie to anyone in this world even to those who dislike draggy love movies this movie teaches a lot about treasuring your loved ones before its too late an absolutely great production i love this movie watch it,sad
i always find myself wondering why during movies people cry when no one has died or been hurt i think its idiotic and ridiculous that there is all this tear shed over a scene or scenes that are either just melodramatic or plain stupid well last night i became one of those idiots there was nothing melodramatic or stupid about this movie i cant ever remember crying so much while watching and after a movie my mom thought that my boyfriend had broken up with me i was blubbering so muchi believe i shed a few forced tears after the notebook but i think that might have been because i didnt want to seem like a heartless jerk for not showing enough emotion during a movie everyone else had cried at this story is nothing like the notebook albeit the prescribed disease was the same the acting was phenomenal and the storyhang it up mister youll never find another story so simple and yet with so much emotion behind it a simple cup of rice had me bawling in my bed because of the premise behind it it represented a huge turning point for both of the charactersthe ending got me most three simple words never sounded so beautiful a moment to remember will definitely be recommended to my friends and family,sad
a moment to remember is one of just a handful of movies that made tears come down my face life death happiness grief come together in a magnificent production with brilliant acting especially by woosung jung splendid cinematography and a wonderful soundtrack some criticism might be levied against the film for it taking some liberties with reality but ill leave those for the nitpickers to gaggle over as with any foreign film there are small things that fill out the film for those familiar with the culture and language this film was wonderful not only on its merits as a film but also as a reflection of korean culture excellent film  mosthighly recommended,sad
i stumbled upon this movie a few weeks ago and as i love korean horror movies i said what the hell lets see what they can make in a romantic movieand i was amazedi can honestly say that this may be the best romantic movie i have ever seen in my life great plot great ending not to mention the actingwoosung jung is absolutely brilliant i cry every time i see the movie and trust me ive seen it several times even my boyfriend was full of tears when the movie ended and he never cried to a movie before all in all i recommend this movie wholeheartedly it makes u think about how short life is and for those who compare it with a walk to rememberall i can say is shut up its waaaay better then that stupid movie,sad
i always used to think that love is a stuckup bitch that bites you in the ass when you least expect it this movie made me go back on that belief and think about it twice before going out in a blaze of glory thinking the worst this one is a real tear jerker by the gallon goes to show that koreans are far better than indians in my opinion in the gender i dont usually shed tears when watching a love story but this movie can lighten and bring down on its knees even the most ruthless cold hearted insensitive soul i watched this movie last night and i was tremendously impressed with the story mainly because it is one of those rare stories where something like this can happen i mean alzheimer come on its pretty damn serious and its one thing when you have no one to care about you and another when due to the illness lives of your loved ones are practically ruined i watched the notebook prior to watching a moment to remember in the same day but the effect that the notebook had vs this movie pales a moment to remember will make you cry big time no matter how much you try opposing it no matter how macho and insensitive you think you are you will cry guaranteed if you dont believe a word im saying or if you think this is bs watch the movie and when you get to the middle and the beginning of the second half and throughout the end you will see my pointthe story is well developed not too slow and not too fast the perfect pace for such a dramatic film no plot holes at all and excellent acting which shows the actors took heartedly to the story its the kind of story that makes you feel sorry for one of the main character and the kind of fate that you would never wish upon anyone because it is irreversible instead of having alzheimer wed all be better off dead no matter how much our loved ones suffer its you you have to think of first in such a given situation and not them no matter how selfish it may or may not seem peace all  and enjoy this wonderful piece of cinematography,sad
what can i say its one of my favorite movies it has everything love romance action sorrow and happiness hero  heroine of this film have wonderful chemistry together and it shows it makes you feel like you want to become a better person and not be so selfish selfcentered and makes you realize that there more important things in life this movie is so indescribable and uniquei have seen it many times i will admit that i am a hopeless romantic and i love to watch these types of movies i think that it is so romantic and so beautiful and i think that the movie was made very well,sad
the best movie i have ever seenhands down one can easily connect to the story for it is so natural and you are bound to cry at times the main credit goes to the actors son ye jin was ecstatic as su jin she has a very cute and innocent face that she perfectly fits into the character the director has made a smart move by selecting her to portray the character that was cute at the initial stages and required some serious acting skills towards the end son ye jin has given more than her 100 per cent to get into the skin of the character the scene where she asks jung woo sung to reunite with his mother and he refuses she did a fabulous job the scene where she knows the truth about her disease and asks her jung woo sung if he wants to have a baby she was simply amazing both these scenes are completely contrasting the former is an emotional scene and the latter is something which is really hard to describe as it consists of mixed emotions she came out with flying colors in these both scenes these are a testimony to her acting prowessjung woo sung was good as well he did a great job by portraying himself as a rough carpenter and he fits the bill the most important thing that needs to be mentioned here is the chemistry between the two actors it was out of the world they seemed like real life pair and in each every scene it was like we are seeing a pair next door the director also needs a special mention as he did an amazing job by working on the screenplay and the chemistry between the actors with a script that has nothing new in the store hats off to him even the background score was good the camera work was mind blowing subtle and simple especially in close up shotsthe guy has got some serious talenton the whole it is movie worth watching which is like an oasis in a desert of meaningless movies,sad
beautiful son yae jin the classic and handsome jung woo sung musa  the warrior mutt boy share a moment to remember sujin son yae jin and cholsu jung woo sung meet under seemingly average normal circumstances sujin is exiting an affair with a married man and cholsu is working for sujins father as a carpenter and when they finally meet its as if it was meant to be their love is affectionate and their marriage as close to perfect as can bebut is fate truly that kind sujin surprisingly contracts alzheimers disease and the tragic struggle they face both threatens and strengthens their love but for how long as sujins memory begins to leaves her the disease they face may turn out to be too much for even a love as strong as theirs a moment to remember is the latest representative of koreas stunningly popular tragic drama genre and features two of the regions brightest stars son yae jin shines as the tragically afflicted sujin and jung woo sung brings photogenic cool to the role of the supportive and loving cholsu this 2dvd set of a moment to remember comes with various extras including filmmaker commentary and a directors cut that restores nearly 30 minutes of extra footage,sad
i love this movie so muchi dont know how many times i cried in the climax i think that the most sad scene is when sujin writes a letter to cheolsu and she apologizes about her mistakespoor cheolsu when sujin forget his name and calls him in her exboyfriends name i like cheolsu character because he is kind and not abandons but help sujin about her alzheimers deceasethere are similar korean movies or novels like this one the main cast get alzheimer or someone die of decease or die of traffic accident but i like all of thempure love is best one,sad
the reasons ive decided to write a review for this movie is not only because it is one of my favorite movies but because i would like to point out the fact that its not just a tearjerkerthe plot is quite simple a man and a woman who are married and the woman has a very rare case of the alzheimers disease hence you know she will be dying since there still isnt any cure for this disease and the movie was shot in 2004the events which occur in the movie could be misleading in the sense that they could leave you with the feeling that its just another very sad and emotional korean dramatic movie with beautiful moments and captures and a heartbreaking ending and while those events capture our hearts we forget that the main issue that this movie is trying to display is the problems of the alzheimers diseasealzheimers disease is exactly the title of the film an eraser in my head you cant do anything against it you can just slow it down your memories will eventually all disappear from the most recent memories to the oldest ones you lose all knowledge all identity until you are nothing inside anymore and the worst part of it is that you dont even know whats happening to you so even if it awakens old wounds that hurt you youll be healed the next day since you would have already forgotten about what was left in your mind the previous daythe movie focuses on a 28yearold woman who bears a very rare case of the alzheimers disease which runs in her family it shows how much it is painful for the people who are close to her to accept the fact that she is gradually forgetting about them about her life about everything not only is she losing her own identity without even realizing it but they are losing their identity towards her the situation is cruel because shes so young but it wouldve been the same with a cast of 60yearold peoplethe movie is so realistic because it shows how much the people around her are hurting and they cant even blame it on her since it isnt her fault and thats the underlying problem of alzheimers diseaseso yes its a sweet beautiful and heartbreaking movie but for the people who are actually in the same situation it points out that you should keep faith in the person who is sick that if they forget about you its not because they didnt care about you but because they cant help it and it can get really hard for the people who are close to the person who bears the diseasei believe thats the most important message we can get out of this movie it is truly a mustsee,sad
first of all i would like to mention that im a 19 years old mediumtough boy and i last cried like this when i released our grown up domestic rabbits in the forest with my mum a decade agoif you are already reading this and you havent seen this movie yet watch it as soon as possible because if youre a human being it is worth it what is more a real must watch although make sure you have at least one roll of toilet paper or a lot of tissues plus some water in case of dehydrationnow lets be serious this movie is not just about love how beautiful or sad it can be the movie itself is a highway to heaven and hell at the same time true love with true agony however you will not cry as much as i did if you dont understand the deeper meanings you may notice some kind of existential nihilism in it the very very sad possibility that the life we know is pointless to us which can actually be true if we dare to change our point of view to a more uncomfortable onethe actors and actresses the scenery the music the story the direction the ending are beyond perfect every minute of this movie is wellspent thats itin the first part you will laugh many times then dont worry whatever your ideas about the movie were before the story will absorb you and you wont be able to control your feelings you are gonna find yourself howling and giggling in the same timeso all in all this movie is among the bestit may have actually taken place in the top 5 in my top list i have to fight down the stress first to decide objectively,sad
cheolsue woosung jung is a carpenter sujinnyejinn son is cheolsues bosss daughter they got married and lived happily but sujinn became alzheimers since then their life became breakingthis is a korean movie i like korean movie because its expression is straight and easy to understand i cried to see this movie if i were cheolsue i couldt help going mad i think the pain of forgetting dearest is so strong and i do not want to lose memories that i spent with dearestfamilyfriends i came to think of happiness of health this movie make people think about alzheimers please see this movie and think about alzheimers,sad
this movie 1made me create the an account here for speaking out my mind which i couldnt resist 2made my eyes water so much and ive not still recovered the hang from this movie even after 1 week of watching it as i write this review the only other movie which had such an effect on me was schindlers listfirst id love to say that the casting couldnt be more perfect the chemistry between the actors are so perfect yejin son you just cant get enough of the aura she lets out with her smile a childlike innocencenot to be confused with childishness is a quality anyone will notice in her which makes this movie more closer to your heartthe movie really makes you think how devastating it would have been for people who had to undergo such situations in life the point to be noted is that its not the patient but the loved ones who are affected more i loved every moment of the movie to the core still i have 3 moments which still keeps hitting back on me 1 the scenes in 2nd half where the yejin son suddenly gets back her memory and feels so sorry for forgetting her husband and writing a note to him explaining how much she loves him the dialogue script in that scenes is so perfect and it really made my heart race 2 to the end woosung finds yejin son in a carehome when he comes close to her the camera focuses onto a few sheets of paper on which she is trying to draw a picture of her husbands face from her fading memory sadly not recognizing that the person standing in front of her is the person she is trying to draw 3 to the end woosung recreates the situation by which they met trying to help yejin son recall her memoryfabulous movie i have no words sorry for letting out such a verbose note,sad
a japanese friend told me one of her favorite korean movies title was eraser something in the headlater she emails me with the english title a moment to remember just finished seeing the moviealthough it was made 6 years ago many aspects of this movie feels fresh and beautifuli will confess that i indeed criedfor the first time in a long long timethis movie is now two of my favorite korean movie other one is my sassy girl,sad
this review is based on the directors cut of a moment to remember so i am not sure how different this may be from the theatrical release however this is by far the best dramaromance i have seen in recent years the concept story and script are original subtle and very thought provokingthe cast is superb lead by a devastating performance by leads sohn jejin and jung woosung who capture the extreme emotional ranges of their characters amazinglydirector john h lee has certainly got a lot of talent every shot in this film is beautiful and rich the cinematography is great this visual flair which is unusual for a romance film enables the viewer to easily get absorbed into the filmit takes a lot to get an emotional response from me but this film sure did if you are looking for a great romantic drama that is uplifting and heartbreaking in equal measures then this is the film for you,sad
a moment to remember provides the mature viewer a perspective of how sad a relationship can become especially in trying times and how love can become stronger between couples in times of illness and sufferingit is a story a young 27yearold young woman named sujinwho is diagnosed with alzheimers disease after marrying a carpenter who works for her fathers company familial alzheimers is extremely rare and may occur among those aged 3060 years but as the name implies it is hereditary and although the youngest documented case was 28 years old in a moment to remember to have come down with this form of dementia at the tender age of 27 is about as likely as her ceo father allowing her to marry a carpenterwhile both lateonset and familial ad are progressive illnesses that may last for up to 20 years or so slowly developing from simple forgetfulness and mild depression to fullblown loss of recognition and almost complete dependence on others for all daily tasks familial ad may also progress very quickly with sufferers dying within a year so it looks like sujin may just be one of the unluckiest people in the worldthis movie features two of the regions brightest young stars led by the popular and attractive korean actress superstarson yejin as the young woman and the equally popular jeong woosung as the carpenter the film is built on the premise that it is possible for someone so young to become stricken with an old persons disease both share great chemistry in this film overalli consider a moment to rememberthe classic and my sassy girl as the best korean movies out of the more than a hundred that i have ever seen so farthis is definitely the bestno doubt about it,sad
my grandpa suffered from alzheimers before his passing and the symptom shown in the movie is similar to his the letter scene absolutely broke my heart the girl loved her man so much however she decided to leave because of her guilt the ending is bittersweet because it was the first time the man said i love you but he realised it is possibly the last time the girl would remember hence probably the reason he did not look too excited when she hugged him a must watch indeed,sad
i first saw this movie almost 10 years agotoday was a rainy kinda lazy day so i decided to watch it again honestly ive rewatched this movie more than 5 times as always an eraser in my head makes me bawl like a baby and grab my chest just like one of the scences with the husband jung woosung that is how perfect his performance is you feel what he feelsthe anguish the fear the hopelessness the anger the denial the despairbut mostly you feel the pure genuine allgiving love also son yejin wow wow wow how se manages to portray the transition and development of her character is truly perfection she even makes you feel that she is someone close to you that is why ive seen this movie so many timesbecause no matter how many times i see the same heartbreaking or endearing scene it still makes me feel the same way anyway the story is so touching and the chemistry between them feels so real you cant help but cry for them and because of them its true that the movie can feel lengthy but there are so many beautiful shots of the scenery plus the soundtrack exquisite makes you wanna capture every scene finally the essence of this movie lies in all of the small details there are scenes in which something very subtle like a gesture a quote a conversation either teaches you something about life or makes you realize the true power of a deep genuine love yep went there cheesy af i know ps i guarantee thiseven if you are a coldhearted human with no empathy or ability to feel emotions this movie will touch your black heart so hard that it will make you cry,sad
i am korean and admit that i do not like the movies that do in my native country but this time takes me a surprise everything points to be one of the deepest movies that i have seen and i am not a critic without essentials the direction is very well the script is excellent and the performance is outstanding i cannot believe that there being so simple romantic coarse and awkward movies as  lost in translation  this movie so notable does not find gained awards regrettably here we have a clear example of the weight of the massive mass media i believe that this tells that although the time should happen the movies do not improve only i can say to them that they should look to believe,sad
all i want to say is that this is the very first movie as far as i can recall that makes my eyes full of tear i mean thatboth main actors did a really good job in carrying through the film one criticism to son ye jin is that even though in the last part of the movie shes suffering from alzheimers disease she still wears lady shoes and has nice clothings rather than decent hospital ones if this asian film could have changed some minor imperfections it could have won more awards than it has so sad that people likes cheap drama like full house and rainbi and song hye gyo won many awards for that while son ye jin and the actor in this movie  i dont remember his name though doesnt seem to be recognized by any award,sad
do we lose our souls when we lose our memories  this saying was what effected me and i thought about it till the end of the movie as it is told in the wedding ceremonies in the good and bad days  this movie shows that jung woo sung loves so yejin so much that he tries everything to help her when she got ill and she lefts him one day for fear of forgetting him what made me cry while watching is that so yejin says  am i in heaven   when she went to the place that they first met and remembered some thingsthis movies shows that one should never give up and should do hisher best for the special one,sad
i cant say anything in this movie except one thing amazing amazing acting specially woosung jung amazing cinematography amazing script most of the line are unforgettable amazing casts in short amazing story super heavy drama you should watch it it is one of a kind movie i cant help myself from crying i cant imagine how cruel this story in real life i hate myself for watching it just now i will surely recommend this movie to my friends i really love woosung jung a brilliant actor i will not forget the day i watched it because it is the day i realized how to love someone in all hisher complications and the day i realized how to be happy in a cruel life,sad
one of the good dramas i have seen  good controlled performance and some good story narration even though it looks a bit dragged sometimesi felt that the story between the mother and son can be cut short or even be avoided ah when it comes to memory i have seen this movie a month ago  but i still remember many scenes from the movie john  h  lee did a good directing job i am disappointed to see there are only two movies from him the father and daughter relationship is also handled in a bit touchy way even though there are only a few scenes the scene where the fatherinlaw tells the guy carpenter only looks after the texture not the material is also a bit touchy i would rate in 8 out of 10,sad
this is not excellent it shares common idea of all love story korean films main actoractress would get a serious disease then die other actorsactresses would cry and the film endsthis is just a tedious script but im not able to count how many korean films have been produced base on this scriptacting is not really good since therere many crying if john hlee could make something different than tears that would be additional point to my voteif youre boring with these kinds of love story film dont watch it unless you have nothing to watch,sad
so im the type of girl that rarely watches movies to do with romance and also i prefer comedy something that will make me laugh throughout a movie im only 16 so why should i get sad over love what do i understand about itanyways i decided that maybe i should watch a sad romance for once so i watched  a moment to remember and the name of this movie is so strong and i realised how it relates to the movie so much as always the first parts of movies dont really get to you that much and nothing serious really tends to happen however as i got to the middle i started getting feels for what was going on in the movie and honestly by the end of this movie i wasnt even shedding tears i was practically crying a river water poured out of my eyes after every scene that i watched this is a very intense movie and it changes my perception and opinions on love after watching the movie i watch it again and again the soundtrack and music used in this movie really has an impact on you every day i walk through life blinded and clueless of things that could potentially happen to my loved ones to be specific this movie has allowed me to cherish the love i have for my boyfriend quite a lot just knowing that anything could arise and the fact that life can be very cruel no matter how much you can love each other i listen to the sad music that was played in the movie and its inspired me so much that ive even learned how to play it on piano because it gives me the feels its opened my eyes up so much and this is true life how her husband appeared to be this arrogant and insensitive guy to actually trying to not give up on his wife and loving her regardless of her health most guys out there probably wouldnt handle the situation and would leave so this really shows me how love can be so pure and a beautiful thing its just very intense when it all goes wrong also i love how the end and start relate to each other she met him because she was forgetful and shes left him because shes forgetful but anyone who is thinking about watching this i would say you will definitely cry especially if youre sensitive 1010 rating i love this movie and its my favourite ,sad
a moment to remember is a life changer it is the first korean movie i have looked at once you have seen this you can never stop looking for korean movies it is so different than all the occidental stuff we are used to this movie is even more special than all the movies that i have seen since it is a master peace you can look at every detail of it and it is still perfect the music variated and touching the acting is amazing and credible you are in their world in a matter of minutes the photography astonishing it is colorful finally the story is so touching stirring moving you cant even believe that a movie can be so happy and sad at the same time,sad
traveling to the cinema in south korea must be one of the single most excruciating pastimes when one considers the emotional features their country is known for producing  imagine 200 south koreans sitting in a room with a massive screen bawling their eyes out as the most melodramatic material plays out before them a moment to remember is beautifully representative of this and though some have previously criticized the feature as resembling the notebook not only is the film vastly different it is also superiorbased upon the japanese tv program pure soul the feature opens immediately with sujin son yejin a young woman who experiences forgetfulness on a daily basis as she later admits it was her poor memory that led her to meet cheolsu jung wusung who she later has difficulty placing when she happens to bump into him once again ms yejin is absolutely phenomenal in this role the desperation and tearfulness she articulates while trying to remember something coupled with the blankness in her eyes when a memory has completely been erased making for a truly heartbreaking experience this is furthered by the performance of mr wusung both of the leads having superb onscreen chemistry that brings the gorgeousness and the agony of their relationship to lifethe visuals from the lavish openness of the natural environment cheolsu intends to build their dream home upon to the hominess of their residence is sublime at capturing the affectionate beauty of the world that exists around the characters the costumes brilliantly suit the leads as well both in their occupations and their personal lives but it is the attire they wear to their wedding that is easily the most glamorous capturing the romantic atmosphere of this touching momentalthough sujins memory deteriorates over time rather than the tragedy been an instant occurrence we the audience helplessly and painlessly watch as the gorgeous couple begin to experience the unforgivable pain that comes between them their love and their memories though cheolsus determination to remain by sujins side is possibly the most painfully beautiful occurrence of all it should already be colossally obvious that this feature is bound to cause some tears the later stages of the feature especially requiring tissuesoriginally loathed by some of her coworkers for instigating a relationship with a fellow individual in their department seo youngmin baek jonghak a married man prior to the commencement of the films storyline as sujins memory begins to fracture and seo ventures back into her life desperate to rekindle their affair sujin begins exhibiting difficulty attempting to differentiate the past from the presentthough sujin later stipulates how cheolsu never vocally admitted his love for her the tears he sheds after admitting he couldnt cry no more after experiencing a painful upbringing brilliantly visualizes the agony he suffers each time he looks at the woman he loves only to have her look at him like a stranger the performances by the other cast members assist in further drawing the viewer into the world of the characters and though the doctor who discovers sujins condition d lee kwon byunggil is blunt and unforgiving in his description of her mental affliction he captures the unsympathetic realism that so many doctors demonstrate in realitythe script which accentuates the dramatic elements alongside using occasional humor is delightful and the soundtrack that is designed to help the audience comprehend the feelings taking place during the accompanying moments is equally excellent occasionally cute touching sad but always honest in its depictions a moment to remember is not a film that can be watched  it has to be for it is dramatic excellence at its finest,sad
what can i saythis is just awesome one thing i can say about these korean moviesthey portray emotions and feelings so well as no one else canthe love and emotions in this movie are really touching there are some smallsmall scene where you really feel touched and the scene where she asked him to play grift and he put all the ace card so that she would not loose was great the movie is about a couple who fell in love get married and the girl has a disease called alzheimers and how they tackle with this diseasei will recommend you to watch this movie and please be ready with handful of tissue paper or handkerchief this movie will make you cry,sad
i watched this movie a long time ago without any subtitles this movie stills make me cry specially that scene when that girl pee in front of everyone its the kind of story that makes you feel sorry and the kind of fate that you would never wish upon your love because it is irreversible instead of having alzheimer wed all be better off dead no matter how much our loved ones suffer its you you have to think of first in such a given situation and not them no matter how selfish it may or may not seem their love is affectionate and their marriage as close to perfect as can bebut is fate truly that kind sujin surprisingly contracts alzheimers disease and the tragic struggle they face both threatens and strengthens their love but for how long as su jins memory begins to leaves her the disease they face may turn out to be too much for even a love as strong as theirs a moment to remember is the latest representative of koreas stunningly popular tragic drama genre and features two of the regions brightest stars,sad
a master piecemost romantic film ever made cried like a babyplus points screen play  lead actors performances  background music  cinematography  romantic scenesminus some drawback scenes in betweenthe main plot of the movie is a love story between a couplethe story starts with the flash back episode of cheolsu and sujin describing how they fall in love besides the previous affair of sujin and a bad childhood to cheolsuand the story continues with some good performances and scripti cant reveal the rest of the storywell i think no one should miss this movie must watch,sad
one of my friend recommended this movie    i did not watch it for some time fearing that i may not enjoy it much as i will be watching it with subtitles but when i did watch i was totally engrossed in the movie the movie felt a bit lengthy as i was watching the directors cut but nonetheless it was surely worth it the female protagonist was very charming and the chemistry between the lead actor and actress was palpable i hardly understood a word of what was being said and without the subtitles it should have been just pure unadulterated noise but because of the brilliant performance on display in more scenes than one i realized a rare sensation of moisture hovering above my lower eye lid thus though i am very well accustomed to romantic and soupy movies being fed upon a daily dose of bollywood this movie surely did not fail to pave its way right into the heart certainly its a movie to cherish or rather a movie to remember   ,sad
this is one of the best but saddest movies i have seen in years it treats love and alzheimer in a way that makes you feel the joy and the pain of the characters bravo for the actors who played the roles as they made me laugh and cry that only happens when acting is outstanding i would recommend anyone that has had a closed loved one suffering from alzheimer to watch this movie it may bring unwanted memories of the pain we all have gone through watching our family and friends deteriorate but it will help you have a closure and remember the good times you had with them director did an excellent job with the visuals and how the movie develops music and production are outstanding,sad
watched this movie for like couple years ago but i do still remember how this movie bring tears into my eyes the chemistry is surreal also the story is quite unpredictable and the way they bring emotion is superb applause,sad
must watchseen it like 5 times and each time i am like booooooo hooooooooooo best korean rom com everrrrrrrr watch it now,sad
first i gotta admit that its moving but i wont give it a very high score the movie shows a very deep love between the actor and actress but their love was simply based on the love at first sight a coincidence gathered them and made them meet each other the girl didnt even know a lot about this handsome guy and quickly fell in love deeply with the guy all the movie is trying to say how the girl and the guy love each other truly deeply by many ways eg when the gal got sick and went to the hospital she sent a letter like below please dont find me i hope you can find another great gal and be happy thats shows typical subliminal need for the guy and in fact hope the guy could visit her write nothing and disappear if she really want the guy to forget her i suggest some good korean movie such as daisy that i watched recently great one,sad
most romantic movie i had seen everthe movie is mainly based on focusing a lower class hero i enjoyed it too much,sad
enduring love versus illness and time is no stranger for the audience i watched this in 2019 the experience could be different if i watched this before i consumed other movies with similar storylinehaving said that this movie has been executed it very well it did justice to this genre i have to say the choice of ending is a bit lazy though and thats the only weakness in the story i understand the ending is always a very tricky part in any stories well done,sad
a beautiful and almost poetic love story of a couple in which one of them gets diagnosed with alzheimers the movie might seem a little long and sometimes dragging but the story the dialogues the intensity of the situations and woosung jungs lead males acting keep you interested till the endthough there have been many movies where one of the partners in a relationship is stricken with some sort of illness this one comes as a fresh and mesmerizing romantic drama which is sure to get at least a few tears out of youthe korean name of the film which literally translates into eraser in my head is apt for the movie the movie is based on a 2001 japanese television show pure heart,sad
okay this one is one of the good movie that south korea made but why they always make same plot even the ending is better for this one the story began as usually and the actress was always the weak one and she had sick which can make her forget everything but her husband the actor is so cool in this film very different when he acted in musa always accompanied her and taking good care of her and for a miracle shes not death just lose her memory they were togetherboth the actor and the actress acted good beside this movie plot actually really good it just why they always make one of them is sick or even deathyou really have to watch this movie if you are one of the fans for romantic film youll love it,sad

a moment to remember is truly an exceptional filmit does not involve comedy as such instead its a very sad film which will surely touch your heartaccording to me it is one of the best romantic film everthe movie clearly shows us what is the true meaning of love and that saying i love you means much much more than wordsthis film literally made me cry and i bet u will alsoi would like to narrate the whole story but i dont want to ruin the film for uthe only reason why i rated it 9 stars instead of 10 is because it is not a true story the movie involves some powerful dialogue such as there is an eraser in my head  i will remember everything for you are truly amazingi am sure you wont regret watching this film,sad
this is the story of sujin who soon after suffering a heartbreak from her previous relationship meets cheolsu with whom eventually she falls in loveduring the first half of the movie the focus lies on their life together and makes people like me that read in the summary about alzheimer disease  believe that this movie has nothing more to offer than thatlater onwe learn that sujin has been diagnosed with alzheimer disease and we witness the effort of the couple to cope with the situationand the problems that occurthe movie is the best i have seen so far surrounding alzheimers problemsbut thats not all it has to offergreat actingnice plotand very emotionalfeel warnedand prepare to cry,sad
the movie starts like this sujin is a young women who first falls in love with a married men and plans to go with him but at the day of run the man is not turning inthen with disappointment she reaches back but her parents does not show any disgrace to her and make her feel goodsujin then meets cheolsu and starts liking him and shortly they are getting married with sujins parents approvalcheolsu does not reveal his secret about his mother who left him at a very young age to a old man who made him a carpenter they both starts to lead a very happy lifesuddenly sujin starts forgetting things very oftensujin then meets a doctor and takes some series of testsmeanwhile the exboy friend of sujin who was working in the same office with her comes backcheolsu is becoming successful in his architect business and continues a very sweet relationship with her wifesujin then meets the doctor for her test results and the doctor says that she is affected by a very rare disease called alzheimers diseasethe doctor says that because of the disease she will first get a mental death followed by a physical one and advises to quit her job immediately and stay in homethe next forty minutes of the movie cannot be explained in words some excellent acting by both sujin and cheolsu ie the lead pairthe movies makes a heavy feel at your hearts if you are not shedding out your tears while watchingif you are in love with some one then you cannot resist your tears at some moments in the moviesa moment to remember is one moment i am going to remember ever with little tears,sad
i have been ocd with south korean movies for the last months but a moment to remember its one of the best for sure i love the music specially the spanish music the actors and their the acting of course the great story to tell the way the stories develops how they make us fall for this characters i love how they are very romantic and passion about each other but always respectful pure when they are together so real and painful so romantic and sad totally in love with woo jung for ever this movie on my top 5 favorite south korean movie and one of my favorite movies completely recommend big time cause more men need to take all the tips from woos character hollywood needs to learn from them fast cause they make better movies with better actors a way better stories,sad
have never been so touched before like i was with this movie the acting was great and the subject was excellent the way such a young woman was able to help him become the man she loved into the person she wanted him to be was excellent helping him learn more about himself and learning to love other was a defining point in this movie while the tragedy of her illness is dramatic it also shows it is not an old persons disease learning what love is all about is what this movie shows us this movie also tells us to show your love to the people you love one day they might not be here physically or mentallyfor you to tell them that i would recommend this movie to the world,sad
it is such a tearjerker movie with tremendous and controlled performances by the lead actors the cinematography is exquisite and soundtrack is remarkable this melodramatic love story never goes to the peak of the emotion but still keeps the tears in the eyesit touches the right chord of your heart at the right time and place and keeps you sniveling with the story the movie has its moments which will make you suffer with the actors in movie it demonstrates both the agony and the ecstasythe recitation is tremendous and will leave you in state where you unexpectedly think about your beloved the story is so poignant and tangible that will make you cry ostensiblyit is the one of the best movies from the korea i have watched many movies of kim kiduk and many other korean movies but it will remain with you until the death of your consciousness highly recommended,sad
i have seen movies that make u feel sad for the characteri have seen movies that try hard to push people to the core of the melodramatic barrelim not the person that is easily moved by those tearjerkersbut this one is one of those gem of movies that strikes u hard emotionally truly and im sure no one can hold back their tearsu r bound to empathize for the characterthe film wins u thereu will feel the pain as he doesi ll also recommend the grave of fireflies another masterpiece that will make u feel the sameenjoy both of them or ur missin something u mustnt,sad
this movie is absolutely amazing it teaches you to treasure life in the greatest wayon the other hand its a very sad movie totally a tearjerker i recommend this movie to everyone even those who dont normally fall for sad love movies this is one of those movies that touch you so hard you can never forget it truly a beautiful movie the actors are all great and cheolsu looks incredibly hot i love how he was that arrogant tough character at first than never show any emotion but then when shes ill he touches our hearts with his tears this movie is really touching i think anyone whos looking for an unforgettable movie should watch it,sad
i am surprised by the high rating of the movie hereafter seeing it i felt something indigestiblethe notion that your spirit is going to die before your body dies would be a big fear the japanese movie memories of tomorrow tries squarely describe the fear and portray the love between wife and husband however in case of moment to remember it is not sure which does the director want to portray the lead and her husband facing this fear or a mangalike love storythe man acts like a hero from the beginning to the end why cant he say i love you to his wife even after they got married is unclear maybe it is why i could not empathize the husband was the reason why i felt it indigestible,sad
yejin son is an angel sent to earth to make movies for crying scene where she grabs his cocacola drinks it whole and burps is one of the cutest things i have ever seen although story isnt original and theres quite a lot of movies made about same topic the way this one is done is more than beautiful acting and directing are excellent but two and a half hours is really too much although i was not bored at any time i had the impression that the film lasts for an entire eternity since the film is able to keep the attention of the audience or at least mine from the beginning to the end the duration should not be a problem but in my opinion this length is unnecessary for a particular story if i watched it in the cinema i doubt that i would endure to the end and end i fell apart literally8510,sad

i went into this movie not having read the book and not knowing anything more than the overall plot i am a sucker for a good love story especially love that i can relate to the pain and emotions felt by the characters felt so real as if i was feeling the same emotionsthough this was the saddest movie i have ever seen it was also one of the most beautiful as it truly showed how exhilarating and comforting and exciting love is i probably cried throughout about half of the movie along with the rest of the audience i cried to the point of heaving out loud and needing more than the 2 tissues i came in with again the actors really expressed the emotions of the characters well and i felt that i am going to see it again for surego see it if you love emotional movies,sad
some infinities are bigger than other infinities says my favorite quote from the movie and the book and its true because i am going to love this movie for the longest of the infinity i am a huge fan of the book and one thing which really makes the movie stand out is an amazing performance by shailene woodley she is outstanding in every scene she is and i have to say i am kind of in love with hazel even though its a love story of a girl who has terminal cancer i wouldnt say that the film is tragic rather the film is about living your life to the fullest in your little infinity if you have already read the book the film is true to the book and the great acting directing and music adds another dimension to the story is definitely one of the best romantic movies ever when you see this movie you are going to laugh and you are going to cry and when the end credit roles i can guarantee most of you are going to be completely in love with this love story,sad
average american guy right here and i dug this flick i dont care how many 13 year olds were in the theater with me this movie has emotion after watching the descendents i knew woodley was going places she simply delivers in this movie im not going to write a long winded review about the summary but i will tell you about the actingelgort and woodley truly deliver you forget theyre acting each and every scene the chemistry between the two is palpable laura dern comes out of nowhere i think the last time ive seen her face was jp she puts up a pretty good role as woodleys torn mother defoe is pure lovehate on almost a house level in fact he goes beyond house hatred with his apathy in this movie and the twos sidekick wolff is loads of comic relief which is surprising considering that he too is in the therapy group the rest of the cast is just kind of there sorry tramell but thats because the camera is on woodley and elgort the entire time i dont even think theres a scene except for flashbacks where the two are absentas far as the movie an emotional rollercoaster you will get addicted to their relationship you will cry big man tears internally and probably externally after 15 hours you will be emotionally drained,sad
i was touched by the concepts and situations on this film being myself a survivor of 48 chemotherapy treatments i can somehow understand the feelingsis not a pretentious film however full of little moments that creates a very good and convincing environmenti like both main rolls the story is completely credible it can happen any time to anyoneit is an ode for life it tell us that we can and should have moments of infinite joy within a limited time it is our choicei liked very much this film,sad
before i continue with this review please note that i have not read the book but am going to in the very near future  please note that im also a straight guy not that it matters pwow what can i say about this movie from the moment the title sequence starts i was hooked straight away scene to scene this movie just manages to suck me into this beautiful world of hazel grace lancaster and augustus waters the chemistry between shailene woodley and ansel elsort is astounding and the performances were astonishing honestly this is the best movie i have seen all year even better than captain america the winter soldier and godzilla which was a massive surprise i just thought this was going to be another teenie love story and boy was i wrong i loved this movie and recommend it to everyone across all ages im rambling on and praising the movie now so i should probably get on with the reviewthe direction and cinematography was fantastic not a single shot felt odd or out of place every shot matched the scene and felt real the editing was also great as shot after shot matched with the characters faces and where they were typical good movie editing stuff the acting perhaps was one of the best aspects of this movie seriously it makes the two characters feel real and alive and at times i forgot this was fiction and not based on a true story their performances were so heartfelt and definitely oscar worthy in my opinion but knowing the academy this is just another teenie love story that will not be acknowledged at all hopefully im wrong but thats the way it normally is this is the first movie this year that i have given a 10 i dont give out 10s easily but there was seriously nothing wrong with this film the pacing was perfect the acting was phenomenal the direction editing and cinematography was exceptional and overall this movie is one of the best romantic comedies that have ever touched the face of the earth i encourage everyone to go see this movie no matter what age you are and bring a packet of tissues as well youll need it1010,sad
this movie simply put is worth each and every one of its 125 minutes including the closing credits that you need to dry your eyes and think about what you just saw its the inspiring story of two young people who are no different then all of us as they both are in the process of dieing though hazel grace and augustus are more aware of this fact of life because their eternity has an expiration date set by hazels terminal illness cancer as the viewer is put on an emotional rollercoaster alongside the feelings and attitudes towards life and love the two teens share this movie will be a key to many locked doors in the recepients minds and through these doors we are lead by an ensemble of actors who are amazingly sensitive in their portrayal of personalities and emotionsthe writing and directing is so brilliantly executed that you have sympathy with every character this movie so caringly brings to short life even when they oppose another you feel unable to take sides because you find yourself sharing both and when the credits role  like the tears on your cheek  you realize that these opposing views are one and the same after all life,sad
wow being an avid book reader im always skeptical about watching the words of my favorite books transformed and materialized on the big screen but tfios stayed true to the book the movie was absolutely lovely from beginning to end the young actors were great the comedy hit on all the right notes the romance made your heart smile and the tragedy pulled at your heart strings it really was a wonderful adaptation and i believe it stayed as true to the book as possible without many changes where there were any the minute it was over i wanted to watch it again upon leaving the theater i looked around and there was not one dry eye not even the men if you are a big fan of the book like myself and are skeptical about whether this stays true dont be kudos the john green on his first film adaptation it was an absolute success id give it a 10 out of 10 if i could but i dont believe in perfect,sad
i dont really cry in movies unless theyre really really sad and this movie is bound to get you crying like theres no tomorrow i brought a box of tissues and i used about half of them i have never cried so much in my entire life being an avid fan of the book i was kind of scared that like some of my other favourite books the movie would be ruined but no the movie had all of the books materials in it except for one thing i never thought shailene and ansel would play hazel and gus but when i watched it their performance blew me away i think shailenes ability to cry got me crying because thats how real it felt it is an amazing movie and im sorry to say that its even better than a walk to remember go see this movie and if you do maybe read the book first so that you can be somewhat prepared,sad
shailene woodley and ansel elgort both have arrows strongly pointing upwards both shine brightly in this movie and suck you in from the get go following up their sibling pairing in divergent they both flash a wide range of chops here woodley is charming and smart and elgort majorly surprised me showing off a comical side also very smarti wont spoil anything but i did not read the book so i had nolow expectations and was sucked in early on and definitely was attached to the characters throughout its a great story and it tugs on your heart loved it,sad

the reason i am rating this a 1 is to combat the insane 82 rating that this terrible movie hasim a 17 year old girl and most people would assume someone my age would fall head over heels for a movie like this i watched expecting to see this amazingly realistic incomparable and tragically beautiful love story which is how tfios had been described to me after spending two hours watching this movie im sitting here wondering if im made of stone considering i did not shed a single tear but several movies i have watched and stories i have read have left me sobbing and attempting to recover for days i have never read the book or any of john greens books for that matter but now i will forever hold the opinion that he is a fully grown man attempting to articulate not only the life of a teenage girl but the life of someone suffering with a disease the first few lines of the movie narrated by hazel made me know i was going to hate this movie since she was describing things that happened in clich romance stories which is exactly what this is and how this was true the idea that this movie was realistic is ridiculous first of all a few token oneliners in the movie were clever and well written but would never come out of a teenagers mouth as a teenager myself i can confirm that we are not that profound i didnt understand the appeal that either of the main characters had in the other other than the fact they both had cancer hazel was boring and selfish and selfpitying and gus was so pretentious it made me feel sick and i never believed for a second that he was a virgin of course cancer is a terrible thing as is death itself but the fact that i didnt care about either of them and saw them as a caricature of what john green thinks or wants teenagers with cancer to act like made me completely indifferent to their predictable demise the story line with them going to amsterdam to visit the author of their favorite book was annoying and unnecessary although the author was painted as this terrible person i actually agreed everything that came out of his mouth about hazel im pretty sure the whole point of that scene was to say hey what can we do to make this movie even more depressing i know lets take the one thing that the main character cares about and destroy it in order to make her completely dependent on her love interest theres too many complaints i have about specific eyeroll inducing lines and scenes in this movie to even remember but the one that angered me more than anything was when they went to the anne frank house first they tried to compare the horrible death of anne frank and her family which was an outcome of the most horrible thing that has happened in human history to these teenagers dying with cancer as soon as they reached the top floor of the house paying attention only to hazel struggling to climb the stairs in my mind i started thinking please make them be respectful i swear if gus tries to crack a selfrighteous joke i will punch my laptop screen at first i was pleasantly surprised because they were quiet and solemn but then they begin making out only to make it worse everyone in the room begins clapping why if i was there i would be furious at their lack of respect i can only hope this scene wasnt filmed in the actual house towards the end i was constantly checking the bar at the bottom of my screen to see how long i had left i kept thinking when is this really sad part coming that will make me cry and when the credits started rolling i realized it never would the fact that people are describing this piece of trash as the best movie they have ever seen boggles my mind im assuming its the first movie they have ever seen if you want to watch a realistic romance movie you wont find it here dont waste your time,sad
i honestly cant imagine how anyone with a sense of good writing good directing or good acting could ever think this movie is entertaining past the humor of its flaws do you people have brains these actors may as well have had the script in their hands while shooting it would have made no difference the only impressive skills displayed came when the girl cries after augustus so pretentiouspasses away the only thing that kept me engaged in this movie after i had started watching was the curiosity of which one dies first there were points when i was rooting for the death of them together just so the movie would endthis review isnt coming from someone heartless i admit that i teared up when hazel bawls her eyes out but that doesnt make the movie good that just means i sympathize with someone who is crying that says nothing about the quality of the film what happened imdb i can usually trust your ratings ive never written a review here before but when i saw that this was higher than an 8 i had to say somethingthis is a weak tearjerker for the weakminded,sad
i give it 1 because imdb doesnt let me give it 0 i never wrote a review before but seeing the average of 85 gave me a feeling of never being able to trust imdb againi usually check movie scores in imdb to decide if i should watch it in the theaters below 7 is lame except for comedies which gets lower scores 7 to 8 maybe 8 and up must see except for this movie seeing an 85 i went to the theater excited i hope someone like me is out there and reads this review before he wastes his time and money with itwhat i saw boring depressing cynic pessimist average looking to slightly good looking girl has lung cancer the audience is led to believe she is smart because she read the same book 1000 times over doing that isnt smart and goes to college which she doesnt reallyshe goes to a support group where good hearted christian cancer survivor which is made to look like a loser helps young people who have cancer there she meets 2 characters 1 eye cancer guy who is going to have to remove them and has a huge boobed to good for him girlfriend who will leave him 10 minutes later 2 his friend an extremely athletic pretty extremely confident guy even though hes a virgin yeah right rolls eyes who is also a cancer survivor lost a leg to it but is paradoxically still very athletic even though his value on the meat market is much higher than the protagonist girls value he only has eyes for her even without her saying anything but depressing thingsat the end of the meeting if being athletic pretty and confident isnt enough a girl passes by him trying to get his attention to show that even other girls are into him so that the main girl can be certain that hes an alpha male but she still gives him a hard time because in every romantic movie a guy has to prove himself even beyond the shadow of a doubt that hes the man for a boring girl the exception is when there are 2 awesome guys fighting for the same girl twilightthey start talking on the phone and she lends him her favorite book the leg cancer guy says that her book is amazing and since the spoiled brat cancer girl has some stupid question she wants to make to the author he decides to get them both a trip to europe to talk to the writer of the book he could get anything for himself but he decides to give his special once in a lifetime cancer wish to her even though they are not boyfriendgirlfriend they have not had sex they havent even kissed yether doctor is the ugliest actor so you know hes going to be the bad guy he tells her that she cant take the trip in any possible way she goes anyway obviouslyin the generic romantic european country the guy decides to use a tux which all men love to wear not to take her to a very expensive dinner which although he doesnt end up having to pay he was more than happy to be able to pay for herthe author seems to be a reasonable guy he tells them in other words that the book ended the way it should have ended that her questions are stupid and that shes a spoiled brat narcissist which is all trueshe gets sad boy comforts her and tells her he could write a better ending then the author no he couldnt and if thats the case why couldnt she and why did they come in the first place they decide to go to anne franks house shes tired of going upstairs because of her lung cancer when shes at the place where anne frank hid she kisses the boy other tourists who were there clap for the blatant disrespect of annes suffering because theyre nazisits the only reasonable explanation this clapping cheers them on to having sexat this point me and my girlfriend were discussing going out of the theater before the end because it was so bad and clich but we stayed just in case the end was amazing to make up for all this bullsthey go back to america guy has cancer again and becomes depressed he knew it before going to europe but only gets depressed about it now w t f in his depression he stops talking to girl because romantic movies need a moment of sad separation which can always be easily resolved after some days by talking he starts talking to girl again about death girl writes eulogy for boy and reads it to him boy dies its time for her to read eulogy im thinking shes obviously not going to read the same thing again because that would be boring for the audience of the movie and then she doesnt read it what who saw that coming except for everyone she decides to say bland feel good lies in his funeral instead of the truth because shes a conformist narcissist coward girl gets a paper that leg cancer boy wrote to her before he died i barely remember but its some romantic bs the endtheres also a scene i dont remember exactly when in the movie that shows how deep does narcissism goes in the girl she says that she knows that when she dies her parents are not going to be able to do anything anymore shrivel and die because shes dead her parents are like no we arent get over yourselfhighlight of the movie another guy plays violin for a short bit of time,sad
85 on imdb seriouslyyou can rate this movie so high if you wanna be stimulated emotionally in a gratuitous manner  if your iq level is really low  if you like actors who cant act and look absolutely artificial on the screen what the heck happened to laura dern she used to be a slightly better actor now she looks like shes joined the ranks of the completely artificialized americans fake smiles fake emotions those kids act completely unrealistic also this is not how people who will die from cancer would behave have someone on the big screen cry for a few minutes the audience will cry too of course its like the yawning thats contagious but why was it that i didnt care at all for any of the characters by the end of the movie the only moment that was a bit moving was when the girl received the news about his death but even that wasnt connected emotionally to anything else in the movie i can list a hundred movies that are way more emotional than this pile of artificial crp and what the fk is with that pack of cigarettes on the boys coffin i know cigarettes eventually put you in the coffin but his was not the case i wonder what message they wanted to convey to the viewers,sad
without me blabbering on i would like to give my complements to john green and his team is a fantastic book which has a really sad ending im not going to say it to you as the quote says some infinities are bigger than others however hazel and guss love was quite an extraordinary one it must of been hard living with cancer the book was different but it still had the same story to the film but with more parts i got the book after the film came out so my book has the photos in it i have to say i did cry at the end but i couldnt stop blabbering through the film too be honest hazel grace has inspired me not everything in life is perfect and people are dying this book showed the good and bad sides to cancer like the book says pain demands to be felt it touched my sad side this book is one of the best thank you,sad
i cannot believe that this tripe has 85 i was unfortunate enough to accompany two 15 year old girls with my friend and was shocked that girls that age want to waste their time sobbing uncontrollably on a friday evening when there is a whole world out there waiting for themthe acting  oh my gosh  the worst ive ever seen gus was unbearable smug and frankly creepy and as for her mother  patronizing is an understatement i just struggled to watch them all make fools of themselves in this silly ridiculous filmwhat rubbish are we feeding our teens we had to point out to my friends daughter who thought gus was such a catch that life just isnt like this during the movie one girl clattered noisily out the cinema strangled by sobs and the row in front of us shook with heartwrenching wails as my friend and i shook with laughterget real kids dont waste your time watching this trite pap get out into the sunshine and live or at least watch a decent movie with a believable storyline and great acting something that will resonate or affect you deeply  because this certainly isnt worthy of anybodys valuable time,sad
i read the book several months ago and have been anxious for the movie so this grandmother went with her 16 yr old grandson who had also read the book we are both happy with the adaptation the story of two teens with cancer who meet in a support group for teens neither want sympathy and both knowing they will die  want to live life they exchange books and because of the ending of one and the questions they have  they email the author in amsterdam because he had not used up is wish they end up being able to go there and have the chance to meet the author willam defoe portrays the alcoholic author so well  you do not like him gus also tells hazel something he has been keeping from her gus and hazel have their ups and downs and knowing their time may be limited their love is fresh and true  and presented so well all the acting is good the sets the music and there is a lot of music but i did not notice most of it  a sign of a good movie score i volunteer in a hospice facility and it was so good to see the presentation of their cancer as real their feelings of what they are going thru as real i will read the book again and see the movie again  it is worth it,sad
it is nearly impossible to make a film about terminal illness and not make it heartfelt has its heart in the right place but  wow  you walk out wishing that someone would shake the dust and clutter and broken fragments off the screenplay so it can flow with more efficiency here is a movie that is so busy being profound that the characters feel trapped by plot gimmicks and stale dialoguebased on the bestselling book by john greene the movie stars the talented shailene woodly as hazel grace lancaster a teenager with stage 4 thyroid cancer with metastasis forming in her lungs shes been living with this disease since she was 13 and now she lugs around an oxygen tank with a nasal cannula hazel is distant a bit surly and more than a little bit cynical about the world in other words shes a normal teenager her parents force her to attend a cancer survivor support group that is led by an overly emotional group leader who begins each session by unrolling a large rug with a big  and somewhat unnerving  picture of jesus on itone day in group she meets augustus waters ansel elgort a fellow teen who confidently announces that he is suffering from osteosarcoma which has already claimed the lower part of his right leg hes a nice guy that hazel meetcutes when she bumps into him in the hallway there is little resistance from either side as to how they feel about one another and in the blink of an eye they fall in lovethats more or less all that you need to know the connection between hazel and augustus is not really built on chemistry but on the fact that they both suffer from terminal illness the movie doesnt have the flow of real life but is built on conventions of the plot everything in their relationship is calculated for effect we get gimmicks instead of narrative for example augustus carries around a pack of cigarettes and occasionally puts one in his mouth hazel is disgusted but augustus offers this explanation they dont kill you unless you light them and ive never lit one its a metaphor see you put the killing thing right between your teeth but you dont give it the power to do its killing a metaphor thats fine but the sight of augustus with the cigarette in his mouth looks as ridiculous as it sounds he puts the unlit cigarette in his mouth so often that we want to take his away from him and say stop that the movie is loaded with strange moments like that there is an odd subplot about a book that hazel has read over and over by a mysterious author named peter van haughton who has apparently disappeared into seclusion somewhere in amsterdam after a long and pointless series of arguments with doctors and with hazels parent she and augustus accept an invitation to fly to amsterdam to meet him van haughton is played in an angry performance by willem defoe that seems shoehorned in as if he were visiting from a different movieworse is what comes next hazel and augustus visit anne franks house naturally hazel has trouble climbing the series of steep staircases when she reaches the famous attic there is little to no attention paid to the fact that they are in anne franks famous hiding place instead the scene climaxes with hazel and augustuss first kiss to which all the strangers around them begin to applaudthe movie never really deals with the issue of what it is like to live with cancer or the inevitability that it will claim your life the dialogue lightly dances around these issues but no one ever gets serious about discussing them they know theyre going to die but neither augustus nor hazel ever get down to the serious business of discussing what lies on the other side augustus talks a lot about oblivion which indicates that he is an atheist but the movie doesnt go there we know from the beginning that one or both characters will face the final curtain before the movie is over but the films final act is a long  very long  series of slow passages about eulogies and final wishes that goes on and on and on it should be moving us to tears but you find yourself checking your watch insteadhazel informs us in the beginning that pain deserves to be felt we agree but the movie could do with a lot more pain and a lot less catharsis the characters talk and talk and talk and talk but nothing they have to say has any real meaning death is the inevitability of this story but theres such a long and drawnout funerary tone to the films third act that is tinged with so much hope and finality that it feels like the happiest sad ending youve ever seen,sad
was good it was funny and certainly heart gripping i thought shailene woodley and ansel elgort did a great job overall the story itself was magnificent albeit there were several faults in the film itselfthe editing was awkward at times and there were noticeable contradictory mistakes that i will not dwell on other than to say without spoiling anything that there is a teleporting basketball trophy see if you can spot it i also felt that the framing was too narrow at times and some of the two frame shots were unnecessary and distracting my last and largest problem was that there is a huge difference in what works in a book and what works on film some scenes can feel odd  and that is because they are out of place in addition the themes could have been much stronger and left us in really thinking sadly the film did not quite make iti may be focusing too much on the negatives i did rather enjoy the film and thought the book was fantastic i would recommend it to anyone contemplating enjoy,sad
this film is horribly cheesy hollywood does cancer very very badly the male lead could not act and therefore i was not convinced and therefore i did not cry i cry at everything usually but this film is not convincing at all it was definitely the male lead that spoilt it for me i just didnt understand his naked obsession with the female lead from the minute he sets eyes on her wham he is in love i found that very strange or maybe it was just the way he did it i know love at first sight happens but this seemed way over the top if you watch love story from the 60s which features cancer it has an authentic love story and build up but this film does not seem to be that genuine so you dont really care about the characters to be frank the whole thing reeks of cheese stay away,sad
why does this film have such a high rating ive been tricked so many times this year by highratings and rave reviews to films which have turned out to me absolutely atrocious that im losing my faith in film critics and the cinemagoing public alikei was promised this film would be a tearjerker but the only thing that jerked was my gag reflex i have never met a more obnoxious and irritating character as augustus waters and the whole script was painfully cheesy for about 80 of the filmi strongly recommend you do not see this movieevereven if you are paid to watch it,sad
i cannot believe that this tripe has 85 i was unfortunate enough to to see itthe acting is terrible probably the worst ive ever seenthe film is silly and frankly ridiculousthe worst thing in the entire movie was in the scene inside the anne franks home when they kissed for the first time after a long tough climb for who never seemed to end not only was it really predictable that they would kiss butoh my god then the tourists started to clapwhy because they kissed inside anne franks home they didnt know that they had cancer dont get me wrongi wanted to leave the cinema after ten minutes so unfortunately its not the only scene that is bad if this doesnt get you to skip this film i dont know what will,sad
ok so typical sappy romantic bs but this time they have cancer oh give me a break yeah thank god theyre wealthy attractive white people so they could have their little romantic adventure my cousin got lymphoma at age 16 and could barely eat because of medical bills his parents are so deep in debt they had to sell their house as no insurance would cover him but the tragedy here is that pretentious dbag gus and his cringe worthy pseudo intellectual metaphor died after traveling to europe and banging a hot girl oh the humanity this is a love story written for the 1 where the biggest tragedy in life is that spoiled little daddys money babies gus and hazel couldnt live to 90 off their parents dime probably in some malibu beach houseif youre a rich white person with no concept of real life you will enjoy this otherwise steer clear of this formulaic love story tripe,sad
i can not believe how high imdb ratings are for this movie i give 1 to this one because this film has a simple plot and can be summarized in three sentencesafter you realize the whole film is nothing but a parade of clichs you may decide to walk out because nothing original is going to happen or stay and try to figure out which of the leads would be dying first acting is terrible and the fault is obviously in the stars gus character and dad are not able to act they only pause for the cameras it gets annoying sometimes and you start thinking after 15 minutes into the film would this guy ever be able to keep his lips closed for once please and he does not film is so boring and this is nothing it has more than one ending so when you have the feeling that its coming to an end this is wishful thinking you are far from that happy moment there is still too many ridiculous clich moments to watch which are aimed to make viewers cry do yourself a favor do not watch it and if its to late and you had already watched this piece of boredom please to others a favor and rate the film,sad
obviously mr denizmoraligil you had not to deal by proxy with no one suffering of the much the same in the movie because if you had nothing but that much the same would be important in your lifeyou have 247 with luck 364 days to think much in the same there is no future to plan there is no happiness to program and pursue there is not even joy in watching a sunset or in listening a symphonyand if you are lucky enough in finding love and have the valour to let yourself immerse in the feeling it will never be without remembering that to get a rainbow youll had to do with the rainso mr denizmoraligil may god forbid that you experience that much of the same but also may god grant you a bit of charity and understanding to be able to discover the hidden beauty that some people have the heart to let out and accept even in the dreadful monotony of every one of their days hours and secondsto me this movie is a master piece that shades feelings worthy of 10,sad
for starters the only line of dialogue that came out of peoples mouths were okay seriously if i had a dollar for every time they said okay i would be a damn rich man the whole idea of the story made me laugh honestly not only was the acting horrid the music was very boring and the writing was noting short of a magnum opus absolutely freaking horrible there were a couple scenes where i actually burst into laughter because it was just that stupid the only people who awed and cried over the film were a bunch of 1316 year old teenage tumblr girls who nobody can stand by the way and they were crying and screaming the entire screening my friend says hed wish to just kick them out of the theater himself in the end everyone was annoyed and i will do the best i can to lower the rating of the film so that everyone could see that this is the worst movie ever madewant quality cinema the godfather,sad
firstly i must say that i am not a cold hearted person i love a good weepy film and i was looking forward to a hungover sunday afternoon cry but instead i was just wanting the film to end so what went wrong i would say that the main reason is that hazel is just not a likable character gus was just about likable but i felt nothing for hazel throughout the whole film she seemed cold and distant something about her just didnt work im not sure if something was lost when it went from book to screen but something happened or didnt at 2hrs 6 mins it was just too longkissing in anne franks house what the f and then to be clapped for it what i almost cheered willem defoes character for attempting to take hazel down a peg or two which i may add was the only good thing to happen during the abysmal amsterdam part of the filmthis just bored me and the only way it almost got any kind of tears out of me was from me mourning the 2 hours of my precious weekend i just wasted on this tripefor those of you who think that this is a modern masterpiece you really should see a few more films even in this genre alone this film is waaaaay down the list of modern masterpieces,sad
take out cancer and they are left with a hollow storyline the movie is simply not believable to me i know it is fiction but fiction can be made into a very believable film if it has relatable characters or storyline not to mention i find gus character rather simple minded hazels parents characteristics are contradictory too they are portrayed to be protective of their daughters wellbeing and safety but this conveniently dissipates when hazel wanted to fly to amsterdam with gus sorry i think this is not for a more realisticmature audience dont get me wrong i love romantic films but this is sadly not my cup of tea,sad
finally someone realize and i am agree with you  ooraculo  its the ugliest movie adopt from bad bad book i wonder do the reader and movie lover understand how to pick a good movie and a bookthey try to make a sad ugliest story and to fool lots of movie lover the story line is so boring mentioned she red the same book like an idiot how they can generously giving a high score to a junkies movie like this i would never ever recommend imdb again for a movie reviewvery very ugliest movie ever do not watch the movie or you will be regretting no refund lol,sad
from what i saw and heard of this movie it was okay the acting was good the story somber but alright but the distracting crowd ruined any chance i had of developing feelings for the characters or story although i ended up having a great time at the movie it had to do with my reaction to the crowd and not the film and now my experience at opening night of the movie i had read some about it that it was a popular book and that the movie was going to be sad but good manwas i ever in for a surprise so i took my male cousin robinboth of us in our early 30s telling him that it was a tear jerker but that i had heard good things we arrived to a packed theatre packed with teenage girls we found 2 seats finally in the middle of a row before the movie started the theatre people gave an announcement that after the film there would be a qa with the writer and the 2 lead actors via satellite the crowd of girls screamed and cheered then when the films opening credits started more screams we both looked at each other and said what the heck did we get ourselves into then once the lead male came on the screen it was like we were transported to the 60s at a beatles concert seriously the girl beside my cousin was actually biting down on her sweater shaking and squealing then every 30 seconds we had to hear awwwwwwww for every cute look or nice thing the boy said to the female lead really we were annoyed because we felt like we couldnt enjoy the film thenspoilers aheadwhen we learn one of the leads is going to diethe whole theatre started cryingcollectively blubbering in unison then for the remainder of the film the cries turned to heavy sobbing girls clutching tissue boxes and their whole bodies convulsing in lamented moans and my cousin and i just couldnt keep ourselves together i felt him choking back laughter and then i was choking back laughter and then we just burst out in gut wrenching laughter we just could not stop laughing we tried to make our laugher sound like sobs people must have thought we were loosing our heads with sadness but we couldnt help it it was just too funny we got the heck outta there once the credits rolled looking like most of the movie goersall teary eyed and puffy faces but our tears were from laughter i have never laughed so much at while watching a sad movie in my life i think if u want to bypass the annoying teenage girls wait till it comes out on dvd i am going to have to watch it again as i wasnt given the chance to properly watch it,sad
the seventeen yearold hazel grace shailene woodley has lung cancer and needs to carry everywhere an oxygen tank her mother frannie laura dern encourages her to go to a cancer support group against her will however when hazel meets the eighteen yearold gus ansel elgort who lost part of one leg with cancer but apparently is cured they fall in love with each other hazel introduces her favorite novel to gus and tells that she dreamed on having a conversation with the author van houten willem dafoe who lives in amsterdam gus contacts him and van houten invites them to visit him in amsterdam they travel to netherlands with frannie where hazel will learn that things are not like they seem to beis a tiresome and too long romance the story has a promising beginning sort of gus van sants restless and supported by the good performances and chemistry of the young lead couple but the film should have been edited to become shorter in the end it becomes a melodramatic mexican soap opera my vote is sixtitle brazil a culpa  das estrelas the fault is from the stars,sad
ive been trying to figure out why this movie is so highly rated and not sure why or how anyone could sit through this nonsense all around horrible acting and predictable storyline from start to finish  i was tricked into seeing this and by far the worst movie ive seen since 2004 highlights all the narcissism and self entitlement problems females today bring to the world princess syndrome at its worst two sick people and a family and one individual spends the entire time only thinking of herself and what she wants how these other person can improve her pitiful life while she does nothing to contribute back thinking they need her and wont be able to cope or survive without her come on just terrible avoid this and movies like that stop making this unequal nonsensestop supporting it but then again i guess some people really arent as committed to equality as they claim,sad
betrayed by the top critics score yet againthe rotten tomatoes percentage hovered in the mideighties a day after theatrical releaseas the ticket taker scanned my phone a nearby police officer demanded i toss my recently purchased coffee in the garbage i replied instinctivelyyes sirmy shoulders fell as i dropped the cup lid still stoppered into the pit of complete and utter wastethroughout a choir of hapless sirens relinquishes groan after moan highlighting each characters obvious emotions and inflating the tortuous plod of lackluster plotanderson cowan cohost of the best podcast ever the film vault said it best when describing the crowd of earlyteen females cooing and googooing at every emotional turna girl was bawling crying like an infant in the back of the theater after gus died ive never been in a movie where someone subjects everyone else to their weepingand hey more often than not ive got leaky ductsbut i sure as hell dont thrust it on others and ive never been uncontrollably sobbing most assuredly id make a hasty retreat out the theaterokay enough personal anecdotes ill complain about the actual movie nowthis film isnt made for me perhaps people who like the book cant help but enjoy the onscreen adaptation at best though educated filmgoers can only qualify it as a guilty pleasureis not a good moviei should have known better than to trust a poster title scrawled in a chalkboard font the use of handwritten script in the lettering of the title has become a staple of the dromantic quirkedy a dramatic romantic quirky comedyin fact any theatrical release poster utilizing the creative quirky penman theme with handwritten fonts doodling on spiral notebook stock or blackboard sketching is generally a red flagi havent read it but i didnt appreciate its not okay or mild its a poor film and heres whythe acting is not great on ansel elgorts part his character gus is overly theatrical breaking into grandiose soliloquys which are meant to be cute and uplifting gus is a bit too romantic his optimism too paperthin his haughty bravado is never convincing and ultimately serves to detach the viewer thereby oftentimes reminding the audience theyre watching a motion picturenat wolff who plays isaac is clearly meant to be the funny guy of approximately thirty attempts at humor his jokes hit home twice for the briefest of chucklesa lot of the black humor such as the jokes about isaac losing his sight are just not funny my god some of the moments that get the audience roaring with laughter are actually very tragic and harshjust because something is played for laughs doesnt make it funnywhen isaacs feeling up his sexy girlfriend in the parking lot the timings so stilted its disorienting even discerning whats intended to be funnyjokes are measured by the quality of the humor not by the purity of a writers intent willem dafoes character is somewhat compelling and i enjoy his offtype performance mostthe confusing scene in anne franks house is contrived and cheesy nonsense firstly it feels in a misleading manner like something surreals happeningthe two american tourists start sawing face in the attic hideaway and the surrounding european strangers respond with applauseits absurd and silly not upliftinglaura dern as frannie hazels mother is a bit of a shmoopderns usually tough to swallow her performances consistently include an odd tic an overly ambitious facial expression or touches of melodrama im thinking specifically of blue velvetbut in tfios shes just overly soapy all the motherdaughter bonding moments are painful and when she shows up wearing the towel does anybody believe for a second that frannie had just leapt out the tuball i can see is laura dern pretending to don a towelshailene woodley is good as always shes best in a very good film the spectacular now and is one of the redeeming elements of alexander paynes dreary snore the descendantsthe film leans on the supposition a viewer will feel unquestionable sympathy for hazel to be frank shes quite offputting and not necessarily likableas far as the story goes its dull and depressing i marched out the theater feeling unfulfilled confused and defeatedthe policeman watched as i sauntered out the exit brandishing his nightstick and releasing a satisfied chuckle but im too wrapped in thought to recognize his villainous waysthe question i keep asking myself whats the rubmy sister read the book so i asked herwhats at stake what am i supposed to take away from this storyi thought it was nice they got to spend the one night together before he diedso theres the selling point the takeaway is the experience of becoming absorbed and swooning in the romantic notion of romancei find zero experiential value in this narrative since the merit of an unfunny romantic comedy supposedly resides in the feeling of romancemost men are the same way its not a redeeming quality we dont derive satisfaction from the swooning sensationthis is why most date movies are badbut anybody older than twenty without nostalgia for the book will realize this is a sub par filmladiesplease dont drag your significant other to this moviego see edge of tomorrow 22 jump street maleficent or how to train your dragon 2 insteadway more laughs and feelgood moments in all four,sad
this film was popular with young adults my daughter when to an advance preview the kind where you have a live by satellite qa session with the starsas a parent you do end up questioning why would you want to see a romance movie about young people with cancer in this case beautiful young people in a hollywood movie i had a sibling who had cancer at a young age it was horrible a nightmare and nothing like this moviehazel shailene woodley has cancer she goes to a cancer support group where she meets augustus ansel elgort a one legged cancer survivor both share an acerbic wit and an unconventional view of life on a visit to amsterdam to see a reclusive and alcoholic writer they fall in lovethe fact that they have a kiss in anne franks attic where a crowd applauds tells you all you need to know that this film has no tasteit starts off engagingly like a stoic fight against the odds kind of movie with some black humour it then becomes inert really going nowhere the narration becomes a nuisance and then the saccharine kicks in,sad
well imdb please please pleasei trust your ratings so much so that every time whether its in cinema hall or on netflix or anywhere else even before renting dvd from red box i always check imdb ratings before deciding whether to watch or not when i see 8 rating i didnt bother to click few pages to read the user reviews seriously my bad i wish i would have time to read few pages instead of blindly believing the some paid reviews and paid rating by imdbmy cousins were pulling and honking car horn waiting outside so i just gave in lesson learned i wont trust on imdb ratings again also i was not furious on my money or my time being wasted like that but did anyone ever thought giving 8 ratings would put this movie in the league of godfatherthe shawshank redemptionthe lord of the ring seriesgood fellas star wars and likes its utter disrespect and blasphemous for these great movies to put this good for nothing movie and listed and counted among them people might be thinking or comment that this reviews comes from insensitive person or i dont have heart seriously my cousins and i seriously tried to cry but we all end up laughing along with few other fellow like us and also got the wrath of some bullteenagers who saw this movie as some sacred text like bible being translate to movieok now come to the story our pretty shailene woodly got cancer and dying very depressive but why every time they end up in support group and all the good christian and the worst of the movie was not her in fact she save the movie else we all would be out of cinema hall in first 15 minutes the worst part of the movie was that chocolate face ansel elgort seriously this guy can only be her brother and he should stick to brothers and kind of looks because he is so emotionless even on most emotional scenes he act like he is acting badly the cigarette scenes were most terrific then comes the author part seriously a author of some unknown book are in seclusion and drunkard he was not john gresham or stephen kings or some pulitzer prize winner author who hasnt got any good book and now in hidingnot only that the author has no respect for cancer patients or something like that he was rude drinking all the time and insult our protagonist next comes our 18 years old so called virgin boy had sex where well at anne frank memorial and that was highly encouraged by applauding strangers i mean seriouslyhow much pain one can bear does this director has any idea so the worst is not yet over by this time we were so bored but to keep our self busy and in fact start enjoying the comedy so we start playing games who will die first elgort or shaileneso by this time i know so much about script i told them what would going to happen and who will die first and how it endssurprisingly thats what happen because the script and screen play was so shallow any 6 years old could predictplease emotions are set aside and reviews of teenagers are one thing please imdb remove the 8 rating and give it a true 2 or at most 3 star ratings and please stop insulting movies with 8 rating its offensive,sad
worst movie ive ever seen because it tries assumes and fails watch silver linings playbook for real charm story and proper actingive never had to skip a movie right to the end expecting something good and even then it was terrible everything mentioned in the 1star reviews is true i have no idea how this reached 8710 its unbelievableterrible inaccurate story taking advantage of a cancer and dying story and just using it to carry the whole movie despicable and disappointing  terrible acting corny oneliners that had my stomach turning i could not handle more than 5 minutes of this quoted from another review augustus carries around a pack of cigarettes and occasionally puts one in his mouth hazel is disgusted but augustus offers this explanation they dont kill you unless you light them and ive never lit one its a metaphor see you put the killing thing right between your teeth but you dont give it the power to do its killing a metaphor thats fine but the sight of augustus with the cigarette in his mouth looks as ridiculous as it sounds he puts the unlit cigarette in his mouth so often that we want to take his away from him and say stop that the movie is loaded with strange moments like that   bad camera angles scripting and jarring pace normal scenes are given heavy emphasis and overemphasised nothing feels natural the chemistry seems forced camera angles that linger between the two main actors for what seems achingly ages for what seems hours i had to look away from the screen they were given so much dead focusoverall 010 this just takes the cake seriously worst movie ive ever seen and its made me write up this darn review if you want quality acting from real actors and real directors with real sweet charm heart good pacing and film editing watch silver linings playbook starring bradley cooper and jennifer lawrence an infinite times more believable and lovable than this,sad
why anyone would care to see this play on emotion junk movie i have no idea full of obvious heartstring pulling scenes fit for 12 year old girls i wouldnt suggest this garbage be watched by anyoneunless you are that 812 year old girl that find badly written scripts good you get more content from a maury whos my baby daddy episode if you find yourself with nothing to do avoid this movie even as a last resort it would leave you empty inside from the hollow acting all the way to the bad script and plot scenes should you have a daughter that wishes to see this prevent that from happening at all costs this will only succeed in diminishing their intellect and giving them a false sense of reality with life and relationships,sad
every girl i know was obsessed with the book and then the movie i figured that it had to be good with such a high score makes sense right man was i surprised the movie was awful the majority of the actors werent at all believable and those who were played annoying and cheesy clichs many scenes made no sense and were unrealistic the whole experience was bad as well the audience that went to see this film is made up of teenage girls who ignored all the faults in the film and gave it a 10 i hope someone like me is reading reviews here then maybe they could avoid ever paying to see this movie i nearly left the theatre towards the end when pretty much everyone in there started sobbing uncontrollably it was too cheesy and bad to be at all emotional there was nothing i took away from this film i wouldnt recommend seeing it i was extremely disappointed,sad
i always find imdb reviews to be a very useful indicator of whether i will enjoy a movie i checked the review here only after the movie got to the slow clapping and when i found the rating was 81 i actually joined the site to help lower the rating into perspectivethis movie is very very predictable boring slow and in places cringe worthyand to crown it  she leaves a pack of cigarettes on his coffin  i get that its supposed to be a metaphor but  seriously so bad and the predictable irony she is dying but he diessighanother sad case of the emperors new clothes,sad
to anybody to sees male or female be sure to have a tissue handy i have seen a countless number of films and i confess this is the film that may have teared me up the most this realistic story about two teens with cancer coming together is so sweet but there is also an emotional weight added to the story because of the subject matter the film doesnt try to be saccharine but it tries to be sincere the movie has a lighthearted tone for the most part despite the dark subject matter and that i can truly be happy with josh boones film is about two kids named hazel grace and augustus waters who fall in love with each other when they meet at a cancer support group together they go on adventures with nothing to stop them not even the grim reaper the film is truly wellacted shailene woodley deserves an oscar nomination for this role her charisma is inspiring and this may be her best performance to date ansel elgort is not too shabby himself i loved his quirky personality and despite his problems still has the ability to keep his witty charm nat wolff was very good as augustuss friend who had cancer rob him of his eyesight laura dern turned a sympathetic performance as hazels mother and willem dafoe gave an hateful but very good performance as the author who influences hazel overall is an incredible film its a very deep thoughtprovoking movie it goes in a lot deeper than a normal romance film would do and that adds more effect to the film by the time the end credits rolled my eyes were dripping with tears and to say thats rare while watching a film is an understatement a powerful well meaning story about cancerstricken teens falling into such a passionate love my grade a,sad
i cant describe how let down i feel there is so so much attention with this movie that i had to go and watch it so many people talking about it adverts everywhere i was so excited to see this cause i am a movie and especially a love movie sucker even better sad but i could just predict everything that was going to happen next in the movie like every little bit ive seen already before like much of it from my sisters keeper  which i did have tears to whereas not a tear shed with this movie i just felt like the acting wasnt very good either like shailaine however u spell it i absolutely loved her in divergent but in this movie i couldnt feel her or her character  i want to watch it again and see what im missing  this has such a high rating  im so disappointed that i left the cinemas with no emotions from the movie  i mean i couldnt even feel my eyes water forgive me for my errors,sad
dont get me wrong i did notice that there are a lot of people who enjoyed this and declared this as their favorite movie of 2014 or at least the month they watched this unfortunately i couldnt see it that way which has to do with the fact that this is so by the numbers that it hardly evoked an emotional reaction once at the airport scene with the father but several times it was shuddering because of the sugar overload this hasi actually was under the impression it was another nicholas sparks filmnovel this was based on not because i read this anywhere but of how the story developed no real surprises here not even that you get beautiful people looking beautiful while pretending to be something else or sick that wouldnt matter though because even movie sickness is best portrayed by someone we love to watch but the fact it lies to itself you are a fairy talemovie is what someone should tell the voice over if it actually helped  but it wonta far better movie on the subject which actually does evoke emotion if you get on the ride is 5050 joseph gordon levitt and anna kendrick are killing it sorry for the pun still this movie has a fan base which will hate my guts for writing all those things but i would be lying if i wrote anything else perception is everything,sad
imagining a day without love has become impossible since i watched this movie no matter which kind of love we focus on what really matters is this that an antidote to all poisons and a key for all doors has been summarized into 4 words loveit was a year ago when i started reading john greens novel i found out from the first pages that at least one guy could finally find a new way to anecdote a romance story and do believe in this fact that this guy could make a revolution in this genre actually as a person who usually writes about different subjects i had never ever thought about this kind of relationship a relationship between two teenagers whom both suffer from cancer and in a way are strange not only the idea of this story is something pure but also the words which writers used to communicate better with readers are among the best ones anyway accept my apology because we are here not for the books review but because of the movies onelike all the reviews i have here on imdb screenplay is the first item in which im interested to talk to you about it as you know when you want to make a movie out of a successful novel or story which has acclaimed critical praises without any pictures you have a hard job to do not only because of this fact that you are not able to change everything you want but also because of this fact that maybe changing words affects readers mind here the writers couldve done their job in its best way just follow these four simple steps and then you will find out why im telling you this 1open the book 2read it 3watch the movie 4review the book  and you feel that youve seen all the things you expected without any deficiencies thats exactly the reason i know this title as an important movie scott neustadter and michael h weber have done their bestabout the casts i searched but couldnt find anyone better than shailene woodley as hazel and ansel elgort as gus weve seen them before in the divergent but here they show how good they are two things would be enough to prove their abilities the way ansel elgort tries to communicate with all audiences and his co star by his body language and without any dialogue and sometimes just by staring into hazels eyes which shows that he has overwhelmed by his role and his character and the way hazel tries to convince you she is in love with gus so theyve done their job perfectly actually ive become one of their fans since i watched this movie and their amazing collaboration with each otheras a conclusion i prefer to write about the best scene of the movie based on my own opinion i think the scene that gus asked hazel to write him a funeral speech and asked her to read it in front of him while he was alive and was there in his own funeral ceremony was the best scene the way they became sad the way they became happy by reviewing their memories and etc all together would be enough to convince you how memorable this scene isi think if you are interested in romance movies you should watch this movie believe me its a good one best regards amin ghanbari,sad
ok so heres the thing i was so not going to bother writing a review for this movie yes i loved it however there were things in the book i think should have been in the movie thats why i give it a 9 not a 10 now the reason im writing this review this movie is sad it promises to be sad just by the decription and the trailer looking at the cover tells you that its going to be romantic if you do not like these types of movies or you are a heartless bonehead like the guy that gave this heartfelt movie a 1 and wishes he could have given a 0 do not watch this movie my fianc put it right this movie and book is the notebook on steroids you will cryyou will get mad at the crying because it wont stop and above all you will watch it again and again thinking each time youll make it without a single tear that will not happen but youll try anyway hazel grace and augustus waters will steal your heart and the end is the hardest part yes someone dies but who i wont spoil that its not who you think btw,sad

all i can say it was a wonderful story plus a box of kleenex and it was worth iti think the actor and actress and wonder as i watched this how they were able to get through this story one has to give them 10 stars for the acting alone i do think it should be watched by one and alli will tell my friends of this movie and myself and many friends are survivors i am so glad i rented this movie i hope to read the book in the future if i can find itsome times i think we need more of this kind of movie a real story there are so many violent stories on the screen these daysgod bless the cast and all that worked on this movie,sad

this movie  this movie is a masterpiece i dont have any words regarding this movie this movie is a massage for those who dont understand the meaning of love scene to scene this movie just manages to suck me into this beautiful world of hazel grace lancaster and augustus waters the pain and emotions felt by the characters felt so real as if i was feeling the same emotions it was also one of the most beautiful as it truly showed how exhilarating comforting and exciting love is i probably cried throughout about half of the movie please at least sit with a packet of tissues while watching this movie  honestly this is the best movie i have seen all year,sad
this movie took me by surprise usually this kind of young adult fare isnt something i go for too watered down and formulaic and although this one does sometimes stray into pandering melodrama its for the most part made with a blunt matter of fact clarity and heart wrenching realism that needs to be commended shailene woodley has been on the map for a while now and although she sometimes phones it in in mediocre projects cough divergent cough she has a magnetic star quality and gravitas that pulls you in she is unbelievable here playing a hard luck girl in an agonizing situation that no one should have to go through there are two scenes that she just nails and raise her performance to award worthy quality after seeing her in descendants white bird in a blizzard and now this i can say shes a new favourite ansel elgort is charming life affirming as gives excellent work as a fellow cancer patient who falls madly in love with woodleys character hazel grace old pros laura dern and willem dafoe are superb in supporting roles at one point dern say something like  its how people have always dealt with pain you just do it this film takes that simple piece of advice and makes its characters make decisions and act accordingly yes what they are going through is horrible heartbreaking tragic stuff but it doesnt cancel out the fact that you are living through it and can make the choice to do just that live with whatever time you have and deal with it as best you can this is what sets the film apart from a lot of other films of its type,sad
i went into this movie expecting a stupid teenagerdrama i havent read the book and im not really a love story type of guy and although many people may see it as just that a stupid teenage love story i was very positively surprised it was actually cute and funny and i really enjoyed it it might still have a few klische teenage movie things and it might try to be all inspirational but it felt real and heartfelt i was also positively surprised by the performances which were nicely and lovingly done it was sad but at the same time gave you a warm chummy feeling so if you like a good love story that has a little humour to it but manages to crush you a little as well i highly recommend this movie,sad
i will be the first to say that the book by john green captivated me i went to the chapel hill public library to do some wojdylo social media work and ended up seeing this book on the must reads shelf right before christmas i read the book in about three hours and i knew i had to watch the movie i went to twitter and asked my friends their thoughts on the book they all loved it i had to wait six months to see the moviei absolutely loved the book and the movie was outstanding the one thing i did not like about the movie was the fact that augustus prior relationship was never mentioned in the movie this was one of the main parts of the plot of the book as he did not want to hurt someone else that did not play out at all in the movieother than that i felt as if the movie did a great job of telling the story of hazel grace lancaster and augustus waters there were moments in which there were tears in my eyes and there were moments that i could not help but laugh i honestly wish i would have read the book closer to the movie release because i forgot some of the amazing lines and the movie did not do them justice there is just something special about reading that great one lineras with most movie adaptations from books i would strongly suggest reading the book first the movie is well above average and even great in my book no pun intended let me know what you thought of the movie,sad
if you need a good cry this movie is for you you know going in youre going to a this cant last long love storyin addition to using every sad trick in the current dying youth arsenal this effort goes beyond and even calls on anne frank references in case there is still a dry eye the houseperhaps the movie works too hard and too long to use one more kleenex how many eulogy scenes does one character need good thing hazel or gus didnt have a dog or it wouldnt have made it through the moviethe performances are easier to watch then the subject matter the young leads will be mentioned in golden globe circles laura dern the second best actor in her family gets better with age william dafoe cant be as bad as written his one sour note performance and implausible popping in as the mail man felt contriveda good score and use of the amsterdam locations lift spiritsdealing with cancer the death of a child and the loss of a friend are tough subjects to explore perhaps the movie is actually soft and romantic compared to the truth after all as tom cruise once said you cant handle the truth,sad
i was nervous going into i really liked the book although it had been hyped up quite a bit and i knew that the trailers made the movie look like a cheesy and somewhat hip adaptation the movie however blew away my doubts and resulted in probably the saddest movie youll see all year or for quite some time for all of you who havent read the bestseller follows hazel shailene woodley a young girl suffering from cancer she is bitter and snarky about her condition she does not have any apparent friends her one friend in the novel was cut from the film and she feels like she is just a grenade waiting to go off her mom laura dern urges her to go to the group counseling at the local church this is where she meets augustus waters ansel elgort the boy who will eventually sweep her off her feetfrom the getgo it is clear that woodley shines in her performance we grow so attached to her by the end of the film her performance brings the character from the pages of the book to life the cancer has made her flawed not in the physical sense but in the fact that she tries to build a shell around her life and is fearful of anybody getting close since she thinks she could die at any time her relationship with augustus is fueled with such great chemistry that you would assume that they were actually a couple elgort who starred with woodley previously in divergent is excellent in this as well he will certainly be making more of a name for himself after this film their chemistry helps make the moviewhich could come off as just a suckerpunching tear festinto something where everything happens naturally without making it feel too forced or contrivedbut sadly not in a disappointing way the film is still a tear fest we know we are being set up for a huge emotional climax we know that the cancer is forever present we know we are going to cry yet we go along for the journey because it feels true with the movie clocking in at slightly over two hours i did feel that it was long but never did i not enjoy the ride even having read the book the events of the movie still hit harder than i expected resulting in multiple occasions of tearfilled eyes i cannot say the same for the other people in attendance though because i heard several sobs from people behind me and even some lingered into the credits the movie is an emotional roller coaster right until the very end so be preparedthe supporting cast supports the main cast admirably dern as hazels mother is a heartbreaking and real performance her character explains that even if hazel were to die she would still be a mother and man do we lose it also supporting is willem dafoe in yet another rough and unpleasant character as well as nat wolff from the naked brothers band who plays the starcrossed lovers friend word has already been spread that he will be starring in another john green adaptation paper towns so be on the lookout for thatin terms of actual filmmaking there are a couple qualms that need addressing near the beginning of the film the movie appears to be cut together by an editor who lacks any experience at all i never really address editing in my reviews but there are some exceptionally bad moments in editing and sound editing sometimes it feels like the film is turning into an action film with some rather quick cuts that are done just for the sake of getting a different anglein the end will leave you in tears it is an emotional journey along with two kids who have cancer and it reminds us to live life to the fullest and to never let the adverse elements in our lives keep us from living the life we want we like the characters get to choose who or what hurts us so if you want to let some emotions out go let this movie hurt you because it hurts so goodfor more reviews check out ragingfilmcom,sad
i am open minded enough to watchread a work of art that is not in my typical favorite subject thats why i watched a film with a 82 rating despite that being under the romance category the dialogs where 100 not teenagers despite the fact that they may be mature because of their life experience have you heard a real teenager speaking the whole movie is so surrealistic that it would be the same if the characters were blue and could fly and by the way not less important the movie is disrespectful to real cancer patients and their families but if you like to cry for some sick fiction teenagers for entertainment because you cant feel a st in real life this can be a good pick,sad
this reviews contains lots of spoilers if you are not wanting the movie to be completely given away please find a different review meet hazel grace lancaster a 17 year old girl with lung cancer meet augustas hazel graces boyfriend who also has cancer the movie isnt exactly slow it just doesnt pick up until the middle because of the character introductions when hazel was diagnosed at the age of thirteen she was granted one wish and she used it to go to disney land and epcot center gus however saved his wish hazel wants to meet the author of her favourite book who happens to live in amsterdam well after a few set backs hazel her mom and gus are on their way to meet this author the author even pays for a very nice dinner date for hazel and augustas where they drink champagne and discuss philosophy oh and fall in love you see hazel is dying and because of this she doesnt want to love anyone extra who will be hurt by her passing what gus doesnt tell hazel is that he too is dying and that the cancer has spread to the lining of all his major organs lungs liver stomach etc then they make out after dinner or at least mostly do when they meet the author he turns out to be a grieving drunk who lost his daughter at the age of eight to leukemia he tells them about greater and smaller infinities and swedish hip hop when all dying hazel wants is the answer to three characters who are left behind when anna the main character dies naturally hazel and gus become mad at the author because they wasted gus wish on the author and he didnt even grant the wish tell them about the characters who were left behind disappointed they tour the anne frank house it has two flights of steep stairs and a ladder to get to the top where they lived then they return home and resume their everyday lives and continue their fights with cancer traditional romeo and juliet story he even dies first there are a lot of factual errors my sister and i finally just started sitting there counting them all the anne frank house has two steep stair cases and a ladder hazel is a very stubborn girl in the movie hazel carries her own tank up both flights of stairs and the ladder with a little assistance from the authors assisant but in all reality gus shouldve carried the o2 tank and passed it over hazels shoulder up to the authors assistant and she carried it the other half of the way repeating the process for each case when gus is diagnosed with the relapse and he becomes so weak that he is in a wheelchair he shouldve also been placed on oxygen because by that point the cancer was in his lungs and he was down to less than 30 capacity and another thing hazel has been on oxygen for a number of months minimally and has no indignation from the candela pressing on her cheeks or dryness around her nose and cheeks from the constant air pressure and lastly towards the end where hazel and gus are both weak from the cancer taking over their vital organs they decide to go out to a park not terribly far but far enough from gus house and have one last picnic date hazel pushes gus theoretically shed be pushed over 240 lbs and pulling another 2530 behind her over uneven ground and up a small incline i would be winded and she barely pauses before they start talking and drinking more champagne its never said where an 18 year old and a 17 year old precursor a bottle of very nice champagne from the only redeeming points in the movie are that their older not your usual 15 year olds and that they dress up very nicely when doing grown up activities not overly mature just enough and that they actually come across as mature not whiny little children they think a lot about death and how their going to die before they can do anything in life but what is keeping any of us live until were old and of us could get in our cars today and die a million different ways there isnt anything different about living life with a terminal illness and dying anyway i say enjoy today and live for tomorrow none of are guaranteed a ripe old age and you dont want to be remembered as then person who only thought about dying and forgot theyre living,sad
okay okay before we begin to review this title lets make it clear that im a man now is a story about a girl name hazel grace who has cancer the movie has a solid ground and doesnt lose its main focus the acting was good but what shined about the movie was the two main characters roles they felt very natural as a couple and when your making a love story its very good to have natural actors unlike twilight however the movie dragged a bit too much i kept saying to myself okay when are you going to get to the point but still this wasnt a big problem once you get to the end one of the biggest problems were that the director rushed the beginning already three minutes through the movie hazel meets augustus her boyfriend than oh oh there together or are they wait yeah there together nevermind they broke up thats how it felt anyway also one thing id like to point out is that the movie is not worth the hype people are making such a big deal about a movie that from the first place wasnt all that great oh another thing spoiler the way they killed off augustus was just horrible we didnt even get a chance to feel bad for the guy because it was like oh he died that was unexpected than hazel crys for about 20 seconds than poof were at the funeral than poof were at the end credits and than you kinda sit there like well that sucked so anyways this was my small review again its not that bad but it can wait until the dvd comes out,sad
ive created an account for the sole cause of writing a review for this film as im stunned by the fact that very few people seem to notice the flimsiness of the scriptalthough this is obviously a teen movie it starts ok with a good level of irony to balance out the profound underlying subject not to make it too sentimental this balance is totally lost after about 45 minutes anne frank comes in out of nowhere just to stir up the emotions a little more this along with some other plot twists came across so insincere that i decided to leave the theater half an hour before the film endedthe fact that tear jerking seems to be a higher priority than offering solace and a good movie leaves a bad taste in my mouth,sad
its a pity a book like this one in a decade from an incredibly talented author to have this fate a disastrous film nothing works first the script almost always its different from the book its based upon which is not a bad thing but here we have a complete misunderstanding from the script writers green constructed his story so beautifully piece by piece with the precision of a clockwork all of his work went down the drain i dont want to go into the details of the story but if youve read the book just dont see this film the casting is a joke two perfectly healthy young boy and girl pretend to be suffering from cancer not even their make up is believable willian dafoe even worse of his usual bad self a disaster the director is a complete failure in directing actors as well as picturing interior or exterior spaces last but not least the music is so bad it sounds like a cheap  very cheap  tv series selection everything in this film is so bad i wouldnt know which is worse in total john reeds masterpiece should have a better fate being filmed of course it seduces teenagers but what do they know,sad
i was totally spellbound on seeing an 82 rating for this movieimdb rating has nowadays become wholly untrustworthythe whole thing seemed like a soap opera series with crying tears and sentimentsif so much people are giving this rating i believe it is only for the sobin real life this is really heartbreaking but for a movie it is sick and patheticthe heroine does not deliver anything and the hero seems worstthe whole movie does not even require a reviewit does not do the main basic reason for a filmto entertainwhether for crying or for laugh or for horror or any other emotionthis movie is for immature people who like to cry on seeing rubbish sentiments,sad
am i the only one who did not like this movie i mean i looove the book but the movie was a disappointment im not trying to be rude or anything i just thought the movie would be better the actors are good but i still imagined them being different i thought that they would  idk what i thought i just think the movie was a disappointment and when i read the book i cried towards the ending when agustus was dying but in the movie i was not even bothered like my eyes were not stinging or anything i think that the movie could have been better if it had a more touching ending and also i did not fell in love with agustus like i did in the book  idk im just sayin this movie could have been one of my favorites but its not honestly thou i just think that the book is too good to have been made into a movie caus im in love with the book im not trying to say that i hated this movie i just didnt like as much as i thought i would,sad
this one is the best one ive seen in a long time the movie was based on a novel written by john green which was a bestseller the plot of the movie is exceptionally brilliant and extraordinary firstly i would like to thank the director who directed the movie in a way that totally matched with the writers thoughts i believe without the eternal connection between the writer  the director this movie might be a big flop i dont know secondly shailene woodley who played the character of hazel grace lancaster was a perfect match for the character and ansel elgort acted tremendously well in his augustus waters role so the casting for the leading roles are perfect match i must sayfinally i recommend everyone to watch this movie because its a true masterpiece,sad
not as bad as i expected from the trailer not as good as i had hoped after seeing the reviews its not all that great but its not bad either its shamelessly even overly sentimental totally unsubtle but hey it works somewhat most of the time probably the biggest reason for this is shailene woodley i remember thinking she was really impressive in the descendants even in her limited screen time then i saw her in the spectacular now and yes i became a bigger fan shes pretty amazing here an actress completely capable of naturally selling the roles she plays without making them ever feel artificial or contrived i wish her a long very successful career and when it comes to certain things shes better than the current itgirl jennifer lawrence ansel elgort doesnt fare as well he has some good scenes but somehow he just comes across pretty unconvincing,sad
i used to be a regular visitor of this site because i would check the ratings to decide whether or not i would watch a movie i dont care to see this movie is rated well above what it deserves it started off nice i thought it was going to tell a realistic love story instead it gave what it said it wasnt a fairy tale and a cheesy one at thatonce you get over the fact that they both have cancer it really isnt a good movie it seems like the fact that they are sick is the only thing carrying this movie some scenes were really unnecessary rushed drawn out and wellboring as the movie went on i couldnt take it anymore so as the lady was trying to help the girl up the ladder i stopped it and returned it there wasnt any love chemistry between the two main characters its more like they liked each other because of the fact that they are both dying the chemistry is so forced that it couldnt fool a disney princessi love romance movies but this was a miss i was expecting a heart melting story considering all of the hype over this movie on the bright side it reminds me of the movie remember me except that was a better movie,sad
one of the best things about tfios was the voice of hazel it put a great creative spin on an otherwise common disease story we dont entirely lose it here its in the narration and in her speech some of the books whimsy comes out with cute choices like placing text messages into speech bubbles above the characters heads in the books font butfrom the beginning we lose the hazels wry commentary and the movie treats the kids diseases as the most pressing issues rather than their mental grappling with them when augustus is introduced he is practically stalkerish in his attention toward hazel which is forgivable only because of his cuteness from here on in its all twee cuteness augustus is a wonderful but impossibly movielike boyfriend who would probably get on your nerves in real life and would also probably be hiding a terrible secret the movie is not as pressing as the book when we go to amsterdam to meet the author that inspires her theres very little urgency or conflict the movie delivers sweetness and young love and it truly is sweet but at times it loses the flavor of the book i will also say the wardrobe and art direction are terrible and that im not sold on shailene woodleys star quality even though her man has one leg it still seems he could do better im knocking this movie a lot but i will recommend the preview audience seemed to laugh and cry in all the right places,sad
what inspired john green to write his six novels including was the suffering he witnessed during his five month stint as a student chaplain in a childrens hospital in an interview with the sydney morning herald he explained how this experience shaped his religious and social views i was enrolled in divinity school and thought i was going to become a minister  im episcopalian  but i was disavowed of that notion pretty quickly while working at the hospital one lesson he learned was the joy that could be found in a short life a central theme of this film adaptation green has a double major in english and religious studies which helped to develop and sell the novel it was on the new york times bestseller list so the film treatment was inevitable particularly at a time when young adult books are servicing teenage girls where hollywood has failed themi havent read the novel but from watching the film and learning about greens background it is clear there are religious metaphors explored in both texts this adaptation is about hazel a teenage girl who was treated for thyroid cancer as a child and now carries an oxygen tank with her everywhere due to the weakness in her lungs she is bored alone and prepared to die in a recovery group she meets a young man named augustus who lost one of his legs to cancer and they toy with the idea of a relationship together through his religious values green is using both these characters as a metaphor for christs suffering christ died at thirtythree a young age but the bible suggests his death helped enrich peoples lives similarly one of the key lines of the film is pain must be felt which stresses the importance of understanding ones preparation for death and also remembering people with fondness once they diethe title of the story is more ambiguous but also encompasses its own biblical connotations the love interest in the film is augustus which is a significant name in the bible caesar augustus ruler of the roman empire was influential in christs birth when he ordered a census be taken for every living person people had to return to their own towns to be registered which sent joseph back to bethlehem and where christ would be born the star of bethlehem led people to discover the birth of christ and later redemptive suffering augustus is a christlike figure a star for hazel because he helps her discover the beauty in pain by adding love and joy to her life in spite of the inevitability of their deaths an early scene in the film pokes fun at some of these ideas with the recovery group being organised by a religious man who lays out a mat with a picture of jesus on it the scene is funny and cynical because its easy to scoff at him when seeing what the kids have been through the first shot of augustus titanium leg gives a frightful jolt its one of the films few real moments yet these same religious undertones in greens book must have impressed a lot of people green is part of the episcopal church a denomination of christianity which would have added to the novels bankability through twilight stephenie meyer transformed conservative religious values into a rich commodity and mormonism was suddenly cool again in the wake of twilights conservatism it is a shame that this fascinating material has been given such a riskaverse treatment the director was josh boone whose only other feature was stuck in love his direction lacks creativity and the film suffers from its over length the camerawork is largely static and few staging directions have been given to the actors who are either standing stationary or sitting down the best choice he makes is planting the camera in tight closeups on hazels face shes played by shailene woodley the descendants divergent a gifted young actress who raises the material because of the natural expressions she discovers on her brow during an early group meeting she shows her discomfort with augustus looking at her only through her expressions no words conversely boone lets the colead ansel elgort overact with a theatrical style of acting and such overt niceness that it lessens the believability of his nearperfect character some of the blame should fall on the source material and the films screenwriters scott neustadter and michael h weber wrote the spectacular now but their script is sorely lacking in conflict between the leads augustus and hazels pleasantries drain the film of any tension theyre better conservationalists than bella and edward discussing the inevitability of oblivion but the plotting around them is dull and increasingly episodic like book chapters too little is also made of the adult characters with laura dern given a terribly underwritten role as hazels mother more conflict could have been generated through the desires of both sets of parents twilight was foremost about chastity but hid it well under the vampire genre this film suffers a similar fate it is about dying grief and remembrance but spends considerably more time on whether hazel and augustus should date or not and swanning around amsterdam it is an injustice to greens experiences because he saw real suffering which doesnt translate here nearly as strongly as it should,sad
is an amazing love story reminding us that it doesnt always end happily ever after bringing a movie out of a book is never an easy task especially not when its an amazing book like this due to this fact i arrived at the theater with some skepticism and concerns 20 minutes into the movie those thoughts were completely blown away replaced with only good ones my reason the cast apart from the mother who wasnt the mother i had gotten to know in the book the cast was impeccable shailene woodley ansel elgort nat wolff willem dafoeeven though im not a fan in general all made this movie into what it is this combined with a fantastic score and some absolutely beautiful scenes took this movie to different heights than i was able to predict astonishing making this movie better than the book was a mission impossible but they sure made a noble attempt one last shoutout goes to shailene woodley who was able to capture the character i grew so fond of in the book perfectly i rarely use the word perfection but it certainly fits the bill in this particular scenario to me shailene you are hazel grace lancaster,sad
i have never seen a worse movie the acting was the worst i have ever seen the dialogue was horrible and it is unrealistic i mean seriously star wars is more realistic and im not the biggest romance movie fan but it is still not good i can deal with it if there is good acting dialogue and is realistic but it has none of those factors it is predictable because they try to make it unpredictable but it doesnt work it gets worse and worse they try to be funny but the jokes fall flat ansel elgort was the worst actor in this and i just wanted everyone to die in this movie it is even worse than titanic 2 and that movie was not good it at least had people die that i didnt like this only had one so it is obviously sucks,sad
please someone stop humanity from romanticizing cancer to make such painfully cheesy love stories out of it that was mighty awfuli dont know what is more embarrassing the beyond ridiculous unrealistic flick itself or the hard to ignore obviousness that they paid a lot of people to give that garbage the same 8stars rating at imdb like ben hur or lord of the rings if i only didnt trust the reviews and not the stars cause they clearly speak a different languageso tired of absolutely healthy looking bad actors trying to convince the world that cancer is a beautiful gift that suddenly makes them see the world like it was disney world full of beauty and amazing adventuresbeing someone whose family is multiple affected i had to forward a couple of times to even finish this twilight leveled bull that has absolutely nothing to do with the harsh reality of cancer there is no poetry in it specially not for affected people in that agethey dont look like that dont act like that dont talk like that dont think like that and dont die like that for gawds sake stop trying to make it look like despite of the ordeal of cancer there is something that makes it any better cancer is painful emotionally and physically its beyond ugly and not a bittersweet enlightening adventurethe height of stupidity were the people clapping when they kissed one another in anne franks house wtf was that i hate that i even had to give one star none at all would have been more appropriate horrible,sad
over the last couple of decades terminaldiseaseatyouthfulromances are dimeadozen in the proliferated korean flick market escalating audience symptoms from indigestion to constipation you probably have heard despite the subject matter is not one of thosethere is one very interesting quote the circumstances for which are incidental and omitted here between the 3 of us we have 5 legs 4 eyes and 25 pair of lungs the three people are the protagonists gus ansel elgort with a smile that wins all hazel shailene woodley and guss delightful sidekick isaac nat wolff equally delightful all cancer patients gus had one leg amputated from just above the knee hazel for all intents and purposes has a plastic oxygen tube anchored to her nostrils all the time oxygen supplied by a portable cylinder she drags around isaac had lost his left eye at the beginning of the movie and then loses the right in the middle of it gus has been free from a relapse for a few years hazels situation is stable while sacrificing both eyes appeared to have preserved issacs life but unfortunately as we all know nothing is really certain in the fantastic realm of cancerlandgus and hazel meet at a cancer support group and eventually fall in love this is not something new to the cinematic world so i wont elaborate the details one thing i want to say is woodley and elgort have set a new bar for the meaning of chemistry in acting together separately they are equally superb on hazels side another wonderful dimension is in laura derns topnotch portrayal of hazels mother frannie while this is not a particularly manipulated tearjerker tear will flow even more so in the motherdaughter scenes than the lovers scenesadditional spoiler warningwhat makes this movie stand out however is the reality and cruelty it does not hold back from depicting a lot of movies with a similar theme would have as the focal point a last wish sort of scenario unabashedly manipulated to give an uplifting conclusion in faults hazel has a dream which gus and frannie help to realize  to visit an author named van houten a brilliantly casted willem dafoe in amsterdam hazel in her sickness clings to a book by van houten about a girl who eventually died of cancer what hazel and gus also wants to do is ask van houten facetoface when happened to the rest of the people surrounding the girl after her death to cut a long story short the three have a dreamlike trip to amsterdam where the young couple is treated to a romantic dinner by the author before the fateful visit the next day this is where the movie shines a rude awakening that all these nice correspondence and gestures are offered only by the authors kindhearted mate van houten turns out to be an obnoxious ultracynical drunk to such an extent of extracting from our lovely heroine the only fourletter word that appears in the entire movieall these happen only in the middle of the movie ironically this common enemy becomes a trigger for the young couple to let go of all their inhibitions and let their love flow the rest of the movie follows a somewhat familiar trajectory there is a plot twist which may be unfamiliar to some but i for one have seen it elsewheredoubtless there will be discussions emerging from the theatre surrounding thing such as what makes hazel and gus tick is van houton truly a villain or just a realistic depiction of a normal human being etc etc but one thing is certain you would want to see more of shailene woodleys movies the divergent series aside something oscarworthy,sad
more likely backedup by bestselling novel from john green is an honest yet faithful love story which containing some positive messages to inspire teenagers the plot flows as a good drama should be thanks to screenwriter scott neustadter and michael h weber who finely adapt john greens genius idea into a soulful play and beautiful drama the script for two central characters hazel grace and gus are well developed it really shows how hazels feeling to gus grows as much time theyve spent together and how they need each other to live despite their imperfect conditions besides that the movie seems taking advantages from shailene woodley and ansel elgorts chemistry who easily makes an adorable couple and put some sweet moments from it unfortunately isnt without its faults the other characters beside hazel and gus may only just supplement seems unimportant and sometimes annoying like van houten character who looks stupid with his strange behavior and builds an awkward scene every time he appears also the film emphasizes more on meeting true love rather than peoples attempt on surviving from cancer that makes it missing some points dont expect the drama would be as complex as 5050 or dallas buyers club because what offers is much focus on couple dating and having romantic dinner is an average good and sweet drama supported by lovely performances from its two impeccable stars but nothing much you could get in it that makes this movie felt just enough on being okay,sad

i have never been surrounded by so many teenage girls before until i sat down to watch this film during an early screening of the alluring teenage film adaptation of john greens novel i was surely the minority of the sexes to be honest i dont think i knew exactly how outnumbered i was until the films tragic scenes unfolded delivering a current of waterworks and overwhelmingly loud wails of screaming crying and sniffling predominantly from female audience members this early screening of the film was jampacked and had me sitting only a row away from the massive screen if josh boones film adaptation of taught me anything its to never underestimate the power of teenage girls and their ability to pack theaters and show their support for films and books they loveis guilty of possessing a number of faults but its biggest sin lies in its persistence to aspire to be greater than it actually is it succeeds when it exposes us to the tragic relationship between its protagonists and the loved ones around them and fails when it aspires to find new territory of plot and redemption for characters that are already born with unlimited amounts of pathoshazel grace lancaster shailene woodley is as much a teenage girl as any other living in the united states her love of reality television reading and curiosity of the taboo is just as strong as other girls within america the only difference hazel grace has terminal cancer should be a film about cancer and how it effects the people surrounded by it think 5050 but it becomes overwhelming with its fascination to overly glamorize the telling of a tainted love story therefore becoming a love story about people with cancer think a walk to rememberfrom the beginning love life and happiness are overshadowed by impending doom and that is perhaps the problem with the film no matter how much you fall in love with hazel grace or augustus waters ansel elgort their fates are sealed greens novel may have been about telling a heartbreaking love story between young teens but much like hazels fascination with her favourite book and the open endedness of a certain literary character hazels happiness is less about coming to terms with death and more about the continuation of the life of her loved ones the interactions with the people who will survive and live well beyond hazels existence are never given their due diligence onscreen especially her mother played delicately by laura dern always being pushed aside by the love story that will ultimately end in unhappiness and tearsthere is sure to be a reason why greens novel has becomes such a pop culture sensation the film is said to be a somewhat loyal adaptation brimming with very clever metaphors of life and death through dialogue and foreshadowing it does a masterful job of fetishizing the most average looking parks backyards and parking lots and makes great use of its supporting actors sadly the two actors that have the most screen time are the two weakest components of the film woodley who is slowly following in the footsteps of emma stone and jennifer lawrence seems to play hazel grace less and herself more with the exception of her chopping off her hair and having an oxygen tank follow her around everywhere she goes woodley only taps the surface of her character hazel grace barely gracing audiences with the brilliance radiating with the promise of such a philosophically pessimistic characterelgort who comes off as a character who is easy to fall in love with shows much of his charm and promise as a young actor elgort as waters shimmers with potential delivering a performance of a person who may be a little too cherry and perfect given sad circumstancesgreen had said to gain the inspiration of the novel by working as a student chaplain at a childrens hospital drawn to the exuberant life of its terminally ill patients green is quoted as saying he wanted to write a book about people who were constantly being dehumanized while showcasing the abundance of humanity in people with a terminal illness the film does an excellent job of making audiences believe that love is what keeps hazel and augustus alive love becomes the answer but only for so long before the inevitability of death at the end of a terminal illness takes hold there is a point where love exists and people fade in the film and although the relationships that held strong are bonded by love hope of an improbably oblivion becomes the films main concerncan be selfassured as being a quality film made for an audience that would be content with halfassed filmmaking the production quality and storytelling is top notch even if its is constantly emotionally manipulating the soundtrack is filled with hyper emo songs the look and feel of the film is drenched with sadness and all hope is lost with each new depressing plot twist and turn thankfully its supporting cast of actors supports the majority of the films life from lotte verbeek a literary assistant who makes the best out of sad situations and breathes new life to new experiences for the couple to a saddened and miserable author played wonderfully by willem dafoe to the underused best friend to the couple isaac played brilliantly by nat wolff the small brief appearances by the people in augustus and hazels life are never given enough screen time to show shattering conclusions when sadness strikes,sad
such a boring movie terrible casting terrible acting and so many things that do not fit into reality like underage kids drinking champagne in the park which is not in a paper bag and champagne cork just pops open when you pull or a suitcase that looks giant and the driver lifts it up like there is nothing in there  details are important to make movie believable both main characters did a terrible job acting you cant feel chemistry at all theyre just reading lines constant staring which is creepy and empty and weird not romantic boring would be better if with someone else as main characters and better job in directing i understand the girl is sick but a little make up wouldnt kill her or girly clothes something that makes it work,sad
okso i saw this moviewhat i think about itit was awfullike the summary says one of the worst movies i have ever seen the story its pretty simplewith basic ideasshes dyingfor like 7 years or sobecause of courseher parents have money and manage to give her all that she needs from my point of view it has too much dramaof course i spilled some tears but just because its all about dying in this moviehow can you not cry a little the only brilliant thing about this story is that writer who says the things as they are right to her facethe first time they meet because the second time at the funeral he just becomes part of her drama trying to help her and all of that i didnt forget about gusthe boy of course there is a boy her boy they where together for a couple of months before they kissedand that kissjust gave her her breath back after she climbed all of those stairsclassic i could talk all day about this moviebut the idea is that its to long for the small idea they are trying to show,sad
my patience is really tested when a romantic film has main characters that are unlikable and ugly the girl in the film has such a nasty detestable face what a miserable cow how on earth does the guy fall in love with that totally incredible never mind the guy is better looking than her but his looks still dont warrant a main starring role in a movie why does hollywood not hire beautiful people so that we actually may enjoy watching eye candy as the love story comedy or drama enfoldsthe scene in the anne frank house is ridiculous two people with cancer on a holiday 5000 miles away from home are going to waste their precious time in a dismal location like that let hollywood remind us for the billionth time about the jews and ww2 and the nazis  even if it has to be jarred into a romantic film if the pretentious girl had any inkling of real intellect and hadnt been nurtured in her sick narcissistic ill naturedness she might have actually managed to go out and do something enjoyable and more out of the ordinary rather than the obligatory us tourist anne frank house visit shes as dumb as the typical sheep who cant think for themselves and simply follow the herd yet she goes about thinking shes so above it all awful smug wench she isavoid this film if youre allergic to ugly people playing leading roles in romantic films that have no other effect than making you depressed,sad
this review may contain spoilersthis weekend i had an opportunity to watch one of the most disgusting films cinema has to offer and to believe it earned around 286 million has just left me bewildered the film is an extremely romanticized version of reality and takes on a cathartic display which was supposed to evoke a few tears but ended up doing the oppositeyesi had a few laughs there this film in my view is cancer for young minds which inspires you to hold onto fallen ideals this film is strictly for those with the bleeding heart syndrome very aptly put by the highly revered most watched leading man in television historythe metaphor is strictly a test of your coherence  cigarette in mouth without lighting it up is supposed to be funny or cool or whateverthe film invites ridicule and a certain farcical exuberance could never hurt the creators but certainly does to the viewersthe movie is definitely aspires to be like its idol a paragon of self pity  yeah you guessed it right nicholas sparksas if one was not enough the only character i liked in the film was that of the author broodingaloofmisanthropic but ruins it all when he shows up at the funeral with a letter in towthis film has nothing new to offer and is as cheesy as  well cheese and the fact that this movie will have a bollywood remake  yeah i saw this comingi would like to believe that i have given you a fairly ingenious outline as to what this movie brings to the fore,sad
oh my gosh how on earth did a movie this bad get a rating so high i swear i am losing trust in the imdb rating where do i start  the hazel thing was so unlikable so flat unbelievable  not for one second did i believe that she went through any pain let alone cancer  the boy is so polished and perfect looking that he is not believable as a normal guy  let alone an amputee  and a cancer survivor and assuming he is virgin is just  crazy at best  the storyline is so fictional you cant engage  yeah right he gave his wish to a girl he didnt even kiss yet  the doctor said a clear no  yet her mother took her  despite the fact that she went to the emergency room shortly before that  am a mother and would never approve this  and as if it couybe crazier they add the rude author thing  who on the face of the earth talks like this to a sick girl who is enthusiastic about his book  and we never learn why  and if hebis so crazy why just why did the woman invite them  and couldnt she at least moved the messy mail minutes before they came  no just no and then they kiss  and people clap  why just why  then there was the love scene which was so boring i checked my instagram then the guy  who doesnt have a single scratch on his face or not even a black under his eyes  not even a tired face decides to tell her he is dying despite looking strangly alive and spotless  she cries with artificial tears  i have been in a cancer hospital i have seen cancer patients i have seen people in pain people dying  they look nothing like that  they talk nothing like that  they are deep and painful to just deal with oh i can go on but i dont have time for this rubbish and it already stole two precious hours of my time its just that it was so bad i felt responsible to add my voice to those who have a sound mind  ,sad
what do you get if you combine a walk to remember and my girl 2you get this unoriginal piece of crap the man who wrote the book this movie is based upon have taken key story lines from better films and then written an under preforming story that for some reason made it to film despite the actors best effort all characters comes off as cliches that predestined to just be there because the plot demands them to be they authors idea of how teenagers behave is ludicrous and frankly just made me laugh besides the plot holes and random behaviors like egging cars for no reason and letting your child travel alone to another continent you can clearly see where the author have stolen things from better work and then had nothing to full the rest of the story with i have never wanted the lead characters in a film to die so badly as this one just so that i wont have to see a sequel,sad
its a romantic movie even if its full of drama its a movie you really have to learn a masterpiece as i was rarely given to see i would try to make a top but it is very difficult for me its as good as the bucket list as good as it gets the notebook and just a few examples,sad
everyone really hyped this movie up so i was excited to see it but alas it disappointed its not that it was bad but it just wasnt as good as everyone made it out to bethe acting was fine as were the directing and just about everything else in the movie there just wasnt anything really great about it recommend only if you like teen dramas,sad
i just wanna explain what i feel its just likea knife in our hearts ,sad
this was such a long overly dramatic movie which honestly felt like every other movie of the genera acting was fine but the dialogue was pretentious creating such fake characters anyone over 15 years old will predict every story beat that will come the saving grace here is unsurpringly willem dafoe with his character being a grumpy drunk writer the movie intends to prove him wrong but his character was so well done i couldnt help but agree with him more i know this review will be unpopular but i just found this movie lacking any sense of reality to its characters and its plot has been done so often,sad
i saw the trailer for this movie obviously it was marketed as a big tearjerker movie the title comes from a quote from julius caesar by william shakespeare the fault dear brutus is not in our stars but in ourselves for we are underlings it basically means that the fault is in the lead characters stars i hoped for something worth my time basically teenager hazel grace lancaster divergents shailene woodley lives in indianapolis she has terminal thyroid cancer that has spread to her lungs her mother frannie laura dern believing her to be depressed urges to attend a weekly cancer patient support group to make friends with people going through the same thing there hazel meets charging teenager augustus gus waters baby drivers ansel elgort he lost his leg from bone cancer but has since apparently been cancerfree they bond at his house over their hobbies they both agree to read each others favourite book hazel recommends an imperial affliction a novel about a cancerstricken girl named anna that parallels her experience and augustus gives hazel counter insurgence they keep in touch via text over the weeks that follow and grow closer gus expresses frustration when finishing the book having an abrupt ending it ends in the middle of a sentence hazel tells that the mysterious author peter van houten willem dafoe retreated to amsterdam after the books publication he has not been heard from since weeks later gus tells hazel he has traced van houtens assistant lidewij lotte verbeek hazel corresponds with van houten by email she writes wanting to find out more about the novels ambiguous ending van houten replies that he is only willing to answer her questions in person hazel asks her mother if she can travel to amsterdam to visit him but frannie refuses because of financial and medical difficulties gus suggests she uses her makeawish foundation cancer wish but she has already used it to go to disney world gus and hazel go on a picnic date and begin to fall in love he surprises her with tickets to amsterdam there is a medical setback but hazels doctors allow the trip they expect that she will soon become incapable of doing anything at all hazel and gus arrive in amsterdam they have reservations at an expensive restaurant paid for by van houten during the meal gus confesses his love for hazel the following afternoon they meet van houten at his house but are shocked to find he is an alcoholic lidewij paid for the trip and the dinner without his knowledge angered he taunts hazel for seeking answers and belittles her medical condition hazel leaves utterly distraught lidewij invites them to go sightseeing to make up for their ruined experience the three visit the anne frank museum where hazel struggles up the stairs gus and hazel spend that night together in their hotel and have sex for the first time the next day gus tells her that his cancer has returned and spread throughout his body and is terminal hazel is heartbroken expressing how unfair life can be returning to indianapolis gus health worsens he is taken to the icu and realizes he is close to death gus invites his blind best friend isaac nat wolff and hazel to his prefuneral where they deliver eulogies that they have both prepared hazel tells him she would not trade their short time together for anything gus dies eight days later hazel is astonished to see van houten at the funeral he tells her that gus had demanded he attend his funeral to make up for the spoiled trip van houten tells her that his novel is based on the experiences of his daughter anna who died at a young age from leukemia he gives a piece of paper she screws it up and asks him to leave later talking with isaac hazel learns that gus had asked van houten to help him write a eulogy for her she retrieves the screwedup paper it is gus writing about accepting his death and about his love for her she lies on her back on her lawn looking up at the stars smiling as she remembers augustus and says okay theyre special way of saying i love you also starring true bloods sam trammell as michael lancaster ana dela cruz as dr maria randy kovitz as dr simmons david whalen as gus dad and milica govich as gus mom woodley gives a charming performance whilst constantly wearing the breathing tubes elgort is endearing despite some cheesy dialogue they are a believable doomed couple obviously it is full of sentimentality and mushiness and manipulative bits that try to draw tears but it is also witty and amusing in the right places its not a bad romantic drama worth watching,sad
i have no idea why people enjoyed this movie it was booooooring if i have to make a comparison i will compare this movie with me earl and the dying girl  watch both movies side by side both have similar stories but me earl and the dying girl is executed beautifully and it keeps you engage while this movie boooooringokay it started good and then it just kept on pushing to be boring hazel grace i felt she is selfish yes i know it sucks to have cancer but its not just you who is suffering but people around you are in the boat and to be honest since they introduced gus i knew he is going to die at the end one way or another so there was no mystery therei really recommend you to watch me earl and the dying girl trust me it will bring tears to your eyes and it is refreshing unlike sorry but this is what i feel and it is too long should be around 1 hour 10 minutes,sad
im gonna be real i dont watch many romantic movies so im not an expert in the romance genre i gave this movie 3 stars for arguments sake i dont wanna be completely biased when i knew what i was getting myself into that being saidthis movie was all the rage when it came out and my friends were peer pressuring me to go see it so we did i honestly couldnt care less whether hazel lived or died or her whole ordeal as coldhearted as that may sound because shes an obnoxious selfish selfcentered spoiled brat she goes as far as telling her parents she knows they wont get over her probable death and basically their whole lives would be over to which they basically replied nah mate we cool understandably so i also dont think cancer patients look that healthy or athletic ie gus but what do i know the only character that i felt was in touch with reality is the writer but of course angsty teen princess hazel wants none of this bs how dare he tell her to get over herself i dont even wanna touch the scene where they go to anne frank house because itll make me reconsider my 3 stars rating and im struggling to keep an open mind about this movie i really am if a movie about a bunch of spoiled brats is supposed to make us sympathize with them just because they have cancer then i guess im cold as ice,sad
this romantic drama film is about a teenage couple in the midwest who are both dying of cancer this sentimental film is very disappointing  i dont know why its so popular it was misleadingly promoted as a film in which the main characters enjoy fulfilling happy lives in spite of their bad health its actually a feelbad film about cancer and death why did they cast a plain girl as hazel it would have been much more powerful if theyd cast a beautiful girl who loses her looks as she becomes more seriously ill i can see that the makers of the film were aiming it at teenage girls by having a plain protagonist get a tall handsome older boy whos out of her league however by doing so theyve made the relationship unrealistic and the film unappealing to the rest of the population they also made the mistake of having her no more or less ill at the end of the film than she is at the beginning of iteighteenyearold gus tells hazel that hes a virgin its highly unlikely that a lad whos tall and of significantly aboveaverage looks would reach 18 without having intercourse even if he has a false leg even if he were that unfortunate he wouldnt admit it to a girl whom hes sexually attracted to  because shed laugh at him and never want anything more to do with him hazel is surprised but not bothered they have sex together once but we dont find out whether or not shed previously had sex with anyone elsethe amsterdam portion of the film is very disappointing hazel is inexplicably angrily disappointed about a novel ending abruptly and travels to amsterdam four thousand miles away to meet the author they go for three days  who makes an eight thousand mile return trip for such a short time this reclusive author pays for these two strangers to him to have dinner in an upmarket restaurant and then welcomes them into his house however he then angrily rebukes hazel for criticising the end of the novel in question in the restaurant the teen couple pretend to the staff that theyre married this is totally unnecessary in present day amsterdam  a very sexually liberal city in any case very few teens in the western world are married theyre only in amsterdam for two or three days during which they choose to go to the anne frank house  but dont even suggest going to the redlight district are these the most boring teens in the world at gus funeral hazel is introduced as his special friend who the hell uses that term in modern america when referring to young heterosexuals who are in a sexual relationship the usual term used  even by prudes  is girlfriendwe never find out anything about the two main characters lives before they had cancer the film would have been better with some flashbacks to that to give us more context and background of what their lives were like then,sad
is one of the most talked about films from last year and this over 2hourlong film won big at several awards shows that were mostly aimed at younger audiences it is the second directorial effort by josh boone and the writing came from the team that worked on 500 days of summer lead actress is shailene woodley and her male colead is played by ansel elgort the supporting cast includes oscar nominees like laura dern and willem dafoe this movie is about a woman suffering from cancer but thats really just the background story with the big c always present we get to watch how she spends her final months with friends and familywoodley is truly outstanding in the lead and there is no denying that she easily belongs to the most talented actresses from her age group she took a break from acting between 2007 and 2011 but returned by holding her own against hollywood star george clooney in the oscarwinning the descendants and since then its been a triumphant walk for her leading several movies this one here is just another great addition to her rsum unfortunately i am not too big on ansel elgort here there is something pretty offputting about him in several occasions i am not sure if its the way the character was written his mediocre acting or a combination of both in any case he looked really weak compared to woodley and i cant see him carry a movie that runs for over 2 hours and he is in it for 15 hours pretty much i rarely had the impression i was watching a genuine character instead of a performancethe script is fine for the most part sometimes it gets into territory in which it feels it sacrifices realism for a sob story but thats fine as it only is maybe 2 or 3 times i think in terms of the subject this still could have been much more authentically emotional but what the writers came up with isnt a failure either i did not know dafoe was in this film but i enjoyed his short performance i honestly did not need the second part of his cameo near the ending as it wasnt nowhere near as memorable as his first couple scenes all in all i cannot agree with the critics and awards bodies who really loved this movie still i believe this is a decent watch its just that i would not put it anywhere near my favorite 2014 movies my favorite cancerthemed film of all time is still a walk to remember but back to this one shailene woodley is very much outstanding in here too bad she is the only real reason to check it out,sad
this could so easily have gone wrong a story about two teenagers facing life threatening cancer risks being overlysentimental but while being a real tearjerker this treads the fine line with skill and warmth hazel has thyroid lesions which have metastasised to her lungs and throughout the film wears a breathing tube and lugs around a portable oxygen tank gus has n osteosarcoma condition which has stabilised after the amputation of one leg they meet at a support group for youngsters experiencing cancer and her favourite novel an imperial affliction takes them to amsterdam where nothing goes as they expectsince the movie is based on a bestselling young adult novel by john green it will find a ready audience in spite of its serious subject but those who dont know the novel like me will find this an impressive and moving work because of the fine acting by the two leads  shailene woodley and ansel elgort both of whom star in the divergent series  and the assured direction by young josh boone of course it is easy to be cynical about a film like this dismissing it as mere manipulation but ultimately all cinema indeed all art is manipulative and this is not a selfpitying rather a lifeaffirming talefootnote the title of the novel and the film comes from shakespeares julius caeser when cassius declares the fault dear brutus is not in our stars but in ourselves that we are underlings for hazel and gus their cancer is in the stars but their response to such tragedy is ultimately in themselves,sad
josh boone did an incredible job of bringing one of john greens best books to life very few main parts were left out after the screening josh and john were present for a qa and explained that parts that were left out were indeed filmed just not included they did this to cut down on run time as well as exclude parts that did not directly pertain to the advancement of augustuss and hazels love story one part that they did cut was johns cameo the cannula scene which is to be included along with all other cut parts in the bluray edition of tfios my dad who has not read the book and is not a romance guy loved it overall it was truly a pretty faithful bookadapt and both shailene and ansel delivered our favorite characters perfectly as well as the rest of the cast no matter how minor the part i cannot wait for the rest of the world to see our book become a movie it was such a privilege to see at an early screening like i was able to with divergent,sad
i went to see this with my two teenage daughters after one of them had read the book it basically is about two teenage cancer sufferers who are dealing with their illnesses and meet at a support group in a local church she is the sicker of the two but he is the one who dies first it just could have been so much more with long scenes of seemingly irrelevant conversations and little about them i felt that i didnt really know either of them at the end and it was all just a huge disappointment it is a typical hollywood conversion of a good book into an innocuous film i didnt feel too cheated as we went on a tuesday where tickets are cheaper but id have been annoyed to see this at full price great for girls aged 12  15 but not their parents,sad
its not that i do not have feelings you know or that i do not respect orand admire people who have or had cancer its just that the entire movie fell in a clich everything i know that is hard topic but lets face itwhen a film about cancer is in the billboards everybody thinks is a excellent movie when the big c is present in the synopsis hollywood had banalized and trivialized the topic there is a movie almost every year about it that the people just adore em the industry must look for other ways to show to the common people how hard is the whole topic the avant garde films about the topic are not as recognized as they would be la guerre est dclar or maybe even 5050 that took the whole drama of the illness with a grownup patient its well done movie and the end is fresh yeah i like the end but its still a hollywood movie made for the teenagers specially females really specially who wants to see how love works and then dream about it until theyre 30 and they are still singles,sad
is not much more than a clich romance movie but with one main difference  the theme of cancer the fact that both the protagonists have cancer could have given this otherwise atrociously shallow movie some depth but it didnt the cancer theme was poorly handled and despite dealing with such an important and sensitive issue the movie doesnt rise to anything more than an unoriginal and clich chick flick by using its cancer theme purely as a vehicle for romance this movie ends up feeling wrong its offensivesee this movie is essentially like porn for women the female lead is a girl most girls can identify with except that she has cancer the male lead is as usual with these type of movies the boy of every girls dreams except that he has cancer hes handsome clever fit alpha male etc inexplicably he has eyes only for the female lead of course and is a virgin so its basically just another romance movie cancer doesnt give this movie any depth but its poor handling of the sensitive theme does make it more offensive oh and no kissing where anne frank spent several miserable years doesnt make your movie any better its just offensivenormally i wouldnt review this stuff but this is the most overrated movie on imdb,sad
i strongly dislike this movie the love story physically makes me ill i wouldnt recommend it to anyone unless you are a desperate and sappy teenager it is based on an extremely unlikely romance between two young teenagers who obviously only like each other because they come from similarly rough backgrounds and are so desperate to have a relationship that they start seeing the first person they bump into in all fairness i did find the acting in this moving particularly from hazel quite good her pain when gus dies is quite convincing but unfortunately good acting in one scene is not enough and this movie and book turned out to be a complete waste of time please dont put yourself through the pain of watching it,sad
this movie was full of messages from the writer or director that were offensivethey dont entertain today rather they usually have to give the proles messages on how to think and livehere is a samplingwhen selling a swingset the girl has to add the word pedophilic to its description which the guy had listed as merely lonelywhy would it need to be connected to pedophiliaoh i get it nowadays pedophiles are funny and cutewho would think of a swing set as pedophilic yet this was coming from the female lead so i guess shes right  sarcasmthe christian guy leading the support group is made out to be an idiot even kissing an image of jesus on a large rug he is rolling outthey make light of his testicular cancer and portray him as a pathetic dweebthe only sick character they make fun ofyet they then egg the car of the ex gfbeautiful blonde of course of the jewish kid because she dumps him because she cant handle his illness of eye cancerso she gets judged for her rejection of himwhich was her rightyet they show no tolerance for the christian and his illness and even make him out as an idiot for his beliefs when the girls mom comes out of the house they warn her to go back in because her daughter committed a grave injusticeso these self righteous little thugs egg her daughters car more while she sheepishly goes back inadmonished by these monsterslesson herewe can be intolerant of you if youre a christian but if you dump the jewish kid for going blind we get to vandalize your car and threaten your mom and its all ok because we judge her as intolerant in a way we disapprove ofthe lead guy tells her she could write a story even better than a celebrated author by adding blood guts and ritual sacrificethat makes it better hahaoh we get it were supposed to laughritual sacrifice another funny topichahaafter this it seemed like karma that the guy who instigated all this was dying in an especially miserable wayi was thinkingsee mr self righteousshow intolerance and you sufferbut i think the director missed this ironythe last message ran throughout and was nihilistic on the extreme constant assertions that theres nothing after this life because their miserable disease wouldnt be allowed by a caring god and yet also preaching about how beautiful their love washintshow it mr director dont preach itanyway if it was just a 1 year blip in a dying works where everything just ceases to existthen how meaningful was it anywaytwo hours misspent but yet enlightening in that i saw first hand the propaganda hollywood is pushing on young peoplesadbut lapped up like milk by the young kids watchingadd they saidamaaaazing,sad
is my personal favorite movie of the romantic genre this movie shows the meaning of love and life with some twists and turns it also shows the beauty and the bitterness of life after watching this movie you will learn to love and live fully or at least remember your first love i didnt feel like i loved the movie or the book better both are extraordinarily great and the movie keeps the heart of all the lovers of the noveli wouldnt feel shy at all telling that the movie made me a crybaby for 126 minutes oh no my eyes were just wet it unfolded so many emotions and feelings it seriously touched my heart overall it is a mustwatch movie,sad
im giving this a 3 because i gave boyhood a 2 and i think this movie deserves slightly betteri gave boyhood a 2 because i come from china and i know what abysmal means and i wanted to separate boyhood from those films that actually deserved absolute trashbut thats it thats the only reason this film is getting the extra 2 points from mehonestly im losing faith in imdb and rotten tomatoes and all critics and the general audience how do people give such high scores for such pretentious and empty filmsim not one of the people who think that visually pleasing films are the best however i think people who would back any indie film and attack the ones disagreeing as shallow and ignorant are equally annoying i dont think theres any superiority in genre and concluding you must be one of those that love transformers is a pretty weak arguing pointanyway rants aside i think this movie is extremely childish and unrealistic the story kinda parallels twilight and 50 shades only it made the fantasy ride on a tragedy to seem more deep and mature it really makes me wonder how much the authors of these books experienced in life to have came up such unrealistic crapterminal cancer patients dont behave or look like this oh gosh this is so disturbing to me couldnt they have picked somebody else for the actors cancer patients dont look this healthy gus was one that needed to lose a limb but still had that healthy skin and beefy body huh even the cgi for the prosthesis was so fake i guess his shin was just too bulky to make it look like it was just a stick underneath the pantshaleys character was really unlikable the girl had more negativity and aloofness than bella from twilight plus she liked to get all deep and talk about some philosophy that the pretentious teenagers love i was totally wondering where gus got all that stuff he talked about in his final love letter how did you see this girl as all those good qualities anyway i had minimal impression of her being smart or caringgus was unreal the philosophy was incredibly naive and pretentious his way of dealing with things were childish the way people responded werent much real either i mean you give that speech at a middle aged lady and she lets you throw eggs at her car and house and all that applauding when they kissed im surprised they even let haley continue climbing and yeah a virgin thats about to die has that much confidence in landing girls who dont even want to talk huh also even putting the character aside the actor had very bad acting skills for a leadthis movie makes no sense was it written by a 15 year old i can forgive someone that age for thinking this is good philosophy and realistic love and a good storyoh wait the movie wasnt all naive and pretentious the writer was a character with some dimensions and the writer had a good point but they made the writer such an asshole that it was impossible to redeem him or explain his reason in the endin all just a very naive and unrealistic movie with pretentious philosophies and childish fantasies,sad
i have never cried so much or been more entertained by a movie i was a bit skeptical about watching this after reading the book to which i gave 2010 starsbut i am deeply relieved that hey stuck so closely to the book john green i take my metaphorical hat off to you sir you have delivered an amazing read and the director has kept to the story this movie was everything i was hoping for and more it doesnt happen very often when you read an amazing book and put the movie in the same amazing box i never have i have been greatly disappointed at times now if only they can do the same with looking for alaska now i must go because as i am typing this review the tears have started yet againthats the thing about pain it demands to be felt,sad
love conquers all i saw starring shailene woodley and ansel elgort tonight at amc theatres hazel shailene woodley meets gus ansel elgort at a cancer support group meeting and they basically fall in love hazel does have doubts about falling in love because of her terminal health condition stating shes a ticking timebomb but gives in to gus who really goes hard for her i really liked how they both were very witty even knowing their lives would eventually end i also liked his style of trying to land a date not too aggressive but romantic to say the least nothing like two virgins going on a picnic  an imperial affliction by peter van houten played by willem dafoe was a book mainly hazel was obsessed with but her boyfriend gus becomes interested in what the book was about what it had to offer to their relationship and her real story not her cancer story this led hazel gus and her mother frannie played by laura dern to take a dream trip to amsterdam netherlands seeking out answers to their questions regarding van houtens bookthe end of the movie is quite tragic and emotional but theres a twist of irony prior to the tragic ending how would you like to attend your own funeral tom sawyer did in the adventures of tom sawyer i would say if you go see it take a box of kleenex brand your significant other or close friend with you so you have someones shoulder to cry on just sayin i give it a rating of 910 go see it maverickradio,sad
the title reflects my demeanor not the movie perhaps i missed something here but to me the movie was more about a sweet teenage love story than it was about cancer i am an adult woman and i really think this movie was geared towards teenagers who clearly got something out of this that i did not the acting was really good but unlike every other viewer this movie did not touch me as it did others it was not sad until the end but it still did not rock me or make me cry i did not think it was an incredibly depressing film but it also did not pull me in as much as i thought it would its more of a 65 and it was worth a saturday night but did not live up to the hype in my opinion,sad
just watched this with my movie theatreworking friend we both were touched by the story of a couple of young adults hazel shailene woodley and gus ansel elgort both of whom have cancer and their eventual love affair one thing they bonded over was a novel about another character with their disease which got them to take a trip to holland to meet the books author van houten willem dafoe ill stop there and just say theres plenty of touching moments between the couple but also some funny scenes and lines to offset some of the sadness i also liked laura dern as hazels mother and gus friend isaac nat wolff really both me and my friend enjoyed this enough so on that note i highly recommend,sad
note if you think this is another chickflick a stupid perverted rom com or a depressing story about cancer attention it isntbeing a true fan of john greens the fault i was looking forward to its movie adaptation with great anticipation and this movie is just spot on josh boone was successful to bring out the essence of the book on the big screen in the right manner the actors portraying the characters were utterly perfect and had a great understanding about their roles ill start by talking about the rising enigma ie shailene woodley known for her lead role in divergent she plays the terminallyill hazel grace like no one else could have  makes me see hazel in a new light i greatly appreciate the qualities hazel possesses of empathy kindness wit and nononsense attitude i laughed with her i cried with her  most of all i understood her that is what a protagonist is supposed to make you feel like and she did her job well the world is not a wishgranting factory now my favorite character ie augustus waters who is portrayed by the new and talented actor ansel elgort seen in carrie and divergent i am just biased when it comes to him first of all i am irrevocably in love with augustus waters secondly ansel is just so cute and charming like a peacock in this rolethat i cannot even describe it to the best of my capabilities hes just adorable sigh he came in hazels life and changed it forever likewise he changed mine tooso i was talking about anselgus he did his role of a pretentious dramatic metaphorbelieving witty and funny augustus with utmost perfection but when it came to cute vulnerable loving caring  and emotional augustus he broke all the dams that were holding my tears back i literally cried i wont give any spoilers though those who have read the book know what i am talking about and those who havent should a read it what are you waiting for its a thin book with a roller coaster of emotions  b after reading the book watch the movie because this is among the best book adaptations everthen the cuteblind best friend isaac is played by natt wolff he is a great comicrelief in this movie i loved how naturally he said all his lines like a normal person does but i wish he had more scenes just like in the book he was great though so was hazels mom played by laura dern she reminded me of my own mom hazels father patrick from supportgroup  last and the least pun intended peter van houten were all like a fragmentation of my imagination put into realitythank you john green for bestowing the world with your acerbic wit in the form of fault and thank you josh boone for making it so perfect in a nutshell this movie is worth every smile every tear every laugh watch it with your bffs or alone and have the time of your life okay okaythis movie is worth all the hype it is creating and is already my favorite romantic movie ill rate it with ,sad
is amazing i read the book long before watching the movie and had extremely high expectations i almost didnt want to go and see it because i didnt want it to be ruined for me but i did go and see it and wow i dont even know how to explain it it was perfect the acting was spot on shailene and ansel portrayed hazel and augustus perfectly the storyline was followed and the quotes were there yes one of the characters from the book wasnt in the movie hazels friend kaitlyn but even without her i didnt like her much anyway just my opinion the movie was fantastic john green wrote an amazing book and the movie version was amazing too i cried i laughed i awhed but mostly cried i definitely recommend this movie to everyone i also recommend the book im not much of a reader myself but i thoroughly enjoyed it the movie brought it to life you will instantly fall in love with hazel grace lancaster and augustus waters,sad
is based on a ya novel that somehow becomes a sensation its basically one of those which defines the generations admiration to literature and music and it majestically expresses them quite sincerely the movie gives a perfect vision to their blissful moments as a youth but its also an uplifting drama about the risks of having cancer and it might be a difficult thing to balance between the sad parts and their happiness and fortunately it doesnt become a problem its not as completely powerful as it should be but its wise enough to just embrace its aesthetics and soulits actually not an original thing to see a love story about two sick people trying to gloss over their pain with a relationship hazel and guss interaction keeps it simple attempting to forget the real problems of their condition these types of drama tend to over sentimentalizing the unpleasant truth behind the person in every single moment but instead they most of the time just express who they are the painful moments only happens when it has to remind the two that they are still living with a fatal disease the film remarkably hits the right note in both elements the romance is distinctly endearing the truly soulful moments that arent meant to be taken away and the crucial parts which straightly display the reality of what they are going throughthey are definitely affecting but only at the fine level the real impact only comes occasionally and when it goes there it becomes triumphant the film just needed a lot more contemplation at the rest of the depression its probably too busy focusing at the sweet stuff but that couldnt be a big flaw anyway the movie just could have suggested to be tougher still im glad it manages to flesh out these characters beyond their struggles the leading cast shines all around shailene woodley is pretty natural as she imbues the characters personality more than just the angsty feelings it works in both ways but we get to know hazel better at the brighter side ansel elgort shares the same feat by showing off his charms until the performance becomes a nuance when the situation has got a lot serioushas favored enough for the fans by being a really good and faithful adaptation of the popular book but a better movie would deeply contemplated more on the serious stuff nevertheless the film still keeps the themes effective the characters are wonderfully developed and the drama doesnt rely too much on making the audience cry overall its a pretty strong film which standout by its outstanding performances and a direction that fully understands the environment and subtext of every scene unlike most ya films and i guess that is what everybody needed for this adaptation,sad
this was certainly one of my most anticipated movies of the year simply because i had read the novel and i really liked it therefore my expectations were extremely high and that is always a problem because for most of the times i end up being disappointed to some degree and so i did expect something a little bit different in terms of emotion but the movie was extremely similar to the novel aside from a few changes still i never got to reach that moment were i felt that this was an adaptation of the book i really loved and enjoyed in many levels it was something i was hoping for and it never delivered except for a few crucial scenes moreover the acting was excellent shailene woodley and ansel elgort were spectacular and were the perfect choice for the characters of hazel and augustus but the movie was shailenes she owned every scene and was great once again while ansel he was great too in the way he acted and how he expressed himself and his mannerisms but i didnt like his physical appearance for the character to me he wasnt augustus in the outside but only in the inside but overall they had a very beautiful chemistry and it showed also laura dern was excellent too the movie looked very beautiful the cinematography gave another sense to the whole movie by not looking like another teen love story about cancer but a real love story about real people furthermore the ending was something that i knew was coming and that would give me chills and it was everything i knew it would be it was extremely emotional and just perfect therefore this was a very good movie that even though was just like the book to me it lacked some of the pathos that really made the book very special but maybe that was just because i knew it was coming but still its a very beautiful romantic movie that should please many fans of the book and also those who havent that will end up falling in love with hazel and augustus june 5 2014,sad
i read the book by john green in one morning it was a quick read but it was uncomfortable to read in its sadness this novel was about the love story between two cancerstricken teenagers i am surprised it was a bestseller given the books topic seemed so morose and upsetting for the young adults that it targets while it had its effective moments the book had a language that tended to be rather indulgent and unrealistic given the age of its teen protagoniststhe film is a very faithful adaptation of its source novel it is so faithful that the faults of the book also become its faults the film is two hours and ten minutes long it felt too long sometimes wallowing too much in its own misery luckily the dialog in the films script were more believably teenage i enjoyed the delightful animation used to show us the text messages between the two lovers the wonderful soundtrack consisted of cool songs by ed sheeran and several other indietype musicians this type of music highly complemented the films youthful angstalso the film benefits from the earnest performances from its main cast shailene woodley has a malleable face not too perfectly pretty or distinct just right for portraying a wide array of characters she was really very effective as hazel grace given that this was such a difficult part to play demanding both physically and emotionally ansel elgort had the charisma required to play her ideal boyfriend augustus the unbelievable perfection of his character as written becomes his limitation as actor ironically for me the best parts of the book did not materialize that well on screen these were their dutchmotif picnic in the park and their hearttoheart talk about the new pet scan result the way ansel elgort delivered his lines in these two important scenes were not clear enough to create the welling dramatic impact they did in the book the script did not even include that highlyemotional moment towards the end when there was dead silence after a recording of a beloved voice invited to leave a voice mailoverall i think this film is good to watch depending on your mood it can give you a good cry if you let it though i thought the book might be more effective a tearjerker than the film the best thing about this film is seeing woodley and elgort together as hazel and gus the both of them had captured so well the essential chemistry of these two star crossed lovers as described in the book and this saves the film from being too depressing,sad
when you first watch it it seems like a perfectly harmless and sad talebut look a little deeper i mean first of all cancerstricken teens are not this hot and why is their death being romanticized and why do they kiss in the anne frank house sorry but you can do whatever you want to your fictional sick people but anne was a real person and she wasnt sick she was murdered and using her memory as the backdrop for a romantic moment is disgusting and why does everyone in the museum clap so bizarre borderline offensive totally bland white people weepy,sad
its the first time i ever felt like my heart completely immersed inside a movie with a heart wrenching dialogues  the story is extremely sad with a small twist and turns each character expressed there way of emotions well i almost cried a lot through out the movie and some time this is all we need an eternal love to live in this small part of the universe,sad
is one of the best movies i have ever seen the 126 minutes is worthwhile it is one of the most captivating most romantic not to mention incredibly hilarious as well i was initially skeptical about what the book had to offer but i stand corrected immediately after finishing the book i went on to watch the film and to be completely honest i was not completely disappointedi was immensely touched by the scenes of this film how perfectly it has adapted from the book this movie is by far one of the most realistic films i have watched reflecting upon how life is not what you anticipate it to always be wishes dont always come true reference in the film the world is not a wishgranting factory and each and every single person should live their lives to the fullest before it is too late has broadened my perspective of this world and of how invaluable life isa sorrowful ending indeed leaving many of us in tears but just like an imperial affliction john green did leave to us many mysteries in which we will never be able to find out that is if john green is similar to that of van houten which i highly doubt although i had my reasons as to why i only gave this an 810 one of the main reasons which you all may find somewhat trivial is that the characters in the film were not what i had initially imagined them to be like isaac should have been uglier dont you think what happened to all the things that were described in the film like having too big pupils and leaving out parts which i found somewhat significant such as augustus deceased exgirlfriend i also wanted more scenes to the time when gus passed away if youre going to make this film sad why not make everyone cry their eyes out all in all it was an amazing film regardless of the issues i may have had with it,sad
this is my first review ever this film drives me to this its one of the best movie i have ever watched i decided to write this review cause the film has impressed me a lot i prefer drama not romance but i decided to give a chance to tfios cause some friends advise me to i have read the book and enjoyed it first of all i highlight the acting of shailene and ansel mostly shailene they formed a perfect couple is dificult to think they dont have a real affair indeed i think they have or did hazel is depressed in the beginning cause she is ill when gus told her she is beautiful she doesnt agree because she is depressed gus was able to conquer hazels heart by means of empathy he asks her what she likes most and worked to realize such desire i think this is the best way to conquer a person the scene of the first kiss in anne frank house is a reference to the old film the diary of anne frank 1959 in that film anne frank kissed her boyfriend at the attic right before the nazis arrived hazel is not sure about the afterlife but gus is certain but i think gus started to doubt about it because of this he decided to attend his funeral eulogy in case he couldnt attend after death the end of the film i think is a metaphor for hazels death observe that she closed her eyes at the very end the scene at the house of peter van houtin was difficult to watch when i watched the film a second time i skipped this scene at all i think hazel decided to change the eulogy at the real funeral because she rather to say something more oriented to guss parents after the first encounter with peter van houtin she realized that a writer is totally different from his work as a writer and stopped to search for answers finally i would say i loved this film and recommend for those who want to watch a good story and fall in love with hazel,sad
hazel hazel hazellike the character the courage to accept the truth that one has to live with what they have accepting this fact is difficult living with it and that too living happilyoh parameshwar  unbelievable thoughtanother best scene was talking about your funeral planning and discussing it with your only loved oneslike itits a very good movie not only for the people who know the value of love but especially for the humans who want to be loved but do not have an idea about the want they have ,sad
the infamous quote from julius caesar basically translates we make our own fates the stars dont tell us them john green contradicts shakespeare with his title hes saying that children diagnosed with cancer like hazel and augustus in the movie have their fates written in the stars the title itself demonstrates how intelligent and deep the movie is before watching this movie i didnt know what to think i was really expecting it to be just another average romance and i hadnt even known that it was a tragedy hazels opening monologue made it clear that it was and my expectations immediately changedsomehow ive been able to enjoy both the divergent series and despite my dislike for shailene woodley one reason i didnt like her in divergent is because she was the wrong actress to portray beatrice pryor and i didnt like the character presented in the movie anyway i cant say for sure whether or not shailene woodley was the right choice for hazel in this movie but at least she did her bestthe beginning of the movie starts out a little clichd and uninteresting hazel grace lancaster goes to a cancer support group after being forced to by her parents the support group is at a church literally in the heart of jesus the first day is just as bad as she expected the leader is a complete weirdo and shes not interested in making friends with any of the other cancer victims the second day before even entering the roomshe bumps into augustus waters and they both are immediately interested in each other just like in any every other romance movie she fixes her hair in the restroom mirror before going into the meeting room and when the group sits down all augustus can do is stare at her she tries to avoid looking back at him but its obvious that shes enjoying the attention she rarely gets obviously they become friends he invites her over and they borrow each others books an imperial affliction a novel about a cancer patient is the book she gives him and i dont remember the book that he gave her its an irrelevant detail i dont know what she thinks about his book i dont recall it ever being mentioned but after he reads an imperial affliction its all the two of them can talk about she has sent the author numerous fan letters but none of them have been answered augustus surprises her by reaching van houtens personal assistant and reads her the letter over phone of course as soon as she can she emails the assistant and the next thing you know theyve been invited to meet him in amsterdam after a few complications they finally get to go to amsterdam and they eat out and have a great time at a fancy restaurant gus tries to pay for the meal but the waiter declines your meal has been paid for by mr van houten the next day they visit van houten willem dafoe and the visit is quite disappointing im not sure why i quite enjoyed the was it swedish hip hopthe movie turns out to be surprisingly good and meaningful the dialogue and writing are a couple of the stronger points of movie and they help a lot in delivering the message some of the movie presented dialogue so deep so trivial so meaningful so powerful you cant help thinking about it for days on end is an excellent example of a tragedy at its bestmy official score 83100,sad
it was a typical teen romance drama it had its good moments but there were very few for the most part the movie just contained sappy and awkward moments it felt like the movie was trying to make you cry instead of having it happen naturallythe characters were very weak and mostly stayed with the same motives and barely changed as people since their characters never really changed it made the story predictable just see how their characters act and feel and you can see all the clichs and how the story will proceedthe acting wasnt that great either i have seen both of these actors in other movies where they were much more believable shailene woodley was great in white bird in a blizzard and the spectacular now ansel elgort wasnt the best actor along shailene woodley either she overshadowed him which didnt make for good chemistryto me the only redeeming part was the soundtrack which was mostly indie music which fit the mood most of the timeis a generic teen romance movie nothing new comes out of this movie the little redeeming qualities made me give it a better score than it deserves,sad
this movie is not what it pretends to be its yet another teenage romance tied with cancer this time around to make the audience invest in it and get depressed and cry their eyes out guess what it does a very bad job of itthe story is completely bullshit and makes no sense whatsoever you will get that point if you are living in an actual world and not in the make believe world of hollywood the trailers i watched which made me compelled to see this movie are way better and interesting than the movie itself and the run time of 150 plus minutes is something i dont even want to talk about because i have already wasted enough time of my precious lifetrust me theres nothing in this movie which is something you should see its boring as hell and utter nonsense,sad
back when the film came out my girlfriend pretty much said i had to go see this with her after her having read the book i however had no idea whatsoever what it was about or anythingi absolutely loved it im a pretty emotional person and this hit me hard i was sobbing away along with everyone else in the cinema it really isnt a film i would normally go see but im glad i did because it was very touching what a beautiful film even from a males point of view it really was one of my favourite films ofthe year one of my all time favourites actually i actually bought it when it came out on dvd to watch again at some point brilliant,sad
this film is a love story about two teenagers with cancer however the film may be about cancer there is so much more than just cancer its about two teenagers who who meet each other though a support group and except that they have to deal with their illnesses this film is filled with all sorts of emotions from happiness and laughter to anger and sadness it has amazing actors and actresses in the film and you feel like you actually connect with the characters and feel their emotions it is an amazingly powerful story thats full of surprises its not your every day love story its a story that will stay with you forever and leave your mind wondering after the film has finished however i would really recommend reading the film first firstly it may help you to understand the film and secondly the book contains more of the story and more characters overall it is an amazing film and book that is definitely worth a watch,sad
well lets begin with a line from the movie believe me this ones full of em if you want the rainbowyou have got to deal with the rain the movie is a very soothing journey as you travel beside hazel grace the protagonist of the movie and you get to see lives of few teenagers struck by cancer the plot is sad on the whole but this very fact delivers the enchanting touch to the viewers it is very well directed and story is really touching i havent read the book but having seen the movie im sure the book shall be awesome too in terms of story content the movie doesnt offer much as i can possibly sum it up in a few sentences dont worry i wont do that but this is certainly the type of movie one doesnt watch for the story you watch it for its sheer beauty and emotions woodley and elgort appear as a great adorable couple interestingly both of them are quite different but still incomplete and they fell in love because they in a sense complete each other and also teach each other and the audience great lessons about life they show us that in spite of all difficulties and pain we endure there are always people who love us unconditionally and will always remember us no matter what happens and it is our duty to pause and enjoys those really great moments with them rather than yearning for public recognition this is aptly reflected when augustus mention thathazel was not widely loved but she was deeply loved and i guess that is what is important for all of us to understand you see her favorite writer flooded with letters symbolizing fame and wide respect love but is in constant misery and not at all in peace but his work has motivates many like hazel so what is the point of all this fame when is doesnt bring peace to youthe movie is filled with exquisite sequences portraying hazel and augustus as a very adorable couple their date in amsterdam is particularly well shown where the actors aptly exhibit the excitement as well as anxiety of a first datewell ill end this citing another dialogue this time from augustus theres a thing about pain it demands to be felt,sad
hazel woodley has cancer and can die at any moment when her lungs fill with water august elgort has cancer is in remission but both meet at a cancer support group and august falls instantly in love with hazel we do too youre too easyi cannot say enough good things about this movie it is perfect witty honest and will be hard to forget its almost like a true story but its not however we will read should be reminded of it when we encounter someone with cancer they struggle with things we take for granted things like breathing see keep in mind that although we see stories for our entertainment real dangerous things have happened to people with medical issues and we should always be aware of that the movie pulls us in instantly as august goes flirting with hazel and the banter between them is pure gold and it also pure gold the rest of the way we hope august is a good guy sincere and level headed because we like hazel and dont want to see her hurt when hazel is sad we are sad and when she cries august never disappoints shailene woodley deserves an oscar for best actress and ansel elgort for best supporting actor whoever cast them for this movie is a genius they were great together with a chemistry not often found in movies their love will touch us for the entire movie and maybe beyond august finds a way to get hazel to amsterdam to meet her favorite author peter van houten willem dafoe as she needs to know the answers to some things in his novel dafoe does good in this curmudgeon rolego to the cupboard or store and get a box of kleenex because you will need it at times although much of the dialogues and banter is light and witty there will be times they are not so this is a most impressive heartfelt touching and well told story you asked about a twist even though this story is rather straight forward and a twist isnt really necessary however there is one and youll be reaching for that box when you see it notables laura dern as hazels mother and sam trammell as michael hazels father both are truly supportive of hazel and also of augustwe all are subjected to read dreams and this fault can never be corrected that is the saddest part of life 1010violence no sex yes kind of implied  nudity no language one fbomb in amsterdam brief small stuff at times,sad
based on john greens immensely popular novel by the same name adapted for the screen with extreme skill by scott neustader and michael h weber and directed with sensitivity and taste by josh boone steps so far beyond expectations that it may just be another nicholas sparks young adults tearjerkers and actually becomes one of the more impressive dialogues about death and dying and the meaning and importance of love add to that a cast of young actors an experienced actors who live their roles and the result is a film that should be experienced by everyonehazel grace lancaster shailene woodley and augustus ansel elgort are two teenagers who share an acerbic wit a disdain for the conventional and a love that sweeps them on a journey their relationship is all the more miraculous given that hazels other constant companion is an oxygen tank gus jokes about his prosthetic leg and they meet and fall in love at a cancer support group add to that the presence of gus best friend isaac nat wolff who also has cancer which makes him lose his eyes and his mental stability at times and we have a trio of youth facing enormous odds who end up discovering the real meaning of being alive in the world and the importance of love hazels parents are for once in film sincerely supportive in the face of a dying child and realistically portrayed by the brilliant laura dern and sam trammel hazel and gus travel to amsterdam to visit hazels favorite novelist van houten willem dafoe and discover he is a smarmy drunk who lives with the compassionate lidewij lotte verbeek sharing how the story plays out would involve spoilers for those who have not read the bookthe on screen chemistry between shailene woodley and ansel elgot sends this film into that rarefied realm of becoming a classic but for this viewer even more important is the lesson it offers about the process and concept and meaning and insignificance of death as an ending it is a continuation,sad
last summer when my friend bought the book for his sister i judged it by its cover i thought it was yet an other notebook but i was wrong this summer i somehow i ended up downloading the movie because the title suited me having started the movie i realized it was that last summer books movie even so i felt like i should go on with it and so i did to see how itll turn out i can only say im ashamed of my passed judgment based on arrogance and ignoranceis one of the things in life thats intensely beautiful enough to move me what i admire most about this story is it being so realistic you dont see cheesy idealistic events or plans going on through the plot for instance when hazels on the stairs she doesnt play the typical damsel in distress she gathers herself and believes she can do it spoiler van houten is considered to be hazels fascination subject due to his work she loves his work and automatically loves the author as well huge spoiler when she meets him in person she learns hes not as idealistic as she thought he was or equally idealistic as his work spoiler i like guss quote youre a shitty person but a good writer all in all i appreciate this movie very much,sad
before i saw this movie i had a feeling the guy gus dies in the end i didnt know how he died but i just knew well that this film wont have a happy endingi thought gus and hazel were so cute together like they couldnt get their hands off each other its so sad how cancer just kills you silently and loses a loved one that you have been with for so long i was gutted that gus passed away and i was thinking at the end of the film that hazel couldve died too when she was looking at the stars lying on a field this movie is really good but if you have a softie personality then i suggest you get ten tissue boxes lol,sad
after reading the novel for a summer class the same reason i watched the movie i was fairly surprised at the movies fast pace its good cinematography and that each character was written to be as accurate to their representation in the novel as possible besides hazels dad i was promised a crying dad not a perfectly secure dad however i am not going to compare the movie to the novel now as i will mostly be doing that for the class since the class focuses on adaptationthe casting for hazel grace lancaster is near perfect in my opinion even though i had not heard of the actress before viewing the film shailene woodley taps into the lead characters mind with great skill able to depict hazels personality filled with sass and sarcasm as well as being able to cry on many occasions within the film without exaggerating how sad the character is supposed to be which is usually how actors handle crying it either doesnt happen at all or it happens with ridiculous intensity woodley is able to be more subtle handling the character near perfection all other actors give mediocre performances including laura dern who i have never loved as an actress anyway i wanted to like willem dafoes character but his performance seemed as though it was heavily directed and did not require any creativity from dafoe himselfto lift the mood and ignore we are focusing on dying teenagers in this movie it is surprisingly funny at certain points such as when augustus nonchalantly gives his nearblind friend isaac permission to break his basketball trophies while maintaining a serious conversation with hazel  his love interest which no moment of the film lets us forgetfor me moments of this film are extremely cheesy or do not explain things well some terms relating to cancer which average viewers would not understand are used once or twice in the film with little explanation and the dialogue is trying way too hard to be teenager dialogue listen douchepants sassy comebacks and corny statements like okay will be our always you probably wont understand this one out of context are abundant in this film exaggerating how ridiculous teenagers are or even giving them too much intelligence at times  especially gusthis movie was surprisingly entertaining to me and i have to admit it is a chick flick which i would actually watch again without cringing in disappointment you may not be able to handle yourself as well as i did for this story so maybe have some tissue in the room if youre going to watch this one,sad
after watching this movie i wont say that im surprised to see so many negative reviews people who look to this film for clich moments and things to gripe about will find them but only because theyre not capable of getting beyond what they perceive as unrealistic storytelling to see the true essence of what this film is trying to express a story of suffering and of trying to find purpose in life even when that purpose has to change and adapt to the sufferingin no way do i see this film as pretentious or nauseating i think it tells a very honest story even if it does so in a dramatic way its not a perfect film and the acting isnt always profound but the story itself stays so true to its characters that i think the end result is a film which tells a very powerful story in an almost perfect way personally i very much enjoyed it i wouldnt give it a 10 but its a solid 9 at no point during this movie did i wish it was over and by the end of it i felt like i was able to gain something very positivewhich by the way should be the objective of any film if realism is all you care about then watch the news in my opinion all of the negative reviews on this film are absolutely baseless it may not be for everyone but it is for anyone who has emotional depth or an appreciation for human experiences outside of their ownhowever idealistic they may seem and just to add some perspective  im a 27 year old male with no close experience with cancer or really anything expressed in this film and i still was able to find something in it that i could appreciate on my own level its not a movie thats just for one kind of person and i dont think it was created to be that way i think this is a film for all peopleand its well worth the two hours it took to watch it it will certainly leave you feeling some kind of way,sad
is one of the greatest movie made of this genre in a long long timethis movie taught me much more than what 19 years of my life couldand when i would tell you what this movie taught me most people would say that they already knew that but there is a difference between knowing something and believing in somethingit taught me that not every infinite is equal and that some infinities are simply bigger than othersyou dont get to choose how big infinite or life you get but you do get to choose how you spent itand i think its better to live less years with no regrets than live more years full of regretssecond thing that it taught me that you dont get to choose to get hurt in this world or not but you do get to choose who hurt youif someone you love hurts you than that feeling of pain is a blessing in disguise and the intensity of that feeling of pain could only be told by someone who dont get to feel a thing and what he could give to just felt for once the pain of getting hurt by loved onesthe last but not the least is that this movie taught me how to deal with the biggest fear of my live oblivionand that the oblivion is inevitable and only thing you could do is ignore itand its not about being widely loved or widely remembered but about being deeply loved and deeply rememberedbecause it is better that people remember you for who you were rather than what you do,sad
just what ive written in the title luckily i didnt follow my friends to the cinema for this movie it would just be a waste of moneywell i eventually came over this movie and suddenly got interested in watching this movie and so i didi sat in front of my laptop expecting to cry my hearts out but halfway through the movie i got bored i sat there wondering whether ive got a heart made of stone but hey i watched several movies that had left me crying my eyes outat this point i recommend miracle in cell no7 well maybe the relationship between hazel and her mother got me a bit teary eyed but i am proud to say not a tear was shedbtw the plot is just old somebody in a relationship is dying and then he or she starts rejecting the other for fear that it would bring pain and suffering to the other however starts to realize that her time is running out and eventually accept the other and starts to spend as much time with him cherish their time together blah blah blah and finally die i have not read john greens book but i cant help but think that this kind of plot just keeps getting recycled by movies producers writers i dont even know what to say anymoremaybe the book is better book readers i just dont knowand seriously whats with the kiss in anne franks house and the guys are even clapping its a good thing that the actual house denied the filming of this movie or else it would be a great disrespect to anne franktowards the end of the movie and i started to get tired and sleepy i was constantly checking the remaining time of the movie thats how boring it isso guys words of advice wanna find heart breaking comedy romance go elsewhere you can fine none here and it is damn boring but hey on the good side got my first review congrats,sad
for the type of movie this is its not half bad slow moving at times and some the the dialogue doesnt ring true sad tale of two young people who have cancernot a comedy for sure depressing in fact well acted by the leads and especially laura dern as the mother wonderful performance and wanted to see more of heras a realist and difficult to take theatrical license im wondering how gus and issac got to that church toward the end issac is blind and gus is dying and in a wheel chair how in the world did the get to and from the church would have been more realistic if one of gus parents had been sitting in the back somewhere then youd know how the two boys got there also at the end when the mother tells hazel that someone is here to see you its issac how did he get to the house just little quibbles like this kind of spoil the whole thing,sad
somehow this unabashedly manipulative film has become a runaway financial success and i have to say i dont get it all of the characters are nothing more than quick sketches that are never fleshed out right down to the main romantic couple heck even the characters from the blandest dimeadozen bigbudget action film you can think of have more dimension and personality than the ones paraded across the screen here make no mistake this movies screenwriters didnt set out to write a story about hazel and gus no they set out to write an emotional movie with a capital e i have nothing against those movies as a matter of fact i absolutely eat them up but the thing is in order to be effective you need characters that people care about and identify with not cardboard cutouts with about as much depth as a single sheet of paper,sad
hazel grace lancaster shailene woodley is tired of her parents laura dern sam trammells help and the support of the support groups the doctor diagnose her as depressed that is until she meets augustus ansel elgort at a support group meeting hes a onelegged cancer survivor who share the same view of life hazel gives augustus a book an imperial affliction written by peter van houten willem dafoe to read van houten invites them to visit him in amsterdam but the meeting doesnt turn out the way they hopedthis is a perfectly ok teen melodrama with a great performance from shailene woodley she nails this character through the ups and downs her scene with willem dafoe in amsterdam is terrific she doesnt just hold her own but she comes out on top ansel elgort is too one dimensional i think that has a lot to do with the writing he is all sugary charms even his bad driving is engineered to endear him to the audience hes not a real person but rather a manufactured characterthis movie could do with some swearing this is where the mpaa rating system really screws with a movie its a movie that needs the pg rating as such bad language that would fit these characters situation is just gone one would expect these characters to have the gallows humor and the swear words to match i guess there isnt much the filmmakers can truly do about it one scene that encapsulates the movie for me is the kiss in anne franks house as the kiss develops i thought that this is going to be awkward once they start kissing the scene actually is touching it works and then everybody starts clapping it becomes overwritten its a movie with a great young star that is trying to do something interesting but just tries too hard with its writing,sad
so i loved this just so dreamy and full of insight on life and death is what i would say if i was a 14 year old girl with a crush spoiler alert chick flick of the worst sort girls and women you watch this movie and love it you will love it guys you will watch it because they want to watch it your flesh will crawl and the logic parts of your brain will liquify with emotion i am going to have to go watch all of archer to reset my brain now but thats just me on the plus side its very well acted good character development some real touching and funny moments the script is a bit blah but no ware near most of the hollywood tripe so it can be enjoyed the cigarette thing is irritating as hell metaphor or no,sad
i am not gonna write things that would repeat all other reviewers i am just going to write one remark which is lately really upsetting me about the latest years of hollywood moviescan we please have good movies like this one without the remark to the jewish sufferings and holocaust much more people has and still suffering the consequences of ww ii and not only the jews i am really really fed up that even a heart breaking movie like this one and lately many others can not be written differently leaving that horrible event out of itas history proofs those ones whom have suffered did not learn a shred from it i have had to express my feelings and i really look forward to read replies and hope i have the right and freedom of expression on imdb as well future will tell,sad
it wasnt a bad movie but i didnt enjoy it either the film was kind of an average romance i felt it was a nice story at first but i got bored of it after reading the book the scenes in the movie were exactly how i imagined them however it didnt live up to my expectations with all the hype i expected it to be great however i couldnt really connect to the characters i dont understand why people were crying at the end i didnt i felt little connection to the characters everything was all too deep and the metaphors sounded ridiculous like it was written by an emo kid who bleeds on paninis reasonable story average camera work average effects good actors overall it was overrated,sad
i was really looking forward to seeing this movie and was actually pretty disappointed after seeing it im not one for romantic sad stories but there are a few movies out there in this category that i have loved i heard from many that they loved this movie and they cried the whole time i dont see how i didnt shed a tear and i was expecting just from the previews on tv that the boyfriend also had cancer and would be the one to die maybe i just was mentally prepared for it to happen and thats why i wasnt so shocked i just didnt like it the part when theyre in amsterdam visiting the author i feel like that could have been better i was honestly bored watching this the actors were okay but the story it self i wasnt hooked on like most people were im guessing the book was a lot better and was what caused all of the hype to see this,sad
i was just upset at night 2 am and awaken widei ended up watching a romantic movie and watched thisi just watched it repeatedlyi loved quotesdialoguesdrama and emotionseverything touched my heart,sad
i had watched this movie many times and still want to watch it again cause its so wonderful movie,sad
based on the bestselling young adult book of the same name belongs to a very particular subgenre which combines teenage romantic drama and debilitating disease i have seen only a few movies belonging to this genre love story 1970 is apparently the movie that is the gold standard in this genre i have seen its modern successor a walk to remember 2002 suffice to say i wasnt in control of my emotions for the next three days and it might have cost me tenfifteen marks in my xiith board english language exam so in spite of knowing nothing much about the movie outside of the trailer i armed myself with a healthy dose of cynicism and went to the theatreand i cried2014 was the breakout year of shailene woodley she had just wrapped up her tv show and her last four movies were the oscar winning the descendants 2011 the indie hit the spectacular now 2013 the experimental thriller white bird in a blizzard and dystopian thriller divergent both released in 2014 the last one also based on a bestselling ya franchise had made her a global star and she had by then firmly established herself among the talented crop of young actresses in hollywood she continues her fine acting form here portraying the cancer patient hazel grace lancaster with great sensitivity and wit she conveys energy of a doomed teenager exceptionally well compassion oozing from her body and quiet strength in the way she defies the role of a cancer patient eschewing selfpity hazel tries to manage her emotions while acutely aware of her parents struggles which she knows in her heart she will leave soon trying to make sense of her emotions the wellintentioned parents send her to group therapy where she meets fellow cancer patient augustus waters gus played by the talented ansel elgort in only his third movie is a plucky former athlete who after a losing a leg to cancer is determined to lead a happy life they inevitably fall in love and there are a few surprise touches in their story yet after the crying stopped i didnt find anything solid underneath the movie maybe i am too cynical or maybe because i dont have a debilitating disease and dont have first hand information on how people behave with such knowledge playing in their minds i had a problem with how gus fixates on hazel at their first meeting and decides to pursue her in spite of her doing nothing of any interest in the meeting the fact that hazel returns the affection without any conflict doesnt exactly cover up for this glaring hole in the plan but maybe something got lost in the almostliteral translation of the book to the screen there is a kiss scene between gus and hazel in anne frank museum which i thought was wholly inappropriate given the setting gus comes off as a cocky smart mouth as opposed to charming rogue which did make me wonder why they didnt go with miles teller who had great chemistry with woodley in the spectacular now maybe because elgort has the wholesome cornfed american boy look done patfortunately the parents arent portrayed as clueless impediments in the lives of their children set up as a target of scorn and ridicule by the audience the lovely laura dern plays hazels mother with great empathy and along with sam trammel who plays the father makes the best of the thinly sketched characters nat wolff makes the best use of his time as isaac gus best friend willem dafoe interrupts the feelgood nonconflict vibe of the movie as a reclusive and cranky author and the beautiful lotte verbeek from the borgias 201113 has a cameo as his assistantif you are a connoisseur of hollywood cinema you know how the broad strokes of the story will go and you will cry laugh and cry again at the appropriate times and hopefully that should be fine because that is the most i got out of this movie good performances all around but a onetime watch is all i recommend maybe two if youre hanging out with your significant other and wouldnt mind crying a bitverdict 610go for shailene woodley,sad
so simple in context but wide in its presentation loving the score which promulgates emotion at the right spot,sad
he could have been better but he was very lacking the book is unequivocally better,sad
i thought that it was going to be a typical made for television movie maybe it is i dont know but it was so moving and beautifully well acted i cried like a baby for most of it so my best suggestion is to have at least one large box of tissues on hand,sad
this movie is beautiful i want to say this as much as gus said to hazel in the movie that she is so beautiful i enjoyed the first halfit was cute i was pretty sure that she is gonna die at the end but it was reverse still it was nice although it was painful but definitely worthwatching,sad
some feelings cant be put into words neither be explained but i think this movie has got a very accurate explanation for what the feeling of losing somebody who is so valuable to yourself is  unlike the rest of the romantic movies  this one explains the meaning of suffering throughout your life because of something you cant even handle  something which is beyond your abilities  all of the other romantic movies which can be categorized as sad ones have the same plot enjoying their happy life then going into the same ending over and over having a tragic event  but this one is so different as it starts telling you that these stories never happen in real life and it lets you realize the ugliest truth in the end and that you have to live with your suffering for all of your life not just the silly ending ,sad
this movie is great its made me cry i ll watch it again,sad
this is a deep movie and its for people who can face fear and suffering of others its a movie about life and death about love and acceptance of grief and gratitude after all what matters in lifecan be short or shorterand after all the importance is the presence of the feeling the experience of it what a profound themefacing what everybody avoids to look straight in the eyes glad that i had the privilege to find it in this sea of movies around congrats to all who made this movie possible,sad
1010  a uniquely beautiful tearjerker that will get you every single time,sad
predictable boring brings nothing to the table,sad
everything in this movie works except for one thing elgorts acting the lonely i dont care for cancer act is just not working for him,sad
i hate watching this movie only because i could never stop tears from falling from my eyes the actors in this movie makes you believe their pain i am a huge movie person and has never cried a day in my life from a movie however this film gets me every time,sad
heartbreaking but also heartwarming this movie is really good personally i didnt feel so sad while watching it but i was touched by the love story and the friendship five feet apart is a lot sadder for me than this,sad
i just love this movie id watch it three times  i want watch it agein the two main charaters are so great  even the parents are cool the mom kinda werid played by laura dern i seen her in jurassic park playing dr ellie sattler  little role she played randy carpenter in i am sam  sam trammell he was in true blood he played sam merlotte  shailene woodley  ansel elgort are both in divergent series witch is crazy but anyways i love this movie  i want watch it now  it base on john green book witch i been hearing good things about  i really want to read this bookmy rateing 10,sad
unpopular opinion hazel grace is very unlikeable and kind of a jerk well get to that laterfirst im going to discuss the movie in general overall it was better than your average sick teen flick it doesnt solely rely on their condition to make you feel for the characters it more or less develops them to give you a better understanding of their perspective their fears their insecurities i did feel that the movie tried to be too edgy at times though it got to be a bit pretentious a word i deeply hate and very rarely use the cigarette metaphor is a perfect example pretentious and stupid even if you dont light the cigarette youre still giving money to the corporation they dont care what you do you with them after you buy them they already have your moneydespite being more developed than your average teen romance character augustus was a little bland he was likable but i wanted more to his character hazel had way more depth which is appropriate considering shes the main character as i stated previously i have a lot to say about her character so ill come back to her at the end the parents arent that fleshed out or explored which isnt really a fault the movie is about the kids not themi found it ironic that the film criticizes tropes it later uses it starts off with a voice over by the main character practically saying and im paraphrasing here this is not one of those movies were beautiful people learn beautiful lessons this is not sugarcoated this is dark and bleak and depressing it was a bit more depressing and a bit more profound than others films of this style however have two attractive protagonist one of which learns somewhat of a beautiful lesson at the end if youre going to criticize stories with certain tropes maybe try not having the same tropes in general i find it obnoxious when films do that its like a complex of superiority this is no fairytale says the fairytale this is not love story says the love story ugh dont tell us what the movie is let us see it and decide for ourselvesthe music was a generic and corny the score was forgettable in fact i dont know even remember if it had a scorethe ending was okay i guessnow lets talk about hazel and why i deeply dislike her ill start off by saying shailene woodley did an awesome job her performance elevated the movie to another level it almost makes you forget how obnoxious her character iswe being and end with hazel at the start shes relatable and interesting the story does a good job in making you sympathize with her she doesnt want to go to support group which is more than understandable up to the point where she goes into the support meeting i was completely on board with her however as i soon as she introduces patrick the support group counselor i start realizing shes very condescending towards other peoples feeling people that are also sick with cancer i might add adding flaws to your characters makes more complex and profound problem is the movie doesnt present this attitude of hazel as a flaw she introduces patrick in a manner of extremely contempt i could perfectly picture her rolling her eyes as she was telling us his very sad story this is a guy who lost his testicles to cancer his wife dumped him he wound up living in his parents basement thankfully he found peace and happiness in religion and is now dedicating part of his life to spreading that happiness to sick kids hazels reaction to him is to hostile she doesnt have to agree with him nor does she have to be happy you have your ways of dealing with your disease your pain your life you can look at this counselor and go he doesnt get me or what im going through i am not him his methods and religious beliefs dont help me thats perfectly fine but the way she introduces us to him its like shes saying this person doesnt know what real pain is aw you lost your balls and your wife left you boohoo i swear that was the attitude she was projectingthen we meet augustus waters who opens up about his very legitimate fear of dying before being able to leave his mark on the world his fear is basically to be forgotten what does hazel do he scolds him about his fear and tells him how ridiculous it is what a b if i were augustus id get pissed i wonder how hazel would react if for some miraculous reason she opens up about her fear of having her parents unable to get over her death and someone responds with youre gonna be dead so whats it to you you cant control your parents emotions now that your alive youre certain not going to be able to do so when youre deceased if that scares you i suggest you ignore it god know we all do would she take it lightly i doubt ittowards the end where augustus is pretty close to death he becomes very depressed realizing he wont be able to leave his mark on the world its pretty heartbreaking to know youre going to bite the dust without achieving your dream does hazel his now girlfriend comfort him of course not instead she gets all pissed and makes it about her why cant you just be happy with my love am i not enough for you you were severely upset when you werent able to go to amsterdam to meet your idol hazel you didnt see gus being all get over it already you have a family that loves you why cant you just be happy with that rather he made sure that trip happened for you the author of an imperial affliction is portrayed as a d for being a jerk to people despite being in pain why is it okay for you to do so couldnt stand her she was all about her pain and what she felt condescending towards other peoples sufferingin conclusion the movie isnt that bad but the character of hazel grace brings it down for me its actually kind of ironic because woodley elevates it at the same time making movies and writing deep and complex characters is incredibly hard this movie isnt that lazy so ill give is a pass i think a six is a fair score,sad
two teens with cancer meet and fall in love a film that by nature will sell crates of puffs our couple meets at a support group which they have both long out grown they want one last chance to do something like normal teens the film takes on that lifetime air and seems more realistic than most films in this genre except for that van houten thingthe film is loaded with metaphors and messages gus cigarette being the most powerful it is love story for a new generation the film will bea peoples choice more than a critics choiceyes it is in the realm of a romance or chick flic light comedyparental guide 1 fbomb implied sex no nudity,sad
it was a decent movie to watch on a sunday night i guess the main problems here were that it was way too long they couldve accomplished the same movie had they cut 2030 minutes off there were also things that kind of got redundant between the two leads that kind of made the movie drag the two main leads were really good but i didnt feel much for the relationship with the parents or their friends around them that part of the story seemed like an afterthoughthad they shaved off some time of the movie taken out the redundant interactions of the two protagonists and added in some more of how their conditions were affecting everyone else around them i wouldve given this a solid 8  but its only a 5 from me for now its a good albeit very depressing and morbid movie,sad
when i read the reviews of this film i had the filter set to helpfulness and i couldnt work out if this was the best film ever or the biggest steaming pile of excrement you will ever see the first eight reviews were 98109810910 and i was getting very excited but then suddenly there were eight 1s in the next 12 reviewshey i saw reviews like this with the before trilogy sunrise sunset midnight i loved those films but others just didnt get it and the 10s and 1s reflected that but i dont think this film falls into that category at the time of writing this film is 77 which is sort of about right we all have different scales and for me anything over 78 falls into the pretty good category and over 8 into the very goodand so on when leaving a review there really isnt anything that should get a 10 or a 1 as where can you go when something comes along that is better or worse as it happens this is mentioned in the film and its not a spoiler to say that she describes her pain as a 9 because well it could be worseso having got all of that out of the way this film is a 77 which for me falls into the ok category shailene woodley is the stand out actress with the rest just meh although willem dafoes almost cameo appearance does add a bit of bite to it my wife loves a good romcom and is always reaching for the tissues and although she did again with this film not as much as she usually does ive shed a tear watching cars fought them back in the final scene of pay it forward and bawled my eyes out atwell you get the picture but not this time i just wasnt moved enough by the performances or the script this film is a little similar to five feet apart which we watched yesterday and for me i preferred that its rating is 71 which i feel is a little low and should really be a 77 with this film being 71 anyway its ok without breaking any new ground and even the twists you could see coming and i found myself predicting the script a few times it was that generic 71 for me,sad
this movie is the best every thing is perfect i dont think i could cry more than this,sad
i think the movie was good but some of it was too familiar with old movies but i really enjoyed it and it made me think a lot about how fast your life can change good and bad  sorry for my english not my number 1 language,sad
first off i hate to be that guy i really do or tfios for short really did play up the tumblr edgy teen culture for those who are familiar will definitely understand for those who can not fathom the utter confusion that is click clacking from my keyboard let me explaintfios really did have some questionable script writing and just weird trying too hard metaphors augustus the young boyfriend to fellow cancer patient and main character hazel followed the cheap bad boy gone good image topping it all off posing with a cigarette because you know its definitely not to appeal to the edgy look at me im young and i smoke im so deep scenehowever the movie is good very good its sad very sad theres something oddly heartwarming about a young couple who fight through pain together the pain in this story however is the fact the couple share cancer although it indeed hide the gore and scars of the devastating disease it needs to be remembered it is a love story not primarily about having cancerto keep in relatively short shailene woodley hazel great performance ansel elgort augustus stole the show at the petrol station youll see  nat wolf isaac gus friend one touching scene parents mum laura dern had great moments dad sam trammell about as moving as a sleeping snorlax without the poke flutei suggest watching this with plenty of tissues as this will make you cry too many times to count the soundtrack complemented the movie very well and in the end shows that an egg on its own may be repulsive if you cook that with other ingredients you get a lovely sweet cake like this moviethe movie is sweet,sad
so at first im a  movie guy   i watched alot of movie through many years but im interested on genre like scifi  mystery  horror  action and some kind of that i never really really watched a romantic film  i mean ive seen it back in 2016 this movie but i stop watching it from the first scene at heart of jesus  for me is kinda boring and here we go at 2019 now  im trying to watch it again  and how thankful i am ive been trying to watch this movie  this time i finish the movie twice a week  now im reading the book  so this film is a  film u must watch before u die sorry my english really bad ,sad
such a great movie the movie allowed the audience to not feel pity for both of them the only pity was at end of the movie such a great way to embrace falling in love in difficult situations both of the actors did such a great job at protraying their characters both of their acting matches up to the characters in the book which is perfect their acting was great,sad
amazing movie it was very nice watching this romantic drama ,sad
this has made me cry always regardless of the time i have watched this film,sad
i totally liked this movie and chemistry between the two leads it has all ups and downs funny and romantic movie this movie totally touhed my heart it really is a one sick love story,sad
most favorite story that john greene brought to life that started from the book itself  the characters were played out terrifically to the point no other actor or actress wouldve did better than the ones chosen very beautiful and it brought me to tears at the end of it because of how real it felt,sad
is the story of two teenagers  hazel and augustus with cancer who fall in love and decide to go to amsterdam to realize hazels dream before her last breath but everything will not happen as expectedthis movie is the saddest and at the same time the best movie ive ever seen its a drama and romantic film directed by josh boone written by scott neustadter and michael h weber it was released on 2014 it is 2h06 min long it may seen long but its worth it from the first minutes of the film were caught in the story and it goes very quicklythe story is unbelievably beautiful the music is incredibly well chosen it conveys emotion it makes us hang on the story and puts us in the characters place shailene woodley and ansel elgort are perfect in the role of hazel and augustus they convey their emotionsive already read the book but i prefer the film we cannot put ourselves in the place of the characters and we feel less emotions in the bookis a movie that makes you think a lot and makes you cry the story can really happen to us or to someone around youi recommend this film at 100,sad
its ironic a movie written by someone who has spent time with cancer patients wouldnt have the movie resonate more completely but for me this one didnt the movie is just kind of there resting on the laurels that because its main characters have cancer we should automatically forgive for not being be as informative of the subject matter or entertaining as it couldve been ive known people who have died or suffered from horrible aflictions and a lot of little things about this movie felt false and i felt bad because i like john and everytrhing he contributed to crash course series and wanted to like thisif you remove the cancer component it doesnt feel that interesting or real to me i have a hard time believing that an author would be so horrible to these kids without more explanation and that someone as nice as his assistant would continue to work for him although im surprised she doesnt forgive him as his apology seemed extremely sincerethe crash course series in much more entertaining than this was movies like this i was hoping would have shown a greater responsibility to the people suffering from cancer and their families how better to cope that may not know how this is why i love the movie 6 weeks with dudley moore and mary tyler moorein this film the adults felt the most real entertaining and informative of how people might be dealing with a disease  her mom dad the author although it was nice to see the author of the book in the movie for me this was the most interesting partnothing trivializes a movies few good moments like a halfhazardly chosen songs as accompaniment to prop feelings this is what the actors were actually for imo,sad
is a 2014 american romantic tragedy film directed by josh boone based on the 2012 novel of the same name by john green the film stars shailene woodley ansel elgort woodley plays hazel grace lancaster a sixteenyearold cancer patient who is forced by her parents to attend a support group where she meets and subsequently falls in love with augustus waters another cancer patient played by elgortsince childhood hazel has respiratory problems forcing him to wear an oxygen tube continuously on her mothers advice she joined a support group where she met augustus who lost a leg to cancer charismatic and sure of himself the young man quickly becomes close to hazel showing him the good side of things he even manages to find the favorite writer of his new friend planning a trip to amsterdam to meet himwhat i find most impressive about this film is the special effects that are absolutely sensationaland the caractersares are very convincingthe chemistry between shailene woodley and ansel elsort is astounding and the performances were astonishingalso it is beautifully written this is the first movie this year that i have given a 10 i dont give out 10s easily but there was seriously nothing wrong with this film the pacing was perfect the acting was phenomenal the direction editing and cinematography was exceptional and overall this movie is one of the best romantic comedies that have ever touched the face of the earth i encourage everyone to go see this movie no matter what age you are and bring a packet of tissues as well youll need it,sad
the meaning of this moive to me is let me love more my life take care more of my life love my firends around mei had watched this moive for 3 time at least this moive inspired me encouraged me evertime xiaolin,sad
we know the bliss cant last and so tears stream down your face during the third act to borrow their favorite line from hazels favorite book pain demands to be felt,sad
this movie is really amazing i cant belive the drama in this movie its influential especially in the end all the actors was doing great and the best show this movie taught me many things in lifethe love is real whatever youre you must try to love and be lovedi love it so much thanks for this great movie,sad
it was such a sad and emotional movie yet it had such an important and meaningful message that to live every beautiful moments of life i simply loved this movie although i did not read the book yet,sad
as one author thaught me you cant expect the book the be as good or bad as the movie theyre two separate things and one of them is just based on the other if you go into the movie expecting a visualisation of the book youre probably going to be disappointed i believe the same counts for this movie if youve read the book please dont judge the movie like a visualisation please judge it as if the book was a guideline to something newi thought the movie was awesomesincere dubnium,sad
if i would like to say good thing on this movie or nothing i say that everyone worked so hard to make a successful movie and touch peoples feelingthe effort of the main actress came through partially but her efficiency not at allwith more talented young lady this movie could have made its markdisappointment,sad
i just love this movie id watch it three times  i want watch it agein the two main charaters are so great  even the parents are cool the mom kinda werid played by laura dern i seen her in jurassic park playing dr ellie sattler  little role she played randy carpenter in i am sam  sam trammell he was in true blood he played sam merlotte  shailene woodley  ansel elgort are both in divergent series witch is crazy but anyways i love this movie  i want watch it now  it base on john green book witch i been hearing good things about  i really want to read this bookmy rateing 10 stars,sad
just like every single romantic movie i can bring to u a hundred of romantic movies contain the same story,sad
the fault in our starsthe movierated here as a ten intentionally because of the student unity towards having terminally ill patients on board like a student scholar with invalidity,sad
shailene and ansel are irreplaceaple in this movie this movie should be considered as a gold standard for the modern romantic genre dialogues are beyond beautiful it is a lovely story told in a more beautiful way overall it is a movie that will stay with us forever,sad
is about a young cancer patient called hazel hermother is a very supportive character unlike her daughter who prefers to read in bed hazel agrees to go to a support group where she meets isaac and augustus isaac has a form of cancer in his eye and augustus is a cancer survivor there for isaac augustus and hazel lock eyes on each other during the group session and start talking afterwards soon they become very close and learn to like the same things augustus emails one of hazels favourite authors and after much time debating arguing and emails hazel and augustus go to amsterdam to meet the author towards the end of the book augustus and hazel declare their love for each other but plot twist in a way they switch places as hazel gets a little bit better augustus gets worse and then eventuallymy favourite character is hazel because she has managed to overcome so much and still find love travel be a teenager and be able to live a longish happy life even when she was told no she managed to overcome the challenging time of surviving cancer she is also a really caring character in the book hazel really makes you feel like if you try hard enough you can achieve whatever you want,sad
i usually dont cry during movies but this one daaamnnn the tears came flooding outta my eyes and tbh it was the most heartbreaking movie i have recently came across over no matter how many times you watch it it still hit your heart the same everytime ok,sad
i read the book within the span of 2 days in middle school i enjoy the overall plot of the story but i cant stand the fact john green made it out as a more romantic storyline and that everyone plays it out to be a cancer story now sure i will admit some things are strongly cancer related and i know most of the main characters have cancer but i was going in as a person expecting it to be like blue by joyce moyer hostetter and came out crying as it was more like an ironically more sad version of the hunger games by suzanne collins now honestly i loved this story it caused me to feel an overwhelming amount of depression for a couple of days after reading it and i honestly can say it has changed my life its made me respect the beauty of everything around me so unless you want to change i doubt youll like not only this book but the moviei have to out of respect remain quite about the sudden death of someone very important but have to admit the part where shehe said i lit up like a christmas tree i cried ive thought the plot of this story more than once over the duration of the past few days since ive finished it and i will say there is no other plausible route for these characters to go other than down at the beginning they were somewhat normal now their more than just depressed they are conscious of their insurmountable feelingsi would suggest this to hopeless romantics and overall sad and depressed people,sad
i feel the pain the story just loved everything in this movie go and watch this movie,sad
when i first read the book i thought that i had found my favourite thing in this world but a few days after that when me and my best friend decided to watch the movie i wasnt sure which one was better of course i believe that the books are always better than the movies but the film made me cry not the book so i decided that both of them are absolutely lovelyabout the plot of the film it was just amazing but completely sad the ending was evil at first i thought that hazel will be the one who will die  i am not saying that i wanted her to die im just saying what i was thinking but the ending was completely different i do not understand why in movies like this one the romantic ones the male character is always dying at the end as you can see i adore augustus watersanyway the movie is great everyone needs to watch it,sad
the movie had a lot of parts in it that made me cry but also very happy scenes it was actually a really good movie,sad
this movie left me speechless such a heart warming loving inspiring and sad movie i dare you to watch this movie and not get choked up if you dont tear up even a little id go to the doctor and make sure you have a heart lol amazing movie,sad
it was painful sad story and mom left our couch in the middle i watched it all and cried terribly i found again that how wonderful to love someone deeplyand that i do not have to be loved by everyone which never happens i will read the novel so that i will realize more things john green tried conveying,sad
i had cancer so these movies hit me hard novadays but the fact that the movie is sad doesnt make it any less good makes you hate the unfairness of fate but still is meanungful and touching,sad
i watched this after reading the book and expecting a lot out of it i was hoping that it would live up to my expectations but it didnt quite do it it was a good movie but it lacked in quality i wanted more context and more passion put into this movie i feel the director was lazy and didnt quite put enough effort into making it live up to the book version nut overall it made me laugh and cry and left me wanting more,sad
sympathetic turns by future stars shailene woodley and ansel elgort make this teenage cancer romance film rise above the likes of other teen aimed fare in its genre the characters are well etched and the dialogues are good which is expected since it is an adaptation of a bestselling book by the same name the authors complete participation in the production phase is one reason why is not like other young adult bookbased films it is faithful to the source,sad
the first time i watched i cried its a truly inspiring movie that is relatable to anyone even if they dont have cancer 810,sad
i stumbled upon this movie while searching what to see on hotstar the movie is a must watch for anyone who believes in love or who thinks that their problems are unsolvable or who feels that they are in midst of a crisis or who feels that life is unfair towards them or who believes that happiness has ceased to exist in their life it is for all those people for all those mortals who know that life is not unlimited the monthorso long story of hazel and augustus makes you fall in love with them you wish you could help them but life has its own ways it makes you happy sad and hopeful all in the span of 2 hours you may start loving your life more than before and enjoy the small things which were being ignored for so long when death is inevitable love and courage make it easy to embrace it,sad
when i sat down to watch i was worried that it would be nothing but a kleenex box flick much like guys can be drawn to the theater with the right quota of explosions special effects and superheroes the same can often be said for women only with really sad stories that is kind of how this movie is marketed tooas a real tearjerker luckily the film does enough besides the waterworks moments to keep your interest throughout it isnt just all sadness and cryingfor a basic plot summary this movie focuses on hazel shailene woodley a teenager living with a rare form of cancer that makes her in her own words a ticking time bomb at a cancer support group that hazel usually loathes of course she meets gus ansel elgort a fellow youngster who also happens to have a lesssevere form of cancer the two strike up a conversation which leads to a friendship which leads to a romance through a mutual interest in a mysterious author played by willem dafoe hazel her parents played by laura dern  sam trammell and gus go off on a last wish adventure to find this author and have him explain the ending of his most famous booki wont go into any spoilers on what makes this movie so sad but when you consider it is about two kids with cancer you can probably put two and two together if you are into emotional speeches and heartstirring for better or worse scenarios then you will indeed need a tissue box handy however even a 28year old male like me was able to sit through the film without rolling my eyes or tuning out though coated with adolescent angst and highprofile teen actors the kernel of emotion transferred from the core of the story although i have not read the book so i cant get into the differences to the big screen remains poignantthe fault in out stars probably gets a bit of a bum rap right now because the general market is so saturated with these types of stories i kind of compare it to the giver in that regard yet one must remember that is was john greens book that practically started this entire genre it just took awhile for it to get transferred to hollywoodon my personal ranking scale this movie would get a 35star ranking but ill bump it up to four stars here because it is a touching story with even a little comedy and lightheartedness thrown into the mix while the core of the story may be very emotional it isnt all doom and gloom,sad
wow such great acting and such great and simple dialogue the characters have such great chemistry i love that in this story that you got to see the characters grow to being friends into loving each other the characters really care about the people that they are portraying and they try to be as real and authentic as possible this is such a sweet and great love story spoiler warning the ending to this movie is so rough and so hard we all know that he is gonna die but when it happens you cant help but feel so empty and heartbroken the ed sheeran song to this movie alone is so sad as well i love this movie and i want to read the book and compare both such great acting and shailene is such a talented actress,sad

firstly this film is an adaptation of john greens book before watching the film i read the book and from my point of view the book is better than the film because you can observe the little details quite a bit better in this film we can also see the power of unconditional friendship and the importance of support when you really need it the teenagers who fall in love in the film are called augustus waters and hazel grace lancaster and we can know that their love is going to be everlasting in spite of at the beginning we couldnt think it if you have girlfriend or boyfriend this will be a very interesting film to see with him or her,sad
ok i saw this movie tonight alright not really anything new than others i had already seen a few things bugged me1 there were too many references to her time when she almost died this implied something later in the story would be related which it wasnt 2 was not real enough after they had met there next months were almost perfect with a trip to europe when the doc said s no and free meal with champagne etci was expecting something a lot more twisty at the end than what happened if i could rewrite the ending this entire movie would have been a dream of the girl after she closed her eyes on deaths door in hospital when she was 13 as she went into a coma that would have been a great ending dreaming your last days of an amazing love experience that you never got to have and then slipping away into the ether,sad
im really glad i didnt watch any trailers for this movie because i probably wouldnt even have watched it they look so damn kitschy but gladly the movie isnt the best thing are the characters they feel so real its like watching the everyday life of real people with real problems to live with mainly because of the smart dialogue which is filled with beautiful metaphors about life and the incredible acting especially by the main character played by shailene woodley this is underlined with a great score and some little turns within the story if you dont need action or a lot of suspense to enjoy a movie i can definitely recommend seeing this one if you are a sensitive person chances are high that youll end up crying although the movie is very life affirming for the most time enjoy,sad
if you enjoy a movie blatantly marketed at a 13 yr old girl then i would absolutely recommend this movie because youll barely get through the opening credits without being reminded of who the target audience is it features fun bubble texting effects lots and lots of apple products and of course parents far better looking than any that exist in real life everything that made the book so great has been stripped away and the result is a movie that in its most heart wrenching moments is merely funny it has no depth no reality and 2d characters that struggle to get their best lines out if youve read the book avoid the movie at all costs because youll never be able to read the book again,sad
tonight i watched i wasnt ready not even close after pacing through my room for about an hour i decided to try and write down my thoughts as scattered as they may be so here is the weirdest review ever written on imdbthe thing with overromanticizing is that it leaves you with doubts if i cant be like hazel and gus love like them then whats the point and i know i cant be like them my semiegocentric brain isnt capable of loving that deeply that profoundly and unselfishly they share a connection so beautiful ill never have thatin order to not just give up on love i have to remind myself that no one is capable of loving like hazel and gus they are fictional characters their actions and emotions are exaggerated in order to make the audience more invested too invested in this case because i now have to constantly tell myself that they arent real their love isnt real and i will find love and happiness in my own real wayat this point many of you will think how is this ever a review and many more will have stopped reading already but consider this if a movie gets a 33 year old man this emotionally invested how good will it be,sad
first i watched this movie on my second screen when i was playing games after moment i dragged movie to my primary screen and i shut down my second screen i started to really respect the moviethe story of this movie was so touching that i cried almost 4 times and im still touchedi can definitely recommend this movie for anyone who loves touching storiesi dont have much to say because im so all mixed up with my feelings dthank you for reading  ill give 1010 for this movie,sad
i know many movie goers are probably sick of hearing that from book lovers but it is a fitting statement for this movie john greens descriptions are just so beautiful and eloquent and at the same time really easy to read i seriously could not put this book down i started just browsing and i couldnt stop reading it was amazing which was why i was quite disappointed that some of my favorite lines from the book were not in the movie i also found it hard to see the two actors as lovers after seeing them as brother and sister in divergent overall there wasnt anything bad about this movie it just didnt quite do the book justice and dragged on a bit towards the end if you have not read the book i think it is very likely you will enjoy this movie much more than i didif you have read the book i dont think its worth seeing the film but if you have seen the film it is definitely worth getting your hands on the book it will just add so much to the story and experience,sad
from the starting till the end the movie was epic each line and scene had its own meaning this movie relates to my life as i have a friend like hazel who was suffering from a blood cancer but when she told her boyfriend he left her in her bad timeat that time she wanted to die because everything was going all wrong but i supported her too much at that time and finally she get rid off from the cancer after suffered from an year same as i was suffering from the same thing after that and she do the same as i do the movie reminds both of us who you actually are and never loose faith i never drop a single tear from eyes in any movie and this is the first movie my eyes were wet while watching really an epic and tragic love story,sad
i entered the mania for this movie about a year in and let me say i was seriously disappointedthis movie and the novel it is based upon illuminates the hardships of a cancer patient and the necessity of love or at least they claim toi know many cancer patients and not a single one displays the mindset of either of the primary protagonists nor do they display the level of intelligence that the children do i found the dreary mindset to be overshadowed by humor and felt no attachment to these charactersmany people cried when gus died because of sadness i cried over having wasted the better part of my afternoonthis film was boring banal closeminded i would not recommend this piece even to my most hated enemy,sad
this movie is just perfect in my view everything fits so nicely together the story screenplay and above all the acting just fantastic i have never written a review before seeing this movie just made me to the cinematography is just great it is not in your face and helps you to feel part of the story the casting is so natural especially the lead actors very well done the story feels so natural you can relate to the initial text exchanges amsterdam visitthe authors character all feels very realistic there are so many lighter moments which makes the movie more enjoyable given the subject i havent read the book but i am sure i am going to highly recommend this one,sad
i really like the idea of fixing a films average rating by kicking it with a 0 or 10 and i make use of it deliberately but since this has been happening here extensively enough i will rather try to offer you a biiit of a mediating evaluation really because i think that this is not a film which you necessarily have to love or hate apart from that i am actually still trying to figure out myself what made me like it in the first place  because i did in fact if you are like me prone to readily dislike a film for being all to cheesy predictable and like this one bourgeois as hell  you will be struggling trying to watch more than the first two scenes featuring the pretentious smartarse makebelieve stereotype gus some acting is bad while sometimes character concepts are just the painful thing  and they usually do not coincide here an in itself very good but in this configuration maybe sometimes very serieslike popish soundtrack and suboptimal camera settings are just things i want to have mentioned it has some lengthy moments and awkward scenes yep the anne frank house clapping scene is unbearable and aspects of questionable directingin the end you may still accept the film as a whole  while it has to rely mostly on the few following things 1 the simple inherent tragedy that works however rich and white the characters may be and their welldepicted inner conflicts 2 the great character of hazel grace beautifully represented by shailene woodley who evolves despite some scriptrelated clichising she is also kind of unapproachableso what and 3 its emotional power because in their moments of genuine weakness or strength the characters are believable and they functioni think tfios really encourages us to see the romanticism in all its frailty and vanity as a refuge and a beautiful joyful thing while it is strongest this innocent and so temporary romantic love as a momentary prospect against oblivion it is macabre and wondrous at the same time that the two lovers might only have enjoyed the purest form of romantic love in the face of death  but does that change so much about it in general anyway it is a story about teenagers teenage worlds of thought and maybe ideals  if you do not care about that you wont enjoy the film eithercheers,sad
the relationships were beautifully natural in this kind of film weve come to expect the weird tense andor overdramatic familyfriends with the cancer sufferer the maturebeyondtheiryears stable centre of the universe im not going to say that isaac wasnt a little loopy but hey we all have one slightly crazy friend right i loved watching the friendship and then romance develop between hazel and augustus again it was natural it was fun it dealt with the reality of their lives and it was marred with tragedy from the getgoliving with cancer or another long standing life threatening illness has generated a lot of fact and fiction stories books movies and documentaries in recent years what was nicedifferent about this story was that everyone involved was already at peace with the fact that hazel would die before her time there were no big arguments around this fact it was a sad reality the family lived with and that was the focus of the story  how they lived despite this hazels concern was that her parents didnt stop when she did go she wanted them to keep living and not lose purpose one of the best moments in the film is when they reveal to her that they are preparing for when she is goneand this makes her happy not storm out like a drama queen and can i just say how nice it was to have the protagonist in a relationship that doesnt fall apart when some earth shattering news is dropped no sad trying to get on with life montage no big scene argument just a simple conversation on a bench which pushes the story in a new direction a relationship which is more about giving than taking making the other person happy rather than simply enjoying the fact they make you feel good yes pleaseand unlike my sisters keeper i could quite happily watch it again next week rather than waiting a few years full review at confessionsofastoryloverwordpresscom,sad
faults in our stars was a good movie but be prepared this is also a tearjerker comingofage tragedy about two starcrossed lovers so make sure to bring tissue i cannot tell you enough movie how thankful i am for our little infinity i wouldnt trade it for the world you gave me a forever within the numbered days and im grateful without spoiling the movie too much i have to say im a huge fan of author john greens work fault in our stars is by far his best novel yet inspired by the autobiography of esther grace earl a young woman living with cancer that john green was friends with and adapted from the fourth solo ya novel of the same name the movie version of fault in our stars tells the story of hazel grace lancaster shailene woodley  augustus waters ansel elgort two recluse teenagers trying to discover with each other what does it takes to fall in love when dealing with a lifethreating illness like cancer directed by josh boone the two characters in this film are very wellrounded and likable however i found the casting choices kinda jarring dont get me wrong ansel elgort and shailene woodley did fine in their roles but its still kinda weird to see these two actors play lovers when their previous released roles was 2014s movie divergent in which they played brother and sister when you think about it its kinda leaves a bad taste in my mouth another problem with the film and the book is how kinda disrespectful it is to holocaust victim anne frank i really dont understand why they added a scene like that it felt out of place were they trying to be funny and make a seinfeld reference or were they trying to say that every moment of life is precious and you should try to enjoy every minute of it was it hazel and augustuss usual way of honoring the dead i still dont get anyway you put it its not a good scene they should had cut it or change the settling anyways one scene i wish the movie kept was when hazel goes to visit isaac nat wolff at the hospital following his eye surgery in the movie she doesnt do that and its seem a little mess up because he plays a big part in hazel  guss relationship yes it probably would have weighed down the main plot just to build up hazels relationship with isaac but audiences may miss a lot of what could had been plus nat wolff gave such a quietly heartbreaking performance that he really needed to be revisited also where in the hell is kaitlyn from the novel in the movie kaitlyn doesnt exist and its sad because she really could had add something to the film another missing person from the book is augustus former girlfriend caroline mathers who died of brain cancer a few years earlier this really kinda affects the movie for me because she supposed to weighs heavily on hazels mind on deciding to love and be loved even when you know it will cause pain since theres no mention of caroline we never truly know for sure what is going through hazels mind or the effect her death had on gus then there is the fact that the movie left out an important scene in which hazel hear gus crying and yelling at his mom before they leave on their trip to amsterdam in the book that conversation foreshadows a big return to gus that i felt would had work to establish his struggles still i just glad they didnt sugarcoat the powerful and mature story for these teen audience like they did with 2015s adaptation of paper towns another john green book however i didnt like how director boone decided to leave out hazels disdain for all the facebook comments people wrote following gus death in the book hazel is infuriated by all the clichd sentiments and rashly posts something critical of another commenter assuming gus would have despised the sympathy notes having trolls on the facebook page would make it a little more realistic in tone anyways the clever dialogue and writing is still pretty much here throughout the film yes it makes the characters seem like their talking like old people but heres the catch its supposed to work that way not only is its supposed to attract the young adults crowd but also the older movie going audience as well in my opinion its rare to see a movie treat its young people as well educated adults so i had no problem with that also i had no problem with the soundtrack for this film boom clap by charli xcx might not be the best written love story ever however its works for the film i love the many of fan theories that came out since this movie came out like how inuniverse was written by peter van houten william dafoe or how hazel writes her own fan fic in the an imperial affliction universe overall whatever people take from this story its a great adaptation yes there is some flaws but its never drive away focus on the main story to quote hazels favorite book pain demands to be felt and feel you will which is more than okay so check this movie for your own,sad

i took many months to watch this movie after it released i knew about this film from someone review about this story and my crush after i stalked her social account then i got this movie from my friend by the way before i want to watch this movie  my cousin told me that it is a sad movie and my friends also said that this movie is best they said so i asked myself is it really sad like my heart was going jumpout like i was watching titanic before it really made me want to watch this movie but the real sadness was i already found the spoilerlittle bit as a spoiler before when i was scrolling my time line on twitter and it seems happen the same in the movie end up the story not sad at all after i finished watching it i dont know if i didnt feel sad because of that spoiler or the story feelings cant cross my heart at all however i still can feel the sadness and sickness that the hazel feels yes im still into romantic movies my openminded about any genres of film happened after that titanic film sighthe story start with the narrative by the main character hazel lancaster which is for me it is just good im not the fan of the novel of this adaptation and i also never read it before i also knew that there are many quotes or an impact dialog in this story that has brought up in this movie nice for me the plot is not too slow and not too rush  it well organised the sad moment not really gave an impact for me maybe due to the spoiler as i point out in this writing what i really love is the scene when they are hazel and augustus going to meet the novel writer of van houten that they really admire in amsterdam it is really unexpected tragedy happen in their meeting for me it the cause of the story is getting interesting and this scene has a thing to do with the endinglastly i tried to watch it back but for me this movie isnt powerful enough to push me for watching this again,sad
is a love story about a teenage cancer girl hazel grace and a survivor of cancer boy with one leg augustus water and a sequence of drama surrounding their families and friends from a cancer community group i usually dont read books or watch films in which i could guess the story is going to be a sad ending i like john green a famous author of young adult books and read a couple of his books including paper town and an abundance of katherines i bought this book when i took a few pages at a book storethe story is unexpected in a good way with a sprinkle of the authors jokes and humors through the characters and its no just a cancer girl story who has a miserable and painful life with supporting family and friends one of the things i like about the story is that hazel and augustus get to know each other through her favorite book an imperial affliction written by peter van houten the vague ending of the book has caught her for years to eager to ask questions to the author and that makes the two teens fly to amsterdam to meet the author its very dramatic and exciting scenes in that a story is created in places from two countries as well as it makes the handicapped characters overcome the difficulties of traveling for their dreamthe whole story about an imperial affliction never described but quotations from the book leave footprint stunningly seemingly that that casts a meaning of life through conversations between hazel and augustus while the story of an imperial affliction sounds epic van houtens quirky and socially twisted personality disappoints the two teems but the trip in amsterdam builds their bond more tightly and the story is going to be a moving ending this is not entirely a sad story but it involves with sadness and heartbreak towards the characters after the story ended i felt it satisfied me as if a missing piece is matched into the story rather than it left out only sadnesson the same day i finished the book i watched the film of shailene woodley portrays hazel so well and peter van houten played by willem dafoe matches the original image,sad
directed by josh boone is one of the excellent movie which i have watched till now it is based upon the numberone bestselling novel by john green the main characters in it hazel grace lancaster shailene woodley a 16yearold cancer patient and gus waters ansel elgort with their chemistry have made this movie mesmerizing and captivating the movie is worth thousands of praises it easily won my heart to become one of my favoritesit shows the journey of two extraordinary persons which takes us through an unforgettable journey it is funny thrilling romantic as well as tragic it is a simple movie with powerful impact the dialogs in this movie are spell bounding the credit goes to the director and the flawless acting of actors i salute their performance which was so realistic and heart touchinghazel and gus are two cancer patients who meet at the cancer support group and become friends their friendship was a fate which brought them together gus supports hazel to fulfill her last wish which is to meet her ideal book writer peter van houten willem dafoe the quest to fulfill her dream and put an end to her curiosity regarding van houtens book an imperial affliction leads to an unforgettable journey with gus which however has a painful ending by the death of gusi highly praise the overall team of movie crew which has portrait the novel in such a lovely way that nobody can deny its positive vibes and feeling of warmth after watching the movie the movie is so enchanting that it takes you to a land of gus and hazel keeping you spellbound till the end,sad
cancer is a wobbly subject a complete taboo western cinemas have covered very little maybe because its an illness we like to brush under the carpet guides us on a young couples journey of illness romance and perseverance the story is the toughest there is to watch shailene woodley and ansel elgort put in some brave compelling performances ones that are warming and emotional tfios covers how it effects others as well its first half is sweet and endearing the second is nothing short of sad expect tears to flow by the end,sad
i was really looking forward to this movie having never read the book the premise seemed to indicate an emotional rollercoaster in the end i felt shortchangedperhaps its meant for a certain audience but it has certain ludicrous moments the worst being the scene where those three are throwing eggs at the girls car you wouldnt believe it was written by an adulti found the ending a bit surprising is gus eulogy supposed to be enough i dont see how a few good words from a dead lover can be compensation for his death they maybe could have done more to create a sense of transcendence but again i have not read the bookoveralli did not care for the characters did not feel anything when gus died couldnt have cared less about how hazel would cope the writer did not do enough with the characters to make me route for them but maybe im a psychopath,sad
summary compensates for its flaws with shailene woodleys performance and tearjerking moments 63100 cis a pretty passable and forgettable film thats why i give it a 610 its far from being a bad film but it wasnt very special either i read the amazing book few days before watching the film and i have to say that the book was breathtaking and deeply emotional it is filled with lots of funny moments and also painfully sad moments the last chapters made me feel so many emotions at once then appears this mediocre and sometimes heartless adaptation it was so disappointing because it does not reach that emotional impact from the book the movie feels so rushed even with its 126 minutes of running timeit was so straight to the point there was not enough character development my major issue with this film is that each scene feels so mediocre and emotionally empty also when it tries to be funny ends up being awkwardly humorless another problem is the lazy screenplay the writer changed a huge part of the original script and some of the scenes were so badly scripted and awfully directed i mean the actions and the way that this talented actors interacted between each other in dramatic scenes were not similar to the book at all what a shame because the book took more risks it was braveranother problem is that there were not enough characters a lot of important characters from the book were not in the film come on the director had enough running time to put them in but he didnt also i didnt feel that connection between hazel gus and that book called an imperial affliction you dont know anything about this book that they love they just barely talked about it throughout the film and there were not enough conversations about this beloved book in the film but im happy that there were some decent moments here all the scenes in amsterdam were beautifully shot and very similar to the book in all the right ways it was definitely the best part of the movieall those moments in amsterdam were very enjoyable and beautiful because there was a lot of chemistry between these two main characters shailene woodley was terrific she was born to play this role its sad that this director went for the easy way and didnt put lots of important and crucial moments from the book in the film the dvd version has some extra minutes but its just not enough overall is a mediocre and empty film compared to the book but it definitely has its moments and the performances were terrific sorry if i mentioned the word book so many times in this review but i cant stop comparing them c,sad
based on a 2012 novel by the same name by john green is a romantic splendor sure to make your tear ducts work this is a story of hazel grace played by shailene woodley a cancer diagnosed girl breathing with the help of a nose cannula and her the world is not a wishgranting factory experience and moments hazel meets an impossibly charming boy next door augustus walters played by ansel elgort suffering from a prosthetic leg at a cancer support group and gradually starts liking him she is moved by a book she reads an imperial affliction which ends mid sentence and she is very animated to know what happens later to the protagonist augustus helps her in meeting the author by traveling to amsterdam under critical medical condition but poor hazel has to return disappointed as the author behaves scornfully with the young couple the story further continues with augustus showering magic in hazels life and mesmerizing her and finally ends on a forlorn notesadly book readers have not found the movie as delightful as the novel which is a case with any novel based movie however the movie stands beautifully as a pure romantic piece in recent times set in indiana the movie has been neatly shot with delicate art designing and editing is about love pain and memories  is highly recommended for a young adult audience,sad
two teenage cancer survivors find each other and fall in love  sort of sounds like a trashy romance novel an after school special or a lifetime movie yet somehow this adaptation of the bestselling novel moves beyond those melodramatic hazards into a touching portrayal shailene woodley continues her string of good to great performances and her march towards stardom ms woodley and ansel elgort provide the grace charm and lift which takes the storyline and sometimes dialog laden with potential pitfalls into an engaging film about growing up love and loss the supposed twist at the end is not very hard to foresee but still it does not take way much from this wellcrafted movie,sad
review what an emotional movie its not very often that a film brings a tear to my eye especially when its based around 2 unknown stars and a storyline without any twist and turns i also smiled all the way through the film because it was great to see gus and hazels relationship blossom under extreme circumstances basically the movie is about 2 teenagers who are suffering with cancer and they fall in love with each other even though there life could come to an end due to there illness theres many different elements to the storyline which makes it so brilliant but i dont want to spoil it for those people who havent watched it the performances are so realistic and deeply emotional which is why i couldnt help but feel for hazel  gus although the movie is based around two characters the director cleverly introduced new characters throughout the movie to keep it fresh and interesting for a 2 hour movie i really didnt want it to end which surprised me for a movie in this genre it could have easily been a morbid movie because of the touchy subject matter but it really was a joy to watch and its proof that you dont need major stars and a big budget to make a great film brilliantroundup this is definitely one of those movies were you have to take time out after you watch it because its an emotional rollercoaster you might remember the girl from divergent and the descendants and the boy also starred in divergent and carrie but they arent household names yet im sure after this movie they will get a huge amount of work which they deserve after putting in such great performances even willem dafoe who only had a tiny role was brilliant along with laura dean who plays the girls mother in all if your into your emotional dramas then this is definitely a movie for you and im really not surprised that it blew up at the box officebudget 12million worldwide gross 304millioni recommend this movie to people who are into their really emotional movies about 2 teenagers suffering with cancer and manage to fall in love under extreme circumstances 810,sad
im a guy so i dont watch chick films or shows unless theres at least something to appeal to men as equally i figured this would be a typical clichd sappy love story weve seen before for like the 100 time surprise surprise i was proved wrong ive watched jeremyjahns review this and i refused to believe what he said because he reviewed and liked the nightmare on elm street remake apparently im an idiot this is not just a love story its a drama two young people suffering from different cancers get together and start becoming friends first even though one of them has an attraction to the other by appearances but still taking it slow nonetheless seems logical and eventually fall in love and then there you have it they live out there lives this reminds me of the bucket list these two know the cancer will kill them but they never let it destroy them they take it in stridefor the most part i recently saw shailene woodley in divergent and thought she did okay the movie kind of felt like a hunger games knockoff but in this good lord she gave an astounding performance of her life not once did it feel like she could have done one part a little more or less i smell an oscar coming her way also shes freaking beautiful i think i like her better with short hair ansel elgort does a good job as well i like that hes this kind of i dont care ill do whatever i want guy but never to a point when hes being a dck about it all in all its an impressive love story that doesnt feel clichd old or verywhats the word tweenish i wont say its the most realistic love story ever put on screen but its more realistic than the usual love stories we get nowadays,sad
to be honest i was not a fan of the book either movie was too clich and as a teenager i couldnt relate to it cuz of the sophisticated language they spoke inno teenager talks like thati was able to bear the movie until they kissed at anne franks house and people clapped i am not sure what thats supposed to symbolize but it was offensive they had so many chances but chose to show public affection at such a sacred and tragic place also why did they go there in the first place doesnt hazel realize how bad her condition could get if she climbed the stairs and obviously gus didnt prevent her from going cuz the plot makes no sensethe only part that was kind of sad was hazels eulogy at the fake funeral but i still dont get why she didnt give the same eulogy at his real funeraland why does hazel want to know so much about what happens after the book of imperial affliction its fiction hazel its not real people and authors are not gonna tell you what happens after the book ends thats dumbfinally i am confused by how some people could call this realistic like really the book and movie are way too overratedps i have empathy for those who have cancer my friend and classmate from elementary school died from cancer,sad
movie runs at variable pace sometimes the story runs too fast so that you are not able to feel what characters are feeling other times when director wants to throw some solid dialogues and wants the viewers to appreciate them he makes it go slow he cuts way too many scenes but naah not the dialogues he adjusts the dialogues of those deleted scenes elsewhere many a times he desperately put okayokay thing to create the effect even when it is not fitting the situation secondly the movie is too straight forward everything is served on a plate for the viewers so much so that they are not required to think what is going to comeup next in short this movie is made for dummies,sad
when first viewing this movie it is as if your heart is a balloon during the movie the balloon inflates to grow larger and larger and the entire time you know that this balloon is going to pop when it finally does though you arent mad the explosion is so beautiful that it doesnt matter the movie is set up to lift you up and then drop you but it does so perfectly the movie never seems to force the audience to feel a certain way it never pauses to say now you are supposed to cry it balances the good and the bad so that no one leaves the theater feeling depressed you may be sad but not hopelessly depressed,sad

i have refused to watch this movie ever since it came out  i guess it was because i thought it was one of the cheesy romance dramas that have been flavored with classic cancer story i could not be wronger this movie not only exceeded my expectations but it made me regret every single second that i wasted with not watching this movie it is not a classic cancer story it has twists and turns it has the element of the unexpected it is one of the movies make you happy and sad at the same time john green did an outstanding job with this story but i believe the movie also deserves credit i think the is wellshot the actors chosen for this movie could not be any better also i believe the director did an amazing job,sad
at the risk of sounding like some type of grinch or cold hearted meanie left me strangely unaffected sure there are many moments within this cancer set tale that are quiet emotional but to say that they are overwhelming affecting would be a lie for is a wellmade movie with some fine acting especially by shailene woodley but nothing here struck me as wholly original and when you look at the success of the john green source material it feels like there was more for this movie to givei cant claim to have read greens book but from many acquaintances that have it seemed like a witty smart and touching tale of young love and the horrible disease that is cancer it would be interesting to hear from those people that were touched by the book and there experience with this film for a while as mentioned woodley is great in her role as hazel grace lancaster all other players feel somewhat slight and untrue with ansel elgorts augustus a fast talking and hyperactive persona who is supposed to be endearing but comes off as an untrue like love interest hazel and guss relationship shouldve felt more engaging here as well and unlike the book it seems to have missed the mark in making a love story for the ages and for young teenagers everywhere dialogue also that may have popped off the page in the book feels a little tripe on screen and comes off as either to mawkish or grandstanding to ring true for the viewerwithout woodleys top notch performance the film finds some much needed intrigue in the important yet not overly used willem dafoe as amsterdam based author peter van houten dafoes character is sadly far more interesting than augustus ever is and it shows up the fact that this central figure is less the sum of his parts director boone also gives the film a nice feel his direction is breezy and effective although there is an overuse of an indie set music soundtrack and in material that could of gone full steam ahead on all things nicholas sparks like its nice that he doesnt overplay things although at times as mentioned things feel a little too cold and you start to wonder just what youre supposed to be taking away from all of this sadness a great movie for teenage girls and all those with similar emotional ties fault in our stars is a nice movie but thats about it woodley is the main reason to watch this film as she is consistently showcasing an acting talent that blows most other young performers out of the water yet the film couldve been so much more than the hallmark tale it has seemingly ended up as mind you perhaps i am just a grinch or a cold hearted meanie as when this tale ended so did my thinking about it and this movie clearly wanted to be a life affirming journey that makes people hug there closest by loved one2 and a half unlit cigarettes out of 5 for more movie reviews and opinions check into  wwwjordanandeddiewordpresscom,sad
i give it 4 i never wrote a review before but seeing the average of 81 gave me the feeling i never will be able to trust imdb user raitings again 2 hours an 6 minutes of common places rigid dialogs bad acting predictability round of applause and trips to europe this are the ingredients of this film which abuses the resource of the drama around a serious illness and turns it in to a cheesy movie with no breakthroughmessage at all i rescue willem dafoes character van houten mr dafoe is an amazing actor and he plays a round solid and believable character with an interesting unexploited story i havent read the book maybe it is bearable the movie is just a low punch,sad

the good ones are the hardest to write about my thoughts are stars i cant fathom into constellationshenceforth tfios is a story of first love of how to deal with loss and the business of dying of giving a number from 1 to 10 to the pain you are feeling and a wake up call to how you want to play the game of life with the cards you are dealt with the teenage lovers depicted in tfios are cancer sufferers stage iv it sounds like one pretentiously powered to the nth degree emotional manipulative tale imho it isnt and has this almost evangelical sheen gleaming like a halo at the seams it breaks your heart not because its sad it does that by swelling your heart with beauty until it burst its sad but its also very funny and insightful with the right blend of levity and honesty it tackles big subjects  life death love and it does it amazingly well constantly buoyant with a hope even in the face of death i know the book first and the movie feels like the actual movie that played in my head when i read the book the movie is extremely faithful to the book movies of this sort live or die on one thing  the chemistry between the leads the chemistry is spoton perfect the two are kindred spirits sharing an irreverent sense of humor and immense charm and watching them fall in love even as they face universal questions of the human condition  how will i be remembered does my life and will my death have meaning  is deeply moving shailene woodley i know since the descendants and the spectacular now but they imho are not sit up in your seat and see me material i see woodley not as a young jennifer lawrence but an actress with a sweet fragility tfios is her star making role she embodies the role of hazel grace lancaster so well i couldnt see another actress in it love how she plays her  she is not your archetypal teenager suffering from cancer ansel elgort i only know from carrie in a dumb role his performance is pitchperfect and winsome together they are simply marvelous i know both of them played sister and brother in divergent but i have yet to see itthe supporting cast did a superb job too and each of them has good scenes to shine in i thought willem dafoe was superbly cast as van houten he totally imbues the character of a bilespitting curmudgeon i hate him but i also pity him if i have to nitpick i would say dafoes character is the weak spot he feels like a simple plot device right at the end in book form i could see the overarching purpose but in the film his purpose seems simplified but i am really nitpicking and scrapping the bottom of the barrel imho tfios is near flawless and for a runtime of over 2 hours we didnt feel the narrative was long drawn and it has one of the most creative and cutest ways of showing smses and emails on screen i bet it will be copied soon its a movie that like pain demands to be felt and i hope people will fall in love with it like how we fall asleep slowly at first and then all at once,sad
i truly do enjoy a good tearjerker as long there is a meaningful realistic story to back it up now watching people who are dying of all sorts of cancer is a very real and emotional especially if its based on a true story this flick doesnt seem real at any point and the teen humor that fills in during the hopelessness is just silly like allot of death themed flicks it spends sometime bashing god jesus and christianity but portrays the afterlife as some far out imagination wish i love flicks that show reality passion human suffering in a real life setting but this flick somehow drops the ball its a notch above average do to the theme but i would say its shailene woodleys least impressive,sad
the world is not a wishgranting factorysound the distress signal no pile is safemy advice to the tissues out there  slip from the top pocket whisk yourself into the aisle and cloak yourself behind a tossed popcorn bucket the alternative slime  and lots of it from the eyes to the nose to the wet debris of the cheeks it will come and therell be nowhere to hidewill singlehandedly spike the kleenex death tollbased on the similarly eyeflooding book of the same name stars is a very sweet but sad teen romance that educates and enriches as much it entertains unlike most other films that carry the youngsters in love tag its set in our world  as opposed to that blinkyeyed butterfly buzzing haven beyond the screen where michael schoeffling and molly ringwald come together at a kitchen table for a 16th birthday kiss and freddie prinze jr manages to convince rachel leighcook hes more than the weight of his jock jacket this anti teenromance movie is grounded devoid of fluff does away with a happily ever after ending and mostly skips on the omd and the pragmatism is what transports to a whole next galaxy far beyond the juvenile romances of cinema yesteryearas our lead character says at the beginning of the film i believe we have a choice in this world about how to tell sad stories on the one hand you can sugarcoat it nothing is too messed up that cant be fixed with a peter gabriel song i like that version as much as the next girl does its just not the truthyouve had plenty of fruit salad now its time to dig into the chicken breast  its good for youhazel shailene woodley describes herself as a ticking time bomb  but cancer will do that she seems to be just waiting around for the boom and fair enough though not big on socializing her mothers insistence leads her to a support group there she immediately catches the eye of courteous gus ansel elgort who lost a leg to the disease hes only there supporting a friend hazel and gus begin to grow closer  thanks to a mutual love of movies music and literature  and things get serious just as hazels health takes a turn for the worsei am in love with you hazel grace responds gus and i know that love is just a shout into the void and that oblivion is inevitableand i am in love with you all of your efforts to keep me away from you are going to faila secondary subplot strings the main thread together hazels found comfort in a book about a young girl also with cancer who feels exactly the same about the disease as she does the book leaves her hanging though  it doesnt give her the answers shes looking for so she writes to the author who invites her to meet in amsterdam with the assistance of her everloving beau gus hazels able to convince her doctors that she should be allowed to take the trip and so sets off  with boyfriend and mother laura dern in tow  to amsterdam to get the answers she so desires the trip is a memorable one for a whole different set of reasonsits the realism of stars that sees it effortlessly make out with the lump in your throat from the credible and amazing performances of its two leads shailene woodley has emerged as one of todays best young actresses  here she embodies true leadinglady potential ansel elgort is as equally as good serving up a wideranging eyecatching and likable performance to the realistic but heartbreaking story being told you know walking in theres not going to be a happy ending for anyone here theres nothing inauthentic about the film i pinched the reel  and its reflex suggested it was the real deal true not a false beat in director josh boones orchestrain its depiction of terminal illness boones adaptation doesnt attempt to evoke sympathy from the audience nor does it ask you to pity the lives the leads have been granted the film almost offers a positive spin  not unlike gus does every few minutes in the movie  on cancer reminding audiences that until youve breathed your last breath youre still alive and should embrace that inspiring it also reminds that even a short but welllived life is far from a waste  one can search forever for that special thing that makes their life complete or like hazel and gus they can find it in just a few monthsyou gave me a forever within the numbered days and i cant tell you how they cry out for a little infinityis a movie that will ultimately still stir sniffles and flip smiles particularly knowing how its going to turn out for the central characters but it might also slap a few of the living dead out there into a new beginning where theyll start to make the most of their beingeveryone will get something out of this  but especially those whove been working themselves over for months to years on end because of something that was out of their hands find happiness where you can push on even when you think you cant and keep the tragic losses locked behind the padlock guarding your heart  after all theyre yours i will not tell you our love story becauselike all real love stories it will die with us as it should amen,sad
the ya book adaptations as the name suggest is a genre for teens and what do teens care about love yeah a bunch of other things too but thats exactly why i never got why they cant make an adaptation where there are real emotions radiating from the screen just so you know it can be taken seriously its never come together for me maybe with the exception of hunger games but the love story isnt the most important thing there anyway twilight is the example where it was the worst the books had feeling but the films were a parody of love okay so what do you need to successfully adapt a book professionals thats where twilight went wrong but it looks like the other film studios are starting to learn from others mistakes and when fox acquired the rights to john greens positively critiqued romantic novel from 2012 they set out to let professionals handle the film cause its to their advantage to make a good film so theyll make money first off they got a young but talented director one who knows a thing or two about romantic dramas and they gave the script to the spectacular nows and the 500 days of summers genius writer this was a great step because the spectacular now was one of the best romantic films of the last little while and then they cast shailene woodley and another divergent cast member ansel elgor so is that really all you need for a good film looks like it the director does his job well the adaptation was done well you dont feel like something is missing if you havent read the book its not really much cinematography wise but the realistic way it was done was good for this production and it really brings showcases the teenage atmosphere the script works it gives us great characters its just a little predictable but because of the theme i figure the book is the same the actors are great in their roles and what i found even better that their acting doesnt start and end with being sick thats not the only layer of their character thats just a status most romances make the mistake that they are too far fetched and cover the screen in rose colored goop how cares if 1000 plus people died on a sinking boat their love affair ended well this film isnt like that it reacts of reality its like it could happen to any one of our friends maybe thats why it hits so hard even when it has the requisite romantic goop it feels like they are based in reality its also a great thing about the film that the romantic story line isnt even the central theme its just a means to help us see how they come of age this becoming an adult theme has the added drama with their medical histories but the film is helped out with the occasional humor that isnt taken to the extreme all in all that quotes shakespeare with its title is one of the best ya adaptations and romantic dramas of course it cant knock notebook off its throne but its up there so i give it a 810 httpswwwyoutubecomusersilverscreenreviews1,sad
i was quite disappointed in this movie and surprised at all the 910 star reviews i dont want to repeat everything people with 1 star reviews have said but totally agree with most of them bad acting i mean where is the chemistry between these two people where does this great love come from that they keep talking about but are not showing love story not on any level and how many times can you say omg in a movie was there some kind of guinness world record attempt here it was very distracting and so shallow i had watched the good lie just before this and was bawling my eyes out this just felt like a cheat after that great movie great because it was so real,sad
this is my first reviewrant having just finished the movie a little late i know i just didnt care enough to watch it in theaters and i had to get this out i dont cry easily in movies but when i do im not shy about it because thats the whole point of fiction to evoke emotion and if a moviebooktv show has managed to do that to me it just means said work of fiction has done its jobnow that being said i went in to this movie sort of knowing the ending and what to expect having waited this long to watch it i just couldnt completely avoid spoilers or hearing how people have reacted to it ie tears what i could not predict was turning this seething mass of tears pain and snotwhich brings me to my point why in thors name did i do this to myself because stories like this add to the human condition they enrich our mundane lives pain however bad it might seem at the time is better than being numbthis an excellent film one which i regret not watching sooner because in spite of knowing how it was going to turn out right from the beginning it still managed to grip me imagine how much more i could have enjoyed it had caught me by surprisei guess what im saying is if youre on the fence about watching this movie as i was because of the demographic of its fans or the ya tag dont be it stands on its own as just a really good story you dont need to be a teenage girl to enjoy this,sad
having read the book first i was excited but also very sceptical to watch this movie i love the book and of course i was afraid the movie would just not be as good as the book was and i am very glad that it didnt disappoint me the movie was very true to the book there was really only one scene i was missing and nothing was majorly changed the main actors were really good and i believe that is what made this movie as good as it is but its also the small stuff  rooms looked exactly like ive imagined them when i was reading the book and even when i first saw ansel he looked just like how id imagined gus to look i dont really know of anyone who has read the book and hated it so my guess is that you will enjoy this movie it has  just like the book  a bit of everything from humor to sadness at the beginning i felt like things were going too quickly but a lot happens in the book i also felt that some actors couldnt be as serious as they needed to be luckily the main actors were perfect and the ending had the right effect even though i knew how it was going to end i loved the movie and would recommend it to anyone,sad
it is very hard to form coherent thoughts and sentences after seeing this movie just as likely after reading the amazing book by john green is definitely a masterpiece in every single way when i first heard about it i thought this will be yet another teen love story with no original thoughts whatsoever boy was i wrong first of all the book is perfectly written the story and the characters are so real when you start to read it you will immediately jump into the john green created world and well that is a rollercoaster ride that only goes up i saw a lot of tearjerker movies that had something to do with cancer or illness but i have never saw a movie that was so artistically and perfectly wrapped up in this psychological universe which was filled with wisdom the movie not only shows us a love story it also tries to get you thinking about the finite life and at the same time its infinity however what truly is remarkable the fact that it does that in such a down to earth way not heavy quotes and out of reach definitions just simple yet powerful thoughts that are going through wellorganized minds the movie adaptation i have to say was certainly not a let down i was really scared to watch this after reading the perfection that book was but i am glad i watched it shaileene and ansel were great choices for hazel and augustus they are great actors and they really grasped the essence of the characters the milieu and the whole environment of the movie was very similar to the books director josh boone did an amazing job the monologues were spot on ad the saddest scenes in the books were truly the saddest scenes in the movie it is really hard to create something extraordinary in todays world john green you did that and for that you will be remembered you are loved widely and i am sure you are loved deeply because that is all that matters thank you for giving a world some infinity within this finite life,sad
this is at par with the notebook i love the emotions in the film and the best part is that a similar relationship is being undergone by me so i can relate even more the film made me overjoyed it is amazing certain cinematic techniques used in the film made it stand out even more i like the way the characters are built the way the film starts the way it ends everythingthis film is a landmark when it comes to romantic films not clichd at all very sweet it makes you fall in love with the characters over and over again and you empathize with themthe actors were brilliant they felt the situation that was evident it formed a really nice base the actors performances for this amazing storythis is a must watch even if you tend to hate romantic films because this is cheesy a bit but amazingly so ,sad
i loved it i cried for almost the last 45 minutes of the movie its one of movies that you have to bring tissues its definitely a chick flick the people on the team that made the movie cast the right actors and actresses to play the main characters john green is one of the best authors for young adult romance i read the book but dont really remember some of the major plot so i cant really compare the book to the movie its a movie that i would buy when it comes out on dvd i think its going to be like the breakfast club for me ill be able to watch over and over again and itll never get old the part i dont like about the whole story is the way peter van houten treats hazel grace he acts like a total jerk and they definitely picked the right actor to play his part willem dafoe i just want to say that i recommend it to all the people whove read the book or like romance,sad
adapted from john greens novel of the same name is the story of hazel shailene woodley and gus ansel elgort two teenage cancer patients who meet at a support group form a friendship and fall in love it is a fairly typical teen romantic drama of two souls reaching out to one another each with their own emotional and physical baggage gus a prosthetic leg hazel the constant companion of an oxygen tankfor two thirds of the 126 minute running time josh boones follow up to stuck in love is an uncomfortable experience not because of the subject matter of cancer and inevitable death but because tries so damn hardconstantly we are pushed and cajoled into empathizing with the sick teenagers and to feeling the depth of their friendship it all feels far too forced hazels mother frannie laura dern gushes and sighs sycophantically everything is amazing fantastic absolutely beautiful the dress she gives her daughter is just one example of painful gushing that is promptly undone in the very next scene when a waitress shows them to a table wearing a genuinely stunning dressit is irksome annoying cringeworthy and the worst kind of labored insulting schmaltzy teen pap that ostracizes anyone with at least two years distance from the completion of puberty i just wanted hazel to get on and die so i could go home and whinge at my wife for dragging me alongthen in the final act boone turns around in a scene i shall in the interest of avoiding plot spoilers refer to simply as the poultry scene the dynamic changes from there on finds a grip on reality it stops propelling us into emotional traps and just flows carrying us along with itfrom there on it feels real the contrivances evaporate the bludgeoning ends and it just gets on with the job of showing us a heartbreaking story of life that sometimes isnt fair and death that is inevitable the only mystery being the timing and cause of itelgot is barely watchable without inciting feelings of mild petulant violence he is smug the ultimate jock without an american football team at his back while im guessing gus should be suave confident and just ballsy enough to be admirable and lovable elgot plays him as cocky and in need of a jolly good slap again regard that as for the first two thirds in the final act he too manages to rein it in a little and pulls us on side his gus isnt bad just annoying and the kind of kid youd make you wonder why your daughter wasnt aiming higherwoodley the secret life of the american teenager the descendants however gives a stunning tempered performance that pulls us onside from the outset hazel is a good kid a sweet girl but not apple pie perfect  close but woodley just avoids it the emotion that pours from woodley racks her and shocks us it is impossible not to imagine ourselves in that situation even if we have limited experience of it there is no suggestion of onions rubbed into the eyes prior to rolling the camera just an outpouring of pent up anger and an unfair amount of heartbreak stunning though belongs to woodley director boone and his screenwriters deserve the final compliment it would have been far too easy and from the first hour or so i imagined it no other way to extend the film to its final mulchy conclusions boone exercises restraint turns around a twostar trudge into a journey that ends with possibility within the inevitability it is a perfect end that leaves a heaviness in the heart rather than the earlier tightening n the stomachfor more reviews from the squiss subscribe to my blog and like the facebook page,sad
a young love clouded by death two attractive young people fall in love so what is the problem well they met at a cancer support group and both have terminal cancerthis is a very unlikely love story it has all the elements of a romcom but it is a drama through and through attraction excitement are all there but with a nasty reality bite each of them knows they are dying soon but for the moment they are concerned not losing the person they love or hurt them on the whole it was made in a way that displays all angles in such an unfortunate story first person immediate family and partner it is one thing for the person concerned to know they are to pass soon but what about the parents involved knowing they are about to lose a child it is just harrowingin the midst of it all comes romance it was resisted at times rejected but in this tower of gloom perhaps it was the only breath of fresh air that made sensego see it and rejoice life do take note however this is not a first date movie,sad
i went to see this movie with my best friend neither of us thought that we would cry but i was wrong the movie doesnt start very exciting but trust me it gets better i would though recommend that you read the book before you see the movie so you are at least a little prepared i sat there crying my eyes out when spoiler alert gus died i mean it came out of nowhere but it was a true tragedy the trailers make it look like a chick flick but honestly it is not anyone would think that gus was perfectly fine but once he tells hazel that he has cancer all over and he only has weeks left it shows strength determination and best of all love an amazing film based on an amazing book make sure you watch it,sad
starring shailene woodley and ansel elgort is an incredible movieappealing to both adults and teenagersthe script plot and the performances of all the actors are great and also notable is the chemistry between shailene and anselthe lines are really good and through the lives of hazel and gusteenagers that suffer from canceryou can realize deeper truthsits an emotional and dramatic film and i think its hard not to cryespecially in the endso be prepared for all these reasons and many more youll understand while watching the movie i gave it a 9 because eventhough i like action films and adventures these movie touched me so much and i would watch it again againwith a tissue package of coursep,sad
omg i loved it it was absolutely phenomenal they really stuck to the book yay and even had most of the actual dialogs which you dont really see in some other movies so i was very proud and excited i think the cast really was really great and i wouldnt have changed the cast at all the actors and actresses really pulled it off it was an awesome tearful and romantic movie ill make sure to get it on dvd thumbs up  thank you for making the wonderful book into a visual making it even more precious the book will always be remembered and now the movie awesome job to the people who helped make the book come to life great job,sad
i havent watched the movie yet but the story is awesome its funny sad romantic its got everything the storyline is fun not boring full of surprises i love how john green could feed me with such complete story i love him  and i cant wait too watch the movie so excited i love all the details all of the characters and all of the conflicts the sad moments really bring me down and the funny moments make me laugh i canr wait to watch the movie really and if someone tells you they dont like this movie of whatever they dont have hearts trust me watch this movie and you wont be disappointed cheers,sad
first i want to start of by telling that i havent read the book also im a guy so normally this isnt the kind of movie i go for btw this is the first time i write a review and im still a noob at it so please consider it that way and this review may contain spoilers usually i try to avoid romantic movies because lets face it a lot of them are very similar to one another i did like perks of being a wallflower if id had to give an exceptionbut today a friend of mine asked to go to and halfunwillingly i accompanied her to sum the movie up really quickly two teenagers suffering from cancer fall in love the story is fresh and although its a heavy subject the way that its being handled by the director and the cast makes it more accessible and sometimes even funny its no depressing flick it gets you to think too people suffering from terminal diseases not only have to wait for death sorry for the perhaps cruel way of saying this but they also have to face the fact that theyre leaving their family and loved ones behind and that theyll cause them a lot of pain once theyre gone i think the story is partly about thatas i said im an amateur so i think ill just conclude with the fact that they really made the script work or the book by for example their okay youll know what i mean when you see the movie as long as you dont forget to bring the tissues i think a lot of people even men or nonromantics can enjoy this movie at least i did,sad
shailene woodley adopts the role of hazel grace lancaster so beautifully that it is hard to believe this movie isnt based on a true story the movie is very comingofage but also captures the true sadness of illness its great to see newcomers such as ansel elgort who only rose to fame last year and oldtimers such as willem dafoe come together for the adaptation of new york times best seller book by john green the casting couldnt be more perfect and the soundtrack took my breath away no hard feelings hazel but it has to be said my experience of the film was more magical than i could have expected as i witnessed at an advanced screening two weeks before the actual release in the uk the people lucky enough to go were given a limited edition poster and were able to watch a qa with the cast after the tears had been spilt and the credits rolled the screening was so spectacular due to all the kids being hard core fangirls and fanboys there was disapointingly only one boy representing the males we all awed wooed laughed and cried together and nobody was ashamed to let the whole theatre hear their sobs it made the movie that much special john green is an excellent writer and the movie couldnt be any more representative of his book 1010 no questioning the matter ,sad
in the many dumb movies coming out i felt that brought back the romance to modern day teenagers romance we forgot as we grew older and got busy i loved how the relationship evolved smoothly and grew little by little making the spectators hearts grow with them youll simply love the way they love each otherbeautiful movie intelligently written and i wished i havent read the book before if i didnt knew what was going to happen i would have cried more but even though i cried and generally i say books are better than adaptations but in this case i liked the movie way better i even suggest to watch the film and then read the book as a relief to revisit those attaching characters and depict beautiful quoteshave a nice cry,sad
when i first saw the trailer of this movie i already felt the hyped inside of me feeling that it will give me the awalktoremember feeling all over again i havent read the book  yet  but seeing those positive feed backs of the trailer from the book lovers made me think that probably my excitement for this adaptation could be worth it then june 07 2014 happened i could say that my sister and i picked the best seats inside the theater but as the opening credits and some scenes started showing i thought that maybe we didnt picked the best moviei was very disappointed in the opening scenes especially the opening credits putting a series of scenes from the movie i mean what is that are you trying to spoil what will happen before we can even watch it and what is the purpose of those opening scenes for us to get excited before the movie well i surely lost my excitement after seeing those scenesanother turn off factor for this movie is the monologue of shailene woodley in the beginning surely a lot of people are raping that replay button once the trailer was released and they have probably memorized those lines i myself memorized some of it after watching it two or three times they could have at least alter some of the lines for the movies opening after letting it be the opening of the trailerenough of the movies structures i shall go now to its story line which gave the movie justice after that poor opening scenes followed by those cheesycourtingtwilightclich of the two characters in the beginning and i am talking about the scenes from the amsterdam i think that it is where the story became mature and complex and im glad for it because i will surely leave the theater if it wasnt for thatto sum this all up the movie have pros and cons of course like any other movie besides the bad introduction the actors also contributed to the movies cons i think shailene is not ready for those kinds of roles she can stick with her divergent role first and let her potential evolve there as for ansel he lacks charisma and weak delivery of his lines lines in which contributed to the movies pros those lines are marvelous and for me i think it hasnt been done justice by the lead characters except nat wolffs delivery of his eulogy for augustus that almost made me cryi rate this movie 710 for the amsterdam story of course,sad
i know that since this movie is based on a book that is read by many teenage girls the movie is bound to get people scoffing at it and writing it off and i understand that i myself expected to see some cheesy stuff that made me cringe at how hard it tries to be deep or sad but i go into films wanting to enjoy them and im not going to be an idiot and pretend like i didnt like this movie i think a lot of people say its bad just because lots of teenage girls like it and that means they need to bash it and shouldnt like it it turned out to be really good touching and a lot less cheesy then i was expectinglet me say that i think shailene woodley does a great job she sells the role completely and seems so sweet and likable she takes lines from the book that might when said out loud seem cheesy or pretentious but she makes them sound natural i would say that i liked ansel elgort in his role 93 of the time he doesnt always sell the lines and sometimes it makes it seem cheesy or done just to make young teen girls swoon over him he can occasionally fall into the dream guy clich that romance films have but i would say overall he works you do care for him they have great chemistry and its so great seeing them on screen i think they work quite well the sad parts are handled in a good manner i wont spoil anything but it doesnt feel like theyre doing stuff to force us to cry at the movie the movie just falls together well and you feel like crying because it works it makes it all feel real their conversations feel fairly real aside from a few remarks from elgorts character such as the whole metaphor thing and the fear of oblivion it really gets you right in the heart while its not a perfect movie its extremely enjoyable and has a lot of heart it will make you laugh cry and get you thinking about love i will say that if youre and extremely negative single person you might not like this movie i think having an understanding of love or a relationship helps with connecting to the film i saw it with my girlfriend and it really kind of made me think about our relationship in a good way if youre gonna hate on this for being marketed to teen girls theres no point in watching it because youve already made up your mind about it otherwise go and see this film its really something,sad
i have watched so many romantic movies such as the notebook titanic etc and this is definitely the best one ive ever seen the story is brilliant and makes you want it to keep on going and going usually when i watch movies in cinemas i would occasionally check my phone to see what the time is or check up on whats going on social media but with this movie i never even touched my phone i was just couldnt keep my eyes off the screen and yes its a very sad story and i suggest that you do bring some tissues because if you cry during movies a lot youre going to be heartbroken when watching this it doesnt matter if your a male or female or an old or young person youll just love this movie and its just so different from those other love stories you know how 90 of love stories made today they meet they like each other they kiss break up and then back together etc is just perfect they love each other for the whole movie with no major fights i recommend this to anyone including the male population,sad
im a man who hates teen love stories while i do believe in love at first sight ive been one who has been bitterly betrayed by love however when i first saw the previews for this movie i was intrigued by the nature of this love story romeo and juliet is beloved because of what one will do for love after seeing this story reminds me that it isnt just what one will do for love but how true love enhances and make precious the moments that you have before oblivion the raw emotions of elation to despair draw you in unlike the perspective of the bucket list of one who have lived life this one reminds us how there are an infinite number of numbers between 0 and 1 and we are great indeed to have love even with the greatest pain this movie hurts hazel and gus will make you feel every nuance of joy anticipation eagerness awkwardnessfrustration guilt fear frustration and peace it sometimes takes death to remind us of living and yes and that even one day no one will remember us,sad
before anyone gets mad at me please note that not only am i a huge fan of the book but also that a 610 is a positive score i was really looking forward to this film but a lot of things fell flat for me ansel elgort is a really good actor but i think that he wasnt the best choice for augustus a lot of the dialogue came off as unnatural and it sounded really weird hearing it from him excluding his performance in the car scene i loved shailene woodley as hazel and she really became the character and i had no trouble believing that she was hazel i felt like the movie was actively trying to make you cry rather than having the story and characters make you feel an emotion on its own and it felt cheap and seeing all the people in the audience bawling honestly made me laugh josh boones directing felt very generic and didnt really have a staple to it which makes me sad because this is a movie that could have a real staple feel to it overall i was very disappointed with the movie but believe me im still looking forward to the paper towns movie,sad
some spoilersthis was definitely by far one of my favourite book to movie adaptations i left the theatre feeling the same way i felt when i finished the book everything was so well done i loved the acting directing and writing of this movie i was skeptical when i found out the ansel elgort was going to play augustus i had watched carrie and i loved the character he played in that movie and i thought he was quiet cute i also watched divergent but personally i dont like the character so i didnt think much of his role in the movie in the book augustus was described to be incredibly hot and breath takingly beautiful though i thought ansel was good looking i was still worried however i was not disappointed at all by ansels portrayal and the directors choice i could not have imagined a better person to play augustus he did such an amazing job playing the role i fell in love with augustus waters all over again because of ansel  i knew that shailene was going to do an amazing job i have seen her previous moviestv shows the descendants the spectacular now divergent the secret life of an american teenager and i already loved her as an actress i was not at all shocked at her beautiful performance supporting cast did a remarkable job glad to see willem dafoe in this movie the screenplay locations and direction of this movie completely satisfied me as a book fan everything did complete justice to me as a fan though there were scenes that were taken out i was no disappointed though a little shocked the way they portrayed the feelings and emotions of the book to the movie was spectacularly beautiful the essence of the story and book was not missed the same lessons were taught the same emotions were felt and the same ache and tears came through half of the movie the way the dealt with the tragedy was amazing i was so glad that they made us fall in love with augustus the same way as john green made us fall in love with him the worst part for me to deal with was the pre funeral scene mostly but mostly half of the movie left me in tears excellent job done and i could have not been happier as a book fan  thank you josh boone scott neustadter john green shailene woodley ansel elgort nat wolff and all other cast for making this experience the best possible for me,sad
you know how really good books are often adapted into crappy movies that dont do the story justice is not one of themits hard to describe the plot of tfios to convince someone to see it i mean what else could you really say besides is a romance comedy about two teenagers with cancer who fall in love that doesnt make it seem like a typical sappy romance film that most of us are tired of by now how else could we try to distinguish the unique quality of tfios as we know it besides following up on that plot summary with but really its john green you just have to trust me on thisi was honestly skeptical about seeing this movie at all the cast didnt seem very exceptional from what ive seen from the trailers i was afraid like many others that seeing the movie would replace my vision of the book as when you thinks harry potter you instantly imagine daniel radcliffe and i didnt trust the performances of the actors especially having last seen maleficent in which all the cast were extremely bad with the exception of angelina jolie and elle fanningit wasnt until i saw john greens tweets about sneaking into the theater to see tfios with oblivious movie goers learned about his close involvement with the movie adaption and discovered that it was the official opening day that i got really excited and asked some friends to see the movie with me i was skeptical throughout the entire movie until an involuntary teardrop ran down my face and when it was difficult to stop myself from sobbing i knew this was extremely good shailene woodley hazel and ansel elgort augustus waters were absolutely phenomenal everything was extraordinary  the pacing execution cast story content what they included and didnt leave out from the book in the movie music selection  not to mention hilarious well worth a watch youd be missing out if you didnt im going to see tfios for a second time tomorrow because its just that goodi suggest reading the book first and then watching this make sure your heart can handle the tears youll be glad to be a part of hazel and guss little infinity okayokay,sad
the story is about a cancer patient hazel her condition requiring her to always carry a set of breathing equipment at a support group she meets gus a boy with a prosthetic leg after amputation from cancer their relationship grow sharing a same passion in the novels going together to amsterdam to meet their favorite writer and dealing with their illnesses together until the end it turns out that gus goes ahead of hazelthe base story was a soso for me a sick girl finds love in a fellow sick boy going through hardships until at the end one of them dies this recipe is the essence of almost all of indonesian drama in the 80s and 90s that they bore me and made me have some low expectations on this movie i dont even want to elaborate on the story like used to on my reviews because its the same like the ones i mentionedbut the development into screenplay and the execution is just great the little things that often go undermined are the ones that in fact make this movie different yes this movie truly relate to other sick people and their suffering but this movie also relate to the healthy population but feeling a bit unstable in their minds particularly on the later parts the value being spread implicitly is that its okay to not having so many people adoring or following us as long as there is one that cares and loves us deeplythe dialog is quite the strong part of this movie there are more than a few remarks and punchlines that really touch the emotions and the hearts of the viewers i personally am not a person to weep over any movie but sometimes i get the chills when a movie is inspiring and i admit the dialog of this movie does give me the chills i personally like the first and last monologues they really touches the heart quite bluntly without being softened also the lines gus tell monicas mother is just a punch to any persons consciencethe side scenes are also worthy of mention the struggle of isaac in coping with his breakup and the efforts of gus and hazel to cheer him up is a great addition to the main story the twist and revelation of van houtens own struggle with the memories of his daughter is also touchingthe cast of upandcoming actors are just a great recipe for this movie its the second time we see shailene woodley and ansel elgort in one frame after being brothers and sisters in divergent a few months back well i sure see shaylene woodley feeling quite at home with this genre of drama romance after last years the spectacular now for me this is the first i see elgort in a focal role and he doesnt disappoint he plays the character gus well and quite enliven the intended liveliness of the character an addition of a senior willem dafoe playing the disgruntled and grumpy van houten completes the recipe without stealing the focus from the two main charactersthe acting is just quite as expected i say just expected because quite frankly there isnt any highlights from the whole act the movie is being great more from its screenplay and story points at least woodleys acting is quite good because she is successful in transitioning from the quite fun drama in the spectacular now to this rather sad story the soundtrack is greatly done placed the selection is quite the safe ones for the taste of the common eras young adults overall from me its a movie worth an 8 out 10 score and a recommendation to go and see with such a hearttouching story and values relating not only to sick people i think it deserves it,sad
i mostly hate all romantic movies like twilightand obviously i was skeptical about this moviefortunately i went with my wife to the theaterand let me tell you that this movie is awesomethe characters are memorable and fell real clever dialogs probably the weakness is the clich historythe actors do a great job especially shailene that was a roller coaster of emotionsi highly recommend it pd you will need tissues,sad
i had been waiting for this movie for a long time i had read the book because my friends made me and i read it in the course of three hours i went to this movie not even close to be emotionally prepared my friend had seen it before and brought a roll of toilet paper instead of tissues because she had ran out from the previous time needless to say i loved tfios i loved the way that all the tears were real and how true to the book they stayed a few small details were missing but it was nothing that was drastic shailene woodley gave a phenomenal performance as hazel she was true to the character and didnt overdo it a single bit ansel elgort is a fresh face in hollywood i would call one of his first films a success he did augustus justice and never settled for anything less than perfect nat wolff was the comic relief of the whole movie every time he was on the screen he said something that made the audience just stop crying and laugh a wonderful isaac wilem dafoes performance as peter van houton was amazing that was exactly how i pictured van houton and the way he just spoke was beautiful i give major creds to john green he was the wonderful voice behind all of this lines such as during augustus death scene were word for word and everything was so well done i laughed i cried and i had to tell my friends i loved them just in case over fifty times ive never cried more in my life i would call it a success,sad
i have been waiting for months and months for this movie to come out and my wait was definitely not in vain from direct book quotes to the incredible acting and chemistry between shai and ansel this movie had me crying from the sheer beauty of some parts and sobbing from the extremely wellportrayed sadness and despair that comes with cancer and suffering hazels eulogy was directly from the book and brought me to tears as did isaacs speech and guss reactions the scene with van houten played out almost exactly like in the book and hazels temper provided comic relief from the impending catastrophe at the endthe chemistry between shailene and ansel was incredible being friends from shooting divergent together they could easily get along and communicate and it was evident in the way that ansel played augustus that his character was deeply in love with shailenes character hazel i felt like they were not actors but the characters from one of my favorite books of all time brought to life on a 40foot screen the movie surpassed my expectations and left me speechless with tears brimming out of my eyes and i absolutely loved it if the scale went higher it would get a 17 out of 10 from me,sad
is a beautiful and thought provoking movie the story centers on two young adults hazel and gus who without giving too much away have been battling cancer since they were little the story is from hazels point of view the movie is based off a best selling book for fans of the book well every fan is different but it was one of the most faithful and best book adaptations in fact the movie actually ends better than the book it gets the final lines just right it may not be the ending i wanted after falling in love with the characters of augustus waters and hazel grace lancaster the movie is about life love friendship family humorliving with a cloud over your head and death it has a lot of humor and a lot of heart it is well written and actedshailene woodley and ansel elgort are perfectly cast as hazel and gus both give powerful performances they are both amazing and gifted actors shailene and ansels on screen chemistry is natural beautiful and phenomenal they make hazel and gus not only one of the most memorable movie love stories in decades but two of the most likable and memorable characters to hit the screenbefore this movie i was familiar with shailene woodley and knew she was talented so it was ansel elgort who really blew me away in this movie gus is such a remarkable character you fall in love with him and his humor and his spirit he is more relatable and memorable than lloyd duckie landon noahetc and ansel brought gus to live perfectly his performance will make you laugh and cry like a babythis movie is worth checking out more than once and is not just a movie for young adultsits one of the best love stories and movies in years,sad
this movie was more than okay i absolutely loved it and it will definitely be hard to beat for movie of the summer it is definitely hard for me to put this movie into words because as i was watching it i wasnt really concerned on how this would rank it was a great movie with wit character a structured script and comedy although i havent cried in a movie since extremely loud and incredibly close back in 2011 i did cry while watching this tear jerker being played out by these amazing faultless stars the only thing that needs improvement is the transitions from one subject to another in scripting and in the story i did jump around quite a bit all in all i give this an 810 stars no fault in that and this movie also earns a spot on my top 100 movie list thanks,sad
to all peaple who said it was awfulyou dant have heart how could you saydidnt you cry you dont understand the pain was on meit was touching all of your skin the male acter he was perfect his acting was adorbale so why someone has said he was awfule he tried to hide his pain and show his smile to the girl it was kinda acting and was so so agonizing to see him when he was tring to smile,sad
its the best romantic film i have ever seen  the relationship between augustus and hazel is so beautiful,sad
this film is a masterpiece because the story is profound and movingthe main carathers are awesome and their love story is very interestingin one word this film is exceptional,sad
this movie is identical to the book honestly its a perfect adaptation if you are a fan of bad acting dull cinematography cringey scripts and the glamorization of deadly diseases then you will love this movie if you find any of those things to be boring or in poor taste then i would recommend skipping this abomination,sad
there are already hundreds of reviews for this film praising it as some beautiful and heartbreaking journey between two kids in love and you know those reviews are right is absolutely incredible if you want hours and hours of text going over how absolutely incredible it is its not too difficult to find the 10star reviews this is in my opinion a pretty good film with a lot to offerits also incredibly pretentious its beginning introduction narrated by hazel tells you that movies should tell the truth instead of romanticizing terminal illness and then it does exactly what it says movies shouldnt do all while introducing two young adults who talk as though theyre reciting poetry every time they open their mouths if you really want the truth people dont speak this way or act this way augusten was the most annoying character in a film ive ever come across in a long time every normal conversation between him and hazel dissolves into geeky pop culture references video games and philosophical musings his pseudointellectual routine yet childish attitude just makes him seem ridiculous hazel herself is so apathetic that its simply unrealistic they have many wonderful onscreen moments together but the pretentiousness got on my last nerve every time the similar 2003 film my life without me also about a girl dying from cancer and falling in love did it the right way showing real human beings without watering them down under nerd culture and lame jokesthe great moments in this film however far outweigh the lousy ones issac who has gone blind from retinal cancer is perhaps the most realistic of any of the characters in the film he bring initial comic relief to the story and later on profound sadness augusten does often drop the showoff attitude and prove himself to be an excellent person whether taking hazel on picnics to an enormous artists rendering of a skeleton to getting her on a tour to meet her favorite author in amsterdam which strays from its route and ends up becoming a tour of anne franks house theres a lot of value to as a film in general however the ending is very harrowing and this is not a story for everyone its going to be a magnificent masterpiece for some viewers and a morose kick in the pants for others either way whichever side of that spectrum you happen to fall on this is still a story worth pursuing,sad
before watching this film i read the book upon recommendation from friends i hated the book it was unrealistic i cant relate to any of the characters depressing in that they had cancer and boring with a 12 hour flight across the pacific i decide to give the story another chance and watch the film exactly the same thoughtshowever alongside the dull story line you are also faced with the terrible acting out of touch music and redeeming cinematography if not for the cinematography this film would be getting a 110 rather than a 2overall an easy way to pass a 12 hour flight dont waste your time on watching this film unless you are a stupid 16 year old girl,sad
i consider myself a woman of taste if intelligent people tend to like a certain thing im likely to give it a chance sadly i find the praises heaped upon this movie and its source material not only baffling but frightening in the first place i found augustus obnoxious not the sort of guy id be into at any point in my life that kept me from buying into the emotions the story is meant to elicit shailene woodley makes for an unpleasant heroine namely with her chainsmoker voice john green has said that the main characters are obnoxious navelgazers on purpose but that doesnt redeem them in my eyes no one ever calls them out on it and their personalities dont change so they remain irritating the whole movie long id be willing to spend time with characters like this if they got some sort of comeuppance or maturation furthermore what about the part where they have their first kiss in the anne frank house someone else out there must find it not so romantic in fact ive never seen something so flagrantly disrespectful is being a middleclass teen with cancer anything like living in danger of the holocaust no how did john green not know better yes i am holding him responsible for the movie because as this page will tell you he was closely involved in its making green once tweeted why did i have to make tfios so sad that is a sign of insincerity it suggests that tfios was written not out of the authors experience but manufactured in the name of true art charlotte bront would never ask that about villette her best novel she put the misery and depression she knew too well into villette so that her story could be heard john green is not the sort of person who would have any sad story to tell because he knew what it was like he can only fail at speaking for others,sad
the fault in our star is the romance movie this movie talked about two teenage cancer patients that fall in love with each other a girl hazel graze has lung cancer and a boy augustus waters lost one leg with cancer they met at a cancer support group and knew each other and their health problems in the final part is so sad as the author of this movie john green put augustus waters dead hazel grace is my favorite character because shes strong and brave even she has lung cancer since she was young but she never given up i really feel real to her my favorite part of this book is when augustus confessed his love to hazel grace which i felt so happy for them the sad scene is on the final part hazel grace reads the letter that augustus wrote for her after he died this book made me cry so hard and it never keep me from turning the pages i really wish the final part wont end like this that i hope augustus waters is alive and have happy ending with hazel graze i would like to recommend this book for everyone especially for people whom like book with relationship and dramatic,sad
the fault in our star is based on the bestselling novel by john green its the best book to movie adaptation ive seen in a long time i was curious as to why this movie is so good and at the same time makes you cry i dont regret watching it at all it is very satisfying movie that will bring you to tears every time i watch it it does really touch my heart it shows you the meaning of life the movie is hilarious beautiful and heartbreaking all at the same time the casting is great the acting is great and it feels real the acting was brilliant and made the whole film work each character was likable and had arcs the effects are great as well it is one of my favorite movies of all time ive read and watched the movie many times but i still wont get bored i have to give most of the credit to john green for writing an amazing book i highly recommend this movie to everyone especially teens see it dont miss it or you will regret that you missed best movie of all time,sad
ive watched many movies in my life none of them were so close to my heart i have not had movies with a not so happy ending in my best movie list but man this ones different to me the movie characters are all real and i will continue to think so and feel so although the journey was short the couple had sweet time unlike most of us ever have trust joy love hope care beauty pain loneliness is what this life is thanks a lot to everyone who have been part of the movie i wish them a happy life and am eternally grateful i hope we learn to endure the relationships in the best possible way let us not forget to remember that we need not necessarily be in pain to realise the value of life this movie is a gods message to all of us to change for good to live the only life we have in the best possible way we can,sad
i had no expectations towards this film based on the reviews i thought its the kind of movie you have already seen without actually seeing it however falling in love is so beautifully depicted in this movie that im not sure i have seen anything like this in recent films the two main characters and the actors are absolutely lovable just for what they are for their silly jokes and meaningful thoughts some scenes are so powerful that youd want to be in their place despite the cancerdying background it certainly had an impact on me at least and i was once again persuaded how great actor willam dafoe is and it was also nice to see lotte verbeek from nothing personal,sad
to explain im not a big fan of romance movies or even romantic comedy movies if youre going to create one though you better do it right this movie is labeled a romantic comedydrama which is false its more drama than comedy and its because of the cancer oh but it is not the cancer you think of its the crappy displays of character that are cancerouswhat do i mean the main character hazel grace lancaster very white name by the way believes that her fate is inevitable as she will die of her thyroid cancer boring thats when everything changes when the plot device no seriously thats what the book calls him known as augustus gus waters also a very white sounding name comes in and have her live for the moment more boring okay names aside these two arent very interesting to begin with because they sound as depressed as the role they portray hazel sounds like a typical teenager rather than the college student she claims she is and gus is as pretentious as they come on top of that they are supposed to be headoverheels because they both have cancer thats even more depressing some other glaring problems the parents are perfectly okay with having this friend come with them to amsterdam most parents would shout oh hell no even if the trip is complimentary the anne frank scene was way out of place it made absolutely no sense to hold a big moment in there kind of a middle finger to anne frank if you ask memy biggest problem with this whole film however is the subplot with the author oh my god this guy is a complete waste of time and energy for both the characters and the audience first of all you have him portrayed by willem dafoe which was really out of place also another alcoholic author did stephen king secretly write this script but by far the most insulting thing to come out of his mouth as a middle finger to this movie and to the audience was his mentioning of the trolley effect if you dont know it look it up and youll see what i mean altogether this movie i saw because it was a date we both agreed to not see it again because there was plenty wrong with it to not be willing i give it a three because there are a few moments that are genuine because i will admit there is some chemistry its just not that good theres even one funny moment where the blind guy is egging the car but its definitely not enough to save this movie,sad
we forget about people struck with illness and this film came along to remind us about people who are in the midst of it all i liked this film acting is truly excellent you can feel the chemistry between two principal actors plot is interesting although i am not sure is it realistic with going to amsterdam and all but you have to make interesting film like this for the wider audiences otherwise it would not probably be interesting for themi also liked the musicif you have a sick member in your family this is a film for you otherwise you could watch it for fun you might like it like i did,sad
superficial and dull despite the topica story of a relationship between two teens who both have terminal cancer should be an engaging and emotional tale but is strangely empty just feels like a paintbynumbers midday tv movie complete with onedimensional stereotypical characters and disneylike lack of grittiness had potential initially but quickly just fell into a pattern of silly subplots and style over substance ultimately doesnt go anywhere new and ends quite predictably and inevitablyhas its moments though and poses some questions regarding life and death good performance by shailene woodley she is one of the few bright lights in the movie ansel elgort overacts and is irritating similarly laura dern willem dafoe provides the only touch of edginess in the movie but his performance feels a bit forcedreally a death and faux emotion movie for teenagers,sad
a fairly unique take for a teenage love story but nothing to spectacular personally i didnt find it to be as big for a sob fest as it was made out to be partly because after reading the plot you have a good idea where it is heading and partly because well i have seen other lovetragedies before and other the teen cancer survivors this one doesnt bring anything new to the party the notebook was much better and had more believable dialog and a better storyline overall good but nothing special,sad
when i was begin to watch this movie i think this is not good moviebut after i saw this is excellent movieit is so realistic movie about cancer patientsthen i saw this movie written about booki watched this film over and overits so romantic film together drama filmits affecting you for some daysbut the end of this movie isnt bad endi can say its happy end tohazel will not die virginaugustus tooand i didnt understand imdbs 10 line review thingim not living in country which language is englishso my english is awfulif anybody try to speak this thing i know you are feeling thisthere are 1 more line away and its over bye bye,sad
adaptation of the bestselling book of the same name about a terminally ill 17yearold who falls in love with a cancer survivor that she meets at a support group all cast is very likable with admiral performances by leads woodley and elgort and an exceptional supporting appearance by dafoe a real plus for not spoonfeeding the audience but for a story that insists on being honestly sad it certainly lines itself up for convenient tragedy with a turnofevents that is quite predictable to the more observant viewer title comes from shakespeares julius caesar out of four,sad
first of all im sorry i watched it pretty latei dont think most of us have had the heart and the courage to see what this really was no this was not an oversentimental fulloftearsandsadness drama it wasnt even a pure insight into the lives of the afflicted it wasnt even an adaptation of greens novel it was only the pinching romantic and delicate imagery ive always had from listening to wait m83 and its kygo remix by the way im not adulterating my everydays empirical observations and imaginations for the sake of this review check my soundcloud account if youve any suspicions for those of you who actually did see i dont lie neither does my reviewso thats the bottomline if wait wasnt in the movie this might have been six star movie for me but because wait is used and in the exact places as it should have been ill give a maximum not that anybody gives a cuss but then see the movie isnt made for getting cusses its made for assimilators not a word like me who desperately long for content that actually is an honesttogod discernment of what some lives may be like and those lives may not be notably similar i mean i dont have cancer but something relatable to itby the way willem dafoe was the best of all of them the scene where he is first shown is absolutely beautiful and really adds to the 8 ive given his character of gus van houden could not have been exploited the way willem did i mean the guys a natural he looked a sociopath and intellectually overdosed freak and when he said lidewij play bomfalleralla ah man i was practically hoping with the song that followed the production is of course by alfasy  filthy but its usage here in th fault in our stars provided it the vigor and intensity gus van houden was a total mess and that messiness is what i like irregular is the new regular john greens work reached its visualization and i am not disappointed it was good and stickable because of its eventual sentimentalism which is the case with most viewers but with that i think greens original work had much more maturity grip with situation and smoothness everything was too amateurish in the movie and looked more like a collegetypo anyways worked for me i rarely look for beyondthegeneralstandard product when it comes to romance,sad
there are not too many faults in the emotional the movie is centered around hazel and augustus two teenagers with cancer who form an exceptional friendship and romance it is based on john greens bestselling book which made plenty of green in the literary world the ascending shailene woodley marvels again with another solid performance here as hazel shailene fortunately has not diverted herself into the poisons of hollywood demise newcomer anton elgort is an unfaulty starinthemaking with his work here as augustus and i also thought willem dafoe was stellar as novelist van houten but a dafoe performance is usually outstanding just at default josh boones direction of the film was authentic as he did not convert into a weepy lifetime movie by incorporating a myriad of themes in the picture i loved how love for a novel became a potent point in the movie yes i even read into that sure this type of film will bring the handkerchiefs and kleenexes out but i refuse to call a tearjerker i rather describe it as a strong movie about the power of love and maybe i am reaching for the stars but last i checked there is no fault in that  excellent,sad
i watched a movie called i hope it won an oscar and any other award it could it addresses and embraces terminal illness and death with  beauty is the word that comes to mind you will cry you will laughyou will rage and it will all be very real how do i know im terminally ill i am have sever copd yes like leonard nimoy and i could die literally at any moment this film is a true representation of what dying is like of the sorrow and terror and silliness i love this movie every single person in the world should watch this movie this movie is the absolute best of the film makersstory tellers art i would have given it twenty stars but they only give you ten slots,sad
i want to give my opinion of this movie and i usually dont write reviews but after seeing a lot of negative ratingsreviews i must for all the people who gave this below 8 star rating i guess you dont see the complexity of this film you only see the negativity around every corner and to be honest it doesnt take muchbut if you look you will see the brightness love and simplicity around you it is there and once you grasp itwell its painlessi know this isnt a movie reviewthe movie itself speaks volumesheart wrenching powerful courageous selfless imagine if we all could set aside our problems and have concern for others without thought imagine the compassion we could learn from othersif we allowed ourselves to feelas a grown man watching this film i would be honored to have a son who portray this character and even more honored to have a man with so much selfless love and devotion in love with my daughterwowsome may say its just a moviewell i say if its plausible its possiblethis is a must see film so dont listen to those negative reviewsallow yourself to feel and be emotionalafter all we are humanright as anne frank said think of all the beauty still left around you and be happy,sad
by far the saddest movie ive ever seen never cried so much in my life its by far the most beautiful and heartbreaking movie you will ever watch if this movie doesnt move you then theres something wrong with you a love story that will last the ages you will instantly fall in love with hazel grace and augustus waters as they bring you into their world and teach you how to love and cope with loss the performances by both main characters were spot on and the chemistry was indeed touching i cried from the beginning the end and this truly was the saddest ending ive ever seen in a movie it has a brilliant soundtrack to add to it all in all this is a movie that will make you go through all the motions from laughing to crying the best movie i have seen,sad
movie is simple sweet fluent yet a remarkable one you can afford missing this onethe movie starts in a typical fashioned love story no points for that but as the movie continues the plot actually makes you feel its weight a lot of appreciable work is done on that part though i didnt understand the genie part where and how did that come from but it was nice watching thatlove stories are meant to be exclusive and this movie clearly explains you that nice job everyone thereokay ,sad
there are always some small things that ruin my opinion of a film which could have been perfect and would get a ten from me this movie is really great  has a great story the acting is very well done and believable something i always search for in a movie even if it is a scifi the scenes of amsterdam are beautiful but although in a film he has one leg it was kinda obvious in most of the scenes that his legs are just fine  also the scene in a car after the funeral is a bit unrealistic to me and the way she treats the writer  of all places in amsterdam  anna frank house and kiss with an applause  a bit cheesy  but all in all has some really great lines which do stick in your thoughtscertainly do watch it,sad
i hadnt watched this movie up until recently i like movies that i can relate to i am lucky enough to not know anyone with cancer or any kind of fatal illness knock on wood so i figured i would not be able to relate to this movie it will not pull on any of my heart strings it will not hit close to home never have i ever been so wrong about a moviethis is not just about illness and making it through it this is about love and losing and how to get through those that is certainly something i can relate to as im sure most can this movie hits every emotion that a person has you laugh out loud and then you cry and your angry i thought there would never be a movie i love more than the notebook and again i was wrong this movie blows all other sad romance ones away this is by far the saddest movie i have ever seen in the absolute best wayi used to be a die hard secret life fan and though i love the show i didnt think the acting was all that great in this movie however shailene woodley ansel elgort nat wolff and all the way down to the extras the acting was phenomenal the chemistry felt so real and all the emotions the actors had they played it so well you felt that emotion with them if you dont have time to watch this move make time it is absolutely a fantastic film a to everyone involved in making it  thank you,sad
the movie was originally based of the novel by john green this comedic drama is an excellent and accurate portrayal of the novel production elements that are included enhance the overall movie and add depth to the plot and characters the protagonist hazel grace played by shailene woodley takes part in many voiceover scenes she reflects on the events going on in her life therefore cueing in the viewer to the emotional side of her brain this voiceover technique is beneficial because it gives her character an introspective trait in a dramatic movie introspective characters are essential to allowing the audience to feel the ways the characters do as a narrator would do for the reader of a novelthe actors chosen for this movie did an exceptional job of capturing the emotion felt in each scene some scenes between hazel and gus played by ansel elgort were playful and filled with the youth and innocence a teenager carries while others were saddening and haunted by the gloom of nearing death both of these strong yet opposite emotions were carried out in many of the scenes the movie provides a good clear message to people who are going through a tough time like the main characters the characters both find something to look forward to in their lives that seemed to be flooded by negativity this idea is significant to the movie and also significant to people experiencing similar feelingsfundamentally this movie captures two teenagers trying to live a positive life after being effected by cancer the on screen chemistry between gus and hazel is impeccable and the loss of gus brings instant tears to your eyes this young love is a great one and the characters chosen for the roles portrayed the characters in the book accurately their chemistry together proved to get them through the worst of situations and undeniably sad ending never ended their love for one anotherspeaking of good acting hazel grace truly captures the anger of a teenager who has loss respect for a role model when she meets peter van houten played by willem dafoe she finds out he is a drunk he is openly rude to them and blatantly offensive towards their sicknesses the scene is very powerful with lots of emotion and frustration hazel perfectly reflected the part of a flustered teenager trying to express anger while gus tried to bring her back to earth and turn the situation into a position one later the movie reveals peter van houtens anger stems from him losing his daughter to cancer when she was a young age still his actions were unacceptable and hazels anger was justifiable the emotional aspect of the movie added new depth to plot lineon a separate note the soundtrack was fitting for the movie and some of the songs took off and hit the top charts the music for movies is important because it sets the mood for the upcoming scenes in this case each of the songs expressed either positive or negative emotion at the peaks of the movie for example their trip to amsterdam the song is very upbeat and provokes positive energy which reflects what the characters are all feeling the use of music enhanced the movie greatlyout of all the elements that were used in this movie to make it a great and memorable one there is one aspect they didnt really touch on both hazel and gus had cancer and were going through treatments the movie failed to go indepth about the medical side of this story and touch upon what was entailed by each of their cancers to make this movie more relatable and downto earth the producers could have added facts and information about thyroid cancer which hazel had and the cancer that gus had there were several other characters involved for example gus friend or the other kids in the support group who also had cancer that could have been further explainedoverall rating 9210,sad
was released one june 6 2014 and is based on john greens bestselling novel that was published in january 2012 shailene woodley plays hazel grace lancaster and is paired on screen with ansel elgort who plays augustus gus waters to form a couple of star crossed lovers the choice in actors to play the roles in this movie is what brings the love story alive woodley portrays hazel with what seems like an effortless grace hazel is a teenager who is facing death therefore she is reserved and does not possess an over the top attitude woodley depicts this to her viewers with ease she appears on screen with minimal makeup closecut hair and a low key wardrobe woodley stays away from overly dramatic tactics and rarely oversells her characters goodness and witand manages to convincingly convey terminal illness without invoking easy pathos barker being able to not overly sell the cancer side of the story is vital to the success of her role it would have been easy for woodley to rely solely on the sympathy from the viewer for the cancer but she strives to make the viewer feel for hazel as a person and the relationships that she has not for the battle she faces woodley never gives the impression that she is striving for the audiences approval just as hazel never strives for anyones approval which causes the audience to feel for her character even more though elgort and woodley form a seamless bond on screen he does not quit match woodleys naturalism with her character at first glance elgorts  cocky smirking selfconfidence barker never quite meshes with gus but elgort is charming enough to cause the viewer to look past this gus is described in the new york times as a perfect romantic hero scott gus is a boy who wears his heart on his sleeve and keeps an upbeat attitude despite his situation elgort constantly has a goofy smile is full of chivalry and has a mischievous modesty about himself all of these characteristics are what make the viewer fall for him fall far him even before hazel does elgort shows guss quirkiness to his viewers and that makes him adorable in their eyes this bond between elgort and the viewer is what sells gus on screen elgort uses his own light hearted attitude and sense of humor to bring these attributes of his character to life on the screen the two actors not only star in this movie together but are costars in the movie divergent the two became very comfortable with each other on the set of divergent elgort reported that hazel and gus are best friends and thats their relationshipits a really really close friendship and me and shailene have that and to have that to build on is so helpful kirby the two having already become so close on an emotional level is evident on the big screen this relationship is what allows the two to bring the relationship between hazel and gus alive director josh boone states that he trusts his actors to carry their own dramatic weight barker woodley and elgort did just that being emotionally attached to the other person off camera allows their emotions that are presented on screen to be raw and moving though the story of hazel and gus is a heartbreaking love story it is one that is simply irresistible is rumored to be seen as this generations love story it compared to the film love story which also tells the tale of a tragic romance that is tainted with cancer hazel appears to become more beautiful as death ostensibly approaches slotek just as the main character did in love story her beauty growing as tragedy approaches is due to her interaction with the other characters woodley portrays hazel with elegance even when she is watching the love of her life wither away whether it be away in a gas station parking lot or when she speaks from her heart at his prefuneral it is because elgort allows guss love and goofiness to come through that it seems okay for him to pass away haze tries stay strong and hold back her hurt but it is still evident which is contribution to her growing beauty she is strong on the outside for the one she loves but is dying on the inside literally and figuratively her pain is beauty we see the emotion erupt from hazel when in amsterdam and many other scenes throughout the movie these scenes are full of raw emotion but woodley presents them so well we are not distracted by poor acting but allowed to see the naturalism flow and depict the true beauty of hazel though they are doomed from the beginning they still manage to find their always the actors allow their viewers to see the two teenagers fully embrace the meaning of living instead of just being alive as they fight to pursue their dreams and wishes despite their circumstances choosing these two actors are a key part of the movies success,sad
first of all i would like to say i was completely torn by this movie from the perspective of this young boy who is desperate but so singular and unique and this beautiful young girl also somewhat desperate who thinks her insecurities and cancer make up the reason she had no friends the movie completely did its job overall and split me in two when one was pulled away from the other in agony i wouldve and didnt expect anything less than what i got a beautiful meaningful very believable movie with one of my favorite actresses and actors if you are sitting at home reading this there is no reason you shouldnt watch this movie it changed my outlook on love stories foreveramazing book and movie and i think the actresses and actors used to portray the character couldnt have been better picked absolutely stunning lines to rip your heart out and an amazing storythis movie was amazing and awful and happy and terrible in the perfect ways 9 12 out of 10 great job and i can honestly say i have never seen anything like it,sad
okay so before i saw this movie i read the book and i loved it  the movie was a bit different and some characters werent in the movie but it was good no i mean it was great its one of the best movies ive even watched it made laugh and cry it just simply made me happy and its really amazing ive given almost half the movies ive watched 1010 but this is the one that truly deserves it and if i could give this movie a 100 i would i got so obsessed over it if you want to watch a romantic movie thatll just make you smile and cry i really suggest this its not like all the cancer love stories or whatever its just kind of different people might say that im over rating it but i sure am not everybody has a different taste in movies but if you like romance youll love this movie i hope,sad
i watched this movie today i already knew the story from the book written by john green that i have already read before as i expected the movie would be it was worth my expectations though some facts are skipped in the movie the movie is incredibly awesome and the part played by the shailene woodley as the hazel grace is perfect including her voice it reminds me the quotes in the book indeed john greens writing is adorable that contain much of interesting and funny quotes i was much eager to watch it and now i am curious to read its story again and to remember its quotes as i finished watching it i jumped into imdb to write a review about it i recommend this movie,sad
the fault in our starsthis is the must see movie of 2014im sure you have heard about this movies pure genius in the looks of love and im also very sure that you have at least thought about watching this movie and here are some resons why obviously im talking about those who havent watched this movie because if you have you might not need to read reviews about it because i expect you have a very crisp idea of this movie so to those who havent watched the movie here is my reviewat first i thought to myself like i would when im watching romantic movies  oh this is going to be one of those girl meets perfect boy moviesbut truth be told its very different from the way the couple use humour and a slice of wit here and there really lays a good foundation for the movie unlike any clich romantic movies ive watched in a long time its a story of self imperfections and how love is able to bring even the greatest imperfections together in one passionate tale of two lovers the movie is one of kind being that it is one of the first romantic movies to ever make me cry and im sure it will make you cry as well last of all the main reason why i would highly recommend this movie is the simplicity and the way the whole storyline and events are not forced but are neatly layered in order to make a well written movie that does not disappoint is definitely one movie that is worth watching and along the way you will learn a lot of things about love,sad
i can say that this movie is beautiful i read the book and it took me a few hours i just couldnt stop because of the story maybe someone will say that the plot is too predictable but i will answer them that most of the movies are and who said that it is bad if you can predict the end it means that you were listening and watching every detail actors were playing amazing i believed every moment every step actually i am that kind of person who doesnt cry especially when someone is next to me but this time i couldnt hold myself anymore for a moment my eyes turned into a waterfall the way hazel and augustus found a way and a reason to be happy no matter how bad their situation was i really dont understand why some people dont like it tastws differ but i think that even if someone is saying this is a crap in their heart they were crying i give this movie 9 from 10,sad
this is better than a walk to remember not that they should even be compared i was opposed to the concept of the novel and waited until long after my friends raved about it to read it then i did i absorbed it in one night i say absorbed because this story is not one that empties you takes your tears and leaves you devoid of emotion this story fills empty places that you didnt know you had it reaffirms that life is precious and shot love is pure timeless knows no boundaries all of the complications we make our lives have are not necessary we should all look at the world like augustus waters size what we want and love it with everything we have,sad
the fault in out starts what a movie the way the characters portrayed their roles made me feel like i am in their places facing the same dilemma they arespoiler ahdead one thing that made me in love with this movie is how hazel knew that one day she would eventually dieprobably young but still she embraced here destiny and was living her life almost normally it was also one of the very few movies that made my tears go down one of the most sad moment is when they were sitting on the bench and gus told hazel about his new cancer and she just said so unfair understanding the title itself will make you sad it explains that what happened to these young lovers was not of there own doing but was that of their fate and destiny hazel wanted to limit the casualties but avoiding being loved by people and thus making them escape the suffering of getting they hearts broken when she dies but this suffering and pain were getting closer an bigger to hazel herself upon hearing gus new diagnoses the eulogy that hazel wrote for gus was sentimentally devastating for me one of the saddest scenes in both the movie and the book hazel was expecting yet very scared of the moment when she hears the news about guss death but these expectations were not enough to hold here tears though as she saw her parents coming up to her roam in the night she fell to tears the way hazel parents dealt with here condition was also fascinating they werent always crying and sadat least not in front of hazel the character of gus symbolizes a hell lot of things living life as if it is the last day embracing your destiny no matter what it is living the now and not caring about later gus changed the life of hazel forever in his life and death he showed hazel that she is not alone in her fight that he will always be there for here he taught here the meaning of love andunfortunately the meaning of losing someone you love through the character of isaac the author showed how people change from around sick people the act as if they want you but finally cannot take it anymore which is funny because your the one suffering here the fault in our starts a book about too young lovers who met at a cancer support group and fell in love their destiny however held much pain coming for the two lovers in the journey through their limited days of life that they had left i hope people would know that real people not just in novels face these problems and sad luck parents loosing their children a husband loosing his wife be thankful for what you are and who you are be thankful that there is no fault in your starts be thankful for your health and live every day of your life as if it is the last because some where someone unfortunate is wishing that he had a bigger infinity like yours than what infinity he has,sad
i am completely out the demographic of this movie but i ended up watching thisthis is obviously a tearjerker meant for primarily teenage girls so adjust accordinglybut i will say this movie has a really good heart and solid message its refreshing to see a female teen character who attracts a guy through her smarts and wits its also refreshing seeing a male character who isnt all horned up and actually believes in courtship and respect a special shout out to shailenewoodley who has an amazing and convincing performance if you are parent of teenagers i this would be a mostly positive movie for kids to watch there is just oldfashion courting that you never see in teen sex comedies it almost has a religious feel and overtones but avoids that path this will certainly be a classic movie in a young adult genre,sad
wants to make you cry and it succeeds with a vengeance itll boost kleenex sales for sure near guaranteed to have everyone in the theatre sobbing tfios is a devastating tear jerker of a movie grown men youll cry as well a love story between 2 cancer patients played by shailene woodley and ansel elgort this is based on a popular book which i havent read but would now like to i usually avoid this kind of thing since many romantic films endless love im looking at you are nothing more than 2 dimensional formula sheets which arent even remotely touching but tfios is a relatively rare exception its not a perfect movie and is admittedly supported by a somewhat clichd framework ansel elgorts character is a bit unrealistic and very occasionally they seem to be sugarcoating the story also the first kiss happening in the anne frank museum seemed questionable the film believes its subverting romantic clichs even though in many ways it isnt and this is slightly off puttingmostly however this is not your typical weepie the film is surprisingly humorous and although the key emotional moments hit hard there is a sense of hope and lightness to the story as well the screenplay has clearly been written with skill and the lovers at the centre of the story both played excellently have very strong chemistry throughout the visuals and direction further enhance the film and although it does go into a truly heartbreaking third act the journey there is one of hope and celebration managing to find a balance of happier and sadder elements this is likely the best love story of 2014 and its target audience will love it its not as smart as it thinks it is but the effectiveness of its emotions and screenplay are unexpected and borderline gut wrenching deservedly a very successful film this is a love story which can appeal to those who arent a fan of this kind of thing just bring the tissues810,sad
in case youre wondering i just happened to come across this film because i think willem dafoe is an excellent actor and i was just checking out his worki guess people like fairy tales how else could this movie possibly get these rave reviews if you want to see sad watch grave of the fireflies or requiem for a dream but despite how the movie is portrayed by other viewers i believe this film is supposed to portray hope and not whats real that is the only problem i have with this movie it is sooooo clich just about everything that happens is like perfect the perfect guy the beautiful dying girl yeah its a princess story rewritten as a cancer story thats my only problem with this movie i guess if youre a 12 yearold teenage girl looking for a snow white kind of tale then this is for you i was looking for something a little more deep and this did not deliver if youre not a 12yearold girl you should probably stay away unless of course you havent seen beauty and the beast yet in which case go ahead and knock yourself out its an extremely shallow movie just saying,sad
is a romance and drama movie based on the novel of john green this movie was release on june 6 2014 and has been directed by josh boone stuck in love 2013 the principal actors in are shailene woodley divergent who played hazel grace lancaster and ansel elgort divergent carrie who played augustus gus waters the acting of this two was amazing the chemistry between shailene and ansel was unbelievable they transmitted us so many emotion in a short time and they represented the character of the book very well the transmission of their chemistry in their character make the story looks very real serious and sincere i read the book before watching the movie and the story is almost the same all the important elements and details of the book are there and also more for all the readers we could not ask better even if the characters are sick we can associate themselves to this characters and it makes the movie very sensitive and moving i think that the best quotes of the movie and the most moving is you gave me a forever within the numbered dayshazel grace lancaster its one of the best movies that i ever seen and i encouraging people to see it because its make people think about real life and all which surrounds it,sad
well i didnt read novel before watching this movie like many of the others had done so a film was recommended to me by a friend with a note a love story you want to never misswell i am not a big fan of love movies and rarely i saw love movies which has good ratings and heard from too many people about itfirst of all the story was sublime then it looks like that the characters chosen were really themselves in the movie not performing or acting then in the start it feels little boring but once you start catching hold of the story than its like you are feeling what they are feelingthe great thing which i liked about the movie is that the director had kept it simple and had not included too many glamorous details as the current trend isthis movie gives the great insight of the lives of teenagers suffering from any kind of such dangerous disease there parents insight and their feelingsoverall i would like to say that i am impressed by the movie and not like other love stories,sad
a beautiful movie if ever ive seen one honestly one of the best ive watched since watching perks of being a wallflower the characters are convincing the chemistry between them is palpable and even though you only know the characters for 2 hours the ending is enough to make even the hardiest of men with a smidgen of a good heart cry the story unfolds without flaw and takes you through a journey of love and loss making you understand the harsh realities of life while also showing to you the beauty that can be found in even the smallest of infinities all in all an excellent movie and a worthwhile watch for anyone seeking to find a diamond among the movies of 2014 and to any person who has the gall to give this movie a 1 i say you must have absolutely no good taste and do not have mental capacity to grasp the deeper and more beautiful things in life though i have not read the book i am definitely going to i am certain that the director and the actors did a brilliant job at bringing the book to life for us hats off to all of you ,sad
i didnt read the book but i did watch the first movie trailer and knew i needed to see this movie for me  it was excellent beyond belief i have been graced by many loved ones and friends whom havehad cancer some of whom have passed shailene woodleys performance in this movie was spectacular akin to tom hanks performance in forrest gump ansel elgorts performance is equally spectacular nat wolffs performance was great too shailenes performance was what draws people into the movie she becomes and ultimately is hazel grace with a few true stars you can see it in their expressions and mostly see it in their eyes rowan blanchards performances as riley in girl meets world is similar shailene is a star that has not reached her full potential with her performance here i really would love to see another book andor film that continues this epic story,sad
a modern masterpiece you have a choice in this world i believe about how to tell sad stories on the one hand you can sugar coat  the way they do in movies and romance novelswhere villains are vanquished and heroes are born and and nothing is too messed up that cant be fixed with an apology and a peter gabriel song but its not the truthwell this is the starting dialogue from the movie and it says all about it frankly speaking ive watched this movie a dozen times and every time it caused certain feeling in me every other actor in this movie outperformed themselves to create a certain type of magic on screen which i might add we see so rarelyin terms of execution ive no complaints as it is beautifully written well directed and contains some awesome songs it is a mix of everything the movie makes you sad and smile at the same time there are also some beautiful dialogues in itit rarely happens that you see a movie and have this urge to share it with the world or everyone you meet its another such great act you just cant afford to miss itive saved my ten for this movie,sad
the movie was okay no reality in emotions the acting was below par as well and the main issue was that the storyline sucked big time there was no real conviction that where this movie is going or what does the director aims to portray a good romantic movie with love as center would be the eternal sunshine of spotless mind there is marked difference between the two movies and the latter clearly outshines it big time the actors did try to do justice to the scripts given to them but its way off from the actual story being told in the book those who read the book dont watch the movie please as youll be really disappointed so save your time folks,sad
few movies have had the ability to move me along the emotional line as flawlessly as this one has the love story of gus  hazel was young but wizened poignant and funny and classically modern the director did an excellent job with each scene each contrast that made me want to watch it just a little more with each passing minute as gus hoped i hoped as hazel hoped and dreamed and cried so did i in many ways it was an exploration of all our selves insecurities and death literally and figuratively what made it incredibly relatable was the age range of these actors through which the story was portrayed were it an older cast it would not have been as impactful,sad
im not generous to give this movie 1010 cause its totally worth it it has been a while since the notebook that i cried a lot watching a movie beautiful quotes and scene adorable couple and their unfinished epic love story are the highlights of the movie they also teach you how to appreciate life and people around i love all the characters in this moviehazel is sensitive and smart gus is sweet and funny others are all lovely although i kind of hoped it would have a happy ending and was sad when gus died it did not ruin anythingin fact it actually made the movie become more real like it was supposed to be incredible ,sad
being a massive fan of the book and an avid reader i was worried that the film wouldnt do the book justice oh how wrong i was the movie stuck to the book the way any adaption should and the actors were perfect for the parts they were chosen to play one of the few movies adapted from a book that i have thoroughly enjoyed just as much as when i read the book itself as it wasnt butchered when made into a film as many book to film adaptions are this is a story that shows the harsh realities of living with cancer and what life is like for those who have to live with it everyday heartwarming and emotional i doubt there are many people who have watched this movie and left with a dry eye at the end,sad
the film speaks about the unexpected love between two teenagers suffering from cancer they met at a cancer support group its a romantic drama from josh boone with shailene woodley and ansel elgort as main actors they did another film together  divergent its probably one of my favourite films because the story looks so amazing he makes me dream even if the teenagers are sick i enjoyed this film i found it hard to put down because the story is gripping i found it so sad but also beautiful the film is inspired from a book and even the book is gripping ill read it as soon as possible my only criticism is that i found it too short you must see this movie if you like this kind of films youll not be disappointed ,sad
i wanted to really love this movie i heard people rave about it its good not great in my opinion it is a touching love story but overall a bit too contrived i mean we know from practically minute one that someone will die by the end i thought the europe trip was sweet and lovely oh and i loved the soundtrack toothought the songs used were beautiful but i cant get over certain parts of this movie that were just weirdstrangeoverthetop first as others have pointed out the scene in the anne frank house where gus and hazel kiss for the first time and everyone claps oh my gosh really i actually said that out loud to my friend while watching this come on how on earth do total strangers know or care even that thats their first kiss im still shaking my head at that part and the writer they visit because they love his book so much i dont really know what was the point of that subplot it goes nowhere because the writer is rude to them then they all start yelling and gus  hazel leave what they accomplish nothing and speaking of the writerim so tired of the stereotype that artistswritersetc are depressed major loners dependant on alcohol or drugs and are just plain weird im a visual artist and i dont appreciate this crazy stereotype you could tell from practically the instant gus and hazel meet the writer at his home that its not going to go well and how he randomly shows up at the funereal is just weird and creepy i mean he came all the way from europe who would do that of course he tries to be nice to hazel and explain stuff and she just screams at him again nothing is accomplished with this scene whats the point i know he gives her the letter but stillcould have been a better  more believable scene and the last scene i cant get my head around is the part where they show up in broad daylight to throw eggs at the gorgeous green car of the one guys ex seriouslythis part bothers me to no end the woman comes out of the house sees the eggy car and just goes back inside ummmm what about calling the cops or at least threatening to especially after gus tells her this is basically revenge the kids dont seem to get in the slightest trouble at all for doing this to the beautiful green car i have seriously mixed feelings about this movie id give the book a shot though generally i find the books are better than the movies theyre based on,sad
beautiful love story of beautiful hazel and gusthough the actors are so young their acting is really praiseworthy a new and beautiful love storyi liked the movie more than the bookthe emotion and feelings that the movie expresses is just speechlessthe bond between young couple is beautifully depictedgot tears in my eyesit is a must watch movie with beautiful story line  amazing actors  wonderful places though is not a pretentious film but is full of little special moments that creates a very good and convincing environment and make you smile by the chemistry between the young coupleloved it,sad
i cant believe the ratings this film has on herewhile not a terrible film as such the whole point of the this film is over sentimental rubbish and i love sentimentality but the whole point in this film just seems to be to try make you crythe acting apart from shailene woodley hazel is mediocre and especially gus ansel elgort who i thought was terrible shailene woodley i thought was decent enough howeverthe film obviously has some intended messages but its so dumbed down i can only think that the ratings have been boosted by the fans of the book,sad
when i see a movie so grossly over rated it makes me remove some points from my actual score this is to me a 6 but at 82 this movie is way over what it should be but i understand perfectly why so many people were moved by it and it what i want to discuss here attention spoiler when the protagonists go to amsterdam as if it was the place where they would find the answer to the ultimate question in their lives the character played by wilem dafoe tells them basically that they are not special because they have a terminal illness but that they are like all other human being faced with the hand they were dealt by life i suspect the author of the best selling novel to have used this character to expose this truth which is hard to accept but with appropriate music and endearing moments we forget that unpleasant encounter until this character comes back to tell us he lost a loved one to terminal disease as for the actors only shailene woodley does her job the sloppy acting that surrounds her is a little irritating,sad
everything about this flick sounds phony from the dialogs to the reactions of all the people involved for instance what kind of a love approach is this  dont underline all the time that they are talking about this particular book what amazed me was the mother in front of her sick child saying i will never be a mother again what mother would be so selfish in a situation like this  evry mother would first thing first think about her child that quote ruined the moment and the mothers every appearances te father is there but absent both parents spent their time running in the stairs with a would be sad face the worst part is that i never felt emotionally connected to the characters besides at the very end the movie is supposed to be funny at times but with the kind of goody christian jokes good story with a bad scenario it could have been done with less pathos less clichs and less music which is redundant with the emotions,sad
this film reminds me why i love watching movies its that simple maybe im slightly biased because of a really good friend of mine died recently the age of mere 24 in cancer but he was brave admirable and loving until the very end just like gus just like in this movie and the lost of my friend i have learned that never take life and love for granted so please watch this movie because you will love it in a bittersweet way but i promise that it will leave you with a smile on your face when the credits will start to roll all in all this movie will have you in a turmoil of feelings but trust me that its accurate portrayed and it leaves you thinking and then some,sad
i was so prepared to cry myself ugly but thank goodness that didnt happen after watching this film is definitely for die hard fans of the novel and for those who yearns for an unconventional coming of age romantic comedy drama film i have not read the book but watching this film makes me feel that i ought to i would definitely understand fans who would silently mouth the words of their beloved characters whenever gus or hazel speaks out lines from the novel my most favorite scene is also the most saddest part of the film audiences may have expected shailene woodley to deliver one of her best performance yet but ansel elgort the guy who portrays augustus waters brings such warmth and vulnerability to his character that one might be unable to help themselves but wish to have a friend just like gus so for those who love romantic dramedy with a twist this is definitely the movie for you,sad
this was by far one of my most favorite movies i havent heard anyone say that they didnt like it yet the story line is amazing and so are the actors its a movie i cant forget not to mention i did shed a few tears here and there but thats how great it was there was so much chemistry in the movie it was so romantic i even learned a few things in the movie but i expressed many emotions while watching this movie i recommended it to some of my friends and they really want to see it now and i wouldnt mind going back with them to watch it too i want to thank john green for not only making a great book but also a great movieits a great movie to see with friends family or if youre in a relationship and want to see a movie together,sad
what couldve been a maudlin mushy exercise in wishywashyweepy fare turns out to be thoroughly entertaining engrossing and emotionally fulfilling aided in no small measure by the tight screenplay and the source work the key lead performances and their collective as well as individual predicaments hold mainstay throughout without even treading into sentimental territory sure there are tears shed but nothing that wouldnt be happening in scenarios such as this one out in the real world shailene woodley after her spectacularly divergent turns in the recent past owns this along with her nondivergent brother who plays the lead here opposite her  ansel elgort cocky to the point of being annoyingly arrogant he dials that stuff down just enough for us to care for the fate of the protagonistseven though a couple of themes explored here seem farfetched the characterization never allows us to wallow in despair and the various instances during which emotionally distressing events are handled with flair and humor make everyone tide over the difficulty of handling neardeath situations while interactingliving with palliative careworthy patientsthe score keeps things lively and along with 500 days of summer will make a good addition for collectors laura dern and sam merlott provide adequate support with the limited material theyre handed but willem dafoe still proves that he will always be a scenestealer no matter the grotesquerie he inhabits in front of the camera chewing up everything else with each word he utters i generally look for originality whenever i try to watch a movie but watching this one though every beat is predictable and bythenumbers it made me appreciate what a wellwritten screenplay could bring to the table and make something worth enjoying appreciating the finer nuances of each aspect of filmmaking sure its not as good as it gets in more ways than one but for now it will do,sad
ive been really excited to see this movie especially since i read the book before hand and absolutely loved it however i saw the movie this morning and it surprised me a bit while it was a good movie and i loved augustus waters portrayal by ansel elgort i felt it was just missing something maybe for me it wasnt as good as i expected it because i loved how the book focused on both the love story between hazel and augustus and the time when augustus was dying and died i honestly feel that hollywood wanted to portray the love story as the main focus which is is even in the book but washed over the cancer part a bit more than they expected to another thing that concerned me was that i didnt cry now i am a very emotional person but i guess that me not crying was a combination of me already knowing what was in store and the fact that the funeral scene wasnt very convincing to me when i read the book i literally cried myself to sleep when reading about augustus death and his funeral i felt that in the movie he tells hazel that hes dying and then bam fifteen minutes later hes dead and the movies over im not saying that this was a bad movie because i really did enjoy it i just felt that there were somethings missing from the book that made it so alive and wonderful to read also what happened to augustus previous girlfriend just curious,sad
let me start out by clarifying something this was a great movie it was excellently directed the plot elements were not predictable unless you read the book the cast was perfectly picked and is everything one would expect from this movie though i hear spoiler that one character was omitted i wouldnt have known as i never read the book now that being said it was also exactly as i expected it to be and not in a good way thus this movie really deserves two reviews one for people who enjoy sad movies and one for those who do not if you like movies that make you cry andor feel particularly distraught and almost depressed then youll love this movie my girlfriend is one of those people and despite being in tears for 23 of the movie she loved the movie if youre like me and strongly dislike tearjerker style movies you will not find this movie enjoyable it is that simple i went into this movie expecting it to put me in a bad mood for days and the movie lived up to those expectations perfectly it has perfectlytimed emotional attacks with the dry humor failing to lighten the tone to more than an infinitesimal degree i was actually relieved when it ended not because of the quality of the movie but because i really could not bear to watch something so sad i have no plans of watching this movie again so you can see that the sentiments about this movie are somewhat polarized therefore i divide up the rating into two fivestar categories 55 for those who like sad stories and 05 for those who do not because sadness is really the primary element of this movie,sad
greetings again from the darkness having not read john greens book and missing his targeted demographics by gender and a few decades the narrators very early criticism of my favorite teen movie say anything  had me quickly questioning whether i was going to make it through this one the greatness of shailene woodley soon won me over and i was all inthe story revolves around a teenage girl named hazelwoodley who was diagnosed with cancer a few years ago and has remained alive and active thanks to an experimental drug she is an exceptionally perceptive girl and carries the burden of worrying about how or if her parents laura dern sam trammell will carry on after her death she attends a teenage support group to keep her parents happy and bumps into a friendship with a spirited young man named gus ansel elgort  a selflabeled onelegged 18 year old virgin cancer survivoryou guessed it  this is a tearjerker but its even more of a love story specifically its a story about the joy in finding someone to love while the cancer is everpresent its the love story that captures our interest when the story veers from that it suffers the trip to amsterdam and the segment with willem dafoe seems out of place until its eclipsed by the final scene at the anne frank house i understand the point but it struck me as forced emotions  in a movie that was not lacking emotionregardless of all of that the reason to see this is the genius of shailene woodley neither she nor elgort are teenagers but they perfectly capture the adorable balance between awkward and witty woodleys range is staggering the descendants the spectacular now divergent and she and jennifer lawrence should be blessing us with their talent for many many years to comethe screenplay was cowritten by scott neustadler and michael h weber who also cowrote both 500 days of summer and the spectacular now their feel for dialogue and budding relationships is spot on delivering a level of respect to both sexes this film is very sweet and filled with grace and tainted only by the saccharine musical choices and the amsterdam sequence,sad
if you go and see this movie be emotionally and mentally prepared this movie is perfect from the acting the storyline the cast the soundtrack and more no movie has ever made me cry more i am a sucker for romance movies and this one outdid them all this is one of the best love stories of the decade its not about cancer never once in the movie have the actors asked you to pity them because they have cancer it is a beautiful tragedy a movie worth seeing im sure that no matter how many times you see this movie more than a single tear will slip your eyes shaileene woodley and ansel elgort have this chemistry that you envy i cannot fathom how beautiful this movie is if you buy the soundtrack after watching the movie even the soundtrack will make you cry bring a box of tissues when you go and watch this movie read the book take a bunch of friends to hold you whilst you cry this movie is truly beautiful,sad
this film tells the story of a young woman who has cancer she attends as support group and meets the guy of her dreams they develop a relationship yet the cruel reality hits and takes their dreams awaythe story is very predictable contrived and unconvincing are we really expected to believe that they fall for each other so intensely that easily and the subplot about the dutch author is simply ridiculous im very unconvinced that someone would track down an author fly half way across the world to ask a question the phlegmatic response from the author is disgusting yet oddly satisfying i honestly thought the film was boring and annoying it is exploitative of the viewers sympathy towards sick children to sell a really bad film film which makes it even worse,sad
i would have given this film one star except shailene woodley is an excellent actress i was first very impressed with her performance in the descendants but then i was simply blown away by her performance in spectacular now which was a fantastic film so when i saw this movie got over 8 stars i had high hopes those hopes were quickly dashed this film is one long clich every scene you feel like youve seen 100 times before and except for woodley who they must have paid boat loads of money the cast was not good woodleys parents were so miscast i felt like they must have walked out into the hallway and grabbed the first male and female actor to walk by contrast this to the relationship between miles teller son and jennifer jason leigh mom in spectacular now which was an amazing look at a motherson relationship woodleys parents were more like placeholders to deliver the proper clich at the proper moment and the fact that woodleys character seemed to be near death in every other scene just telegraphed the fact that it was the boy who would be the one to die i knew nothing of this story but that was so obvious to me almost from the first scene and omg the slow clap after their first kiss that was so cheesy i cannot find the right words to describe it i will continue to be a fan of shailene woodley but in the long term this film will be one she would like to forget,sad
whoa what can i say about it i really loved the book i almost cried at the end of the book but i control my emotions but when i saw the movie i cant control to cry and the tears ran from my eyesperformance as hazel by shailene woodley was beyond imagination the emotions created by her was superb ansel elgort as gus was really cool in his role josh booe done a superb job by adapting a this novel and make a moviejosh boone had really taken a most exciting challenge by adapting this novel as it has lots of emotions love fun and most lastly song at the end of credit all of the stars by ed sheeran was superball and all its perfect movie and the best romantic movie of mine at the end of time really watch itat last my ratings is ten 10 and no doubt about it,sad
i was drunk when saw it first time but it didnt faze me much sure it was sad sad story right but after just few drinks when my rational mind stopped suppressing years of training not to cry when my most vulnerable side of me was exposed as in my emotions i just rewatched it it must be the sweetestsaddest story ive ever heard of and i hate it for thatand heres a little tidbit of info if you girls who still dont get it and call us callus we were forced by society to be this way our rational minds tells us boys dont cry since we were babies do you think we have no emotions go one day to a bar to see a man crying when emotions take over and overpower rational mind after a fewbut that was ot this movieit got me sobbing like a little girli felt tears pouring of my cheeks romeo and juliet is a sleeping pill compared to that i hate this movie for that last time i watched a drama fck that considering im especially really empathetic in real life i cant watch this kind of movies i can put myself in their shoes and i feel all that pain its too fcking painful i hope ill forget this fcking movie soon i have to give it an 8 i cant go any higher because i know when i will sober up id give it a 6  oh fck you ill give it a a a 9 for the pain it cosed me i cant give it 10 because those are reserved for my all time favoritesil copy and paste it on the board to discuss this if anyone intrestestestd,sad
i read this book and refused and still do to get rid of it the book made me cry and laugh the movies did the same thing one thing i love the most about this movie is that it stayed so true to the book even knowing what was gonna happen didnt stop the tears from forming in my eyes or rolling down my face this movie was beautifully portrayed august waters why are you so perfect 3 john green did a phenomenal job at tricking people to get attached to august waters rather than instead of hazel even in the book you expect hazel to die not gus this movie also strays away from conventional movies that end on happy notes or on a sense that everything is ok you get a sense of incompleteness and pain i cant imagine what someone going through cancer must actually feel however this film made me realize how much more they lose i love this movie,sad
hollywood capitalizes on a young adult bestseller and doles out the usual drivel in the hopes of a blockbusternot to say that is drivel per se but it lacks the magic and emotion that is captured in john greens acclaimed young adult novel i read the book awhile back and while i had minor issues with the plot it resonated with me because of this tragic but tender love storytime to tears book  last 90 pages dont judge me movie fleetingly at 1hour 53 minutes im not a monster the movie followed the book to the letter but is vastly ineffectual the screenplay is lazy and a bad adaptation writers scott neustadter and michael h weber did not take the time to translate greens writing for the screenthe directing by josh boone was unimaginative and literal reverting to lame voiceovers and text bubbles instead of good structure from the screenplay for workable content and actingboth writers and director seem inexperienced beginners earning their stripes with this filmthe acting was not great and the main characters were miscast i can see why shailene woodley and ansel elgort were cast as hazel and gus respectively they were able to pull of the emotional scenes near the end lacking was the charm for the entirety of the rest of the film woodley is basically a happily bewildered toothy smile while elgort is overconfident and decidedly not charismatici did think willem dafoes casting was spot on and found nat wolff to be underutilized as guss best friendthis film was a higher budgeted version of some hybrid disneyhallmark made for tvmovie trying to be more frankly i am a bit offended at how juvenile the final product seems as the film version was not smart and belittling to readers of yes it is an adaptation of young adult book about teens finding love while being deemed cancer patients but it didnt need to be this horrible cheesefestmore film reviews at our website,sad
pure excellence astonishing hart wrenching i could go on listing superlatives about this movie but it wouldnt do it justicei am a grown ass man and i pride my self on being a tough guy but this movie just tore at my heart and made me appreciate life just that much more if your a lad like me and got a image to uphold then dont watch this with someone else especially not with the lads but for gods sake do watch itits a great work of art and something you shouldnt miss out on just want to thank everyone who worked on this movie and made it possible the story itself is about life and the things that make it worth living i found my self lost in time as i watched it and i was completely caught up in it i kept wishing it to go on it was beautifully shot and well writtenthe cast was amazing especially the two main characters they made it a pure delight to watch and i have nothing negative to say about the performance i expect to see more from these two in the future i just hope the movies they do can reach the mark set by this onethank you,sad
these days with so much emphasis being put into movies with hightech special effects and things going boom its refreshing to have a chance to watch a gem of a film such as this one now i am not one of those audience members that are into romance movies much maybe during my younger days especially teen romance movies but i am so glad i got a chance to watch this teen romance movie lot of teen romance movies or dramas these days seems to go into that really sappy pretentious delusion direction and just misses its mark and seems to target the audience members that likes to eat a bucket of ice cream while watching some superficial cardboard cutouts input on what love is in order to feel that sense of sweetness in their lives which is understandable however this movie is like a romantic poetry on screen this is a bold statement but i would even go as far as calling it modern day shakespearian story work mainly because the story is so well written and it delves into the mindset and the core if the matter when it comes to emotions and heart so when it comes to the story its about 2 people dealing with cancer and the relationship between one another you can let reality crush you and live in denial while trying to forget by means possible or you can stand and fight through and seek and these are two characters dealing with cancers it also wasnt forced to get emotions our of the audiences or did it seem selfindulgent like some art house movies sometimes when it comes to movies like this even the serious scenes sometimes comes off funny because of how cheesy it is however that wasnt the case for this film when it came to the funny parts the audiences in the theater was laughing during the cute scenes they were all chuckling and during the sad or serious scenes it was dead silent that my friends is movie magic as a matter of fact i almost criedthat is a lie i actually did cried then looked around to see i wasnt the only one in order to not go in that guilt trip thankfully i wasnt the only one but even if i was the only one its okay augustus waters is now one of my favorite leading male character in this genre he is just so charming humorous witty knows how to use sarcasm in a nondemeaning way and above all the guy has integrity the couple in this film was so likable cute and the chemistry was so uplifting that i wanted to get out of my seat and root for them overall this is a movie that really tugs on the heartstrings and is not just another teen romance movies that hollywood seems to be chugging out these days if anyone including teens and even elders are looking for something to do during date night check this film out it will make you fall in love with movies all over again as a matter of fact this is probably my favorite film of 2014 oh and the soundtrack is fantastic1010,sad
it was sad but not for the reasons id thought it would be yes the main girl character  hazel grace lancaster or something like that is sick and dying and yes she and the boy augustus watersgus fall in love but the love isnt instantaneous love it is a slow growing love formed around a friendship as described in the movie i fell in love the way you fall asleep slowly and then all at once it was beautiful to watch develop and i think the cinematography really displayed it so well i felt the excitement nerves and flirtationthe thing that i found saddened me was not the fact that hazel grace was sick it was more her obsession around what happens when she dies is everyone going to be okay it made me think about the comfort we provide to the dying verses what they need from us it isnt necessarily to provide comfort that they will be ok or we are here for them in their time of need but that we will be okay without them another line that stuck with me was after the funeral and hazel had chosen not to read the words she had written she said a funeral is not for the dead its for those that have been left behindanother thing i found saddening and thought provoking was a conversation late in the film between hazel and gus about his fear of oblivion or being forgotten  he wants to be great remembered as a hero and have stories written about him and she replies that isnt her love and admiration enough i found it thought provoking in respect to my own craving for stardom and admiration it made me question myself and my own relationships with people isnt it better to be deeply loved by one person than adored or known by many isnt one persons total love and admiration enough what more do you want in lifei found this film was layered with so many thought provoking moments and i was still quiet emotional an hour after id seen it the emotion i was expecting after all thats why i went to see it it just wasnt the way i expected to feel i really enjoyed the film ,sad
im a big fan of reading books and one day my history teacher told my class that we should read some of john greens booksbeing who i am i read and i instantly fell in love with itwhen i found out that they were gonna start filming i was so excited and cut my hair like shailene woodley and donated it to cancerthe first day the movie came out i saw it and thought it was spectacular but i liked the book better because it included more details and when you read the book you feel the pain and hurt hazel felt from the cancer when she goes to the hospital and when augustus diesyou also feel every emotion she feels from the beginning of the book to the endim very glad john green decided to write an incredible book like this and i cant wait for his other novel to be in movie theaterswhich nat wolff comes out in,sad
hello folks had heard lot of things about this movie i was not expecting anything from the movie as my expectation was low so many times i have seen such flicks like a walk to rememberkeith i am frankly saying this movie surprised me i must admit this movie took my hear away people who is claiming that movie is cheesy or not good i think they havent watched this movie or watched it without heart these kinda movie should not deserve negative comments from peopleacting from both of actors tremendous screenplay writing emotions shows by the actors so natural loved this movie and even i will buy a dvd for thisthanks for giving your time,sad
a few friends had recommended the book to me but since 1 i already had a long toread list 2 i have had heard that a movie is coming soon so i decided to watch the movie instead okay so the date of its worldwide release came and went without any mention when its going to release in my country so after a month or so later i had already almost forgotten about the movie but just by chance i had a glance on the name in movie show timings in todays newspaper so just decided to watch it right away okay to the movie 1 story okay so there wasnt anything new to that i mean there are already a walk to remember restless and keith so there really wasnt anything i would say that could have blown peoples mind 2 acting good job everyone i have seen the descendant and shailenes acting was really good in that movie and here i wouldnt feel shy in saying she has done a better job brilliant and especially though i dont want to say it she really looked sick the guy playing augustus was also good but initially i was reluctant to accept his character but with time it got better or its his good acting that put me on ease other characters well what i can say about the veterans except for their appraisal and william dafoe as always never fails to make audience hate him i particularly liked his character and his word 3 direction it was good the movie was full of little things that really made the whole thing compelling and be felt screenplay at couple of times there was a little awkwardness but overall good or maybe its the acting that took care of everything 4 and music too was nice but they could have included more appropriate soundtracks at a couple of places  and if i decide to go into the details and dig out the dialogues and all then apparently i will be praising the book so ill just stop here by saying that although the story really hadnt anything new to it yet the movie was good and perfectly watchable and probably for some it could be a great experience ps since it includes a tour to anne frank house i have to read the book now,sad
hazel and gus are two teenagers who share an acerbic wit a disdain for the conventional and a love that sweeps then on a journey their relationship is all the more miraculous given that hazels other constant companion is an oxygen tank gus jokes about his prosthetic leg and they met and fell in love at a cancer support groupis based on the new york times best seller novel published in 2012 and written by john green at first i was a little bit worried to walk into a theatre for another book adaptation to a movie because 1 i loved the book and 2 there are so many of them nowadays it became a proper trend but gratefully tfios is different this is a love story its a story of joy devastating loss and most of all life it will make you laugh rejoice think feel and will expend your heart with gratitude and humility as well as change forever the way you hear the word okay yes it will make you cry if you are one of the millions of people who have read tfios you know this already if youre not prepare yourself as you will not walk away from this book or this movie unaltered i cried for the whole movie if were being honest what struck me the most is that i thought i would leave really sad but instead i felt hopeful and inspired this movie is an encouragement one of a kind you can take down into the darkness and it would still give you light personally i read tfios the way hazel falls in love with gus slowly and then all at once i started out reading it a chapter at a time in between the papers i was grading and then i gave up on grading and read straight through till down the strength of the film clearly comes from john greens novel the beauty of the book and now the film is that its a young adult novel that brought teens back to reality which is good after years of popular ya fiction novels and movies revolving around vampireswizards deadly games and dystopian universes that isnt just a movie hazels voice over intones over a close up of shailene woodley expressive eyes but a document that dares to stare terminal illness baldly in the face rather than hide behind euphemisms tfios end is not that sad if we think about it for a second its uplifting and hopeful its emphasising the importance of making your days count even if you have very few left the movie manages to imitate those different feelings and does a great job of accurately bringing the book to life thanks to a smart screenplay and dialogues plus there are some aspects of this halfdreamy halfearthbound romance that the director josh boone gets just right obviously certain scenes are cut but oddly non of these scenes are particularly crucial to the plot however they may have helped to add some depth to the character mostly i feel like the movie didnt really missed of anything in fact the most important aspect of this romance is the characters chemistry shailene woodley hazel and ansel elgort augustus created two vibrant believable parts filled with humour and intelligence hazel is clearly not afraid to die but shes scared of getting too close to people and what theyre going to do how theyre going to live without her thats probably why its so interesting to see how her parents deal with the fact that their child is dying on the one hand shailene woodley embodies perfectly hazel shes her shes funny sarcastic and cynical on the other hand not to disrespect how amazing shailene is in the film but ansel elgort is a real star hes kind of the revelation of the movie gus character is tough as his heroic journey goes from strength to weakness instead of the usual heros journey from weakness to strength he seems to have perfectly understood gus in deep ways hes brilliant his character appeared like the best human being ever by that i mean if everyone was like gus there will be no problem at all on earth once again its demonstrating how important is a strong supporting character in romance as they are are both overcoming the fact that theyre dying of cancer almost together indeed cancer provides the butt of the films most funny jokes provides the power with which the story starts to squeeze the viewers first tears read the end at httpstrangersinpblogspotfr201407movievsbookfaultinour starshtml,sad
this film is mildly recommendedno the fault is in the story a simple tale of two teenagers coping with the big c based on the popular ya book the film as well as its source is marketed for an adolescent audience which is certainly not me while the subject is adult and serious the treatment is purely superficial and saccharine lets begin to count the ways this weepie manipulates its audience and is a disservice to any cancer survivor1 the stereotypical young lovers as with all romantic films the couple must be good looking and adorable but more so the two doomed partners need to be brave and stoic as they buck the odds to keep their love alive here for your approval are hazel shailene woodley and gus ansel elgot two teenagers who meet cute at a cancer support group and fall head over heels in love they suffer as they must but as one character ruefully points outpain deserves to be felt unfortunately i felt the pain and suffered as does the audience as they spout positive bromides about survival and love rather than real teenage conversation2 dumb plotting director josh boone helms the story fairly well amid all the suds the screenplay is based on john greens popular novel and scott neustadter and michael h weber rarely stray from the source material both set these lovers on a absurd journey to amsterdam in order to meet a writer well played by willem dafoe whose book inspired them to move on with their lives this particular section of the film is where i gave up all hope for any sense of truth to enter the picture especially cloying is a scene in the anne frank house that defies any resemblance to reality3 inconsistent acting does have one stellar performance at its core which slightly elevates the movie ms woodley is the perfect heroine to play hazel bringing nuance and a fine degree of distinction to her melodramatic role she keeps the mellow at bay and is convincing in her dramatic turns this talented actress invests in her character and so does the moviegoer not the same can be said about her costar mr elgort who brings his puppy dog eyes and handsomeness to the forefront no subtlety here its a surface performance without much depth a lookgoodandreadyourlines performance this throws the whole love story out of kilter strong support is also given by laura dern and sam trammell as hazels devoted parents less than good support by nat wolff in the thankless role of as their wacky sick friend isaac4 unrealistic treatment of an illness the film is relentless in its shallow depiction of its disease always looking at the sunny side of life and looking away from the harrowing effects of cancer dying is such an unpleasantness a mild interruption of life in the fault is in our stars for every realistic display showing the effects of this debilitating illness there are an infinite number of lifeaffirming uplifting moments that overplay the characters circumstances the couples grim fates are always just out of reach but rarely seen in the true context of death death is ugly but not here the film doesnt want to be too much of a downer after all5 a slow death indeed in conclusion romantic doom is profitable in films screen junkies love a good cry look at some past winners in this tearjerking category an affair to remember bridges of madison county ghost titanic the notebook dr zhivago and the granddaddy of all soapy romantic movies love story the rare few that merit our tears can even be exemplary movies films that have been sensitively rendered gone with the wind brokeback mountain brief encounter and the two films that always do me in casablanca and roman holiday those films have the words and pictures and stars in perfect alignment just as many soap operas before this tries hard but it doesnt earn every drop of moisture lodged in those tear ducts it may get that whimpering reaction by its final scenes but thats mostly due to the luminous shailene woodley well i guess every generation needs a love story but as for meill always have paris or rome grade bvisit my blog at wwwdearmoviegoercomany comments please contact me at jadepietrorcncomnote the film poster uses a clever tag line along with the subtle oxygen tubes to hint at the plight of the lovers it is concise storytelling with the teenage actors as the films primary draw for its young audience the poster outdoes the film,sad
i had been listening to the audio book version of it was amazing the only problem was when i got to the last chapters when all the really sad stuff happens my choice was to go into my doctors appointment relatively on time or finish the cdbook the doctor was running late luckily and called me by this point i was crying my eyes out i tried to explain to her that no i wasnt in pain but the character just died i was so invested in the story that i was boohooing to the doctor about itthe movie was just like the book the only thing that i didnt really like was the fact that ansel elgort and shailene woodley mouthfull do in fact look like brother and sister i know they played such in divergent but it was a tad odd also the character who was half blind sorry forgot the name wore these cheesy looking sunglasses the whole time i really dont know sunglass brands but these looked like freebies given away at a trade show i read the actor wore blinding contacts the entire time so what was the point boo hoo at movie too,sad
this movie struck my interest before i even knew there was a book so i decided despite how eager i was to see it to read the book first which is unlike me and i am so glad i did it is a difficult task to turn a movie into a book because the readers will never be satisfied if you read the book then you know that the movie leaves out many parts i believe the movie would have been a lot better had there been more narration by hazel because a large percentage of the book she is narrating and is funny and witty and you dont get to see that in the movie also one of my favorite scenes in the book when all of them are together and gus is dying and they are still cracking jokes about how is good looks blinded their friend isaac it was that sort of thing that made you fall in love with them now dont get me wrong because im being a book snob this movie despite these small flaws that only those who read the book would see is beautiful i still cried my eyes out just like i did when i read the book the casting is great and you fall in love with gus as hard as hazel does,sad
the fault in our starsi read the book i fell in love then i fell in love with a person then i proceeded to pass it onto my loved one she fell in love i fell in love with her falling in love with this lovely bookanywaymy biggest hope and fear simultaneously was that the movie would a have the wrong casting b not follow the book and cut and slice into the plot c ruin the former experience of readingturns out i was wrong on all 3 levelshas what i consider the most perfect casting for this movie everyone more or less converges with their story counterparts and has their story to tell each character is memorable by means of acting performance and facialbodily expressions character development here is as intense as was the case with the bookokay so enough about acting what about my blunt and totally biased opinionthe movie was plain brilliant i hardly ever cry at movies even less so when i am in the company of others i was i did and i did it a lot in this case that is not a shameful feat hazel grace cancer patient and realist versus augustus waters former cancer patient and idealist the chemistry between the two persona is astonishing and utterly fascinating i think everyone is a mix of those two dispositions and we struggle to choose which one to rely on rendering both persons very easy to relate to the movie pierces fixed ideas ostensibly set in stone on cancer and adds ideas of its own of course kudos go to green for the original work but the movie manages to convey the same defiance which i believe is a rare occurrence does cancer have to define your life no is everyone fighting a brave battle no is it okay to glorify the dead no these are all very controversial topics but i agree with each and every one of them to a differing degree questioning these delicate topics and considering the way outsiders see cancer vs how cancer patients look upon it is a very needed debate in contemporary societythe movie managed to pinpoint what made the book so true to life and expand on it without deviating from the main plot excellent intoxicating lifechanging go see this movie now or see it again it matters it deserves it,sad
wow i just left the theater so im still a bit teary this movie did what is so rare in movie adaptations of books nowadays  it stuck to the story faithfully the acting is excellent and the pacing is great at first i was unsure if i liked the lead actors because they were so different from what i pictured when reading the book but they quickly proved themselves ansel and shailene play off each other very well and they did the characters justice i was a blubbering mess for the last thirty or forty minutes the story is beautiful and it carries such a great message i would definitely recommend this to anyone and everyone,sad
is amazing i was very excited when i first found out about this movie but when it finally came out i read many bad reviews so despite how excited i was i prepared myself to be disappointed when i went in to see the movie but i wasnt disappointed at all is basically just another ridiculous teenage love story but what makes it different than the rest or better if i should say is that its realistic its realistic in the sense that life is a bitch and that it doesnt always have a happy ending its realistic in the sense that pain death and all other bad things are inevitable that you will get hurt and you dont have a say in it but you do have a say in who will hurt you i enjoyed this movie so much i laughed and aawwwwed and cried it was a little boring at the beginning because the dialogues were a little too long in my opinion but overall it was great i give it an 810 although i know why there are some bad reviews this movie is not for everyone its mostly for girls i dragged my brothers to watch this movie with me and they complained the whole time  if youre someone whos looking for a romantic drama that can make you cry go see this movie,sad
 synopsistwo people that are going to die decide to hook up for a while before they die things arent easy as they are mostly sad about the whole death thing the boy becomes worried when the girl becomes delusional making outrageous claims such as im a grenade the boy knows this to be false seeing as she is not small metal and oval but she does wear a pin in her hair one day this is confusing for him spoiler alertbut then the boy dies and the girl realizes she was a girl and not a grenade the whole time the she reads a book we dont find out for sure if she dies but come on she definitely does rendering all her feelings pointless the manufacturers of her tombstone get the dates of her birth and death mixed up leading them to mark her age as 16 on said tombstone her parents are disappointed scientists describe it as the first ever case of reverse life death syndrome,sad
okay i know that im late writing a review for but i forget to so here we go i read the book before the movie which was my goal and im really glad that i did and this is also the first movie ive seen twice which is really cool because its a movie worth seeing multiple times despite augustus death so if you already didnt know this movie is about this girl named hazel grace lancastershailenne woodley who is forced to go to a support group by her parents and doctors behalf but one day a handsome guy named augustus watersansel elgortmeets hazel at support group since issacnat wolff invited him and their love story was just the beginning i was really impressed on how this the movie turned out th music went well with the scenes the actorsactresses did so well with there parts mainly shailenne ansel nat and william defoethe rotterdam trip augustus funeral the cute text messages hazels flashbacks of her proceduresthere date dinner i think the only things that i was kinda disappointed at not seeing was katiyln hazel desperately trying to find augustus eulogy and augustus brothers and sisters but you cant fit everything from the book into a film but overall this is a must see movie that will not only make you cry but laugh and smile all the way through thank you john green for this little movie that is a one sick love story,sad
back in 2012 i read the book for the first time little did i know that a little more than 2 years later that i would be seeing john greens creation come alive on the big screen what i loved about this movie and should really be the norm for all other books turned into movies is that it was incredibly true to the book and what was left out of the movie was at least reference in someway or another examples gus has a poster of the movie v for vendetta above his bed  talked about briefly in the book  and hazel and gus sitting on the swing  referencing back to the ad they created to sell the swing set in the book after this movie i want all movies made from books to have the author sitting right next to the director the whole timethis movie made me go through a whole box of kleenex in less than 2 hours definitely one of the best movies ive seen this year so far,sad
now let me get something out of the way first i am a 15 year old male who went to see this movie with 4 other guys we wanted to see what the fuss was about as none of us had read the book also none of us expected ourselves to cry well werent we in for a shocki loved this movie the two leads shailene woodley and ansel elgort were superb their realism that they brought to each of their roles worked well and they had a fantastic chemistry between each other which really complimented the movies storyline i thought the script was great as it isnt your usual ya sappy romance story with an overall less clich feel however near the beginning i did think the script was a bit cringey with the staring and what not but as the story progressed and became deeper so did the writing become more matureas much as hardcore fans of the book say to read it first i really enjoyed this movie by going in knowing next to nothing about it and i feel that made the twists all the more hardhitting some scenes brought me to tears where as others made me laugh with awkwardness me and my friends all left the cinema broken and shocked we now have a pact never to speak of it again oops,sad
here be spoilers during the long drawnout ending of this movie i could hear sniffling and noses being blown everywhere and indeed if youre looking for a weepy to blub your heart out to then this could be the film for you now i have to confess on my side the vision did get slightly blurred but certainly not the floodlike levels i experienced around me i last time i saw this level of collective sobbing was titanic i guess theres something about a charming pretty boy dying young that sets off the ol female tear ducts he had all his life ahead of him snort madame could you please remove your hankie from my lapanyway credit where credit is due this is for the most part an engaging portrayal of two intelligent teenage cancer sufferers who dont know what the future holds gus appears to be in remission but has had a leg amputated while hazel has only one lung after her treatment and has to lug an oxygen tank with her everywhere they meet at a support group which is of course full of false platitudes and unhelpful advice the couple connect almost instantly in this staid atmosphere and before long theyre swapping books and sharing their own unique brand of black comedyin fact they make a perfect match which makes it all the more tragic that inevitably one or both will pass away soon come on youve seen the way this movie is marketed you werent expecting a happy ending but before she shuffles off this mortal coil hazel wants to meet the author of her favourite novel in the flesh because the story he wrote had an unsatisfactory conclusion that she wants elaborating on one problem he now lives in isolation in amsterdam and she doesnt have the money to get there plus her health may be at risk during the flight thanks to gus and her familys efforts though her dreams come truethe trip to holland is eyeopening in more ways than one as our intrepid duo have an unforgettable three days sadly its all downhill from there as events take a turn for the worstthe film does begin to lose some of its power by becoming a bit too melodramatic and the previously witty dialogue turns rather flowery to this trained ear still it studiously avoids maudlin sentiment for the most part so i suppose we can allow it to get a little morose during the climax as long as old biddies seated nearby could be more careful with their snotrags in the future jeez 610,sad
went to see it last night and it was incredible so happy with it almost perfect of course there where a few minor twitches compared to the book but i had been counting down for the movie for nine months and it so paid off couldnt stop the laughter or the tears omggg the film ended and even though i was already balling my eyes out i didnt want to make and crying noises cos everyone was so quiet but the credits came up and i wailed like crazy thank you so much to all the people who were part of the movie leaving me without a single doubt or disappointment and for making the best book ever into the best film ever 3 i cannot tell you how thankful i am for our little infinity 3,sad
my teenage daughter gave me the book a week before the movie came out i knew it was teen fiction and i also knew that a lot of young people especially girls were waiting for the movie release with bated breath and stocking up on tissues in anticipation i finally went to see the movie with my daughter and it was lovely  though you could probably have sailed out of the movie theatre on the river of tears going on around us by the end of the filmthis is a very faithful adaptation though it leaves out a lot of the philosophical stuff in the book that really wouldnt have translated well on screen the lead actors were excellent and it was interesting that this movie with a modest budget outsold the latest tom cruise blockbuster on the same opening weekendthese 2 young lead actors are definitely worth watching again,sad
i truly enjoyed this film the cast did a phenomenal job the settings were beautiful the writing was excellent everything just fit into place i especially enjoy films that make the audience feel something a film that inspires people or makes them believe in something this film did exactly that its beautiful how light of a film it is despite one of its major subjects it includes comedy romance passion  everything that can make a person feelgood almost every single audience member left with big red puffy eyes yet huge smiles on their faces job well done im looking forward to seeing this film again in the future,sad
okay its manipulative on the other hand if you choose to watch a movie that you know revolves around two young kids both terminally ill who fall in love a love that by definition has nowhere to go and when the lovers in question are teenagers rather than say sixty year olds then you shouldnt be surprised to be manipulated my feeling on this is ill sit still for a little manipulation provided its being done by pros so that its polished to a high gloss and acted to a high standard that in short is what we have here i singled out shailene woodley as the best thing in the descendents a couple of years back and here she lights up the screen and though once again she is the best thing on view the support is light years better than she got in the descendents so that overall woodley takes the movie but only by a nose from the rest of the cast it was probably slightly unorthodox to have a leading man ansel eghort so stunning as to be an amalgam of tom cruise tyrone power gregory peck robert taylor etc and cast him opposite an actress like woodley who is not chocolate box pretty a la liz taylor audrey hepburn etc and make us wait to see that she is beautiful once she starts to act for that matter it is inconceivable that a babe magnet like eghort would be a total singleton this to one side all the cast are totally believable and we can even forgive the heavyhanded metaphor of a visit to the home of anne franck in amsterdamarguably a slick rather than a chick flic but then again why not a slick chick flic,sad
first of all i dont think this movie deserves the reviews that it has been getting i know this novel isnt the most dramatic thing in the world but i still think that a few of the scenes in the movie couldve been a little better for example the peter van houten scene was too crammed in my head i envisioned the room being big with a gray sofa on which peter van houten was drinking and talking to hazel and augustus in the movie theres this guy in a wooden chair talking to hazel and augustus in this room that is so small hazel and gus are sitting on the couch that i envisioned peter would have been sitting on anyway enough about that i did like the acting i thought that shailene woodley did an incredible a fat job of portraying hazel grace lancaster she did a great job in the scenes where she had to cry or be very happy i think those emotional scenes she did very well on on the other hand i think that ansel elgort couldve done a better job in those emotional scenes i dont know if that is his way of portraying gus sense of humor or if that is just fine that they cast the wrong guy to play augustus waters for example in the scene where gus calls hazel asking for help when hes at the gas station he kind of just threw up i think they couldve done a better job of having him be throwing his body around in pain or crying thats just what i think you guys might disagree with me and think that ansel did a good job but i just think they couldve found a better augustus waters lets go back on the topic of peter i imagine peter as being a fat obnoxious drunk with their choice of willem dafoe as playing peter van houten i think it ruins the point of the character willem is kind of a skinny guy who has a beard and kind of looks obnoxious but i think they shouldve gone with someone who had a little more weight on them plus willem didnt give me the vibe that peter van houten gave me when i was reading the book it must sound like im a pretty negative guy but here are some good things about the movie i like how hazel is narrating throughout the story i liked all of gus jokes and how he would annoy hazel i also like that they spent a great deal of time in amsterdam the movie really spent a lot of time there which i thought was great and further developed hazel and gus relationship i gave this movie a 9 out of 10 because its just such a good story i hope you guys found this review useful and be sure to think about all the suggestions that i made to the movie,sad
it has been said that the movie is a sick love story to me its a realistic love story love must count no matter the length of the time death also doesnt mean to an end by the poetic name of the movie stars refer to the concept of death in western culture in which death is an ultimate end of ones life theres nothing more after ones life when we look close to the storyline the whole movie emphasizes the fragility of human life and the purity of love the pipe and the conversation when peter van houten plays funky rap music to hazel reveal that love is a feeling than an answer when people look for an answer like hazel they will be emotional and hurt themselves the death of gus can mean the end of love or the start for hazel to learn to love and the answer is from us the fault seems to be the only answer of death,sad
the fault of our stars is about two teenagers who meet up in a support group and realize that they have one thing in common cancer hazel grace lancastershailene woodley who i have never heard of and this was the movie that introduce me to heris a 16 year old teen who has stage 4 thyroid cancer who meets gus waters who is an 18 year old who has bone cancer in a support group and the two of them become friends quickly and soon they fall in love of course hazel dreams of going to amsterdam to meet an author called peter von huttonwillem defoewho wrote her favorite bookand her mom and her dad decide that she can go on behalf of the hospital that she goes to get herself looked after but will her 3 day trip to amsterdam be great or not also is gus really cured from his bone cancer or is he hiding something from hazela lot of films make me laugh and crysome make me weep more make me cry so hardim looking at you marley and me and the lion king along with tangled and beeches and a walk to remember but overall i was glad i got to see this today as the acting was brilliantthe story has been done before in the pastand this is based on a noveli dont read any books at all on books turning into movies like nicholas sparks novels like dear johnthe lucky one etc but this was a good movie and a real tearjerker i wept at a few scenes particularly at the end of the movie and like i said before the acting is very well doneespecially woodleys performance which hopefully will give her a few awards for this film alongside the guy that plays guswho was very handsome indeedoverall its a 9,sad
first off i must say that i have not yet read the book by john green i remember watching the trailer to this movie months ago and thinking that i wasnt completely sold on it however i do know one thing i do enjoy watching movies starring shailene woodley she is a fantastic actress i remember seeing her in the spectacular now and thinking how great she was i actually didnt care for that movie but i did like her performance she was believableis a great movie once again i thoroughly enjoyed shailenes performance she just plays the role of the average girl in high schoolcollege so well shes beautiful but its not only her looks which carry such a movie her characters in these coming of age movies really shines because she gets it and does it acting very welli felt like this movie was divided into three acts in the first act i struggled a bit to find the characters believable specially augustus i felt like his character was trying too hard it wasnt until the second act when i realized the characters started to grow on me and i found the characters believable the third act in the movie is fantastic and really proved to be the strongest for all the characters involved you really feel for these characters and youre thoroughly invested in their journey together the writing is fantastic now that i know how much i enjoyed the second and thirds acts id like to revisit the movie again to enjoy it all over again it could very well be that i didnt get it from the beginning because it may have had hints of a clichd teenage coming of age movie with no substancethis movie is different there is plenty of substance the focus is kept mainly on hazel and augustus relationship these two carry the movie without the need of a big supporting cast shailenes performance is fantastic you really feel for her and her struggles specially if youve every known someone whos battled cancer at a young age specially a teen in high school dealing with the pressures of friendship fitting in dating sex all of which come with peer pressure its all relatableby the time the third act shows up on the screen i dare you not to shed a tear or a few this movie really pulls at the heart strings and it does so wonderfully because of the fantastically written script and book i presume this movie book contains some great messages enjoy,sad
is refreshingly contemporary with a really open and honest head on depiction of death its not a weepy in the classic sense because i never felt that they were trying to make me cry the direction and the two main performances really shy away from simply treacly excess the film is way too long by about 25 minutes but the director and two stars deserve huge kudos for keeping it real shailne woodley is adorable wonderful and honest equally ansel elgort is a really interesting choice for the male lead hes not pretty by todays standards and a bit of an awkward lug not at all what you expect from an actor in this role i was impressed,sad
i spent a lot of time checking my watch wondering when this movie was really going to get rolling when it did it was good but the whole movie could have used some more editing also i found it had for me an annoying life is beautiful postcardy sense about it for such a difficult topic of kids dying of cancer there was little difficulty or real conflict in the first three quarters of the movie laura derns talent was completely wasted willem dafoe put in a fine performance as a crotchety hateful writer but it wasnt enough to add any real depth to the moviei wish i could say i liked it more hazel augustus and josh came off as likable real people although as perfect attitude began to bug me as the movie wore on,sad
i watched this film without actually reading the book i saw it on the adverts and i just had to watch it i was a bit put off at first as it was about a woman with cancer i am not a fan of films like that as they usually feature death i am not a huge fan of death i finally decided to watch it as everyone else had seen it and from the beginning i enjoyed it the storyline was clever it had its funny moments and it had its sad moments throughout the storyline i found myself becoming quite attached to hazel the main characterand found myself unable to stop crying at bits then the storyline had all this plot twists that even i a person who can predict what is gonna happen before it actually happens in a lot of filmscould not guess the ending was very very very sad and i could not stop crying at it i have to admit it was one of the best films about a person with cancer that i have ever seen it made me want to go out and get the book i enjoyed watching it and i highly recommend it to anyone as long as you do not forget to bring your tissues not a waste of money to see at the cinema ,sad
i dont cry very often  in my group of friends im known as having a heart made of ice before i watched the today i could not remember the last movie ive cried to the last one being at least three years agois a very good movie for the right audience im luckily in that audience being a 15 year old girl having read the book also in a very specific scene with hazel talking to her parents about when shell die of the tough lung cancer she had it reminded me of what i was doing through doing my halfdepression some time ago there i dealt with the same feelings  about being forgotten leaving people behind and death in general which i struggled with accepting just there i felt so connected to these characters even though i dont have cancer and never have  but it just felt so real and thats where i cried in the cinema for the first time in my lifethe acting in this movie is very very good it felt honest it felt realistic the script could easily have made this movie into one big sap with soaking cheese but with the very talented actors and amazing directing the film avoided thatof course this isnt for everyone i would say its mostly for teens around my own age and if you find yourself having a need to break your own heart and think about your role in the universe go see tfios and of course everyone else whos interested i wasnt disappointed something i tend to be watching book tomovie adaptations if i was john green the author of the book i would be very very proud,sad
with being only half interested in watching the film but yet being dragged by my otherhalf my expectation for the film was not at a high i havent read the book nor even picked it up yet the film seemed flawless in perfecting the beauty of flawed life the movie is a roller coaster of emotion in its self that takes you on a journey of many feelings and emotion knowing that cancer plays a role in who the characters are we are immediately set up for a doomed laps of events this just helps draw us in as we can only wish for the best outcome like any other love story to my understanding john green has created a perfect life within a limited time line or what is as close as perfect can get for these two lovers something so thoughtful and emotion grabbing has been successfully portrayed on the big screen the acting was exceptional both play a convincing role with unmatched chemistry for one another i give it 910 as it does nothing but draw you to the unbound love and affection of such a heartbreaking film im not generally a crier but this almost got me there the movie is brilliant yet not perfect as most movies arent but remain exceptional within moments of hazel and gus meeting its easy to love how easily they fall in love if you arent careful you will be hooked in moments and enjoy every minute of it but that wouldnt be so bad,sad
first of all i have not read the book however my girlfriends teenage daughter has and i went with them to see it ill start by saying the acting was really good the only other thing ive seen woodley in is the descendants and i remember thinking what a great job this young person is doing well she does it again in this film the thing about this movie that i dont like is how it emotionally manipulates the audience now granted all forms of media do that thats the point of film books music etc but this film lays it on really thick that to me was unbelievable i think it could have been a little more subtle for subject matter that is very real and very believable the way everything played out to ensure maximum tears from its audience was not most specifically the gus uncanny ability to perfectly execute all these hopeless romantic endeavors to make the audience fall in love with him even after the climax it just wasnt real enough to me for subject matter that is supposed to be very real i did like the movie overall but thats why i give this a 6,sad
i dont usually write movie reviews but this one just had me waste the time to do so how in gods name can this be rated over 8 the movie is so full of clichs that it had me gasping for air much like the female stari cant understand how they could take such an emotional subject as the love story between two terminally ill teenagers and drain it of all emotion the movie is so predictable it is scary and beyond that it fails to make you as a viewer care for their fate at allunrealistic pretentious and without substance but heyits about kids with cancer of course we are going to sing its praises im almost starting to see van houtens point of viewand my final question is what movie have you people giving it rave reviews been watching,sad
you may think you have seen enough terminal romances but surprisingly this one works even though you can expect some predictability and clichs this tear jerker romance is engaging and watchable it doesnt get too cute too often good twistgood job on how they made up shailene woodley to look tired around the eyes but not too sickly for this kind of role she is quite dignified and restrained ansel elgort smiles a bit too much at first but later on his sad face is touching the trip to amsterdam is enchanting and the valiant visit to anne franks house is quite touching at first i thought that the pairing would be strange with the sibling casting in divergent but didnt really figure because the settings are differentthe willem dafoe writer thing is a bit annoying but its good contrast so show how in real life everyone isnt all sweetness when it comes to cancer the bitterness and bile are the reality check in this movieoverall worth a watch,sad
oh my goodness this movie is so freaking great like i was just hooked ever since i watched the trailer and then watching it and the title came i couldnt take my eyes away its like watching that i just dont want to watch anything else that is the greatest movie i have ever watched other passion of the christ seriosuly that is such an amazing love story and how the actors chemistry in the movie worked so well together making it seem like it was real that i had to remember that it was a movie like i just cant believe it blew me out of the water ive been looking for the book and cant find it so that right there should tell how amazing this story is i probably will end up reading it as much as hazel has read an imperial affliction that is just amazing i seriously cannot stop thinking about the eulogy scene when hazel described her feelings for gus it was just incredible and i cant forget isaacs when he never wanted to see a world without him in it it was just incredible and how it ended with okay just sealed the deal for me im a guy a straight guy but i am literally a sucker for this movie i just dont care its incredibly a masterpiece im going to watch this again actually if i have the time and even get me started when the dvd comes out it will never leave my dvd player thank you so much shailene for your acting in this it was superb it also made my crush for you even bigger since divergent seriously that was amazing the emotion into every feeling in every scene was just incredible its just impossible for me to think of anybody else playing hazel dude ansel that was seriously some awesome acting for real the character you brought to life was just amazing hilarious always keeping a smile no matter what on every ones face just incredible seriously congratulations on this movie it was perfect i save my 10 for this,sad
i loved the book let me say that again i loved the book the movie though it had some charming moments and they did salvage a couple of good bits of dialog felt as if someone went through the story with a big disneyafter school special sponge and scrubbed away all the edges that made the book so uniquewhere was the snappy sass and witty repartee from augustus when we meet him at the support group in the book his ease at teasing his soon to be blind friend was appalling and fantastic in equal measure and it set the tone for the reality of people living with cancer they do not want pity and they wish more than anything that people wouldnt edit every freaking thing they say in their company because they will miss the good jokes when they dowhere was the family gathering after gus got out of the hospital and the cloying sympathetic behavior of siblings and extended family that was so brilliantly exposed and demolished by hazel  guss funny exchange in front of them all if they took the time to put thought bubbles over heads while texting why didnt they just let hazel narrate the deeper thoughts that easily could have been laced throughout the film and how the heck did the screenplay writer the director and anyone else who read this miss the huge significance of the reading of kids names at the support group who had died the singular moment they should have gone for a good cry from the audience should have been hearing augustuss name echo out in that heart of jesus room and it would have been the moment it all came together but no it either never got filmed or its sitting on the cutting room floor i could have done with less  way too longdramatics when her parents got the call and the whole emotional bundle would have been offered at the name reading for any teens who saw this film and loved it 10 stars hearts  flowers i encourage you to wait about ten twenty thirty years and read the bookagain you will as an adult finally understand the depth of what you have in your hands and when you rewatch this vanilla cutesy teen love story film youll give it the six it deservesit could have been so much more if the screenwriters hadnt pulled their punches to dumb down the dialog for a larger audience really too bad oh and the actors were great given the cold meatloaf they were handed to work with,sad
never have i seen a movie so heart wrenching as this one is an exceptional movie that will have you crying laughing and anxious all at the same time it is based on the amazing novel written by john green in this movie shailene woodley plays hazel grace a girl diagnosed with stage four lung cancer ansel elgort plays gus waters who is diagnosed with cancer as well they fell in love with each other the way we fall asleep slowly and then all at once their journey goes from meeting their favorite author in amsterdam to rushing to the hospital for immediate chemotherapy this movie shows the hardships of being in love and fighting for your life in such a beautiful but realistic manner i absolutely love this filmthere are so many great aspects about this movie that its hard to highlight a few however one of my favorite things is the whole plot and its meaning it creatively captures a teenagers perspective of love but also of dealing with cancer it reaches out to a younger audience but still allows an older audience to enjoy it john green knows how to grab the audiences attention by intertwining the two most heart wrenching aspects of life  love and death another thing i really love about the movie is how well it depicts the book it is based on i read the book a few months ago and i loved how the director put in just enough of the details to keep its authenticity i didnt feel like there was anything missing overall this movie is extremely great and i want everyone to enjoy it as i didmy favorite character is hazel grace lancaster hazel is witty and smart but also strong and understands things she teaches gus a lot about books and how not to be afraid of oblivion hazel knows shes going to die but she accepts that and she wants her parents to accept that too i think a lot of teens going through love or even pain can relate to hazel grace my favorite scene is when hazel gus and isaac go to isaacs ex girlfriends house isaacs exgirlfriend monica dumped isaac because he was going to have eye surgery which would leave him blind right before the surgery monica dumped isaac and never even asked if he was okay hazel gus and isaac want revenge so they go to egg her house this part is so funny because isaac is blind and he cant see where hes throwing the eggs this struck me as so funny because hes throwing the eggs in the bushes and at the trees but hazel and gus try to keep his spirit up by giving him encouragement it is just a funny scene i recommend this movie for ages 12 to 18 because it is a lot to comprehend and some of the information about death may be too much for young children i am 14 and have never cried so much in two hours this is an amazing movie and i give it 5 out of 5 stars this is a great movie for teens to go out and watch with friends it comes out this weekend so make sure you get to watch this movie you wont regret itreviewed by jailene a kids first film critic for more film reviews go to kidsfirst dot org,sad
i saw this film late one thursday night and i was blown away by the storytelling of the film not only was it captivating it was also immensely emotional there were a few faults with it but not enough to warrant it even close to being bad the characters of hazel and augustus had such great chemistry that it didnt even feel as though you were in the cinema it felt as if you were watching the life of someone else my only problem with this film was it didnt quite flow as well as it could have it jumped from scene to scene and the transition scenes were rough but that might have been the intention that was the only fault that i was able to find with it the story was great and it followed the book more of less other than rough scene jumps and it had me crying even after the movie was over and done with all in all it is definitely a movie to be seen by all ages and by both men and women,sad
i read the book earlier this year and loved it it has become my favorite book i have ever read so i had pretty high expectations going into this movie this is a fantastic film shailene woodley is one of my favorite actresses and she does a terrific job playing hazel she has amazing chemistry with ansel elgort the scenes with the two of them are a lot of fun the romance between the two of them was believable and never felt forced shailene does a great job with the emotional scenes and had me tearing up a few times i truly believe she should be nominated come oscar time ansel elgort was also great as augusts waters i liked how much he cared for hazel the most difficult scene to watch took place at a gas station he does an amazing job in that scene and i dont think it would have been the same with another actor this is a very special film and one i hope a lot of people take the time to watch,sad
you laugh you cry and you are left emotionally distraught for the next week the scene where they land in amsterdam is really upbeat and you cant help but smile every time ansel smiles you smile and every time ansel cries you cry this book is very true to the book and if it does change something it is either very small or you dont even know it was changed i thank john green for writing such a great yet heartwrenching story i think the casting was amazing and the whole movie team should be very proud of making a great movieadditionally this movie requires a lot of kleenex i left the cinema with my eyes all red and puffy and this morning i still felt the same this movie basically ruins you but in a good way ,sad
breaks your heart and makes you laugh these are the words i said to my mom after reading the book and again after watching the movie that is definitely what the movie does to you this is love story that is true to the sickness and all the love that they have in the book and im so grateful for that i had fears that the movie will be too different from the book but this was definitely not the case everything from the restaurant in amsterdam to hazels bag holding her oxygen was just like imagined it the casting was perfect and ii will definitely go see this movie again and again and againsorry for my poor english,sad
oh my god i saw the movie today and i was in tears the book also had me in tears its awesome and sad and funny all at the same time warning dont read the book or see the movie unless you are prepared for the pain that will come its just perfectjust perfect like words cant explain i in love with this movie and book i will reread and re watch it probably over 100 times and i guarantee each time i will end up in tears over all i recommend this to anyone im in love with it and im sure anyone will be my aunt said she wouldnt cry and she didim pretty sure everyone in the theater was i heard sniffles all through the movie,sad
i knew this movie would be good no not good  amazing breathtaking astonishing heartbreaking special or just something in between that reading the book i found myself nonable to stop so i had very big expectation for this movie and god help me i was positively surprised not only had they chosen actors who fit very well with their characters but they played amazingly with each other nothing felt awkward or not right shailene woodley though i had my doubts was the perfect hazel grace she knew how she should react how she felt how her whole world was supposed to be it was a pleasure watching her play that role i actually thought that i would start crying as soon as the movie started as soon as the worlds would appear on the screen but i didnt the beginning was as lovely as the books beginning everything was down to earth and you started to get an idea of what it was like to be hazel grace what you go through when you have cancer and what your priorities are it is not easy especially when youre as sick as she isbut she soon figures out that there is more in life than just cancer and that thing is augustus waters and their time together is absolutely heartbreaking but true i have to say that the journey they have is why you need kleenexes it is nothing but real true and sad but the thing is sometimes you need that you need something that might not have a hollywood ending and if you seek that then this is the movie for you but please i was very grateful for my kleenex you should have some near you  just in case,sad
four and a half stars out of five a romantic drama film based on the bestselling book of the same name by john green it stars shailene woodley as a 16yearold cancer patient who falls in love with a cancer survivor played by ansel elgort that she meets in a support group it was directed by josh boone who also directed the 2013 romantic drama flick stuck in love and written by scott neustadter and michael h weber the duo also wrote 500 days of summer and the spectacular now which also costarred woodley it costars nat wolff who also costarred in stuck in love laura dern sam trammell and willem dafoe i dont usually go for cheesy teenage melodrama or painfully bad tragic love stories but this movie isnt either of those things its actually a well made and moving film that offers up another stunning performance from shailene woodley woodley plays hazel grace lancaster a 16year old cancer patient who lives in indianapolis indiana with her parents dern and trammell elgort plays augustus waters a 17yearold cancer survivor who rid himself of osteosarcoma by having one of his legs amputated the two meet at a cancer support group that hazels parents force her to go to augustus is there to support his friend isaac wolff whos now gotten cancer tumors in both of his eyes augustus immediately takes a liking to hazel after running into her outside of a meeting and then proceeds to stare at her and hit on her after the meeting concludes the two watch a movie together at augustuss house and then recommend books for each other to read they continue to develop a relationship as augustus tracks down the author dafoe of hazels favorite book a book about a cancer patient much like herself and they attempt to get answers from him about the books inconclusive endingill start by saying im becoming a huge fan of shailene woodley much like her buddy jennifer lawrence i find her to be a very inspiring and likable person in interviews at least and also think shes an amazingly talented actress shes once again excellent in this film and delivers an oscar worthy performance shes also the main reason i wanted to see this movie i havent read the book and if woodley wasnt in the movie i probably would have had no desire to see it either im glad i did though and shailene is the main reason but its a good film in many other ways as well neustadter and weber are great film writers i love their other work especially the spectacular now but they also obviously had good stories to work with adapt boone is also a good director i loved stuck in love and look forward to seeing many more movies from him in the future the supporting cast is all decent in it as well but elgort is especially a great match for woodley the two have beautiful chemistry together and they do make the story seem romantic which is a little odd considering they played siblings in their last film divergent the movie is touching and funny in places but im sure its even more moving for those who can more directly relate to the subject it deals with the issue in a seemingly effective way and never feels forced or overly done although the film might look to some like it reeks of the bad taste of similar themed movies it doesnt its a well made film and another triumph for shailene woodleywatch our movie review show movie talk at httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv6xzh1flmmq4,sad
is a story about young life love and living while you can based on the 2012 novel written by john greene this film tells the story of hazel grace and gus two teenagers living with different kinds of cancer hazel the more pessimistic of the two knows she has limited time left and chooses to let the clock tick without making something happen the story begins with hazel meeting the charismatic gus at a stereotypical support group gus immediately chases after her affections and what follows is a beautiful story of what life is like for the notsotypical american teenager falling into the arms of young love leading this small but powerful cast is the phenomenal shailene woodley in the role of hazel grace woodley practically carries the film on her shoulders being the entire focus of the film and she does an incredible job of it the emotional ups and downs her character endures over the course of the story were hard ones to keep up with and hard ones for a 16 yearold boy to relate to but i was immediately taken by the power of her character and the realities she faced and the realities actress shailene woodley portrayed so well in my opinion woodleys performance is by far the best seen in a 2014 film so far and will be hard to top starring opposite woodley is ansel elgort playing the bold and practical gus elgorts performance honestly put me off a bit the character he developed was great however it did not match the screenplay he was given beforehand which made the character of gus difficult to relate to this was minor however and in no way took away from the whole of the film also starring are laura dern and sam tremmel doing an excellent job as hazels parents natt wolf as gus best friend whos purpose was honestly difficult to understand and willem dafoe as hazels temporary idol van houten josh boone took the directors chair for this picture whose screenplay was provided from scott neustadter and michael weber adapting the novel of john greene neustadter and weber did an excellent job with their adaptation keeping necessary story plots eliminating portions that would fit well for a book but would struggle on the screen while holding dearly on to the abstract and poetic words of author john greene director john boones work was hardly noticeable in this film which is always debatable whether or not that is a good quality here i believe it was what boone did allowed the viewer to step into hazels small world a small world filled with countless infinities there were no extraordinary shots camera angles or certain scenes that left watchers breathless instead we were there with her sitting on her bed waiting for those special texts filled with so much more than a three word message climbing stairs that felt like both an impossible mountain and the finish line of a marathon and seeing everyone you care about so much love you more than you can imagine the work done by these filmmakers did not take us anywhere special but they allowed us to see life here on earth at its fullest valuing the people youre with above anything else whether its in the form of romance or friendship and especially family at its very best is not a movie about cancer it is a movie about love in all of its truest forms so as i sat in the theater watching the credits roll with other viewers walking past me wiping their eyes i smiled and thats exactly what a movie should do i give an 8610,sad
was literally a book comes to life it was a great movie but for a nonbook reader it was a purely perfection i read the book before they planned to make a film adaptation of it and i can say to you that it tore me apart that time the book did well making me cry like a baby girl as i read iti rate it 95 for its perfect plot the acting was great although i never imagine shailene as hazel and ansel as gus but they still did the role right for a typical romance drama comedy movie this is entertaining and it will be more if you havent read the book first the problem is that i know what will gonna happen so in my case or the book readers there is no suspense at allthere is just a little disappointment when the scene from the book most are tear jerking scene and my favourite scene are missing most of it is those unforgettable lines and quotes which i was hoping to see in the big screenthe first was isaacs talking computer those moments are funny yet it was not including in the film john greens cameo is missing too and the complete scene of the funeral where hazel opens the casket the lines like my thoughts are stars i cant fathom into constellations and i love you present tensemoreover you will enjoy the film i just cant decide whether you need to read the book first before watch the movie but i can tell you the book brings you lot of emotion and tears,sad
i am a fourteen year old girl so my opinion may not matter to many people looking for a true review however i do believe that out of many of my friends and classmates i am able to write an honest review without my teenage personality getting in the way with that said i recommend if you are looking for a legitimate review before you watch this movie or spend money and time watching it to read this review i will not include any spoilers because i hate when that happens to me as well i read the book about three months before this movie came out it was before they released the trailer for it too i simply read it for a class project and not just for the upcoming movie to be completely honest this was the first book i read that has a movie that goes along with it when starting the book i did not expect to love it as much as i did to put things in perspective i have read it five times and highlighted and annotated the whole thing but thats the book not the movie my point is i really think that you should read the book before watching the movie if you havent please do because you will appreciate the movie so much more i went to the movie in theaters the day it came out with friends i did not buy the tickets online because i truly didnt expect it to be really crowded since they had so many times that night however the line was unbelievably long to just get into the theater and no it was not just teenagers i love that i loved how this bookmovie did not just target teenagers like critics and people may say there was so many ages there old young college 30s every age i also probably saw at least 15 people i knew from my school alone the reason i tell you this is that this bookmovie is for everyone now to the movie it was incredible i wont spoil anything like i said earlier the acting was fantastic i felt everything the characters felt it had every single person in the packed theater laughing every 30 seconds and then crying their eyes out every other 30 seconds it was a roller coaster of wonderful emotions it went exactly with the book with minor changes that didnt change the plot or storyline so it didnt annoy me at all i actually liked the small changes a lot it took so many direct quotes from the book and it made it feel like this genius book that i love came to life another thing i loved is how the actorsactresses they chose matched how i invisioned each character in my head like i said before i read this book before any news was said about the movie i especially liked ansel elgort gus because he was the perfect gus in my mind at first i was skeptical with him but once he made his first appearance in the movie i knew he was absolutely perfect what made me so happy as well was the setting of each scene i feel like every scene that they were somewhere different was just beautiful the sky was never gloomy the places were lively and just overall gorgeous not every movie always has that and it really added to the feel i cried so much from beginning to end that my mascara ran down my face luckily i went home right after it was actually embarrassing at some points because i wasnt sobbing i was full on crying my mouth was quivering and i was breathing heavy and my nose was running this movie has to be one of the best if not the best movie i have ever seen i am definitely going to see it again in theaters and buy the dvd when it comes out absolutely beautiful i am quite sad now that its over but the world is not a wishgranting factory so i guess ill have to live with it,sad
i would like to say go f yourself john green this movie this book was fantastic you thought this would be a hateful review right well no i cried and god damn cried threw all of the movie it gave me a sense of hope that you can find love anywhere in any situation ive loved this book and was sceptical about the movie since a lot of movies that were formed from a book is never that great but this this went above and beyond i cant say how much it felt when i saw it was almost the same as the book and the actors did a great job making the characters come to life hazel shay can i say that shayilene woodley was the perfect girl for hazel im not going to lie i did have my doubts about her but overall i loved her performance and felt the connection to her character she did hazel well gus ansel he was my favourite out of all to be honest his emotion his expression i literally felt like gus was actually real and out there you know i cant stress enough that if someone else was playing gus then i dont think it would be as great as it isisaac nat can i say the hell is wrong with monica isaac was sweet and hilarious he believes in true love and was the most awesome characterhes my second favourite btw he nat is extremely gorgeous my legs are always open nat  i dont understand how she didnt want to date a blind guy i mean just because hes blind doesnt mean anythingsmhi loved this book the characters and the movie if you are having doubts you shouldnt its the best i have ever seen the scene where they were sitting on the park bench and he was telling her oh god i cried like a fing baby it was so real so realistic i thought i was watching a documentary koodos to the director the producers and the cast i loved it,sad
the following is a review of one of the best films of the year everyone was literary sobbing in the theater once the film killed off augustus  it would most likely be even more sadder if they showed it on film but you can still feel the emotional effect of the films characters because they look and feel so real the film has one of the finest performances of shailene woodleys career  she deserves an oscar nomination for best actress williem dafoe while he has a very short role as van houten his performance haunts us because his downfall can happen to anyone laura dern who i have not seen since watching blue velvet did a great job in her performancethis is very much like the citizen kane of all romantic dramas the film is a mystery a romance and a comedy it is also a tragedy much like romeo and juliet the ending to this review i urge you to go see this this is a great movie all in all this is what romantic films now have to follow up to in order to be great,sad
well i knew nothing about the book or the movie until all of the sudden the trailer gets released so i watched and i was hooked i cried like a baby just with the trailer so i went on and got the book read it and loved it but i was waiting for the moviei went to the movie with my best friend because i knew i was gonna cry and so i did i think i cried the entire movie shailene and ansel have an awesome chemistry on screen they make you feel like you know them and so you love and grieve with themi really hope she gets some award recognition and ansel keeps doing fantastic movies hes a charm,sad
i saw this in the philippines where every seat was taken and people even sat on the floor and at the back they were standing i sat in the front row as i often do for quiet but every seat filled there too somehow the locals knew it was good even second day of release i was told the book was very popular there in fact people were calling out the names of characters as they made their first appearance the ingenuous response of the filipino audience was almost as touching as the movie itself i am a bloke and even before i felt sad tears were streaming i have never experienced that before weeping before the sad bits came i cant account for it and i usually dont cry being a man and all if you dont cry during this you would have to be a sociopath it is beautifully put together what a movie it is corny of course but sophisticated heartfelt corn and not actually overdone the acting has been acknowledged as great and yes the female lead was excellent but i was most impressed with the male lead ansel elgort this guy for me stole the whole movie with his performance he was magnificent especially since he was only19 when he did this movie all the acting and photography was excellent william dafoe also did a great job as you would expect i thought hazel graces mother was performed exceptionally well as i came out of the show holding back the tears there was a long line of people waiting for the next session,sad
i think in terms of being able to portray real emotion on screen and capture the perfect amount of sadness with just one face there is no one better in hollywood than shailene woodley whether its the one short scene in divergent or the near 10 scenes in this movie she is perfect at crying and for the most part the entire cast executes as well ansel elgort was surprisingly great as the cocky but truly caring augustus waters laura dern perhaps had one of the best performances of her career and even sam trammel nat wolff and willem dafoe shined in their small but significant roles as much sadness as this movie will bring to people especially those who have had or know somebody who has had cancer it can also be very upliftingfrom what i hear the movie is nearly a perfect transition from book to film and i can say there isnt much they could have done better it does take awhile for the emotional scenes to hit but when they do its hard to hold back the tears also i really liked how the trailers gave us the gist of the story without showing too much i was surprised a few times with where the story went and i compliment 20th century fox for giving us a great marketing campaignthe chemistry within the entire cast was impeccable if im comparing it to spectacular now i would say this movie has the edge in balancing emotion with slight humor and even being more gutsy as shailene woodley said there arent many movie posters that show a beautiful girl using an oxygen tank they very easily could have taken shailene woodley and elgort and just left out any signs of cancer woodley has a bright future and if she keeps choosing her roles wisely then she will one day hold an oscarlike i said there are roughly 810 scenes where you may cry and for a film to do that and still manage to be uplifting at the same time is quite the accomplishment its one of my favorite movies of the year so far and for the performances and near perfect directing it should be seen in theaterswoodley is getting better and better emotional scenes hit the exact right amount of times few surprises depressing but still manages to be uplifting at the same time9610,sad
i cant even put words to how much i loved this movie i went in expecting to see an amazing book turned into a bad movie but i was so wrong shailene and ansel had such great chemistry their performances were oscarworthy the rest of the cast did a great job too when shailene hazel cried over gus i too was bawling as was the rest of the theater ansel played gus in such an amazing way that even before the sad parts came i got teary eyed this is also very true to the book i have been a nerdfighter john green fan since 2012 and i could only spot a few minor changes nat wolff was surprisingly a great choice for isaac during the trophy scene he was hilarious and the whole theater was giggling warning you will need two boxes of tissues at least if this movie doesnt win at least an oscar i will be shocked everything about the movie was perfect definitely my new favorite movie,sad
another book turned movie in recent years due to peoples inability to make stuff up themselves we have the story of hazel grace lancaster played by the lovely shailene woodley who seems to be on her way to becoming the new jennifer lawrence she doesnt really need the replacement already but i digress and augustus waters played by ansel elgort now to be fair i did read the book but i went into this strictly to see how well it was as a movie and you know what it was actually pretty enjoyable you can tell its definitely aimed at the young adultteenage audience with its attractive young actors teenage humor and well young love do these things take away from it for adults wellll if they didnt read and enjoy the book then most likely i sat in a packed house of teenage girls their mothers and boyfriends who looked like they really didnt want to be there i left the theater and didnt hear anything but weeping from about 90 of the crowd alright lets look into the story hazel is a young cancer patient whos lungs dont work properly but doctors have given her an air tank to drag around and help her breath she goes to cancer support groups where she meets augustus waters a young philosophical man who lost his leg due to his cancer over time they begin to develop feelings for each other she shows him a book that she loves and he decides that he will use his make a wish foundation wish to let her meet the author of said book upon meeting him he turns out to be a drunk who wants nothing to do with them to make up for what the author did augustus takes her around amsterdam to see the sights and she admits that she has fallen in love with him the next day he admits that his cancer has returned with a vengeance and he doesnt have long to live hazel and her friend isaac played by nat wolff who actually does a great job in this rolewrite augustus eulogies before he dies so that he may attend his own funeral augustus sadly dies 8 days later and at his funeral the author returns to give hazel a letter that augustus wrote for her a very long and complex story gives you enough humor and tear jerking moments to keep lovers of the book and lovers of the romance genre satisfied along with that it follows the source material very very well john green himself said the movie followed his book very well they leave out little details but theyre all forgivable a movie that follows its source this well is a rare find these days but im very happy with the final result an a book gets an a retelling on the big screenwhat about acting people are saying shailene woodley gave the best performance and i wont deny that she did a great job portraying hazel but honestly to me the stand outs were ansel as augustus and willem dafoe as peter van houton the drunk author my guess is most males are going to say ansel was just playing the pretty boy role that anyone could do but honestly i thought he was a very enjoyable person to watch i laughed at all his jokes i felt myself welling up when hazel finds him slowly dying at the gas station willem dafoe also was very enjoyable to watch he makes a good drunk ill give him that one of the big surprises here out of everyone was nat wolff as isaac you remember him from the naked brothers band on nickelodeon that guy has really matured and grown as an actor and im glad its good to see child stars grow up to do good things the verdict is a faithful light hearted retelling of a great novel a solid 910 for me,sad
this movie is a really good movie that is sad and romantic shailene woodley deserves an oscar for an incredible role and plus ansel elgort needs a oscar too this movie is a romantic sad movie that if you go see it with your girlfriend to a theater near you hazel played by woodley is a sick girl who bumps in to gus played by elgort at a cancer support group and fall in love if you liked the notebook or any movies by nicholas sparks you will think this movie is excellent this is a oscar worthy movie that will possibly do really good and possibly win best picture is an amazing movie for everyone in the world,sad
not a good movie at all would be better off with way less money spent and be a wallmark movieits just a really bad movie about terminal teens falling in lovewith a twistoh wait totally saw it coming,sad
im not saying this is not a great movie i mean sure a girl is sick and all great storyline but its just too much there are tons of movies like that out there but somehow only this movie got famous and won awards i feel like it couldve been betterkind of a disappointment,sad
i had very high hopes for this highly acclaimed film after all a mature theme cancer starring shailene woodley to boot the girl from the divergent series what could go wrong right this to be precise gus jokes about his prosthetic leg and they meet and fall in love at a cancer support group because yeah theyre not falling in love are they it starts with gus accidentally bumbing into the girl he doesnt immediately pull back but keeps pressed against her thats your first clue that isnt love but teenage lust and severely lacking in subtlety at that then enter the session room the boy cant take his eyes off of her literally and mr swooney himself keeps glancing at her all the time even when she tries and break eyecontact she doesnt seem to mind from anyone uglier his behavior would for sure have evoked a metoo moment then they go outside and the boy keeps up his act heavily coming on to her again pulling out all the charm stopsat that point i was already too disgusted pun intended with the movie sure shailene woodley is quite attractive even with tubes up her nose but this was not supposed to be flick about pretty girl meets handsome boy was it and yet all the opening teenage lust ruins the premiss of the entire film for me as it uses cancer as a disguise for what turns out to be just two attractive people instantly falling in love read lust and that undermines everything mature about this film and only resoundingly underscores the shallowest message of all a pretty boy meets a pretty girl  despite their dismal circumstances masking it as something else if the girl had been ugly  or just mundane even  and theyd still have fallen in love that would at least have been something as it was though it was just shallowness with a halo,sad
the plot of this movie is amazing it makes you think one thing but is really another pipe shirt reference it is incredibly sad so prepare yourself beautiful but sad,sad
a boring movie from beginning to endpatients and young children fall in love with each other,sad
way ita too long  thing are happening very slow and it should be maximum 90 minutes im not understanding the goal and the plothow she and gus met ohh god classic and boring way  untill they arrived netherland it was good  but after that it start losing the wayi watched it with my fiancee so i had to pretend that im enjoying it  people this movie is bad  end of story,sad
is the saddest movie i have ever seen love sacrifice and hanging onto life were conceptualize through the sences of the movie,sad
really great adaption of the young adult novel enjoyed this one a lot funny and heartbreaking shailene woodley  ansel elgort are fantastic seeming very comfortable with each other and are addictive to watch you dont want their story to endwe follow them from their meeting in a cancer support group and through their whirlwind romance which takes them to amsterdam to meet the very nasty willem dafoe a reclusive and mostly drunk author of a book that has touched their lives ultimately this trip teaches both of them what it means to truly be alivewillem dafoe plays the bad man to perfection laura dern as the mother is great this teen romance felt very mature to me because of what theyve both faced worth a watch even if your not a teen but be warned youll feel kinda wrecked afterwards,sad
is one of the best movies ive ever seen its a love story of two teenagers attacked by a cancer hazel and augustus who met and fell in love at a cancer support groupon one hand the film make us discover the pain of cancer patients and the suffering of their families on the other hand it show us a pure love that go beyond all the difficulties of lifethe outstanding performance of the actors shailene woodly and ansel elgort make us feel the characters as if they were realthe soundtracks extracted by different fantastic romantic songs make the scenes rich of beautiful emotions the plot is very good written it transmits a lot of ideas of a pure love that goes beyond the limits such as an infinityi invite the lovers of romance movies to watch the film it deserves to see,sad
ill be the first to admit that romantic comedies are not usually my cup of tea but as a genuine cinephile i will honestly say that out of hundreds of the romcoms ive sat through when trying to accommodate a past present or future potential girlfriend i would come across some that were quite mesmerizing every now and then with that being said sophomore director josh boones romance epic is easily one of best films of 2014from its infectiously raw opening scene to an incredibly heart breaking ending director josh boones heartfelt drama is a magnificently endearing love story even though the film may seem to be only targeting teenage audiences by concentrating entirely on the lives of just two teenagers its a conquest for love thats remarkably original with a roller coaster of emotion elevating throughout all while including some of the strongest acting ive seen in 2014,sad
if you think that is just another teen romance are you infor a pleasant surprise youd better have a good supply of tissues because thisfilm involves two very special teens ansel elgort and shailene woodley are apair of cancer survivors and they just havent got very much timewith woodley shes come through cancer of the thyroid and she has the breathingapparatus as just part of her person now her parents naturally worry about over straining herself but woodley is determined to lead as active a life as shecanat a cancer survivor support group she meets ansel elgort who has really madequite a name for himself since this film came out elgort is a former basketball star who lost a leg to cancer he is so incredibly quirky and charming in thispart im surprised he didnt get oscar considerationthe two make a trip to amsterdam to visit an author they admire willem dafoe however has less than meets the eye still they have a good time whenthey visit the anne frank house the symbolism is certainly not lost on theviewerthe title is a play on cassiuss famous quote from julius caesar about the faultnot lying in our stars but in ourselves theres no fault here for woodley anelgort fate has dealt them a cruel and rotten hand and they have to make the most of iti havent seen a film move me as much since clint eastwoods million dollar baby even a medusa would be reduced to tears with this one,sad
this is the best romance movie that i ever seenyou cant live  if you dont watch this,sad

is a worldknown book written by the best seller author john green the movie was released after two years of the books debut in 2014 a lot of people may say the book is incredibly better than the movie and i will agree in some parts but the movie is actually a sweet romcom that will make everyone want to fall in love after watching itfirst of all the choice of actors was extraordinary they thought really carefully about how faithful it could be and tried their best shailene woodley and ansel elgort make the perfect couple as hazel grace and augustus waters their chemistry is tangible concerning the plot i had my worries about straying too far from the book but they just nailed the adaptation john green himself kept up with the recording of the movie and that says something about the truth of the moviebesides being similar to the book the movie is wellwritten and has nice photography in addition the scenarios are very beautiful and wellchosen also the soundtrack fits perfectly the kind of romantic and sad story that is being narrated and it makes you feel way more emotional about everything i thought about this movie a lot after leaving the movie theater and i couldnt decide if i was angry or happy about the movie being so good i know a bunch of people criticize a movie that doesnt have a complex and deep background but this movie is the perfect movie to watch by yourself at home on a friday night you will get involved with the lives of such innocent characters who believe in love and who can fight everything to have a little piece of itif youre wondering about the story itself i can tell you something to make you want to watch the whole movie so its kind of a simple lovestory except the main characters have cancer and theyre just teenagers which just make you more immersed in their universe other than that the quotes you get from this movie makes you want to go to your diary and write them down plus along with the heartbreaking love that hazel and augustus live together there are lessons about friendship and family and how it is great to be surrounded by people who care about you with all that in mind i think people will hate this movie or absolutely love it and id much prefer if they do love it maybe it is just another romantic movie but i mean who doesnt love romantic movies right,sad

so rarely does the universe align and everything fits in place for this one eventtfios has a great scripta director to watch out for and great performances from its castwho all have great careers ahead of them it might also be one of the most charming films ive ever seen how dare you say that about a film based on cancer well unlike its counterparts tfios actually has a brain and a heart and might just be one of the best films of the 21st century its not depressing but rather a story about falling in love and living each day to the fullest even if someone has a heart made of stone im sure it will be shattered as they watch this beautiful and moving story,sad
tone script  story i have watched the movie twice the first time was a long time ago i will discuss what i remembered from first time  first it was as if how two incompletes meet each other to build something which is complete what else i remembered from story did not show exactly same the second time it was as if hazel while attending the funeral explained how happy go lucky stud gus fell in despair in his last days i mean even the strong ones deteriorate while watching second time theres nothing like this instead what is shown apart from coming together is that they visit amsterdam to her favorite writer and spent some good time in short the funeral scene were as if got replacedapart from the story mentioned above what i most liked is how gus wants him to be remembered in world and how hazel mentions truly loved by someoneeven if the only person is more than enough as oblivion is inevitable i stand with gus on this one 45direction screenplay cinematography each of direction screenplay and cinematography is very good 45music music is very good as well 45acting acting is very good as well 45final verdict it is worth adding to your dvd collection 45 910,sad

familiar with imdb for more than 2years but this its the 1st ever i signed in myself to write a review for all those idiots who rated this movies below i cud have missed this wonderful romantic movie with all you 2 3 etc ratings u cud have watched lots of romantic movies with good ending or sad ending but only few movies ill leaves scare in your heart even after the movie this that kind of movie actually i dont wanna to blame those idiots who rated low cos love cant be buy or thought if have it inside u u ill definitely love this movie,sad
based on a worldwide best selling novel the fault in out stars made a severe impact with audiences and helped elevate shailene woodleys career to the next level fans of the novel having many doubts as to how the film would compare and share with the novel compared to the notebook this film is quite arguably better and features arguably better writing and refreshing performances from its leads shailene woodley and ansel elgort showing great chemistrya major reason why this film is as praise is due to the positive message sensitivity of the issues and characters and the authentic feel of the film in many romance drama teen films there are silly and over the top forced comedy and they come off as cheesy this film although deals with a serious matter plays out in a relatively lighter tone and it works featuring likable characters a clean and good pace is quite an interesting tale and better than one expected,sad
while watching this movie i got reminded of sadness from inside out  to really experience joy one also needs to go through some emotional troughs and boy i was feeling a wave of happiness running through my body with every passing frame of this movie and it was aristotelian happiness eudaimoniathe movie is based on a book of same title  its a tale of two teenagers both battling through cancer and how courageously they decide to put themselves out there  vulnerable to love and become wiser and stronger through their bond a charming and humorous narrative with big jolts of reality and it makes you cry i dont remember if ive ever cried so much in any moviethe characters are earnest and the soundtrack amplifies all emotions very eloquently but it also makes one feel really blessedone of the best movies ive ever seen,sad
this book touched many millions of teenage hearts around the world so its not surprising then that eventually hollywood came calling wanting to adapt john greens words to filmand its an honest attempt actually yes there are slight changes there has to be really but on the whole this is a well made and well acted film that will bring more peoples attention back to the book which is not a bad thing at allits not the best book adaptation in the world but it captures the message of the original and i have no doubt will become as belovednot bad at all,sad
is a film directed by josh boone based on the john green novel of the same name the first time his novel is adapted to a film now let me confess i am not a person who sees romantic films i would rather watch films of action genre even when i read a one line summary about the film i wasnt ready to see it because i thought it would be overly melodramatic but then many people said me its actually not that and when i saw the film i thought how wrong i was plot hazel and augustus meet at a support group and fall in love with each otherstory if you see the film in the very first scene only you get a hint at the ending of the film i actually guessed the ending of the film and yes i was right the story has basically nothing new in it the setting is little bit changed to 2 people who are actually battling for their life i also began to guess some of the scenes which is the only fault in this film but still i was feeling joyed and excited in every scene that i was seeing that is the magic of the screenwriters and directors they create a world in which you love to swim that is why the film actually caught hold of me even though i knew most of the scenes there are many things that differed from the novel but i will highlight the 2 which i thought were important 1 ansel died quite quickly in the novel 2 hazel forgives van houten during the funeral scene the reason i highlighted these 2 things is because i liked the way these two things were not shown in the film because actually the essence of the film quite dienow since i saw an extended version of the film i would actually give light on some of the scenes that was not in the theatrical version 1 the first would be the scene where hazel tells her mom that gus is ready to take her to amsterdam and after the scene they go to the doctor to ask for permission which she declines i guess this was quite important to show the care of the mother for her child 2 another one is toward the end where hazel takes gus to the hospital and on the way she recites the poem the red wheelbarrow this scene is too important as it tells more about how strong is the relation between gus and hazelacting shailene woodley is actually the main protagonist of the film she did an excellent job as hazel as the director had said once within ten or fifteen seconds of shailenes audition i knew she was hazel she held up her script pages and just her eyes were peeking over them i couldnt see anyone as more convincing as her i would also say the very same statement for ansel as augustus he too was very good william dafoe as the alcoholic author was great and the rest of the supporting cast too especially laura dern as hazels mother she killed it with the emotions as a mother whose child is sufferingfavorite scene i guess it would be the scene where hazel and gus meet after the support group session for the very first time then gus puts a cigarette in his mouth and hazel is surprised the reply to hazel in that scene was actually something that grasped and fascinated me a lotverdict i loved the film a lot as i said the only fault in the film is that i have seen things like these many times but still i enjoyed the film so i would give it a 910,sad
despite it being a cute movie whenever i read a book first the movie falls short in the book augustus is a charming and seriously witty guyand his relationship with isaac is hilarious the movie leaves out some of the most clever lines and replaces it withnothing its not a terrible movie but i think the script was a little flat and missed the essence of the characters described in the book i feel like they just blew through the entire movie too quickly like they were trying to cram it all in if there was too much in the novel to make a movie they should have picked some of the key scenes and developed the story around that rather than barely scratch the surface the book gave so much to work with im disappointed to say the least,sad
the fault in not in the stars but in the minds of this films creatorsi am not a fan of josh boone despite being pictured on imdb with a bob dylan tshirt his films are usually the equivalent of teeny bopper pop songs all sparkle and no soul he also uses the same formula for every single film its his little bag of cheap tricks which is as follows  1make sure your love story has a bit of death in it so that love becomes more important2 keep everything very superficial in terms of thoughts and feelings and instead just use clichs to achieve empathy3throw in as much of your own musical taste as possible because everyone should have to listen to your ipod when they watch your film4 set you pretentious melodrama in white middle class america making sure everyone is rich and good looking cos noone wants to watch ugly poor people crying thats just awkward and hey presto youve got a josh boone film but i wanted so much to have something good to say about a movie that sets out to empathise with people who are terminally ill but instead i found myself actually angered by this films approach to such a serious issue despite being diagnosed with cancer both of the main characters seem totally fine very happy and to be honest in complete denial im not saying this kind of movie should be a total downer but nor should it be a disneyfied dose of shallow distractionif that is the case however then we are left with a question of some moral implication namely does this movie make light of the kind of suffering and depression involved in diseases like cancer or is it simply trying to provide some light distraction my view was the former even as a film for teenagers a blanket whitewash of teeny charm axiomatic platitudes and pseudomorality is hardly a responsible framework of material for a film that supposedly aims to help lacking as it does in any sense of emotional maturity or intellectual depthi am glad however that they donated a large portion of money to cancer charities for that this film is forgiven but honestly show a boone movie to a struggling povertystricken member of any society who actually has real problems and youll have a riot on your hands if you want a serving of insincere and self indulgent sympathy then this film does the trick,sad
this is my first film review here actually i will not review much but just share my feelings and observations and the film very shortly1 the theme is poor a very clich subject to work on 2 the script is very poor many meaningless conversations 3 casting is poor characters do not match at all 4 acting is extremely poor you never get into the film as you cannot get rid of the feeling that they are only acting especially augustus and hazels mother and up to a point her father were very far away from being real also the mimics and the toning of the conversations were ridiculousi think high rating of this film come from teenagers which may be the target of this filmi gave a 6 to this film but i am too much generous i should say,sad
this was really not a very good movie  but i cannot say it was a very bad one either it did show some interesting things but it was still perhaps not worth itlet me start with the good things to begin with it really is kind of an interesting love story this is rather notable and i must admit it leaves me wanting because i am a 16yearold who has never had a girlfriendi appreciated some of the things said for example near the end hazels speech regarding infinity does provide some matter for thought augustuss metaphor regarding the cigarette was notably interesting as well thus i cannot say i left the cinema the same i enterednow for the bad things the whole idea of this love story is kind of clich that is one thing they meet in an unusual way she thinks hes a jerk but then somehow id like to know how she likes him and so onby the way what were the guys parents thinking about when they chose their names hazel and augustus reallyand then of course we could not have a good movie without having someone dying at the endfurthermore of course this film contains a few swear words which for me always decrease a films quality it also encourages premarital sexin all it has a few interesting stuff im not telling you not to watch it but it has quite some bad things as well you can watch it if you want but if youre like me do not expect much,sad
i had heard about this movie but i postponed the watching for months evidently i was afraid to live through another teen tearjerker without a differencewell my fears did not come true full particularly during the 1st half and very end where balanced approach pleasant performances incl a harsh one by william dafoe and some distinct shifts made the watch rather seamless plus for me a nice joy of recognition regarding amsterdam but then some typical americanisms appeared eg related to eggs and funeral rehearsal and when one started to guess the ending then it was not that catchy anymore at times even protracted in the anne frank house for exampletrue i realize that i do not belong to the target audience as well as i have never experienced respective issues in my environment but i often felt that the movie in question was made for attracting audience and making big money visvis eg 5050 dealing with related topic but as did not bring along insipid moments then strong 7 points from me,sad
many will likely disagree with my rating of and i am understanding of that this movie was recommended to me by almost everyone i know that had seen it in its opening weeks i was told that people couldnt stop crying and that it was the saddest movie ive ever seen now to be clear im sympathetic of those suffering from cancer and their families and friends i myself have had several relatives diagnosed with various types of cancer i also understand that being told someone very close to you is dying is a very difficult and sad situation again ive been in such a situation myself but despite my sympathy i cannot give this movie a good rating because of its layout i saw it as a nice romantic movie deserving of a 610 rating through roughly the first 12500 but then there is a moment in the movie where gus informs hazel of his condition being diagnosed with incurable cancer throughout his body this scene signals the beginning of a 30 minute sobfest for the rest of the film i personally dont enjoy watching people cry for about halfanhour the drawn out ending ruined it for me and dropped the grade two points resulting in a 410,sad
shailene woodley ansel elgort and nat wolff star in this movie that was the talk of the town this past year my friend in india became obsessed with the lead character so i finally got around to watching this off hbo go awhile back woodley who really impressed me with her performance stars as a teen cancer patient who meets elgort in a cancer support group they use the grant a wish program to get her to europe to meet the author willem dafoe of a book she is obsessed with and he doesnt meet up to her expectations oh such is life now i liked this movie dont get me wrong but i am only giving it a marginal recommendation due to how forced it seemed at times in fact i really just found the stuff with the author to be kinda forced willem dafoe great actor dont get me wrong but i thought the story of the two teen cancer patients was really enough to fuel this movie along and didnt really think it was necessary yes i know based on a book but thats just the direction i wouldve went with rising star nat wolff also stars as their friend who has his own set of physical issues to deal with,sad
dont bother just pass to the next reviewmy english is broken and unpolished your eyes were going to hurtso if you rate this movie a perfect 10 and a im going to give you my boo button silly enough to rate this totally overrated teen movie that depicted or should i say encourage underage sex also think about it without a consequence good way to get a herpes or unwanted pregnancyon the greener side i rate it 2 because it has a good message also for people who suffer from illness that love is possible overall 2 stars out of ten,sad
for me everything that is as high as a star or above is never a fault and thats what this movie have gave me the story might told about a terrible disease but isnt it the reason why we all have to pass it through first before a better life and i quoted the movie not your cancer story your real storywhen the midnight phone ring wakes your uneasiness up makes you wondering whether it ends your worst nightmare or brings that dream into reality then what comes after that you will be surprised and moved with what the young hazel and august have done and said to go through their agony togetheri give my 9 stars also to the musicians behind this movie especially ed sheeran and charli xcx for giving just a perfect dose of beat and young spirit it speaks beyond words,sad
i had never read the book nor knew much about the movie before watching but i just knew whom was going to die about 15 minutes in and that is the fault with this filmhazel is a girl fighting cancer and goes to a support group there she meets gus a very upbeat boy just 1 year older than her whom tells the group hes been cancer free over a year gus starts up conversation with hazel and the next thing you knew they are calling each other and spending time together a lot of their discussions center around hazels favorite book and what happened to the characters in the end hazel begins to let her guard down and realize she should enjoy her life till its overgus uses his special wish to take hazel to amsterdam to meet the author of her favorite book but everything ends in disappointment and at this time you already have guessed what is comingfinal verdict it was an ok drama but movies that try to feed on tragedy so people think they are good are not my favorite but if you like to cry definitely check out this movie,sad
based on the bestselling novel by john green and starring shailene woodley and ansel elgort is an occasionally poignant but contrived story about love and life the plot is really easy to summarize as it follows the basic ya formula of having two people who are quite different enter into a romance with each other the only difference and what i feel to be most contrived part of all is that both of them have cancer i wouldnt necessarily call myself cynical but this seems to me like one of the cheapest ways to get audience sympathy i suppose john green set out to write a ridiculously depressing tearjerker of a novel and for its target demographic it seems to have worked like a charm however i am not so easily swayed and this film didnt work on me the way it might work for others thats not to say it wasnt wellmade or wellacted because it is but the story felt deliberately constructed to get a certain reaction and in that respect again for me it failed neither one of the leads was particularly likable or interesting to me and some of the dialogue they were given to say felt odd and unnatural stuff i cant really picture teenagers actually saying i also thought that the voiceover was a weak point as it kind of gives away the endgame a little too early and removes tension about the main characters survival still it wasnt all bad i did enjoy the segment of the film in which hazel and augustus travel to amsterdam to meet the writer of hazels favorite novel an imperial affliction i wont spoil the cameo for those who havent seen the film but i enjoyed his character and the brutal honesty he portrays despite him being somewhat of an ahole i also did appreciate some of the conclusions that the film draws about the relationships we have with others and what we leave behind its just a bit sad that the film wallows in so much misery and selfpity to get there not having read the book and not usually liking this type of film i already know that this probably wasnt meant for me still i like to go in with an open mind and give certain things a shot especially when theyre generally wellreceived id hesitate to call this a bad film but i will say i didnt like it fans of the book will probably love the hell out of this but i was left mostly cold,sad
aww look at that aside from movies about graphic sex addiction and brutal rrated revenge tales involving hammering fools through the crown of their skulls i make room for the softer side the ones that might just make you feel all fuzzy inside and perhaps call for a box of tissues i love me a good tear jerker is what im saying and there wasnt a bigger waterworks show this year than the ones that happened at theatres showing did i crack and cry glorious man tearshazel grace lancaster shailene woodley is a young woman who has terminal lung cancer she carries a oxygen tank around with her everywhere she goes yet theres so much more to her shes really sophisticated she has a wit to her plus shes really pretty despite this fatal journey she finds ways to get the most out of the life she has left after much insistence from her mother laura dern hazel grace goes to a cancer support group meeting there she meets augustus waters ansel elgort or as i now call him the guy your girlfriend now wants he is also an excancer patient who unfortunately lost his leg to his sickness there meeting sparks a romance that we the audience watch and grow on and ill leave it at that because i want first time viewers to really soak in how this romance is toldplease check out my full review of on my tumblr link to that is in my instabio and let me know what you thinkwhat about you guys have you seen fault have you read the novel its based off of whats your favorite shailene woodley movie drop a comment and lets talk movies,sad
now when a film tells you its more honest than other films you can tell its full of crap just because it has a morbid premise doesnt make it anymore real than the rest of the teenage melodrama is painfully smug as it relishes in its idiotic quirks each one deserves a ferocious eye roll its manic pixie dream boy ansel elgort encapsulates everything wrong with its smarminess contrivances and pretence thank god the film got bored of him by the second half and were trapped with these two characters only offering us a laura dern or willem dafoe to look at occasionally i quite like its fantasies and it has a few decent moments where actual obstacles confront the characters without the film opting for easy solutions but theyre swiftly ruined by baffling decisions such as having an audience clap for their kiss in anne franks house when it isnt schmaltzy the film revels in its trivialities and indiscernible philosophies shailene woodleys conviction of the trite material is decent but the film has such an ugly production that theres little to redeem it above mediocrity510,sad
i just watch this movie and i really dont know what to say what to writei just know that this movie the love story that this movie is about is absolutely amazing inspiring and so heartbroken none of them deserved that disease actually nobody deserve that disease and this movies just show us how life is unfair but at least augustus and hazel had their little infinitei really loved this movie its my favorite love story so far id love to change the end of the movie but i wouldnt because this movie is the truth there is so many equal stories in real life and perhaps almost all of them end with a unhappy ending to me this movies was amazing beautiful in all ways,sad
the cure for cancer is still an exhausting search but the cure for bad movies about cancer has finally taken affect a few years ago jonathan levines 5050 changed the portrayal of and dialogue about cancer in movies fastforward to 2014 and the tv show red band society and this film adaptation of john greens are normalizing cancer in teenagers its a weird trend to highlight but if hollywood can start treating other taboo subjects the same way theres hope for film as a meaningful teaching tool yetbegins by essentially scoffing at pictureperfect love stories its narrator hazel shailene woodley a stage iv thyroid cancer survivor not even 20 years old warns us that this story will not have a happy ending shes right but that said you wont be blindsided by some nicholas sparks tearjerker move eitherhazel doesnt know her timeline but she knows her cancer is terminal she carries an oxygen tank with her everywhere she goes including a support group that she only attends to keep her mother laura dern and father sam trammell happy but its there ironically where she meets augustus or gus ansel elgort an osteosarcoma survivor with a prosthetic leg and an impressively positive yet realistic attitude about life both of them witty sharp and sarcastic hazel and gus become fast friends and their romance grows in spite of hazels best intentions to avoid falling in lovetheres a terrific sense of humor and approach to cancer in this script that even makes 5050 seem dated the characters are not defined by their illnesses but by their attitudes toward life the way they cope with the ups and downs hazel and gus are surprisingly mature for their age partly because theyre written so well but also because theyve been through a lot and ripened at a young age they still feel like teenagers though and thats keyscott neustadter and michael h weber writers of the outstanding 500 days of summer and the spectacular now nail it again with the chemistry between hazel and gus obviously much credit belongs to woodley and elgort but these writers know how to craft real authentic dialogue they so effortlessly evoke our own memories of love and lifes challenges at a young age in addition to creating compelling dramatheyve also got modern teenage relationships down pat theres just enough use of phones here to make texting a meaningful component of hazel and guss relationship but not so much that the movie is overbearingly contemporary director josh boone handles these scenes delicately and in a way thats true to those who have experienced romance develop through text but anyway these characters are in the business of making real connections after all theyve been through more hardship than a majority of kids their agethe movie is the story of their relationship which doesnt become a romance for them as quickly as it does in the audiences mind trained to know in movies when two people should fall in love we are conditioned to look for a first kiss scene well before it happens in this movie which reflects the inherent largely unspoken challenges of hazel and guss relationship as much as teens will gravitate toward this film its the adults  who know the heartbreak who know what teenage romance is like who would likely tell these two to be cautious  that will most appreciate the storys attitude toward love and relationships in a lot of ways could be a great film for teens and their parents to begin to have conversations about these thingseven though the opening narration insists that the story wont sugarcoat anything it doesnt mean its free of melodramatic twists that ratchet the drama and sadness up to 10 the approach to scene work and dialogue and characters is more authentic but the plot doesnt exactly follow suit in the storys defense however wed have a very boring film on our hands without something to really challenge these characters even if you might argue their lives have been challenging enough its still a moviethematic richness is another strength of its an emotionally deep and resonant film just in the way it handles cancer but it also presents difficult concepts and subplots that even further inform the core story when gus uses his makeawish to take hazel to amsterdam to meet with the author of her favorite book this seemingly tangential segment in their larger journey brings a surprising number of new layers and ideas to the story including the authors unexpected reaction and a visit to the anne frank houseis one of the films changing the way we look at major issues theres nothing politically charged about cancer but films wanting to approach anything from race to sexual orientation could certainly adopt some of the techniques here to approach those issues in authentic ways teaching tool or not its still a quality comingofage story right next to the perks of being a wallflowersteven cthanks for reading visit movie muse reviews for more,sad
i hesitated for quite a while before watching this movie exactly because of the great reviews it has been getting and because i have often been let down by highly rated movies but not by this one i then hesitated for a while whether i should write a review as i dont ever do but i have been so surprised by the mixed reactions to this film i decided i shouldthe script seems to be one of the big deal breakers for those who did not enjoy the film sure i too was at first put off by guss character and i questioned the likelihood of the debacle with the author however i do not feel the film can be said to have a nonsense unrealistic scriptno part of this movie can or should be taken out of the context of the fact that it deals with terminally sick teenagers who are played i think very very well by shailene and ansel their sickness is an integral part of their lives and so the anne frank scene for example made complete sense to me as her story forms in a way the answer that hazel was looking for cancer is an emotional rollercoaster and that is what the movie gave us happiness sadness laughter tears and frustration sidenote i lost my mum to cancer when both she and i were still far too young and i can recognize much of her and the course of the illness in this movie so i can only say i found the moviestoryline realistic and relatableim not sure i can call it a masterpiece or the best movie in i dont know how many years but i feel it was truthful its not a movie ill say i enjoyed watching but im damn sure glad i did it is worth seeing and it left me at least with something to think about,sad
i did give this a 10 and heres why this movie was real it was not faked and not filled with teenage fluff it touched me as a mother and a woman i wanted this girl who was given a horrible dose of life to love life experience everything that she could and be happy as a mother i saw what i would want for my daughter i would want her to love her hardest and die knowing what that felt like as i woman i want to be loved like she was this movie spoke on levels that most of us cant comprehend i have never been so sick that i have had to stay the night in a hospital i have never had to be rushed to the er by a loved one or have people terrified every time i call their name the person that this book was based on knew all of those things she may not have had a teenage romance before she passed but her memory will live on because of who she was the movie made a point to tell you that this was not an ordinary teenage love story but it was an exceptional one i hope when you decide to watch this movie you go in ready to let go of what you know about people and clichs and just be a part of hazel an gus be strong scared loving compassionate and vulnerable be so happy you have another day to be great and enjoy it,sad
in our current 2014 hollywood wasteland of an endless barrage of bigbudget superhero movies of which im a sucker for hollywoods other big obsession seems to be adaptations of popular teen novels earlier this year i was goshwowed by the spectacular now 2013 now ive just sat down and watchedi just needed a break from the bigbudget superhero movie hoopla you know was a perfect distraction until guardians of the galaxy 2014 is released on dvd tomorrow ive been eager to watch for some time now and let me say that i wasnt disappointed i knew what the story was about and wasnt disappointed by the final result i was thoroughly pleased by this teen love story that like a lot of teen movies of late invents its own language lingo and philosophical outlook on life as it goes alongadapted from the book by john green which i intend to begin reading later on this afternoon and admirably directed by josh boone tells the story of hazel grace lancaster shailene woodley and augustus gus waters ansel elgort two teenagers who meet in a support group for teen cancer patients gus is a survivor fully intent on living a life worth remembering but hazel is battling terminal stage iv lung cancer and knows that her time is finite after being granted a few extra years via an experimental cancer treatment  while being cared for by her loving parents frannie laura dern and michael sam trammell over time however hazel and gus develop a close friendship that gradually blossoms into a fullblown romance and somewhere in there too these two also learn to fulfill their greatest dreams and aspirationsone of the key reasons i was so eager to watch this film is because i have personal experience with the films subject matter  which is life with cancer i lost my mother earlier this year to lung cancer and in the remaining two weeks of her life which were spent in the hospital i visited her everyday and in her final moments i did my best to make it clear to her that she was the greatest mom her only 29yearold son could ever ask for this was something i hoped i would not have to deal with until much later on in my life but you never know what curveballs the universe is going to throw at you and ive moved on quite quickly and easily from the grief of having lost her so soon and so suddenlygetting back to the film of all the teen romance novels made into films over the last few years this is the one that appears to have struck a chord with me the most i couldnt help but feel that both hazel and gus are such strong positive characters  making the most of whatever time theyve got together and having no regrets about anything they do shailene woodley appears to have an amazing future ahead of her in the movies if only she can get past her persistent casting in adaptations of teen novels she was quite amazing in this picture as was her costar ansel elgort whom ive never heard of before but he was quite phenomenal in his acting performance here i admired his upbeat demeanor and humor and the way he was able to keep hazel on her toes constantly during the course of their romance but like life throws us a curveball an hourandahalf into the picturei knew that this movie was going to end the way that it did but i was not expecting the curveball it does end up throwing at us  its something that truly catches you offguard and comes straight out of left field and makes you think about the special kind of cruelty thats dealt by the stars to some people in this life but whats most admirable here is the way the two teens deal with it with hope and humor  rather than gloom and despairim glad that i had the chance to watch im sure im going to love john greens book right now im listening to the soundtrack which is also worthy of special mention here im not a fan of any of the artists on it  its largely mostly a mix of indie musicians ive never heard of with the sole exception of charli xcx and her song boom clap which i honestly cant stop playing  but it fits the film perfectly many of the songs came from josh boones personal music collection while others made themselves known over the course of the films editing process and i can find no fault with his choices its equally as amazing as the film that inspired themkeep playing charli xcxs boom clap like theres no tomorrow which is what im doing1010,sad
based on the novel of the same name by john green is a melancholic lovestory that is emotionally engaging  often heartbreaking and shailene woodley triumphs with a mesmerizing performancesynopsis two teens both who have different cancer conditions fall in love after meeting at a cancer support groupnarrates the lovestory of two illfated young lovers who find hope after meeting each other the romance between its sympathetic leads a beautiful narrative that is at times funny and at times depressing scott neustadter  michael h webers adpated screenplay blends romance with grief exceptionally well the pace never drops thanks to the strong writing material josh boones direction is sensitive cinematography is pictureperfect editing is neat performancewise its woodley all the way her subtly devastating performance merits an oscarnod ansel elgort supports woodley well he particularly stands out in the emotional scenes nat wolff is remarkably credible laura dern is lovable sam trammell is wonderful willem dafoe is terrific in a moody cameoon the whole packs in tremendous romance with emotional depth strongly recommended,sad
i have not in fact read the book so this review is based solely on the merits of the film on its own and i gotta admit its a fine movie sure the whole message of the film is a touch convoluted as it all starts with the whole speech about how this is not some overly romantic love story coated in saccharine and yet it kind of is at least it starts to be as soon as we meet augustus ansel elgort one of the savviest most perfect 18yearolds ever seen in cinema and yet that dichotomy doesnt really bother me because teenagers do that they think their sufferance is special unique and they draw strength from that it feels real that wayas a whole this is one of the most touching love stories ive seen in a while a lot of that is due to the phenomenal chemistry between elgort and shailene woodley playing the main character hazel you totally buy that these teens are in love and the movie wastes no time in getting them together starting the saccharine in some movies this would be rather disneyesque but here it seems more like a stylistic choice like they wanted to focus on the actual relationship instead of how it started and that relationship is very fine full of sarcastic humour snarkiness tenderness and some really good conversations its a romance you wont get tired of watching no matter your age or genderthe script is also very well paced the rest of the cast is equally talented the story contains enough joy and sorrow to reach you and as a whole its a pleasant way to spend an evening definitely recommended for all and now i kind of have to read the book as well,sad
size and scale fits all a romantic flick with an unusual drama definitely makes you start loving yourself and the near and dear ones more after understanding what can be the extreme situations in life not exactly 10 on 10 but a lot closer to that must watch cinescope well it could have been an usual story of teenage love between haze hazel and gus augustine who are studying  falling in love with each other and with situations creating some drama what if the situations are way too drastic than one can imagine so unfortunately both of them are cancer patients at later stages of the disease and knowing that they are not going make it longer the 2 hour movie traverses through the graphs of emotional lows and occasional highs in their lives or probably the efforts made by them their parents and friends to create those highs moves us inside out it is also about the very sensitive element of parenting the kids with such diseases and dealing with very delicate mindset of such kids its also about the caring the enthusiasm and the determination to realize self and others dreams during the curtailed span of life bfb bang for the buck a very apt title both the leads were played by very young actors shailene woodley haze and ansel elgort gus while shailene has potential to become the next jodi foster or sandra bullock ansel definitely is the next leonardo dicaprio even after knowing the movie consists of some traumatic situations youd watch it for their outstanding performances and for occasional lighter and humorous moments for their funny friend isaac played by nat wolf and a cameo by none other than william dafoe it takes time to understand the importance of william dafoes shabby drunkard and annoying character my high1 scene depicting the 3 ailing friends at guss prefuneral knowing his last days are nearing and then they speak his eulogies very unusual situation and very touching2 in the end when haze first refuses to take  read the piece of paper which she receives at guss funeral and then after reading the crumpled paper the emotions unfold for haze as well as for us makes us take a bow at the writing prowess and the award goes to screenesha speaks 1 both shailene and ansel have already received multiple awards at junior  certain levels they may even be considered for the golden globe  academy awards 2 john greens novel by the same name would be in the race at oscars for best story 3 josh boone the director may have his share at least for his nominationyo  u,sad
i like a happy ending in a movie and even though this one didnt end in the greatest wayso they live happily ever after obviously it was pretty enjoyingthere war great acting by young actors but not only them hazels mom mostly was very good at her part through her struggling to maintain a smile and stay positive and supportivethe start of the romance was a little clich but who cares it does not bother you at all it was nice and seemed natural even they are pretty young more teenagers than adults there was great chemistry an nice dialogsyou dont need to have always a part that the couple has to be in war and break up or have a big fight either they werent together for so long and the little fightargument that they had about gus being famous and all was enoughi liked the stars references too the text messages would pop star shapedthe speecheseulogies were incredible a big part of the film is sad but its just because it is realistic the parents knowing the chances for their daughter they are on alert every single moment but they give her freedom to enjoy her time as gus parents dothe vulnerability and fears of gus the cool guy felt pretty natural toodafoe was a little more cruel that he had too i think for no reason to treat the couple as he dideven that the movie has a runtime of 2 hours it fulfills this time with enjoyable moments and good scenes and i say that because many times i think some movies are longer than they should be and when you reach 2 hours you have to back it upit was as raw as it had to about the illness of the protagonists there was no need to fill the film with more moments of breakdowns and stuffto sum up sad but beautiful movie it touches you in a enjoyable wayand sorry for any mistakes english is not my native language 910,sad
i never crying to see any movie but when i watched it i can not check my tearso i can not finish it one time i was see it half and half its a really hurt touching and haven love from my seeing romantic movie hazels acting was awesome and gus was also not bad if director include some comedy scene in this movie then it will be more beautiful and people can enjoy with fun and laugh overall its my best movie love to hazeli got more laugh in the scene of egg thoughegg though is a different idea i never see like this item after seeing this movie i was suggest my girlfriend to provide to see it she were get more love to see it and she tanks to me to suggest it really she like it,sad
the director might be soaring after back to back success interestingly both the films dealt with writers but the main themes were romance hes just a two movie old and now the movie goers can expect eagerly for his next venture this movie was based on the teen novel of the same name about a 16yearsold cancer patienthazel grace who is battling between life and death is also a strong fighter against all the odds when her mother sends her to attend the group therapy she meets augustus water a fellow member as she is being sarcastic waters finds an interesting character in her a friendship develops and they spend more time together even knowing there will no future together the relationship progress and how everything ends is the restusually cancer themed movies are called tearjerker films surprisingly this movies aim was different of course emotion strikes but the story narration and character developments were the basic goal threefourth of the movie was well told story about teen romance the afterwards account begins with a twist which were portrayed in the usual manner like all the movies kept sentiments in the last part the last quarter was very predictable but they avoided clich as much possibleapparently the world is not a wishgranting factorythe parents role was kind of mysterious one that diverts viewer from their anticipation interesting it also creates some doubts compared to the previous movie the spectacular now shailene woodley looked completely different that means the physical transformed to look a perfect 16 year old was amazing her performance as well gives an impression that the hollywoods future academy award grabbing the female lead is on making at this rate she can do that like jennifer lawrence didas for the lead actor it is a good breakthrough and expecting the same result from his next movie as well this movie which runs over a 2 hour was smartly sliced the contents and organized those on the right spots many had agreed it was a fine cinema transformation from a book so you can try this but be careful because nowadays most of the teens movies are overrated because of the overwhelmed teen audience the warning meant only for the older people im sure the youngster will love this movie i mean most of them,sad
i really loved this movie not only because its romantic and cute and because i like augustus waters but also because when i watched this movie a lot of emotions came up there was laughter tears joy pain compassionthe story is about two people who have cancer but they still live to the fullest through all the bad things that happened to them they can still see the light in each otherim not going to say much more about the movie because i do not want this review to contain spoilersi just wanted you to know that this is a great film and you should definitely watch it,sad
i myself am not really into girly film with romantic story line this however upon reading the book which was an amazing and addictive read want to see the film as most time they do not live up to the book this however was amazing the strong characters and heartwarming strong line had me hooked the strong was by far the best if there can be cancer story about a girl hazel and gus that lived there lifes to the fullest and as long as the could the touching words and looks they gave would melt the hardest of hearts and make you realize we all only have one shot and life and we should live it defonetly a film that can be watched over and over without getting bored the book and the film are the same with very little changes there are lines within the film that you will remember and quote the rest of your lifedont not miss the fantastic film with the wonderful actors that told the strong hard hitting story so beautifully well done and this amazing film,sad
its about this beautiful girl with a terminal illness falling in love with a guy who survived the sameor is it the story winds around their quest to meet the author of their favorite book and how their love becomes stronger over time hazel played by shailene woodley gives an inspirational performance which i think was done marvelously and way better than ansel elgort who plays the role of gus the movie runs for more than two hours but you hardly feel it due to the emotions flowing around its a beautiful movie just like the nicholas sparks stories that we instantly fall in love with one of john greens greatest turned into a movie,sad
the first time i heard of this movie was on the front page of imdb where new movies displayed as in a showcase to be honest i am not a big fan of sad romantic movie so i decide to ignore it while today i was watching a video clip consisting of footage of billboard top 50 songs all of a sudden this song boom clap coming on my screen its hard not to be attracted by the music video for some certain reasons first of all that singer has a peculiar image then i find the song rather catchy so i watched the whole video for like twice and i criedi dont know why this happened listening to music was supposed to be amusing but i just couldnt control myself when i saw two young people hugging and kissing each other wearing a i am in love expression that can literally drown you in their face the second i saw the smile on their face puddles of tears coming out of my eyes and by that time i dont even know any plots of the movie just few seconds and couple of scenes in this film can make me act like this id better see what the entire movie can do the result is just as what i have expected i cried i cried so hard that my dad thought i was having problem with my upcoming test i havent cried so hard for a movie or anything for yearsthe last time i did this was when i watching hachi as i rememberedpeople all tend to be moved by strong and beautiful love no matter what kind of love it is sometimes it is the love between families like hazel and her parents sometimes it is the romantic love that hazel and gus shared frankly i dont buy things like true love however this movie one of the saddest one that i have ever seen really helped me regained the faith for finding a person who is there for you who can give you the best love ever the love you never ever dreamed of before the love and forever that only happened once in your life within the numbered days its the shield for you to fight while it hurts you with every breath you take as it said in the book pain demands to be felt i am in love with you and i know that love is just a shout into the void and that oblivion is inevitable and that were all doomed and that one day all our labor will be returned to dust and i know that the sun will swallow the only earth we will ever have and i am in love with you i bet i would cry every time i watch this movie,sad
everyone i have met who has seen this movie has done nothing but rave on how goodsad it all is so i gave it a fair shot knowing almost nothing about this movie before going in maybe thinking i might come out of it surprised so after watching it with all due respect to the people that like this movie in my opinion it isnt exactly the movie people are building it up to behazel is a cancer patient who has to spend basically the rest of her life breathing through an oxygen tube when at her support group thing she meets angus  a cancer survivor they fall in love they ask each other to read their favourite books and all that stuff soon they plan a trip to amsterdam to stay in luxury hotels eat luxury foods all to meet their favourite author and talk to him about the unfinished questions at the end of his book but maybe some bad news maybe on the horizon for hazel and angusokay my biggest problem with the movie is the first half basically it sets up almost 70 minutes of how hazel and angus are in love and how everyone thinks theyre adorable together no everyone and i told you about their trip to amsterdam it makes the characters unidentifiable i mean whens the last time you took a trip halfway around the world and stayed and ate in luxury places just to meet your favourite author and i dont think in any possible way does making out in anne franks secret room warrant an applause from everybody else visiting its stuff like this that just has me disconnect from them all i see from it is basically hey were setting up this fairy tale like love story now reality will hit them i just think it would hit harder if i connected with them and i never did at least not for half the moviebasically the movie picks up in the second half when angus reveals that he has cancer again and he doesnt have that much chance of making it out okay basically everything after this point is where the movie really picks up is it the sad movie fans are building up no but in terms of effective drama this movie does do well in this part i do have to mention that if you didnt like the performances of the lead actors i divergent then this movie does almost remove all doubt that it would be because in that movie they didnt really have defined characters plus poor scriptwritingthere is technical stuff that i can talk about but i have to mention that everything is standard stuff i mean the acting is good but thats only in the second half of the movie the cinematography while looking good in the amsterdam scenes is nothing really special what i have to say on this movie is that no it is not the sad movie people are building it up to be but for some part it does put across some effective drama,sad
someone did a great job over this film emotions emotions and emotions its hard not to get sensitive which is the whole pointit represents people dealing with serious illness and the audience tries to feel the way they do i think the actors are just perfect for both main characters they did a great job as their feelings were so believable the story line was very interesting as its completely different perspective of an illness than the way its usually presentedthe love story element of the film brings the idea of appreciating the people that are close to us as you never know when its time to say goodbye in addition to this this also gives hope to those who are seriously ill for love and to try new things even though the diagnosis is clearthe cinematography and sound in this film is great and it really appeals to the storyline as well as suits both characters in terms of their personal thoughts overall i think this is a very positive film to watch even though its mainly about cancer it tries to give hope and remind us that love is the most important aspect of our lives and this is what makes each individual full of optimism and happiness,sad
frankly speaking i dont have an appetite for love stories but reviewing art critically makes it somewhat bearable it may well be treated a caution for the fanatics of romance but if you intend to ignore the repercussions following you may be my wonderful guests for the postthe movie has actually won several awards but it is ironically only due to the fact that it is more practical than a walk to remember shailene woodley may look cute as always but has actually grown as an actor since her last flick spectacular now the movie lacks in the content but manages to engage you till the end quite intelligently it is actually the acting direction and music that works for the movie the target audience viewers is well served for the stupidity the awww or the epic class may want to abstain from speaking negative about the movie but for the person with average intellect like me wouldnti actually intend to make matters worse for you by rephrasing the title to the fault in our content and surely i would be advised soon that it is the one movie review that i should have never wrote like,sad
plot is widely known to everyone whether they have seen the movie or read the book having read the book a year ago i was prepared for the story but still had forgotten enough since reading to make some of it still a surprise to me i enjoyed traits of some of the characters ie van houten but found most of the characters a bit thin with not many layers however this movie does describe the idea and feelings surrounding death and illness unlike any other media i have seen before which is extremely liberating the character choice was spot on being practically what i remember imagining while reading it augustuss monologues are brilliant and his and hazels relationship is truly touching very good movie heartbreaking moments with some beautiful words and friendships but at the end of the day who doesnt like a dose of lovey cheesy moments,sad
i wasnt looking forward to this i thought it was going to be one of those pieces that make you feel guilty for being fortune enough to be in good healthit really isnt sickness and death obviously play a large part in the film when both the main characters are suffering from the affects of cancerbut mainly it is a story about relationships the chemistry between the main characters is electric and i found myself entwined in their story before i knew what hit me i think the target audience is younger ladies but i had no problem getting into itwell produced directed great camera work etcno action nudity or surprises here but some of the best character work i have seen for a long time,sad
ratings actually do not tell us the reality about a movie or a show and then they are subjective to me the braveheart is the greatest ever movie and i really liked robin hoodstarring rusell crowe but the film has been bashed all over the internet especially here on imdb and further more robin hood was not a box office charmer also so what all this did not stop me from liking the movieloving it and time and again watching it is an typical hollywood romantic flick with not many but 23 good emotional scenes like the one where gus tells hazel that his cancer is recurring and they are sitting on a bench in amsterdamthis scene was actually very good may be i had too high expectations from the moviewhich i shouldnt have id rate it a generous 65 though my ratings will hardly matter to it now,sad
i want to enter just the words i will keep with me from that film a metaphor is what keeps us going we should care less for oblivion we should enjoy a dayslong eternity we should daily force hope to be live everywhere inside us there are no untold stories or unspeakable fate we re just experiencing our lifetime scenario see that great film and you can decipher those words meaning this is a real breadth of life even when the expiration date is reaching out i havent read the book yet i started from the opposite side watching the film from the technical viewpoint is a well directed story keeping up the limits to avoid sadness overflow the actors were excellent,sad
i must say that caused a certain feeling on me that im not accustomed to since im still trying to figure out my emotional reaction to the film on one hand i enjoyed the story and the movie flows in a good way on the other i feel a little underwhelmed by the effect the movie was trying to convey cancer is always a tough subject especially at a young age as is the case in this movie in a way i related to the characters but didnt care enough to cry at the end unfortunately i have experienced one side of this disease as i saw my grandfather pass away because of it still this personal heartache wasnt enough for me to end up loving the moviein terms of execution i have no complaints as the movie is expertly directed written and acted shailene woodley  ansel elgort handle their roles in a great manner and make the romance more believable there has been some oscar talk for woodleys performance and personally i wouldnt mind seeing her nominatedi guess that by the end of this review i have decided upon my evaluation of the film so in the end i believe that a movie like is primarily a chick flick as its marketing strategy pointed out that however if youre looking for a good story and may or may not have had a personal encounter with cancer i would most definitely recommend this film speaking for myself i think its a nice enough movie to feel like you havent wasted 2 hours of your time yet ultimately the story failed to fully grab me in a spectacular emotional fashionrating 7510,sad
has its stumbles and problems but most importantly it is a movie that will speak to each one of its viewers in a very personal way and by doing so it will produce very different opinions this is due to the fact that the film treats its material in a unique way and to the movies merit it has the balls to say this is the way were going and were sticking hard to it by doing so the experience that everyone will take out of it will be very subjective because of this i feel it is very hard to talk about this movie looking at it soley as an art piece it touches thematics that are close to every human being and comes out victorious in its intent to offer a prospective from which each one of us can take what he or she wants and think about it meaning that as much as the film can be liked or not i contend that every judgment will be surely influenced by the relation that the viewer had with the films tone and the themes involved so if you were able to take something special out of it you will probably see the whole picture on a positive light if instead you didnt feel in anyway moved or interested youll probably see it on a total different light yet this isnt due in my opinion to the fact that the movie is good or bad but it is because it has its way of going and you will be either in out or mildly in on it however i invite you not to blame this on the artistry and to value the filmaking craft on a different level this doesnt mean that you must like the movie but only that i see two sides of judging it here and i dont feel like they should be mixedregarding the movies treatment of its story i believe that had the potential to reach the greatness of its similar 5050 but comes a bit short in that it most certainly touches equal emotional heights and curiously it touches them more frequently but other than banally having singular moments that will plainly take you out of it yet they dont count too much it has a subtle convenience about itself and tends to privilege sentimental storytelling over realistic storytelling i am not against sentimental storytelling everybody needs and loves believing in the fantastic reason why the movie doesnt fail by being sentimental but it clearly isnt what the film was going for that being more realism i didnt feel comfortable onehundredpercent in being carried away by the narrative in the first 45 minutes and this is probably due to gus character not the performance it didnt feel safe for me to give the story my suspension of disbelief in the start i truly believe this was the scripts fault yet most thankfully after the first act and a half this problem quickly dissolved and boy was i on board from there onwards the narrative had its problem but from the tone and the treatmentofmaterial perspective i was totally in the film has a very wide array of themes family love friendship disease death it could have failed so badly in its intent to touch on all of those yet the balance of every element inserted both in drama and comedy was astonishing the movie made me both laugh and cry multiple times it is so gutwrenching yet never stumbles in melodramatic or pretentious territory and manages to maintain a very noble intention and heart this culminates in the last 30 minutes which touch amazing dramatic heights and had a true impact on me hats off to all of the actors that all had their moment to shine and did so still maintaining a solid quality throughout despite some characters feeling somewhere and somehow unconvincing yet this didnt really matter on the whole because i found myself truly caring for everything and everyone and being involved connected and sometimes reflected by the people portrayed josh boone surely deserves lots of merit for the success of the movie his direction is very very solid and keeps everything going without having any really important stumblesyet nothing and nobody deserves the praise that shailene woodley deserves here i can now salefy say that she is the best actress working today alongside jessica chastain i will also go as far as saying that this performance is oscar worthy i truly dont have many words that can explain how much i loved this performance i might as well go on and just write a love letter to her instead of describing how wonderfully awed i felt by her frame after frame all i could think of was just how dam spectacular she was she is the reason this movie succeeds in every single aspect without a performance of this caliber you would have half if not less of a movie i dont know how to put in words how much i was riveted by this particular performance i knew she was totally brilliant before but this really was powerful i actually came as far as thinking that shailene woodley would really die its no spoiler we all know haezel has terminal cancer because of how convincing she was in the role i have rarely ever been affected so deeply by an actors craft and as superficial as it might sound i am honestly saying what i really thought thank you shailene for your acting talent this is the reason i love going to the cinemain the end hit the right buttons for me and resonated on multiple levels plus it had very deep emotional affection and in spite of its many minor incoherences i found myself totally won over this is one of the best of the year,sad
seeing the movie for the first time was so thrilling i was so excited to see it and i was definitely not disappointed it basically followed the book through and out although some small things did not appear in the movie shailene woodley was nothing but fantastic as hazelgrace although after watching divergent i was a bit skeptic about the chemistry that hazel and gus would have so i was definitely surprised as how well they both played i would recommend this movie to everyone it is a very beautiful movie next step up from the notebook  and especially for those hopeless romantics this movie would definitely be one to watch 3,sad
tells the story of two kids who are both recovering from cancer falling in love this could have so easily become a cheesy sentimental tearjerker like so many other movies featuring love and disease but the way the story is told is beautiful it is actually a very adult movie its smart funny and sad the script flaws effortless and leads you inside their story and the people around them all dealing with the aftermath of their disease in their own way shailene woodley and ansel elgort have a great chemistry together and they deliver every line perfectly well maybe only the sentence about the dragon carrot risotto being human that was a weird one and ansel elgort clearly had a problem with it they stay far away from being pathetic victims and give many layers to their characters also the supporting cast is making this story really work especially laura dern as the caring sensitive mother and nat wolff who gives a great comic performance as the best friend of gus the cinematography is beautiful for instance i love my hometown amsterdam and they did a great job showing the beauty of it this is the amsterdam i know so well and love so muchand of course the scriptwriters and the director did a fabulous job with this movie its not a cheesy sentimental tearjerker but man  did i cry i dont know the book and i dont think i ever will and i dont care this movie is beautiful and i will remember it for a long time,sad
very good movie  the movie is about two young teenagers hazel grace and augustus waters who are suffering from cancerthe movie is really emotional and inspiring and it would be really difficult for you to keep your tears in your eyesit is very well written i really like its dialogues pain demands to be felt and i saved my 10 these two really touched my heart i have rated 8 because somewhere in middle i felt the story could have been little short by 15 minutes or so otherwise i would have given a perfect 10so if you like emotional movies it is a must watch for you,sad
watching i noticed that i had experienced many emotions throughout the movie after every upsetting scene you think itll be over however it gets worse in the scene where hazelgrace shailene woodley is lying in bed asleep she gets woken up by her lungs failing her this is because she is suffering with thyroid cancer that has spread to her lungs she gets rushed to the hospital and wakes up in the icu alone she is then told that she doesnt have a brain tumour but her lungs had filled up with a fluid and they had to be drained augustus ansel elgort is waiting for her however hazel does not want to see him this is a heart breaking waterworks scene because of her rejection towards augustus and her almost dying the actors and actresses are a perfect fit for the type of film because i read the book and pictured how they would look by the way john green described them to be shailene woodley is a strong and talented actress you can see many emotions she has expressed in the film from her disease and however the love that hazel and gus share is unbreakable where the film is based on a true story it does mean a lot more to the audience as this is what does happen its not just some other love story its a life story i recommend seeing this film as it does match the essence of the book,sad
i dont know why but this kind of movie makes me feel good i guess it just makes me feel so fragile and we also need that kind of emotion almost all people wants to show they are strong but deep inside they can be broken too in such situation i just like how its true to show that pain is really an ugly feeling but it can make you feel stronger every time you surpass those excruciating moments in your life although it is based from the book i must say that the movie is great i havent read the book but i guess the movie made justice to the book i never liked reading books until just recently i started to read a fiction novel and im liking it and i might read tfios book too because of this movie still i love this movie i thought im not going to like it the phasing is okay and not boring unlike other sad love stories,sad
let me start by saying i have not read the book i only saw the movie my review is for the movie this movie was sad yet happy tragic yet joyous dark yet light ugly yet beautiful harsh yet tender i know that sounds crazy but its true and this is why i loved it it was real yet had the essence of a fairy tale i cried smiled laughed and i felt so much emotion it was a deep movie two stand out scenes spoiler if you have not watched it so stop here if you have not seen it the end when they showed that he snick into her hospital room when she was sick and they read his letter and showed the flashbacks that touched me 2nd stand out scene the way he looked when she read his eulogy so well acted and touching this movie touched me i love that its not your typical cancer story or pity party it was told with such truth you can bare this movie the casting was perfect they both shined bright like a diamond in their roles very good acting for such young talent,sad
i love this move im gonna watch it all over again it reminds me so much about my hight school time being me again living in novels and romances im living in happy life but still getting old suck because i would to go back to that time again its a love story but not like every other love stories its funny dark and also touching i found a great feeling which i had such a long time ago in this movie everyone want to be remembered everyone want to be something special but i want to be the special of only one thats enough isnt it this movie gonna be kept and i will review it to my child as one of the beautiful love story thank you for such a great story huong,sad
the film has gained a lot of popularity among the young audiences the reason is obvious the agony of young star crossed lovers depicted through few emotional sequences to be fair the film doesnt create the flair of a nice melodrama perhaps due to lack of a better script the characters somewhat dont appear sympathetic which they ought to be however in certain instances the film does work and particularly the performance of heroine overshadows the heros role which unfortunately doesnt look very natural nowhere the signs of disability or the affliction appears in the heros character the biggest flaw in the script of the film was its failure to depict the dreadfulness of the cancer they are ongoing which makes the film appear not more than a feel good time passer the affliction of the disease and their scorn or desire with life doesnt just come in this teenage romance only the sequence shot in anne franks museum catches the agony of the protagonistrating 15 stars out of 4,sad
i recently saw the chick flick made in 2014 it was directed by josh boone and stars shailene woodley and ansel elgort who also acted in one of my favorite movies divergent however it received a lot of good and bad reviewsi think that the story was predictable but it wasnt but my friends werent impressed by it they say that all the movies like this have a terrible and upsetting endingthe protagonist is hazel grace lancaster a cancer survivor of 16 years old her mother decided that she was depressed so she took her to a cancer support group where she met augustus waters a 17 years old a cancer survivor also who has a prosthetic leg then a love story begin full of trust hard times laughs and adventuresi think that the performance of ansel augustus waters was fascinating and shailene hazel grace is a fine actor and the perfect complement to anselsome of my friends said that the movie was hilarious and i couldnt agree morein conclusion isnt just a chick flick its also a thought provoking because it teaches you to appreciate what you have for example health my friends and i totally enjoyed the film and i would recommend anyone to see it,sad
i found this one on dvd from my local public library it is a good movie although it has a few too many very slowmoving scenes it deals with teenagers with illnesses that will likely take their lives all too sooni became a fan of young shailene woodley when she was the lead in that teenage tv series in 2008 she is a very pretty girl who also looks very innocent while she might not have looked rough enough for the role in divergent here she is perfect as hazel who has been fighting a type of cancer and weakened lungs so much so that she has an oxygen machine with her everywhereyoung actor ansel elgort is an interesting pick for her love interest in their last movie he and woodley had the role of siblings in divergent here he is gus a cancer survivor with an artificial right leg hazel and gus met at a support group meetingthe focus of the story is hazels seeming to accept her fate and not understand all the fuss everyone else is making particularly her parents laura dern as frannie and sam trammell as michael but her meeting gus causes her hope for the first time he falls in love with her and she eventually with him even as she does not understand whyan interesting development involves willem dafoe as van houten hazels favorite author gus corresponds on her behalf resulting in an invitation for her to travel to amsterdam to meet him it is there that she achieves the clarity of her purpose and lifeit is a sad and yet uplifting movie at the same time,sad
oh my god its rarely happen you see a movie and have this urge to share it with the world or everyone you meet its another such great act you just cant afford to miss itthough you find some odd reviews in imdb about the movie and that to for a people who dont own a heart but for rest of us who has heart which can feel the emotion and respond to it this is kinda movie which evoke every bit of emotion in a very subtle mannerthe characters are so full of life and true to life that you feel you with them all time of the movieand as famously said by augustusits a thing about pain its demand to be felt and boy o boy its felt a ton along the coarse of movie moments you just cant help with your teary eyes waiting for that unbearable moment when one of the character left us and it inevitable and you knew it from beginning but you cant stop it or reverse itall and all a grand movie for the year and must watch for everyone who possess some heart at least,sad
i am a huge fan of john green and have been a nerdfighter for a number of years now so when i heard his book was going to be made into a movie i was ecstatic i read a few months before watching the movie and i can assure you there is no detriment to reading the book before viewing the film oftentimes movie adaptations will gloss over important plot lines else otherwise slander the books original story yet in this circumstance the book and the film are both so elegantly portrayed either one is a pleasure to partake of if you have already read the book and thus know what to expect i would still recommend a pocket full of tissues as this film packs a powerful punch,sad
first of all i just wanted to say this movie portrayed the true love between those compatriot shailene woodley acted very well in this movie she was perfect as well as ansel elgort i think the director of this movie did an excellent jobthe location was so good for capturing good sense for the audience of this movie i didnt read the novel but this movie gives a clear sense visualization and its awesome this movie felt lengthy to me cause i think dialog of this movie is not that much feelable script of this movie can be better but overall the movie seems okay to me the feeling of love between those young people just remind me why dont i love deeply rather than widely in my teenage,sad
there are some songs just say i love you there are some songs make you feel the love this movie is doing the first one in the movie there are many scenes were supposed to be really sad and i am usually sensitive about those scenes however forget the tears i didnt even feel sad at all if you do things right you dont need to burst in tears to make the audience sad even a look would be enough they said thats the thing about pain it demands to be felt well im sorry but i didntfor the ones who dont agree with me i recommend to watch my sisters keeper and dont worry im fine french moviei gave 4 stars because at least i was able to watch the whole thingcheers,sad
this is the first time that my emotion move and goes on with a movie i rate a lot of movies but this is the first which get 1010 i love you director  love you story writer love you all who work on this movie okay this movie take me a long in my life walking into it scene by sceneall the love for youplease go and make some good movies like itits alright have a bad scenario like all sick are young but i can forget this onei will share this movie with kind words to let all watchthank you who support cancer sick people,sad
this is my first review and guys its worth itthis movie made me realize that my problems are soo small as compared to the problems that people like hazel and gus face i mean they knew that they would die and i was wining about the crush of my life rejected me shailene woodley made my eyes numb with her acting skills and really pulled it off its only because of her that i was so into this movie awesome movie its worth it and god i am in love with shailene shes really beautiful the movie is quite slow in the beginning but you would thank me when you watch it its also a treat for romantic people to see the love that blossoms in the movie and they looked really adorable,sad
i rate this movie right up there with susan sarandons step mom make sure you have plenty of tissues up your sleeve i for one shed tears of happiness and heartbreak during this amazing movie this storyline is close to my heart and seeing the cancer journey through someone elses eyes always puts things in greater perspective the story of hazel grace and augustus waters takes the viewer on an emotional roller coaster the feelings and attitudes towards life and love the two share we are lead by an amazing cast of actors who are acutely sensitive in their portrayal of personalities and emotions each showing their unique way of their part in the process the parents the friends support characters all showing a variety of emotions and opinions in what would be a devastating journey for all concerned this movie is a reminder to us all that each person is different in their views and they way they deal when facing a terminal illness,sad
amazing movie i was amazed with this movie because it shows that life can change at a drop of a dime you never know what can happen to a loved one until they are gone this movie inspired me to make sure i tell my family that i love then every single dayy and dont forget too because like i said one day you could get a call saying there goneamazing movie i was amazed with this movie because it shows that life can change at a drop of a dime you never know what can happen to a loved one until they are goneamazing movie i was amazed with this movie because it shows that life can change at a drop of a dime you never know what can happen to a loved one until they are gone,sad
i read the book in about 6 hours a few weeks ago loved it couldnt put it down i did not have high hopes for the movie when i rented it tonight watching a movie after reading the book almost always leaves me disappointed im glad to say im not disappointed at all ill watch it again tomorrow my husband and i laughed cried and cried some more i just could not get over the chemistry between shailene woodley and ansel i really thought it would be strange seeing them together romantically right after playing siblings who hate each other in divergent i wonder how that will play out in the divergent sequelsthis movie was just great,sad
i didnt read the book nor did i really want to watch the film but i was pleasantly surprised with it and i never got bored i also liked all the characters and cared about them always a big thing when you care about the main charactersits a love story no doubt about it it was an interesting take on young adults who have cancer i think some people need to realize that we take a lot for granted the little things we complain about in our everyday lives are so minuscule compared to the things others go through yes i know this is a work of fiction but there are real people out there dealing with the diseases these characters have to deal withshailene woodley does a very good job as the main character and i for one believe she will continue to get better as she grows older the chemistry is there as well with her and the love interestoverall its a good movie but a bit depressing so i probably wont watch it again,sad
id hardly know where to start without giving away spoilers even after this long there are those who have not seen the movie  or read the book the film does a marvelous job of bringing the book to the screen with its themes and viewpoint intact for that the filmmakers deserve much praise the production values were high the direction tight and on target and the locations sets and music complimented rather than distracted it goes without saying that the acting was talented and spot on to begin i especially liked laura dern shes always good but i especially enjoyed her here she reminded me exactly of some of the cancer mothers ive known and she did it with dignity and grace thank you ms dern i cant comment on the part played by sam trammel i cant because his character is me i should mention that unfortunately for me this subject matter was a bit too close to home once youve been down this road the world can never look the same again that has to bring me to hazel grace and the young talent who played her shailene woodely ms woodley gave beauty sensitivity dignity and grace to the most difficult of characters i could give in to my ceaseless grief and anxiety and say something meanspirited about her performance because after all shes actually healthy and strong and is likely destined for a long happy and successful life how could she possibly begin to grasp the gravity of her character and the alltoreal physical pain and mental anguish that her character had to live with every second of her life but to her great credit she pulled it off at least she did for this filmgoer and thats enough of an accomplishment for her young life im glad i didnt have to cut her any slack she had that line as taunt as it could be the real question left for this film then is if they did right by all of the very real hazels and gus out there in the final analysis they did as much as could be covered in the short flash of time that is a film its perhaps all most audiences could take as well it was very hard for me to sit through as it was had they struck a mark any closer to the source i dont think i could have lasted the film my own familys experience was far worse than this my oldest daughter had a brain tumor the same kind as john travoltas character in phenomenon i guess thats ironic in some way the only good thing i can say about that is that she very quickly lost the ability to understand what was happening to her another irony is that patients like her were mentioned in the book this film was adapted from it said  her brain cancer was of the variety that makes you not you before it makes you not alive that was the sole blessing in it a perverse kind of mercy but enough about me see the movie its bound to give something to each one who sees it if it does do yourself a favor and read the book it is better than the film  all books are,sad
this is the first review i have ever written and i thought this film was enough to make that change i have read book it blew my mind i was sceptical about the film whether it would ruin it for me and how the book touched me but i was wrong this film physically made my heart hurt it was utterly beautiful i think the actors were perfect for this film it was hardly altered from the book so it did not ruin it im a hopeless romantic any day of the week but this film is more of a reality to the perfect love which is even better for any romantic out there i have personally lost many family members to cancer and even though the medical terms are fictional the relationships the heart break the day to day suffering is real so for me this film did it all its powerful its beautiful and most of all its touching for anyone wanting that perfect heart warmingbut heart wrenching film all at the same time this is a must watch,sad
i really liked  its more than just a 2 hour time you spend watching in fact it is a whole life experience summoned up in the movie the whole scheme is so uplifting even it is hard to resist crying in some scenes the main points i think it caught my attention are the following 1 when hazel replied to gus in the support group when he said that his greatest fear was oblivion to tell him that all people is going to die someday and no one will remember cleopatra or mozart really tells you how she not even think the way most of dreamers do and that she is humble minded yet so wise to know that difference2 the restaurant act in amsterdam shows the very opposite yet corresponding way the couple think like they close their circle together they complete each other he would believe in afterlife because its the point of all this lifethats how he proved his belief towards what happens when u die and life ends on the contrary she always asks why should even be a point of life why should it be linked to a truth anchor to tell you how you did back when you was alive3 when they met with van houten and he told hazel that she is childish wanting to know what will happen next is really the best way to show that those sick children in front of him are only physically sick but their minds are not on the contrary he us healthy but with sick mindindicates that those sick dreamers wont live along us for a long time because they are so pure and heavenly fiction minded that the writer of the novel himself cant find the end of an importancemaybe because its his daughter also4the way gus keeps pushing hazel forward seems like she is going to die and his lost leg is not an issue as her lungs thingsooner you realize that he is the doomed one and she is way too healthy compared to him5 the paradigm shift gus has realized that you should be remembered and loved by only one not millions but deeply not widely  so he learned his life assignment and knew she was right from the very beginning that explains why he already died it is a life changing movie that can replace so much pain and experiences by just realizing the very simple fact yes you should be remembered  but only by the ones who you love not millions because after all we are doomed,sad
i had only known about this movie having seen john green talk of it he wrote the story though i havent read it i read an article saying the book had been banned all to unfortunate i just want to say that i think these are the kind of stories that should be enforced not revoked this movie is captivating in that you want to just watch but instead youre held closely cozy in the web its riveting because its so simple but induces your conscious the grade was peaceful the dialogue was written for the story not the moment this movie just does it for me im not good with descriptions but this story is told very naturally and i think its best had on a nice winter night by a fireplace with a window cracked emotional intelligent sensible contrasting subtle honest a great movie,sad
plothazel shailene woodley has cancer and may die of it the prospects dont look great her mother laura dern is worried about her and thinks she is depressed because she keeps rereading the same book so she instructs hazel to go to a cancer support group during the course of a meeting she is introduced to gus ansel elgort and isaac nat wolff gus makes a pass at hazel who looked intrigued by the offer but not all together moved by it slowly gus is successful in winning hazels affections after agreeing to read her favorite book it is after this time when hazel confides in gus that she tried to contact the author and was unable to get a reply later when gus tries contacting the author he gets an invitation to meet the author himself at his home in amsterdam hazel is delighted in having the opportunity to talk to her beloved author in person and discuss what happened to the characters in the story she was reading after the book was finished only she doesnt know if she can make the trip because her doctors told her she is too sick to go and her mom told her they might not be able to afford itcharacter developmentthe impressive trend of this film is that the whole cast goes through a transformation of one kind or another and unlike a great many films this films timeline leaves room for that to happen the two leads spend much of the screen time with one another and slowly build a relationship an interesting element of the storytelling involves superimposing textting messages and emails onto the screen instead of having the audience read over someones shoulder and then there was a tender moment when the couple picked one special word they would use to signify their loveactingimpressive acting all around though nat wolffs character was at times very irritating but i dont know how much of it is the actors fault and how much of that is the writing i think it could swing either way most likely something that the director josh boone could have squared away if he had the means i also thought that sam trammells character was underutilized but that would be another problem with the writing he had a couple poignant little scenes only it wasnt much he was left behind a great deal of the way willem dafoe was another actor that was underutilized though that had to do with the fact that he was given a small role i know it is said that there are no small roles only small actors yet the honest truth is that he had a small role and he did the best with it that he could and he did show some growthoverviewthere are a few unforeseen twists along the way that keeps this rather weepy tale from getting stale and they all work within the logic framework of the story and are quite clever in their design nothing can be taken for granted here and about anything could happen one thread of the story goes one way and just when you think it has run its course it continues along the same path in the next scene generally i was entertained for the most part yet there were moments and some unpleasant stretches of time that began to lull a bit too much or irritate i could definitely notice this awkwardness because when things began to fall into place in the end and i could feel the difference in the storytelling the energy was palpable when they made the effort,sad

in what some may call the tearjerking film of the summer based off of the best selling novel hazel grace shailene woodley and augustus ansel elgort take us along side them as they endure their emotional and heartbreaking journey hazel whos history of cancer has left her lungs weak now supports a new fashion accessory of an oxygen tank much like augustuss prosthetic leg he was given from his cancer when the two young and naive cancer patients meet at their weekly support groups augustus instantaneously falls in love with the sarcastic and smart ass character played by woodley the writers do an amazing job of making the audience connect with the movies in more ways than one this unconventional love story portrayed by these two characters is one that is unfamiliar to this genre of movies completely original and dramatically unlike any other love story it leaves you fighting back tears one moment while suffering from a gutwrenching laugh in the next all the while feeling the same pain that the characters on the screen display when hazel suffers from taking on a flight of stairs you see the pain and struggle within her while seeing the love augustus has for her as he stands by her side it is truly interactive in the sense that these actors have done such an extraordinary job in making the audience experience the aura and ambiance this film gives off the actors behind the screen play a huge role in why you may find yourself relating the story to your own life as well perhaps the circumstances are not as severe but the principal of being able to fight for yourself and the ones you love is not a foreign idea the way woodley plays hazel so naturally and effortlessly in the film makes her engaging us as an audience automatically are overcome with empathy and sympathy elgort plays the approachable and charismatic augustus and he undoubtedly does the character justice he draws you in with his clever wittiness and his ironic comments such as  hazel grace itd be a privileged to have my heart broken by you while maintaining the image of prince charming what girl wouldnt want to hear that rightthe script that was made for this movie is one that cannot be matched some may be hesitant on seeing the movie because they may have fallen in love the book so much but surprisingly it pulls the lively and alluring chapters directly off the page and on to the big screen to be able to match the tone and atmosphere of a novel in its follow up film is something remarkable and very hard to accomplish the amount of voice and detail that was put into the script is something that should not go unnoticed i applaud the writes actors editors and directors of this film because it was truly one to remember they allowed us to step inside the movie along with them and fully connect with every scene it truly is an eye opener and makes the audience wonder about many things as augustus says you dont get to say if you get hurt in this worldbut you do have some say in who hurts you,sad
fault in our stars is a quite remarkable film if only for the stunning performances of shailene woodley and ansel elgort in the leading roles as two teenagers suffering from terminal cancer there might have been a temptation to sentimentalize this story in the manner of love story 1972 but director josh boone manages to create instead a story of remarkable poignancy while remaining aware of just how destructive the awareness that one has cancer can be its often difficult to explain to nonsufferers the effects of cancer not only physically but emotionally despite the well meaning intentions of her parents laura dern sam trammell hazel woodley cannot really communicate her true feelings to them she is not simply an ugly duckling whose illness renders her somehow different from her classmates she is a living breathing person who wants to be regarded just like anyone else the fact that she has an illness is irrelevant in the limited time she has available she wants to live life to the full this is precisely what gus elgort and fellow cancersufferer isaac nat wolff understand and hence the three of them become almost inseparable when hazel and gus are together they not only gain strength from one another but learn how to treat the world on their own terms and not necessarily listen to their parents boones handling of these sequences is quite brilliant especially the sequence where the two teenagers hug and kiss in bedin the end however the realities of cancer leads to a sad ending but is it really sad according to a noncancer suffer it might be considered as such but to hazel it represents something else something intangible she might experience severe emotional distress but that experience gives her a renewed faith in life cancer requires people to rethink their lives and try to approach each day in different ways to reconstruct themselves and to become more mindful of the world around them this is what hazel manages to do which is why we feel so supportive of herfault in our stars is perhaps the first movie i have seen to approach the experience of cancer in a way that noncancer suffers might understand it is a groundbreaking piece if it could be shown to anyone and everyone who has encountered the disease it might change their lives for the better,sad
firstly i am not one to ever right a review for a movie so me actually doing this is sort of a big deal before this movie i thought it was going to be one of those teenage love stories that are usually an epic fail but i was wrong this movie was a lot more than a love story it was a true outlook on how cancer can play its scary role in a teenagers life hazel and augustus did so much more than show me a short but amazing love story hazel despite her illness was still a normal teenager and that augustus he was everything but normal these two have really inspired me and touched my heart i would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a different view of life because it sure changed mine it wasnt hard to rate this movie a 10 and just a tip make sure you have a box of tissues near you trust me youll need them,sad
contains spoilersis life worth living even when we know death is around the corner does life need to have a transcendental meaning to be meaningfulthe wonderful motion picture attempts to answer these timeless questions by focusing on the love story of two terminally ill teenagersteenage love should be filled with the joy and exhilaration of knowing that the best days of your life are ahead of you neverending romantic evenings marriage parenthood and aging in the comfort and warmth of each others care it should not come with a time bomb that says that all of a sudden either you or your lover will die at a few hours noticein the case of hazel and augustus madly in love yet hopelessly ill with cancer the question is why should they invest in their relationship if they live on borrowed time heck why should they really invest in anything at all the more they attach to life the harder it becomes to let go of itaugustus is obsessed with leaving a legacy with being remembered through the annals of history hazel isnt able to engage wholeheartedly in any activity and spends each day simply going through the motions as she puts it at the beginning of the movie depression is not a side effect of cancer its a side effect of dyingby finding each other the two teens discover that love can bring meaning to both of their lives no matter how shortlived augustus understands that he doesnt have to be a mozart or an einstein to have a life worth living that doesnt need make his mark on all humanity to feel fulfilled his legacy will be treasured by hazel by his friends and his family thats all that matters on her part hazel discovers that love can fill even even the shortest life with meaning and can make every last minute worth livingthe movie is filled with memorable amazingly touching scenes perhaps the one that resonated with me the most is the romantic fivestar dinner in amsterdam complete with bottles of champaign and the chefs full selection of delicacies hazel and augustus savored every last bite every last drop of champagne and every last instant of each others company for one night they forgot their existential plight for one night they were able not to think about what awaits them around the corner about never being able to fulfill their dreams of being a normal young couple what is so touching is that their tragic circumstances forced them to grow up very quickly to go through the various phases of their relationship in fastforward mode you usually dont have a candlelight dinner at sixteen in a dark suitlong gown overflowing with champagne but then again you are not supposed to be terminally ill at sixteen eitherthe message is inescapable and i think the analogy with ann franks death  which the movie pointedly makes  is not far fetched ann was able to find love and beauty up until the moment she died hazel and augustus had that same strengthhopefully we too can abandon our own delusions of leaving a legacy of some consequence to humanity and focus instead on leaving a tiny  yet infinite  legacy to those that really matter in our life however few hopefully we too can learn to appreciate every minute of our life however inconsequential and ephemeraltwo quotes come to mind for the world you may be nothing but for someone you are the world anonymous it is more noble to give yourself completely to one individual than to labor diligently for the salvation of the masses dag hammarskjold,sad
stuck in my sights since the huge success of book i could see it everywhere i go and i love bookshops frankly book cover is truly original and catchy but im not really into these teenage dramas and never read it however i did consider watching film because of two leads talented and beautiful shailene woodley and newcomer ansel elgortgolden globe nominee woodley the descendants plays a girl hazel grace lancaster with thyroid cancer whos been diagnosed of disease in early age and since then her life mostly happens in between home hospital and support groups while elgorts character gus is an ex basketball player cancer survivor with an amputee leg as they meet at the most boring support group meeting their friendship gets a weird and interesting start that turns into unconditional love whatever it is even from the very beginning we all know that this is not going to work because any of them can just die and leave another behind gus and hazel knowing this are truly having the moments of their lives making all their dreams come true which includes trip to amsterdam  a place where the author of hazels favorite book livesis a pleasant movie to watch and mostly because of main characters and actors hazel grace and gus are the most real people among other hundreds of teenage dramas they are real with their problems personalities aspirations the way they love etc shailene and ansel manage to just fit the bones of this couple and turn their personalities inside out  making them easy to read understand however good parts of writing does not go further since the rest of story is just another a walk to remember hence it does not bring much new to the table the end is predictable it says nothing newid say shailene woodleys performance is surprisingly good surprisingly because does not seem one of those movies with brilliant acting but she makes her character so nice so good to know so perfect to watch that i can not resist thinking that shailene actually was great here hazel grace has some emotional breaks a lot cries drama fun laughs and woodley deals with this huge palette of emotions quite impressively ansel elgorts portrayal of her sweet gentlemen boyfriend is no less good he to the contrary is more fun not dramatic easy goingsince fails to deliver something new extraordinary or refreshing its a nice one time watch film with impressive performances that is not going to be remembered too long,sad
by all rights this shouldve collapsed under the weight of its many tragiromance clichs and conventions but despite its worst efforts at timespretty sick people characters who are bursting with wisdom and always have just the right thing to say an on the nose emopop soundtrack that kicks in at just the precise momenta pair of fantastic performances ultimately prevail to make the fault of our stars a moving winnershailene woodley and ansel elgort give performances that deserve to be recognized come oscar time their chemistry is something special and they absolutely lift this movie up on their shoulders and carry it the supporting cast is also strong particularly laura dernmanipulative sure clich oh yeah moving absolutely,sad
this film is really amazing i havent seen a real drama film like this in my whole lifei suggest everyone watch thisi havent cried that much in my lifeit was the saddest i have ever seeni think every kind of people will love this moviethe film is not exciting at firstbut when you reach the middle of the movie you understand that the movie is really great and so impressive after watching this movie i couldnt sleep for four dayseverything in this movie is greatnobody can say that this is a bad film and has a weak storyand if he or she says thatit means that he havent watched the movie completelythe most sad part is the last 20 to 30 minutesi think this movie is much better than any other dramaromance moviethe movie shows the problems that cancer families have and they have to fight with itand a teen girl that fell in love with an older boythey are just friends at first and after that they become very interested in each other,sad
was good it was well acted good story very sad and moving at times i fully expected and maybe looked forward to blubbering my way through it watching starcrossed terminally ill teenagers falling in love i expected it to really impress me after if i stay barely failed to impress me the problem with is that i waited so long to see it and people talked endlessly about it i knew every detail and people emphasized how sad it was and the characters and the book and you just heard about it constantly since the day it released in theatres so by the time i finally sat down to watch it it felt like i had almost been there and seen it it was sad but maybe because the expectations is that it was desperately soul wrenching sad that it underwhelmed me in fact for a story that seems to be very very popular we have seen all of this before havent we this is not a new concept love story a walk to remembereven the notebook in some respects two young people inadvertently meet he is the pinnacle of manhood and she is this adorable young naive but sexy young girl and death will tear them apart it is intense and the film is indubitably sad right from the opening monologue you know this isnt going to be a happy storyit appears as though shailene woodley is becoming an it girl in hollywood and i can understand why i dont necessarily think shes an amazing actress but she has a very down to earth quality and her performances are solid and you relate to her shes very girl next door in all the right ways and for this role that is nearly perfect she draws you into her world and you feel everything she does ansel elgort is very similar i dont necessarily think hell ever win any oscars but he is insatiably fun in the movie you instantly understand her attraction to him and hes genuine and free spirited and teaches her about life the two of them together are excellent the key to a film like this is passion and chemistry and theyve got it pretty good it isnt amazing but its solid laura dern and sam trammell are good but underused as woodleys parents i think i would have liked to have seen more interaction between woodley and them in regards to her own illness both are good actors a surprise cameo and a great addition is that of willem dafoe as an angry writer who woodley idolizes until discovering how full of hate he is dafoe really stands out being such a nearlegend in his own righti hate to be so pessimistic but i cant help but feel is one of those movies that everybody loves because everybody loves it it happens to be the latest fad i feel that its actually not really age appropriate for its intended audience but i get that teens now are a lot more intense than they once were for this to have such a high score on imdb doesnt make sense to me it is a good movie but it is far from a great movie its tried and true material done again in a decent way with a decent cast and no more or less josh boone who directs has very little big screen experience but that being said he does a very good job and im certain his career will skyrocket after this so look at it this wayteens are in love with this right now because everyone is talking about it if you have seen your fair share of romances you will enjoy it and much like me youll thinkoh that was sad and cutebut memorable hardly just a good movie to entertain 7510,sad
i would never watch the movie again because the movie is a tear making factory but for those who can bear the pangs of love please go ahead and enjoy it i thought the chemistry between shailene woodley and ansel elgort was real the suspension of disbelieve kicks in early and you are transported to the world of hazel and gus hopelessly i am one of those who has read the book and i had great expectations from the movie i was a relieved man that the movie did justice to my imaginationthere are few reasons why the viewer will watch the movie till the end one its smart the conversations between hazel the optimist who wants to leave a mark in the world and hazel the pessimist who believes that everything finally ends in an oblivion has the right formula for some very fresh rhetorictwo even if ita pathetically sad movie the characters who are suffering in it do not indulge in self pity they are unabashed about their illness and they also find room for humor three it has a positive message saying that life is made out of small and big infinities hazel is grateful to gus for giving her their small infinity so life is not about the number of years one lives but the number of infinities that one lives within iti would give this movie a ten but i guess i am saving it for later,sad
ive seen many films but dont write reviews nor have i got the literary skills to do so but this one gave me a burning desire to put many words out even though its hard to find ones that might be sufficient for this epic story this is just my feelings sorted in the order they pop inside me rather than a review i dont have to write about all the good writing acting and performances along with charming set up of deeply sentimental scenes coated with highly emotional songs these are all obvious some people would still claim it as a teen movie or another sad love story for a dedicated audience but truth is ive never come across a fiction that induces such noble thoughts and emotions and never felt such feelings for a fictional character before most common way of hypnotism is the state of mind that you are really fascinated and moved to an alternate state of consciousness by something that is made upand this movie does that im an average man on his late thirties and usually dont cry for a movie nor like sad stories but also never keep myself from simple pleasure of admitting itproud to confess bursting into tears on their eulogies which could have been their vowsnot just because their limited infinity or the ending that set my soul fire but because how real and how utterly great their love wasand their way of celebrating itcouldnttt resist to envymaybe i aspire what i lack in my life but everyone relates to it one way or anotheri want my own hazel gracemesmerized by whole realness of itas for real life i wish for once people would kill bias and consider this as a worthy piece of hypnosis business of motion picture industry along with all characters hazel grace was uniquely real and endearing thanks to shailene woodley giving her life perfectlyand wont be surprised rather will find peace if she or movie gets showered with awards other than reactions of uslike many i also had a tendency to save my 10 always for something higherup until finding myself rewatching it over and overso yes this is my first ten and i like my choice of tenokay,sad
the fault in our starsone of the pros to dying young is that you dont have to worry about getting alzheimersbut as this drama points out there are more cons to early expirationurged to attend a cancer support group at the behest of her mother laura dern and father sam trammell terminal teenager hazel shailene woodley finds the meetings more bearable thanks to fellow sufferer augustus ansel elgortagreeing to read each others favourite book hazel shares one about cancer with augustus  who is reluctantly won over by the prosewanting to meet the author before her demise hazels wish is granted but her and augustus encounter with him willem dafoe is disparaging at bestbased on the teen lit sensation this adaptation does an adequate job of adhering to its inspiration specifically characterization plotting and the sorrowful endingwhats more when you die young your obit photo will be hot green lightvidiotreviewsblogspotca,sad
my only complaint is my eyes are swollen i have a terrible cold aftermath of crying in this movieshailene in this movie and in divergent showed off some incredible acting prowess i guess her forte is to look natural unassuming when needed ansel and nat did great i would be surprised if this movie doesnt make it to oscarsgolden globecritics choice etcjosh  john greene you guys pulled off some awesome stuff there kudos clapronna kress you couldve done better sam  for father  duh  was it the budget  paucity of time  look at sam at 20049 give or take youll know what i meanshailene  you nailed it girl  really,sad
such a deep meaningful movie it just makes you heart stop every single time and appreciate what you actually have got in this life how lucky you are to be alive and so many troubles suddenly seems stupid and small when you understand the beauty of being able to live healthy and full life so sad story but at the same time so unbelievably beautiful and pure i normally do not like any types of drama but this film is now one of my favorites thank you so much for this it really helped me to see so much clearer what is really important in life and give a new perspective on things that happens around me thank you and thanks to the actors for such good performances you are great,sad
i have watched a lot of movies a lotand this movie is the best ever romantic movie i have ever seen the cast is just perfect the chemistry the emotions all perfect the pace of the movie is excellent and it all the events which take place are at the right time however the sheer superb performance undoubtedly comes from shailene woodley she is literally head and shoulder above the rest of the cast whether it is her acerbic wit acceptance of her fate emoting through her eyes or delivering gutwrenching moments through emotionally harrowing sequences and monologues wodley quite simply knocks every scene and dialogue out of the park this is an exceptionally young talent and can be easily counted among the decades best performance from an actress shailene woodley is surely a superstar in the making,sad
an excellent romantic love story with positive strokes every moment it is a true love story of commitment and dedication for what you are though we find ourselves in difficult situations we often do not look into us rather move by the comments of others a deeper experience of love can help you accept what you are not being carried away by the like and comments by the other the beauty of you is you not in what you make of you for the other in depth value it finding her in love she was able to change the whole course of her life not just being for oneself but for others a wonderful watch never miss it,sad
this is the most realistic but at the same time the saddest movie i have ever seen other movies with a similar genre arent really as truthful about what these people go through and they dont really go into the why what and how concept but this movie did it is a much more fresher insight it is honest truthful and at the same time delivers an epic love story i cried so hard while watching this movie this is most definitely a heartwarming and heartbreaking moviethe actors played their parts extremely well they delivered such a powerful performanceone of the most epic movies i have ever seen bravo,sad
the story of those teenagers just at my age has taught us a lesson its little difficult for me to understand that story fully since im a teenager too but not a patient of cancer or at least not diagnosed their situation is really hard for me to be fitted in withbut after reading a few reviews i get a sense of a larger scale that i dont need to be with cancer to catch the means behind the shots that the death might be the best way of being remembered and loved gus passed away as a great boyfriend and a great friend a lovely son he left us a handsome figure his girlfriend hazel remained in love with him maybe always for isaac though he was not died he lost his girlfriend monica with their always became a fake if isaac died he could be remembered by monica forever be with love until his last day like gusanother thing is that its so heartbreaking to expect that someday your love will die its totally different from dying from accidents youre taking everyday preciously knowing everyday might be hisher last day i cant stand that but thats what they did in the filmso now a little bit of filmmaking therere a lot of music in the film some of them are quite well while others are lack of proper emotions in the start the music does a great job of building the atmosphere but in the end when hazel opened the letter from van houton the music gave me a kind of absurdity not so contemplative as an end of a filmfor their trip to amsterdam to me the plane took off as soon as the flight attendance got away with the captains announcement thats too quickly that hardly no one can get prepared for take offand the letter from van houton again he gave hazel a letter after gus funeral it seems like the director and the writers tried to present us a strong twist about the aloofness of van houton superficially and the real means of him but i didnt cry since i didnt care about his words those are trivial to the film i thought i havent read the book yet so i cant prejudge its whose fault but surly it can be improved for a better film,sad
greetings from lithuania2014 is simply beautiful picture great acting by all involved and especially by my favorite star of recent years shailene woodley this is an involving picture from start till finish i didnt found it very predictable sure if you are watching a lot pictures you will now where its coming but still i was captivated from start till finish on its core this is a romantic picture with unusual characters this picture is not about cancer either its about embracing your life in every step no mater what  this is i think is a point of this movieoverall flavorless acting especially by both leads and another standout performance by shailene woodley nice script refreshing love story and nice drama  this picture is simply a joy to watch and yes dont forget to have some handkerchiefs  you will need them 910,sad
i am so glad i saw this though it appears to be a tear jerker well it may but it also gives you lots of hope it flies in all accounts perfect story script casting acting and inspiration i cried and laughed and felt satisfied even though i was not sick we can learn so much from kids and yet these are not really kids as young adults they have the purity and positive drive of kids who just live for the present and seize the moment yet on the other hand they are about to become adult and have the maturity to love and care for the people they deeply lovelook up toadmire beautiful story setting very realistic and positive outlook for life inspirational for all ages and of all conditions life maybe short but still good it is important to vent and have a support system who accepts you as who you are and on your side at all times excellent casting and acting especially the three youngsters who have to brave cancer guz ansel elgort is so charming with his sincere smile that you just want to hug and kiss him hazel shailene woodley is very cute and sweet and had a great sense of humor she also displays a strong sense of confidence yet when they weep you really feel the ache inside them and cry with them even when issac nat wolff loses his eye and has to wear sunglasses his facial expressions made me cry but it is not a sad story death is all around us we are all going to die yet before that day comes we have to live well and full and have a good laugh about it these teenagers with terminal illness show us exactly how to do it as mentioned in the movie pain demands to be felt so is love sadness anger and all kinds of emotions because they are what make us human no need to worry about whether we would be remembered because we would not know then lets focus on this lifehave not seen such a good movie for a long time i would give it an 8 really looking forward to read the book,sad
one of the best movies ive seen in a long time the movie was touching and it compelled me to eulogize the movie and its starsi never got my eyes off for a single moment shailene woodley and ansel elgort share an amazing chemistryi dont like reading books but now i guess i am more intrigued to read the book this movie shows the truth of life and how two young folks deal with the fact of life that they have few days to liveseen a lot of romantic movies but this one is very different and deserves nothing less than 10 and an oscar nominationtouching romantic sad and is emotional to the core never cried in a movie but exceptions are always there and is that exceptiona must watch guys,sad
director josh boone took on the challenging and alltoocommon theme of young tragic love with  so he had better get it right  and he did in fact its refreshingly one of the best if not the best attempt at capturing this difficult and emotionally swept up idea in film hats off to stars shailene woodley and ansel elgort who add a truly beautiful touching and sentimental movie to their portfolios waterworks guaranteedwoodley plays hazel  a 17 year old girl whos already running on borrowed time her devoted parents laura dern and sam trammell try to manage having dealt with their daughters illness since she was 13 and their longtime weariness shows empathetically on their faces life lacks luster for young hazel whose situation is pretty grim mom and dad send her to a support group for teens with cancer  and its there that she catches the eye of augustus ansel elgort hes also been struck with an affliction that has taken part of his leg although when he meets hazel he is currently in remission hes adoringly innocent playful and forever charming  and completely smitten with hazel shes cautious per her situation but ultimately cant help but fall wonderfully head over heels for him its the value of this relationship that the characters discover and its their definition of what makes a significant life that is forever alteredthere are some obvious shortcuts to the audiences heartstrings being used in  lets not deny that  but its quickly forgiven in this honest and gutwrenching romance because its just done so well the premise allows the teen coupling to be intensified without making it ridiculous the characters simple lives transpire to a higher plane with love and their longing for more of what they just cant get is the ultimate tragic romance,sad
im 999 sure there are no spoilers but i marked it as such just in case something i said gives something away for you i tried my best not to give anything awayi believe that books are better than the movie made for the book however this was one of those rare exceptions the movie was just as great as the book i do however have some complaints about them changing who says what or certain things that happened in the book but didnt happen in the movie that should havelets talk about the cast i am really disappointed that they didnt stay true to peter van houtens appearance as described in the book but he did stay true to character in many other ways this is not a spoiler since hes seen in the trailer i kind of expected different parents for augustus though they were not what i expected but still just as sweet i only wish they had more screen time hazels parents were the absolute best you could see the love they had for their daughter and how much they wanted to see her happy hazel and augustus oh my gosh the two actors actor and actress seemed to have this amazing chemistry sometimes i would forget that it was just a movie and that they were just acting thats how convincing they were that they were in love it felt like they were actually together off screen as well due to the amazing cast choice and sticking to the story despite the few changes this movie receives a 10 out of 10 i absolutely loved the book and im so glad the movie was just as good as the book since i cried reading the book i knew i would cry during the movie as well i was right i did cry i cried uncontrollably its such a touching story i read in the discussion boards that someone felt they romanticized cancer i dont think thats true at all i felt the book and the movie went into detail about what cancer is really like the author even did his research to ensure he explained it correctly the story does however focus more on the love and friendship between hazel and augustus as well as what their lives were like dealing with cancer their lives were nowhere near easy i felt that i had a better understanding at least a little bit of what some people with cancer go through but i do feel like they could have made the effects more visible during the movie just as the book was very descriptive about itlike always i do recommend reading the book first so that you will have a better understanding of the movie happy watching movie lovers,sad

ok  i finally watched the movie after reading the first book though this was my first experience and i really enjoyed it but the book is better than the film i guess the reason is that the book is in very detailed and you cant put every details in a two hour movie so if you are wondering what to see first my advice is that go check the book first youll like it as far as the review goes the movie is very emotional and heartbreaking but also have touch of humor the movie is about a teenage girl hazel grace with a terminal cancer and have not much time to live meets gus who also suffers from cancer they fall in love but deals with the harsh reality of lifethe soundtracks of the movie is also very good and catchy in a nut shell youll cry and laugh its definitely worth watching ,sad
i am not a guy who cries easily with a movie thats not my style i am not trying to sound tough but thats the truth i remember i only cried with gladiator when i was 12 now is in my list now i am 18 believe or noti never liked romantics movies i am not that kind of guy to be honest my girlfriend wanted to see this one so i said okay lets see it to have some fun what i found i found a very very emotional love story between two teenagers with cancerthe love story between hazel and gus will catch you and will never let you go even if you dont like these types of movies i even want to see this movie again and againtalking about acting it was so amazing i really liked ansel elgorts work on this film i see a new hollywood star right hereokay so this is a movie for everyone no age limits deserves 85  in my opinionmy vote 10 out of 10 great film,sad
i havent read the book but decided to watch this movie after having read the good reviews and for me its was an absolutely great movie as it had everything i like in movies a deep soul humanity warmth but also funny moments for me ansel elgort is absolutely outstanding in his performance that he could become one of my favourite actors there are few actors that in my opinion are capable of such intensity shailaine woodley is also great wish hollywood would deliver more of this kind of movies rather than some action stuff i wasnt bored for a single second watching this movie even if the theatre was full of silly teenagers who laughed,sad

i started watching this movie being recommended by one of my friends good thing is that i didnt see the rating of this movie back then because that makes my vision and expectation specific so only knowing that its a romantic movie released in 2014 i clicked the play buttonand that was thatonce the movie started i was totally into the movie and thats what surprised me the whole thing was so real the plot is the kind you can somehow predict but then what makes it so special i guess its the acting shailene woodley and ansel elgort portrayed the two starcrossed lovers hazel and augustus so well that i couldnt but feel their emotion the script is simple yet enough at what it does the direction cinematography and editing are so coherent that no scene seems out of place and thats also another reason to keep you stick to the movie till the end or even more and about the soundtracks i dont need to say a word about the soundtracks during the movie but the song all of the stars by ed sheeran during the ending credits is such a song youd surely love to listen after such a movie after the movie ended there was this whole movie flashback in my head and i was left with the feeling that yes some infinities are simply bigger than other infinitiesone last thing probably you wouldnt regret now if you dont watch this movie but once youve finished watching youd know that you surely would have regretted not watching it and from my personal experience i highly recommend a box of tissue while watching this movie,sad
i am going to start off this brief twoparagraph review by saying that i originally had no intentions of seeing this movie period this movie was obviously not meant for guys particularly ones my age and instead was meant for the young teengirl audience so i figured why bother that being said i did end up seeing it and i actually thought it to be a very good film the characters were given a lot of depth shailene woodley gave one of the best performances i have seen all year and the story is not just a typical cancer story instead of having the lead characters fine and healthy throughout half the film and becoming sick towards the end this film is about people that have already moved into the acceptance stage of their illness and how they learn to enjoy what little time they have left in life it is a very wellpaced movie the dialog is fine you will cry at some pointi did and it has willem dafoe if only for about five minutes this film had so much going for it that i really have nothing major to hold against it the acting was very very well done the editing is spot on and nearly all of the technical components of the film were in top form all the complaints that i did have with it were extremely minimal and most of them were fixed by the end of the first act anyway because of this i have to applaud it was not meant for my demographic yet it made me enjoy the movie anyway there really is not a lot i can say about this movie without sounding cheesy or weird so i will let my rating speak for me i am going pretty high on this initial rating although it may change later on 910,sad
many times after watching a film i had the feeling what a waste of money for the film maker and time for me its simply because those films were lack of depth and consistency or the writer simply dont know how to end itthe film titled is one of the few great ones ive watched lately it echoed with my views on life and love those two main characters are young but their views on love are so insightful would they be different if they were like any other healthy teens many young or old couples that have been together for ages fail to grasp or achieve that kind of levelyes its a story a fiction but it is very inspiring and meaningful it is a great film to watch for both young and elderly,sad
in just word i cant describe what the director and writer described the movie the best epic tremendous love story and most of the acting of lead actors make the movie so alive heads off for shailene and great salute to the ansel elgort at the last 10 or 20 minutes movie really set all the character on fire and their alive acting forces tear to come out from the eyeseven no matter how strong you arebut your feeling just let go this tear and feelings expressedamazzing dazzeleing music selectionm83omg keep making movie like this and inspire the worlds people i bieleve there is nothing big important than love and the writer it describes so hopely and strongly i love it,sad
i love this movie so much as this love story teaches us no matter how hard our lives are we need to always appreciated what we have and the time we spend we cannot use money to exchange love we do not have to afraid of losing each other because it is fate the only thing we can do is hold on to each other and do not fear of anything life is full of challenges we need to face it positively like the couple in the movie seeing each other everyday can be a most wonderful thing ever loving who she or he is is the things we should do we should say thank you to the one who be with us this is because they take care of us like a precious girl is the one of the touchable movie that i had seen,sad
for me  one of best may be the best movie i have seen unbelievable excellent choice of actors  each of them create around himself his own rich world  and it results in very high level of credibility of this story i could be wrong but i do feel that it makes me much more understand complexity of feeling of people who are dying in other movies is this situation presented much more black and white without confusionit gives me hope that if they are people who can create such a movie like this one that we may not destroy ourselves with too much rapid technical development simply excellent,sad
the movie was awesomewonderful and inspiring story with perfect acting by shailene and anselvery realistic and emotional as it should beall the stuff about cancer and leukemia are so real like it is really happening which is great because it makes movie so much better to watch this one of those movies where while watching it you will cry and smile at the same timethere are many sad scenes especially the one when augustus dies that will really make you cry and think how terrible it must be to have cancer and only one leg or waking up in the middle of the night because you cant breathe movie deserves 1010everything is done perfect with no mistakesi would recommend it to everyone children teenagers adults and even grandparents it is meant to be watched by everyonei beg that you will enjoy watching it so give it a shot,sad
one of the most beautiful love stories i have ever seen it touched my heart i felt the trauma of cancer patients and what they must be going through life is so unfair its not the same for all hazel grace lancaster and augustus waters what a performance guys even the eccentric character of the writer in the movievan houten was amazingly played its a movie which talks about loving someone about relationship about caring someonebrilliant story aweinspiring performances stupefying dialogues heartwrenching climax but it defines life and death at the same timesoul touching indeed,sad
an amazing presentation a successful team a terrible subject for humanity a film filled with excellent cross scene i hold myself to cry harder i think everyone should watch this one however did i could probably go on and write 20 pages on how good the chemistry between the actors is or how well the movie was written and such it should at least be nominated for the oscars for bestscreenplay and definitely an award for shailene woodley i normally will reject plots that i can see coming but with this story it was journey of getting there that made it suffer able two more quick points as this is one i would highly recommend for my friends that are softhearted enough to admit as guys we enjoy a good love story as much as the girls do now and then,sad
i dont know what to say i was attracted into watching this movie because i loved the main actress playing hazel she is just excellent seen divergent another thing i heard the boom clap song on the radio these days and although it sounds a bit teenagerish excuses for that it got under my skin rightoh yeah also the cover picture of the movie is just right even the font of the title even the title ok ok im going bananas but in essence here it isi was expecting to see a teenage movie with a bit more sorrow due to the circumstances however i saw a touchingfunny and beautiful love tale told from two very convincing actors that got my eyes in tears more than oncei simply loved it i can only recommend it,sad
honestly im not so much for tearjerkers especially when diseases are involved im normally not interested so i was surprised at how much i enjoyed this movie part of this is because of the leading actors the girl is a strong character who forgets her disease to follow a dream while the boy is a fun character whom everybody would like to have as a friend and theres plenty more great characters in this movie especially willem dafoe in his role as the writer of the book that inspires a trip to amsterdam ah and to see amsterdam in this movie its wonderful i live ten miles from amsterdam and have been there too many times to count so its funny to see a movie about people whom it mattes so much to to go there the city looks grand and its a great supporting character all in all great picture,sad
this film portraits the tragic circumstance of two young lovers who both have cancer and are doomed with a short lifespan never the less they still love each other deeply based on the novel by john green the film manages to project a plethora of messages through good acting both from shailene woodley and ansel elgortthe movie bewilders viewers while trying to make them understand the hopes and aspirations of these wonderfully portrayed characters although it becomes apparent that all those prospects and ambitions that these youngsters exhibit are never coming to fruition because seemingly death is what governs their livesin reality though as the film progresses we understand that death has minimal hold on these people love is what really drives them their love will not last long but it still is an infinity by itself at least to them just like it is explained in the movie some infinities are smaller than others but theyre still classified as infinities a wonderful messagethe films director john broone manages to explain viewers the story of these two people in a respectful manner while keeping fancy camera work out of it the cinematography is not what i would like to focus on as it is not the strongest trait of the film and does not enhance the story telling of the filmi liked it and its actors as such i give this movie an 810 and warn viewers to bring handkerchiefs to watch it,sad
well this is my first movie review ever though i have watched hundreds of them if not thousands  this can give you an idea how much i might have liked this movie  the movie is a vanilla love story of two cancer patients as told by most people but actually it is a beautiful metaphorical presentation of pain and survival instinct hidden inside every one of us pain is meant to be felt and thats the truth writers have done amazing work by painting out the darkness of life with such bright colors that it doesnt scare you but gives you a push to find you path out of shady roads every member of the cast group have done more than justice to their role especially ansel elgort and shailene woodley the two just comes out as the perfect couple though each ones role were missing some parts according to worldly definition couldnt ask for more from the director josh boone such as impeccable presentation of truth which we all try to ignore in our indulgence for whining and pity is worthy of applaudnet net  if you want to fall in love with life watch it there is something for you,sad
out of all cancermalady movies i like this the most is a heartbreaker for sure but its also a sweet romantic film full of sudden warmth and humor it gets everything right about being young and in love for the first time theres a moment when the breeziness powering the story goes away and medical reality takes over and elgorts performance goes to a surprising new place well comparing to a walk to remember now is good safe heaven and other cancer survival movies they all are pretty much the same the grief at the end make us viewers cry i mean the character they put an end to and the suffering of their beloved ones a person just cannot resist to not to cry at the end of the movie,sad
well ive waited for so long to see this movie because tumblr was all over with it and i was just curious and it was a movie that i could kept watching until the end the character of augustus was just amazing he was strong and special this is the right word for it he was special and i wasnt expecting him to be the one dying in the end he made us feel that his struggle was over i have found it a little unrealistic hazels parents dealing with the thought of losing their only child like that thinking that theyll just can live with that pain i mean i dont have children but losing a child by cancer is just doesnt make a parent think like that i dont say that it wouldnt be the right way of thinking it would make grief a lot easier to deal with for humans but our consciousness is far from this level right now pain loss and grief makes us blind and this is just the way it is but then i just felt sorry for both of them and in the same time i felt guilty for feeling sorry for them i couldnt really relate to the struggles of the characters,sad
its very hard for anyone of us to live with a fear that we are going to die unknowingly we are going to loose someone we love so much we cant be like everyone becoz we are different in the sense sickbut we livefightsurvive and get on with our lives this is what is all about shailene woodley as hazal just made a character in a book alive and so alive that she would leave an impression on your mind for a long time ansel elgort gave her a good support and they both lived their most memorable character on screen this a movie of a lifetime and being a guy i criedyes it is true becoz anyone who watch the prefuneral portion of the movie and didnt cry is not practically humanthis is a lovely film about lovepassiondreamshopehumanityaffectiondevotion and many more feelings like this that it will clean your heart and make you believe in destiny and teach you how to livean oscar winning film all the way specially shailene woodley becoz she would be remembered for many years to come,sad
there are movies that entertains you and there are some that showcases your very own life in front of you not literally but you can connect the bits and pieces of your life to the story this movie is one of those that flows in your heart and you will likely to be comparing it with all time modern love stories tears roll not because whats happening to the character but because you wonder what if the situation was same for you what if the same words were spoken to you what if you have loved a person the same way this is what makes the movie so highly regarded it is not a movie about technicality but about the script and the foreshadowing that keeps you wondering from the characters point of view a movie to fall in love again,sad
i fall in love with this movie immediately the actors plays so well expressing the feelings of their character beautifully the writing and directing are amazing the movie go smoothly they manage to put 336 pages into 2 hours very well i didnt feel they are missing something or the the scenes are going too fast the landscapes are beautifully and they make you want to be there with themi like that they gave a new perspective to this terrible disease therefore even if you are very sick you can have a chance at happiness and loveyou can make your wishes to happen is also about the journey the struggle that you with the disease the belief that youll manage to pass all that and the relationship you have with the ones that are close to youi will definitely going to see it again,sad
that to see a rainbow it is needed to outlive a rain stars are guilty  real sincere simple and such truthful screen version of the same book john green and josh boone managed to find balance in the image of mortal illness feelings of two teenagers aspiration to live and behave to the eternal things philosophically their heroes grow develop the certain vital stages pass become stronger and a smile in the end is the greatest proof that force inwardly won over grief and those depressed emotions that it entails maybe hazel and gus it was even succeeded to win over time because they snatched the piece of happiness because they lived,sad
i just want to add i have never actually read the book because films appeal more to me i am also a male and i felt the almighty feelswhen i first heard about this film i shrugged it off as one of them not as good as you say it is movie oh how i was wrong i really felt for hazel in the last part of the film you could easily make a connection with her feelings even though she was trying to act strong and put on a brave face it was amazing the acting skills of this woman are amazing and all credits to hernow augustus the wise cracking 18 year old who brought the comedy the this wonder of a film the way he could make the bad things seem good by adding a joke or being sarcastic really help lighten the mood of this feel his attitude in this made me think of my favourite quote of all timethe storyline was amazing but sadly a little bit predictable what is like most films in this genera but that was its only fault wink wink the way this was edited was amazing the clean cuts the perfectly placed music added to the atmosphere and overall experience of this first class masterpiece not many films like this make it to my top 1 and this one will take a long time to get knock off i would like to leave you with a quote that sums up this film to me in a paragraph the longer i live the more i realise the impact of attitude on life attitude to me is more important than facts it is more important than the past the education the money than circumstances than failure than successes than what other people think or say or do it is more important than appearance giftedness or skill it will make or break a companya churcha home the remarkable thing is we have a choice everyday regarding the attitude we will embrace for that day we cannot change our pastwe cannot change the fact that people will act in a certain way we cannot change the inevitable the only thing we can do is play on the one string we have and that is our attitude i am convinced that life is 10 what happens to me and 90 of how i react to it and so it is with you we are in charge of our attitudeslc,sad
reviewed by dare devil kid ddkrating 45 starshad amazing prerelease hype and it lived up to its expectations by all counts i havent read john greens immensely popular novel  and now that ive seen the film i dont foresee myself reading it in the future  but if the movie has adhered closely to its source i can see why greens romantic yarn is so loved the plot is centered around hazel and augustus two teenagers who share an acerbic wit a disdain for the conventional and a love that sweeps them on a journey their relationship is all the more miraculous given that hazels other constant companion is an oxygen tank gus jokes about his prosthetic leg and they meet and fall in love at a cancer support groupspeaking solely from the films perspective is nothing short of a masterpiece that leaves you with a lump in your throat tearyeyed and an almost palpable aura of love engulfing our senses the direction is exceptional with a smoothlyflowing narrative that draws you completely in and keeps you emotionally engaged the writing is of the highest quality with beautifully fleshed out characters that you genuinely care about and want to invest time in and the dialogues are witty satirical and emotional without being mushylending depth and gravitas to the seamless narrative and incredible writing are the cast of talented actors  irrespective of the length of their role every actor does a fine job and their performances remain etched in our psyche long after the curtain comes down laura dern as hazels shailene woodley mother and nat wolff as gus ansel elgort best mate stand out among the supporting cast while willem dafoe is hauntingly terrific as usual in a bit role ansel elgort is easy on the eye  though he comes across as effortless charming throughout most of the film he ends up displaying his range towards the end and packs quite a meaty punch in the dramatic and emotional sceneshowever the sheer standout performance undoubtedly comes from shailene woodley whos literally head and shoulder above the rest of the cast whether it is her acerbic wit acceptance of her fate emoting through her eyes or delivering gutwrenching moments through emotionally harrowing sequences and monologues wodley quite simply knocks every scene and dialogue of hers out of the park this is an exceptionally young talent whos not only delivered an act worthy of an oscar nomination but it can be easily counted among the decades best performance from an actress shailene woodley is surely a superstar in the makingbrings warmth to our hearts makes us believe in the power of true love and shows us that even in the most trying times life can through us an unexpected enchanting curve ball it is definitely one of the most touching emotionally haunting realistic and magical love stories ever and will eventually go down as one of the best romantic movies of all time,sad
in a way it hurts me to say this but i liked the movie way more than book this is the best book adaptation to a movie i have ever seenthe book seemed less dramatic than movie when reading i laughed quite a lot and didnt cry even once honestly the book to me seemed pretentious and disappointing on the other hand watching the movie i did laugh a few times but my face felt more like crying than smilingi have to admit that i was quite surprised to see john green in the movie himself but i guess if he was working on the set anyways why not appear in a shot as wellone of my favorite parts not related to movie or novel was the scene at a caf where on the table were two giraffes who love giraffes i was so geeking out about this vlogbrother referenceactually when i think about it i am not sure i like the plot and frankly and i want to think about it because i dont to ruin my first impression of the movie i do know that i liked what i saw and what i felt during the movie and that is enough for me,sad
i am a huge hollywood fan but i thought that hollywood lacks in emotions or maybe i am just a stone hearted there are two movies which melts my heart one is into the wild and the other isjosh boone finally leaves a impact with his love stories yes its most beautiful movie i have ever seen haze and gus done a great job and the wait of death is always horrifying and whenever u look at your love ones pain demands to be felt like till u breatheeveryone should watch this masterpiecewatch it alone if dont wanna anyone see your crying,sad
this is my first review this is because what i think usually isnt what everyone else thinks but this time i have to speak upthis movie is like it says in the title the first movie that ive ever cried to and ive seen some sad movies however none of those movies have ever felt so realistic even those who were based on a real story this one however did i could probably go on and write 20 pages on how good the chemistry between the actors is or how well the movie was written and such but im not going to because that isnt what makes a good movie in my honest opinion it is the feeling you get when you watch the movie that matters when watching you get the feeling of joy and humor but also great sadness and sorrow all this combined with the feeling that you belong in this movie that this is something that could happen to you or your loved ones combining each of those elements is not an easy thing a few if any movies have done it until nowno matter if you are an action fan or fantasy fan no matter what kind of movie you like you should watch this movie you will probably feel a great pain in watching it since it reminds us of all the sad parts in our lives but it is worth it because honestly pain demands to be felt,sad
just saw the movie unfortunately 2 days after finishing the book what i liked about the book is that much of details topics characters the way it begins and the fabulous ending of such a story it was really a great journey on the other side i watched the movie and it was fairly good just concentrating on the idea of  the fault in hazels and augustss stars marginalizes the other characters and their lives such as isaac hazels parents kaitlyn guss family lidewij and specifically van houten who i assumed to be the best rule in the story after hazel and gus but the director didnt show that changing the end of the story was improper too i think the book is way too better than the movie,sad
this movie surprised me to say the least i went in not even really being a big fan of the book needing to know how much worse they would make the movie imagine my surprise as i watch a perfectly good movie that even moved me to tears of both joy and sadness the actors playing hazel and gus are perfectly chosen and do the trick perfectly as i thought the book to be a little bit to flat lacking a certain amount of depth in the characters the movie does not give me the same feeling however they choose their highlights a little bit differently then in the book it all makes more sense to me this waya big thumbs up for this movie,sad
i have read the book which was so fantastically awesome and so when this movie came out it had only one show in my city and i spend my pocket money on this film rather than some commercial crapi somehow convinced by friends to watch this and this movie is worth a thousand wordsone of the best movies i have seen this year surely it should at least be nominated for the oscars for bestscreenplay and definitely an award for shailene woodley i have become a fan of her since divergentthis movie specially augusts death made me cry and all the people in the theater were also in tears i would rate this 2010 and this should definitely be on the top 200 films ever list,sad
this is my first review and very well my last as i find that time could be spent in many more meaningful ways that said i felt compelled to give kudos where they are due and when a story grips you like this one does its worth a few minutes to reflect even to yourself i know there have been many great love stories told throughout hollowed halls of time past but this one must be included in mention of the greats i normally will reject plots that i can see coming but with this story it was journey of getting there that made it sufferable two more quick points as this is one i would highly recommend for my friends that are softhearted enough to admit as guys we enjoy a good love story as much as the girls do now and then i must say the character build up was very well done and acting on both sides was phenomenal and worthy of award consideration my issue is with the bigger picture of how a story like this could very easily have had a deeper meaning this was done on a strictly naturalistic level and the lack of god is very depressing because truth is so very taboo on the silver screen my wish of course would have painted them finding true joy and coming to the lord but that is my wish for all major movies so i guess outside of that i couldnt have asked for a better film a must see and worth watching again,sad
i had real high hopes for this film and i was not disappointed thank god i read the book a while ago and it was that type of story that stuck in your mind for days no kidding this book had me feel all the emotions it was brilliantly written by john green yet another one of his fantastic novels it had romance drama and comedy all in one and was a heartwarming story right from the beginning i thought the film was really good they picked the perfect actors to play the characters just how i imagined them to be when i was reading the book ok so they missed a couple of things out in the film which were in the book but they werent really important things i advise people to read the book first if youre planning on watching this so then you can imagine yourself what the film will be like it is a fantastic story film and just like the book this film will stay in my mind for a fair few days because it was such an emotional and moving film in which the actors captured the emotions perfectly 1010,sad
the book original book is a beautiful work of art that many people do not understand the see the mask of the love story that is used to explain the beauty of life in the book both hazel and augustus fall in love each other because of their personalities and how they have similarities and how they share similar ideas about life and death in the book it shows how they fall in love with each other not because of looks but because they can have actual and real conversations with each other the one that one can only have with someone who really knows them in the movie it does not show them falling in love for these reasons instead it becomes your typical clich love story augustus waters is supposed to be more than a pretty face he is supposed to be a guy who has a deeper meaning of life and how death is inevitable the movie does not show their relationship and how it develops in the book both hazel and gus have great relationships with their parents hazel mom tries to make the best of everything and is more like a friend than a mom i could not see this in the movie also in the book hazel and the waters become close and have a relationship of their own his parents love hazel and what she does for gus in the movie they look at hazel as if she is a stranger in the book isaac and gus have an almost brotherly relationship they joke around with each other and understand each others wants and needs in the movie it shows as if hazel and isaac only became friends because of augustus which is not true john green uses many literally references in his books the poem about the red wheelbarrow was there and that is a key part except hazel does not write poems and gus notices that the poem that was supposed to be recited in the airplane on the way to amsterdam is also missing which is also a key poem hazel and augustus also have more of a correspondence with van houten which is not shown in the movie the thing that annoyed me the most about the movie is that the biggest and major quote the one that the book is based on is missing the julius caesar quote there are some characters that are missing from the movie and i understand that they could not fit all of them in because then it would make the movie to long but i feel that caroline mathers is a really important person in the book after reading carolines page after she died hazel realized that she was a grenade she also learns why augustus stared at her when they first met because she looked like her kaitlyn who is one of hazels non cancer friends brings realness to the book in the movie before hazel meets gus its seems that she is depressed and once she meets him her life becomes perfect it also shows gus being her whole entire life in the book isaac and gus are not her only friends every girl needs a friend that is a girl so they can be understood hazel talks to kaitlyn about things she is not a expert in but kaitlyn has more experience in overall if i had not read the book and memorized it it would have been a good movie a bit clich for my taste but a good movie,sad
eh its a cancer film expect to get sad as the stereotypical boy next door helps lonely girl come out of her shellfor me it was just far too overwrought with the love story angle i think it was the amount of lovey dovey speeches they made when there was a lot more room for displaying the love rather than pausing for a whole page monologue about it ithich made the pacing of the story a bit choppy and too shakespeare in the park feelingthe performances from the cast were just ok shalene woodley definitely stood out however they certainly wouldve shone even brighter with better source materialwait for this to come on cable,sad
to tell you the truth it was an okay moviehmmwhat can i say teenage girls are important they made thisthis very good movie with great advertising and from an important and wonderful writer with famous books and served by new breakout stars such as shailene woodley ansel elgort and nat wolff that was a pretty long sentence i know i will point out that i never recommended itthough sadlyit was a very sad truthfullike a kid just knew santa wasnt real type of movie it really told the truth and id repeat the sentence because it is good at least feels good to watch a movie especially for me total stranger who the heck cares but honestly not every life turns out that way i guess the book was very emotional and im guessing that people begged people to make it a movie and to tell you the truth since thats what ive been doing all along is that i dont think anyone should hate it or regret watching it although i honestly dont think itll leave a mark in the world it could be some teen girls favoritefor a whilebut not foreverthe truth does hurt but it wont be there foreveri cried through some parts of it and some parts i was so sad that i couldnt cry no tears or water filled up my eyes and im sure most of it was because of the spoilers on youtube or facebook or your friends or even the original book that ruined the important parts of the moviethe movie got a fair rating and if it wasnt for the book actors or advertising it wouldnt be a great movie itd be good but not greative run out of words watch it yourself you dont need my opinion or anybodys in fact youre a different person and youll decide what you like even though it might be a little extraordinary dont think if other people liked it or your friends liked it that you might toothanks i appreciate your time to check out my review,sad

directed by josh boone is the screen adaptation of the bestselling book of the same name written by author john green hazel grace lancaster shailene woodley is a longtime cancer survivor who carries an obligatory oxygen tank wherever she goes concerned with her daughters depressive state for reasons known to us hazels mother frannie lancaster played by laura dern lovingly pushes her to attend a cancer support group while attending said support group hazel locks eyes with augustus waters ansel elgort and from then on a blossoming relationship beginsthe good drama central from this i mean the all the talk of dealing with tragedy cancer death and consequently having to do so at such a young age the main characters augustus and hazel try to uncover their lives impact the meaning behind life and aim to experience their short times on earth together laura dern delivered a splendid and nonstandardized portrayal of a parent with a terminally ill child funny bits so that audiences do not sob throughout the entire movie has incorporated dashes of comedy especially seen in the encounters with their mutual friend isaac nat wolff ill admit that a few of the sickly sweet dialogue between the couple made for some chucklesome scenesthe bad anne franks exhibition ugh people actually watched them kiss and started clapping and cheering ive read other peoples takes on this scene being quite fitting considering anne franks narration was playing as hazel struggled to make it up the stairs of the exhibition i do not agree why would a crowd of people surround you and applaud you no matter the situation it felt unrealistic and out of placethat cigarette close to death metaphor hearing the explanation once was enough it can only be described as an agonizingly reoccurring bit augustus never failed to have an unlit cigarette hanging out of his mouth being seated on an airplane rocking up in a limo etc willem dafoe why dafoe why im accustomed to seeing him in the less mainstream films such as lars von triers antichrist and nymphomaniac this appearance is simultaneously unnerving and baffling to say the least he plays peter van houten a caricature of a peeved off writer whose last book had caught the admiration of lead character hazel subsequently the two teens travel to meet him in a scene that can only be described as saddening and utterly bizarre eventually hes villainous behavior is given an explanation in an attempt to give his character depth,sad
the target audience for this film is teenagers and parents although anyone can go see it i went with a group of friends 2 male and 3 female for younger audiences the film is a drama romance that touches on death cancer love and teenage angst all the while weaving in out the experiences of people who struggle with terminal or a debilitating illness the film is worth seeing but a little buggy it is slightly offensive to people of faith and portrays religion as either kitschy schlock or something to be privately disdained not that religion cant fall into the stereotypes that the film portrays but it would be nice for once for hollywood to show at least a glimpse of the way the christian faith is actually been practiced historically instead of the disdainful white suburban stereotypes and the male character comes off as overly sanitized in manners motive and his completely nude free manpad in his moms basement girls may find gus to be a heart throb but in the real world and in the film there is a sense of unrealism to think that he being 18 has never had sex and that him withholding his new cancer results from hazel until after they had sex was altruistic the odds are more likely in this day and age that he has watched tons of porn and 50 of his feelings are tied to just looking for mindless jockish release it may have been me but the vibe i got in the theater is that they shouldnt have had sex no one cheered or seemed relieved or happy it was dead quiet and everyone seemed to be thinking dont do it the kiss in the anne frank museum was actually more of a crowd pleaser it just seemed that if two people are both seriously sick and have health complications having sex could be difficult if not disastrous if i was hazels father i would have been furious over him putting her at risk like that and its not like they can show him putting on a condom either so basically the message is if your dying its ok to have unprotected sex just dont tell your partner your dying what is real love anyway think of the long term heartbreak created by physically telling someone that you love them then an hour later breaking the news that youll be dead soon would it be a surprise that so many young people today are sexually burned out and emotionally numb by the time they hit their 30s  aside from this the film feels a little condensed and the perspective is entirely that of two rich white kids i understand a film is a film and you have to pick an angle and time limit but you could almost retitle this movie the fault in our white suburbs or suburban heart ache for the first time it just seemed a little too lily white and privileged i mean hazel gets to meet her favorite author go to europe date another rich white kid and text on her iphone from her wealthy family home with lovingly rich card board parents it must really suck to have cancer if your black or poor but i understand again its a movie and tickets must be sold at face value its not a terrible film and designed to be a tear jerker most females in the audience seem to cry at least once and if you have cancer or have a child with cancer the film can provide some sense of common experience with others around the country or world who are struggling with the same emotional roller coaster of anxiety fear and existential grief so despite its few quirks affluent centric characters and minor flaws i would recommend watching this movie,sad
now this is what i call a great movie is a great heartwarming movie for anyone to see if they feel like they need to see a feel good movie when you watch you will be shocked to see how good this movie was that is how good this movie is parents this movie has somethings that you may not want your kids to see but you are the judge if your kids see this movie or not there is one part where this one guy name gus dies and it is very sad this movie is a lot like i dont know there is no other movie that is like this one of a kind movie sorry but there is not the two main actors the ones who play gus and hazel they are both from the movie divergent so if you saw it you will most likely remember themthis movie rocks,sad
is possibly the best movie i have ever seen because of the good acting sad scenes and great timelimit the movie starts off with hazel a teenage girl with cancer meet a teenager called gus who has lung cancer in their lifetime they do much fun for there life but in a sad scene we see hazel needed to go to the hospital and get the cancer out of her but then gus gets sick and cant walk no more but then in some few days he died by a memorial with ansel elgorts gus the movie also focuses peter van houten played by willem dafoe where hazel asks van houten to ask what happens in the end of the book she is reading he wont answer but later in the death of gus he gave her a card from gus then says all the memories she had1010why the movie is probably shailene woodleys bets performance in her career the movie has good acting and fantastic screenplay and this movie is clearly a remake or referencing to kule kidz grter ikke the movie is of course the best movie ever,sad
i tried to avoid the book because of all the hype that doesnt immediately make sense but what i mean is i have a sister who reads and watches what other people suggest but never me her older sister who previously suggested many of those books films etc basically reading and watching things that are a craze however when i was invited to go see the film i felt inclined to read the book everyone knows the book is always better i decided this too late and it was film first i was impressed by the 84 rating for a tearjerking romance but was let down i dont know whether to feel bad for not finishing the book or glad that i didnt already know the ending it was sad yesbut in a morbid pessimistic way although i will admit that i teared up when hazel hears the news about augustus and is believably heartbroken however i felt more compelled to produce tears by my friends and the rest of the cinema everyone glancing at each other through watery eyes clutching tissues to their faces and smiling in an embarrassed its so sad omg isnt it way initially i wasnt keen on elgort as augustus i imagined him completely differently and he seemed much too cocky and then im a virgin shy woodley is suitably pessimistic and i later warmed to her realistic portrayal as the cancer patient who needed someone like augustus to make her life consist of more than just illness dafoe is great as the moody alcoholic author who is angry and bitter and wants to be left alone it was refreshing to see how the wrath of this bitter man brought out the best in the actors and allowed you to feel for the characters rather than just feel sorry for them the parents much too smileysadsmiley thats the best way to describe it really i liked it it was cute i think i should have read the book and maybe i could have imagined the left out parts together with the film adaption and felt stronger about it i think that it is a lovely romance but not a great one for me i preferred the notebook so 77 maybe a 78 because its better than a lot of recent romantic films that miss the mark so often,sad
this movie is surely to bring some tears off your eyes the story line is great  based on popular novel the actress is above expectation the way she performed the lead role actor has performed upto mark this movie will leave you a great impression and a pain in your heart but also a motivation to share the agony and sufferings of peoplepatients suffering from deadly cancer like situations the movie succeeded to help viewers imagine patients state of mind along with the pain and sufferings of their loved ones this movie shows some way to the patients and viewers so as how to handle such situations and keep mental stability at bestmy ratings 910,sad
wow i dont even know where to beginthis film is a truly epic story that sucks the viewer in and doesnt let them go i have rarely come out of a film feeling so emotional beaten battered and bruised what a beautiful portrayal of life and some of its purposes i thought the acting was outstanding throughout and the soundtrack and cinematography were spot on all adding to a thoroughly brilliant movie i particularly appreciated the effort to stay true to life  this isnt your classic hollywood blockbuster this is a beautiful portrayal of two extraordinary yet ordinary lives and you cannot help but become involved in the story as it unfoldsi always think a good film should lure the viewer into truly caring about the characters and their lives this did that with almost unrivalled success a must see,sad
quickie reviewhazel shailene woodley a terminal cancer patient and gus ansel elgort a cancer survivor become friends after meeting for the first time at a cancer support group despite the overwhelming circumstances they both have been dealt with through their friendship that grows into love hazel and gus triumph over the fear of death and oblivion is a surprisingly touching movie that is actually smart its incredible two leads bring such realism to their characters that make them and the story all the more relatable a beautifully heartbreaking and heartwarming movie that deserves more recognitionfull reviewwell ill be honest when i saw the trailers and saw that this is yet another teen romance novel adaption i couldnt care less for it but then slowly i started to hear some good buzz so i got curious i knew i wasnt the target demographic this was made even clearer to me when i realized there was literally one other male in the entire cinema no exaggeration and he was there with his girlfriend so i was the only single male in his 20s watching which is a shame because i enjoyed the movie and think more people should go out and see itthere is a reason why some people avoid movies that are based on teen romance novels because they tend to sugar coat and glorify the love aspect of the story and ignore realistic hardships that comes with relationships sneeze twilight sneeze sorry allergic too crap movies cant help it but let me be absolutely clear is not that kind of movie both hazel and gus are instantly likable characters they are witty and smart and that comes across very well thanks to the strong script gus especially is this extremely optimistic person and by being with him hazel finally feels like she doesnt need to be defined by her cancer at the same time hazel helps gus realize to cherish the memories he makes with the people he loves all of what i described doesnt happen in an instant it all takes time just like it would in real life that is why when they eventually fall in love and see them suffer with cancer together it is completely believablethis is not a movie that only people dealing with cancer or people who know others with cancer will relate to everyone will be touched by the story of gus and hazel i could hear half the theater sniffling and in tears and understandably soso i must say if you are on the fence about this movie i say give it a chance it may not be a perfect movie but it doesnt have to be i am thankful i gave it that chanceps i know i have male friends that feel like they will be dragged to this movie by their significant other so guys and girls if you feel the same way trust me this is a pretty good one to be dragged tocheck out more on my movie review blog the stub collector httpthestubcollectorwordpresscom,sad
put a smile on my face from start to finish mainly because i had read the book it does the book justice in wonderful fashion the characters are very well put together in the film isaac in particular gets a lot more of personality and more funny moments in the film than in the book props to the writers for that also the film has a wonderful sense of pace it is able to blend the same realistic humor and drama together from the book seamlessly well it was also very creative with its visuals as well for those of you who dont know the book the films based on contains a lot of texts and emails during hazel and guss conversations i like how the movie didnt stick to one style sometimes thought bubbles filled the screen and other times the camera showed the screen hazel was texting on that being said do i think this movie is flawless no for starters this film has a lot of pop songs like i mentioned in my divergent review props to them for actually using their soundtrack but they didnt need to include so many to begin with also the film makes certain parts a lot more sappy and therefore more clique than in the book its ironic how much the film tries to stay away from these cliques but sometimes falls right into it its almost as if the film was originally made in a unique way then the director thought wait this film still needs to make money and decided to add a hint of hollywood cheese either way this movie was a lot of fun to watch i can overlook its flaws to be very content with this one there are few faults in these stars,sad
well the movie was quite interesting but hugely emotional the plot was quite simple but complex at the same time from what i could gather it was initially suggested that one of the lovers which i will outline in due course was dying of cancer however as i rightly pointed out it was actually both of em hazelwoodley is dieiing of cancer not sure the exact medicinal name she has an oxygen tank to help her around when she was a kid she had an episode whereby her lungs were fluidly she is being put on tablets as an experiment to absorb the fluid in her lungs so afterwards we see that she is highly depressed and her mom suggests a cancer support group in an episcopal church here she meets gusaugustus waters  what a lovely nameelgort hes some babe alrite so precious he too is dying of cancer we are introduced with him as in he comes in with a mate of his isaacwolfff he too has a medical condition in his case the eyes he eventually goes blind gus however is dying his cancer has affected his leg and hence has a prosthetic leg isaacs girlfriend monica dumps him when he goes fully blind sighting she cant deal with a person being blind gus and hazel go out with each other and develop romantic feelings for each other he uses a lovely metaphor with cigarettes he is about to light the cigarette he continues that if he doesnt light the cigarette that the cancer cannot be made worse you put the killing thing right between your teeth but you dont give it the power to do its killing a metaphor so it is revealed that hazel is book reader ie a book worm she has this particular book thats of interest to her she wants to head on over to amsterdam where the author is living the scene of where gus was on the plane and was told that was his first time i said to my friend i can totally sympathize with him as the plane was taking off i felt i was actually on the plane it went right through me i just have a fear of flying especially with the taking off even the thought of it makes me wanna vomit i just cant handle it ill prob need valium to control my anxiety as gus was taking off on the plane i felt his pain and excitement i was the same when the plane was moving he was smiling and excited and likewise myself when the plane reveed up to take off he started to get anxious like me gus was so meahem the plane scene that is then he said about the scenery looking out the window yep you guessed it same with me shame i couldnt take pics on the plane i think these days you can then shortly afterwards they arrived safe and sounds in amsterdam they came across peter van houtendafoe who is the book author that hazel is madly in love with she wanted to know the ending of the book he insulted her to the hills with particular reference to her illness i was so crushed to hear such words that she is  failed experiment in mutation he was such an ass gus reveals to hazel that his cancer has come back with a vengeance and hence he set up a prefuneral he wants her to read a eulogy sadly gus passed away the cancer ate up his heart previously his legs went the scene where she was crying her eyes lots of emotions came to mind namely my moms deathwhich obv hasnt occurred and my exs breakup as my heart was giving out to me with the stress of the breakup,sad
i think this is the first time in history where i have liked the film better than the book with all the hype surrounding the book and everyone who read it saying that they cried and loved the book to death i just didnt see what it was all about sure its a sad story and all but it didnt make me cry and i didnt get it however watching it on screen made a significant differencethe cast i feel was absolutely a perfect match for the characters and the acting was superb the chemistry between everyone was just spot on maybe thats why it did even more justice to the book i feel that thats the way film adaptations of books should be to bring the characters to life so that readersthe audience gets an insight to the characters which will have a stronger impact however i feel that this will be one a in a millionthe film followed very closely to the book but i feel that they made gus the main witty person in the book hazel was equally as witty and the banter between them was what kept the dialogue freshand its not really a problem i have but more of a questionwhy would the parents let her drive i mean i guess its ok for people with cancer to drive as long as theyre not in a critical stage but she has problems breathing isnt that incredibly risky she already has cancer why do they want to risk her dying earlier due to a car accident im thinking the answer to my question lies in the bookbut i cant remember maybe they just want her to do whatever and live the rest of her life happily it just seems pretty risky to methe ending for me was really well done it basically summarized what the whole story was about in one word a very well made and edited filmread the full review at championangelswordpresscom,sad
took five minutes to get i to the film but then was totally gripped such a sad but powerful movie which makes you leave the cinema feeling sorry for people in that situation and how lucky you are the two main leads played the part brilliantly and had so much chemistry the sidekick was a bit bizarre is parts and not that funny espapple clearly sponsored the film and was great marketing for them did not see it coming when gus told hazel he was actually dying very powerful and upsetting it would of been nice if they got engaged in amsterdam and married back in usa it was nice the author came to the funeral at the endoverall a great movie and left the cinema shocked and moved at the story,sad
i stepped into the theater hoping for a good movie i had seen the ratings on imdb and 84 was a very good score for a romantic drama i must say that i entered the cinema hall with high expectations but guess what i came out more satisfied than ever literally trying hard to keep my tears from rolling down my cheeksthis movie portrays the romantic life of two cancer patients and it is as good and as realistic as it gets no useless stuff no made up scenarios  it all seems natural i havent read the book so i had no idea what was coming and whatever was thrown at me i found it really good i couldnt predict how it would end atleast not exactly how it actually ended and it was a pleasant though sad surprise the story isnt sad  you start with 2 cancer patients you know how its gonna end but the love that bonds the lead characters even in a time of unbearable difficulty and to know that it will not last long is heart breaking even much before the movie ended i was contemplating as to what will happen to the characters later on in the storyif you are looking for an amazing romantic drama this is the best and the most realistic as it will ever get for those who cannot hold back their tears make sure you bring lots of tissues along youll need it,sad
this is a movie which makes you feel that no matter what you need somebody the carefree and confident gus is reduced to tears and fear as he faces his own mortality and it is then that the inspired hazel comforts him and frees him of his fearsin return of a small infinity that he gifts her in her numbered days with him she gives him immortality in her thoughts thats a heavy duty yet significant message and yes it makes one wonder that women afterall are the stronger set and bear the ultimate brunt he was the cool and confident guy and even sweetly cocky when he really got scared when his time came to face the challenge and she who had been so cynical adapted to life after love and showed him the real import of what he had taught her yes it gets so beautifully tangled that you are at once depressed hopeful and thrilled sounds like life does itthats the movie for ya,sad
even though i havent read the book i liked it quite a lot its not the usual movie with twists and turns its a straight forward movie about the lives of hazel grace and augustus watersthis movie will change the way what you feel about love yes  still some true love exists in this modern worldthis is one of the beautiful and sad movie that i have ever seen i am still thinking  how someone can give 1 star to this beautiful moviewhats their perspective of this moviei loved each and every scene in this film even though we know that we are watching in screens and not their real lives it will tempt you to crydon miss this movie,sad
based on the popular romantic novel by john green is another story about a pair of starcrossed lovers who care immensely for each other but couldnt be together due to their unfortunate circumstances i believe for those who have never read the book or watched the trailer would assume that this film to be those weepy sappy melodramatic mess right well not exactlysurprisingly the film is a heartwarming and touching love story wrapped in exceedingly witty dialogue and memorable one liners successfully preventing itself from making its way into melodramatic territory the comedy and romance is wellbalanced the film is also slightly mature and wise in its content and character perspectives what is oblivion is there any meaning or purpose in life can we truly outlast death by being remembered by everyone in the world what should we actually seek in our short lifethe main female lead hazel who suffered through cancer most of her life doesnt anticipate much from her life as her days are numbered out of nowhere here comes augustus a surprisingly charming cancer survivor whos seemingly optimistic about his future augustuss charming smile and his relentless devotion of love for hazel captured her heart theyre both equally smart and the onscreen chemistry between shailene hazel and ansel augustus made their instant connection believableshailene and ansel both provide convincing performances as a couple the romance was subtle feels honest and realistic for the audience to emotionally invested in them their affection for each other deepens as the film progresses and its heartbreaking to see that this relationship doesnt last i dont think im spoiling it as we all know what we signed up for even before watching it the film doesnt overly exploit the romance drama thats usually comes with the chronic disease which is commendable rather than making it the typical depressing melodramatic tearjerker the film has a bittersweet ending with surprising depth and meaning about lifethe eulogies written by the leads for each other is thoughtprovoking and heartfelt at the same time i have a few gripes about the film thoughi would appreciate if the film adds more scenes about their cancer sufferings cancer is not a joke the film seemingly gives an impression to the general audience that stage 4 cancer sufferers can still live and converse normally like many others without the repetitive timeconsuming treatments dealing with severe side effects from drugs or countless hospitalization the film does feel draggy a bit in some parts as well overall despite some shortcomings is still undeniably a decent romantic drama comedy thats well worth your time and moneyhttpyjcoolblogspotcom201407 rating 810,sad
well as the movie began i really had my doubts whether it would be any good or not mainly due to the quite fastpaced plot and the exaggerated character of gus i mean he was only eighteen or twenty years old and acted like someone too mature for his age he was just sogood at everything he was intelligent wellbred humble good looking and so on his character felt too unrealistic for me and i believed the whole movie would feel that way however i got the opposite everything else felt credible the characters are well written with highlights to van houten whose quotes are funny for being too absurd the directing is highly professional delivering lots of intense scenes like almost all involving the main couple shailene woodley and ansel elgort are also very professional and i cant find words to express how proud i feel for them they along with the marvelous directing are what make this film so intense sentimental romantic and somehow sad i didnt feel like crying for any moment but i heard that a lot of people did so thats a proof of how realistic the story looks like even if using a clichd main plot some people may consider it to be an overlysentimental picture but i believe there are films more appellative than this in the genre therefore if youre going to watch it keep in mind that there will be some or a lot of romanticism all in all its another great surprise in 2014,sad
a lot of you might know that i am a movie buff i religiously go to the movies every week some weeks more than once but i never found the need to write what i am about to write i have just come home after watching movie it is one of the most beautiful movies i have seen in decades after the action movie flood at box office hollywood and senseless movies bollywood this movie is such a pleasant change it leaves a sense of appreciation for life in you once you get up from those red velvet chairs i would really recommend this movie to all my friends its a must must watch i never give 10 to a movie but i guess i was saving it for this one,sad
i have not read the book that the movie fault in our stars is based on but i have heard good things about it the movie is good interesting in a world of social media and the information age the one thing this generation is striving for is love and human connection i watched this film late one night with a room full of tweeners and a bit older crowd i heard the girls swoon to the characters and even shed a tear or two the story revolves around two teenagers hazel and gaus who both are diagnosed with terminal disease they dont focus on their limited time or share in their anger that they will never grow old but fate has it they find each other this combination of souls are the ideal of any romantic and what hollywood seems probable on the big screen is often not true in real life when mixed up with the complexity of life there are some very touching scenes and even an old cynic like me was warmed by this movie that rekindled my inner yearning for a happily ever after,sad
calling a teen flick might sound a little bit stereotypical yes the primary target audience of this film is young adults but there are so many heavy emotions and relatable themes that it can even appeal to an older audience as well all of the issues that the film covers are real and tragic and we as an audience can feel for the characters and even grow to love themwatching hazel and augustus cope and struggle with their terminal cancer diagnoses feels so powerful that it appears as though it is really happening their love for each other grows even as their conditions worsen you can feel the pain that they feel and the deep bond that they shareas i sat in the theater with my girlfriend next to me in my arms i realized that life can end at any given second she is to me what hazel was to augustus perhaps the greatest lesson that i learned from this film is that if you love someone let them know it spend every second you can with them and make them the happiest person in the world because tomorrow it could all end the relationship between augustus and hazel did not feel real because it was real there was no acting it was genuine and heartfelt and we could feel the growing sense of sorrow and pain as augustus health began to rapidly decline we grew to love them as human beings not characters and were torn apart when the ending of the film arrivedi love this film i love it because of its heartfelt lesson that life is beautiful and that one should love it as they love the person that they wish to spend it with this is a film that needs to be seen because of its sheer power and its message,sad
went to see it today being a 20yo straight male i got some strange looks when at the funeral i was crying uncontrollably my advice bring as many tissues as you can carry a great movie the actors were first class i would recommend to anyone i would give it 9001 out of 10 if i could prepare to look like a mess afterwords  for all the girls out there dont wear mascara its not worth it prepare to be a blubbering wreck for an hour afterwords all you guys out there bring your girlfriend she will love it so will you it is a fantastic movie just starting to read the book the main characters are played so well you have to tell yourself it is just a movie but you will cry like a baby,sad

you gave me a forever within the numbered days and im gratefulis one of those rare romantic melodramas that succeeds thanks to its talented cast and its believable script considering how easy it couldve been to emotionally manipulate and exploit the audience with the material director josh boone did an excellent job of recreating a tender love story while avoiding clichs and one dimensional characters i was unfamiliar with john greens bestselling novel which this film was based on but i had high expectations for this film considering the script was adapted by scott neustadter and michael h weber whose work in 500 days of summer and the spectacular now i highly admired didnt disappoint thanks to yet another powerful performance from shailene woodley in my opinion her best work who played her character in such a natural way that she made the story feel believable considering the subject matter this film couldve been over manipulative but it never feels this way thanks to a smart and intelligent script and some strong performances the film balances these dramatic moments with grace and there were also some very funny moments that helped lighten the mood when things got grim this isnt like other cancer dramas im mostly thinking of my sisters keeper here which have mostly failed by being too exploitive because this film handles the material with grace its still a heartbreaking film but it is much more natural in the way it approaches the material this is one of those rare chick flicks that guys will actually enjoy as wellthis love story is narrated by hazel grace shailene woodley a teenager who has been diagnosed with stage 4 thyroid cancer and has to carry an oxygen tank with her at all times in order to breathe in an effort to get her out of the house her parents frannie laura dern and michael sam trammell convince her to join a cancer support group despite thinking its a waste of time something good comes out of it when she meets augustus waters ansel elgort he happens to be there supporting his friend isaac nat wolff who has a tumor in his eye and is about to lose his sight augustus himself is a former cancer survivor who lost his leg and is now wearing a prosthetic one from the moment they bumped into each other at the support group he just cant take his eyes off her and easily wins hazel over with his charm and wit the two become good friends although their relationship seems to be a bit more limited by time than most other couplesin order for a film like this to work it is important that the two main characters share a strong and believable chemistry together makes the most out of this thanks to strong and natural performances from both shailene woodley and ansel elgort the chemistry between the two is amazing allowing the relationship to feel authentic and captivating at the same time weve all seen what woodley can do and she has been amazing in every film shes been in but this is in my opinion her best performance to date ansel elgort on the other hand completely took me by surprise as i wasnt too impressed with his work in divergent but here he is incredibly charming nat wolff who was one of the main characters in josh boones previous film stuck in love has an important supporting role here considering his character helps break some of the dramatic tension with several laugh out loud moments those scenes really helped lighten up the mood and made this a much funnier film than what i was expecting laura dern and sam trammell are also convincing as the parents who are dealing with their daughters condition the scenes that really didnt work for me however were the ones involving willem defoe as the author of hazels favorite novel those scenes were just too weird and took me out of the story but its my only complaint for an otherwise incredibly captivating and tear inducing romantic drama,sad
i know there are different opinions about this particular titlethis is one of those movies which demands its viewers to get connected to it beautiful adaptation of the novel though i agree its bit cheesybut thats for the audience only basic reviewthe cast has done a decent jobbackground score fits well with the moviepace and language is just fine target audienceplease if you dont really connect well with emotional films i would advise to not for it because you would be your waste of your time only messagethis film makes us think about what cancer is i mean how one get crippled physically as well as physically watch for the awesome quotesrespect your life thank you god for this life,sad
while one might step into the theater expecting just an amazing love story of a young couple you might actually leave the hall with whole lots of additional surprising beautiful thoughts it brilliantly combines humors love inspiring and heartbreaking moments of the two main characters who suffer from cancers other than the love of the adorable couple it is also well balanced with the sweet family relationship and friendship which all of these elements are switching well between the fictional and the medical parts both shailene woodley and ansel elgort spark a great chemistry they immerse well into the characters and illustrate the audiences with different level of emotions the film does not use much of scores instead choose to manipulate musics that indeed fit the story perfectly it may also be one of the most pathetic film with sad moments and cancer suffering but the true beauty of this film is its beautiful metaphors and soulsalving quotes that remind all of us not to give up easily as life is always amazing for everyone,sad
i have looked after young people who face death from cancer this film adaption of a much loved book deals very honestly but sympathetically with these themes went with my daughter who is not much older than the main characters portrayed in the film a lot of my emotion came from realising again how i need to value our relationship in the present as you never know what is coming was very funny in parts and the leads played this strongly all the way through really believed in them as people have thought about it quite a bit afterwards which is always a mark of a good film for mesome of the character development was really well judged the guy leading the support group appeared to be a stereotype but then a later scene shows his ability to cut to the heart of an issuei thought the parents were not very well developed particularly guss parents but the film was already long enough and focusing on the leads was probably the right choicewe went on a habit breaker just turning up and seeing what was next on at our local cinema i think on any other night we might have seen something else so a good idea if you have not tried it,sad

when i read the book i rated it 45 for a reason i really really liked the books but in my opinion there is a lot of philosophy that can be removed  meanwhile i watched the movie and i can say its amazing  its the first movie i like more than the book  usually i dont like the movies because they are nothing compared to the books  but this is an exception the movie is so much like the book nothing new is created  its typically like the book but the only difference is that in the movie they have deleted a lot of the philosophy i didnt like and they kept the amazing ones  so its worth a 1010 and its the first movie i rated it more than the book,sad
3 12 out of 4 starsjohn greens novel has been a big hit for the past couple years it tells the story of two teenagers with cancer who fall in love it was only a matter of time until it was turned into a movie and fans of the book will not be disappointed by the filmjosh boones 2014 adaption of stays true to the novel thanks to its writers scott neustadter and michael h weber who also wrote 500 days of summer and the spectacular now there were one or two changes from the book and some things had to be eliminated if the film had an extra halfhour or hour it would be exactly like the book i have read the book and the things they had to take out make sense boones adaptation works very well thanks to its strong cast shailiene woodley is great as hazel and she has great chemistry with ansel elgort who plays augustus nat wolff laura dern and willem dafoe are also well cast although it can be sappy at times the cast makes the line works and we can care about these charactersthe film does have its faults though the editing is awkward at times and i thought the exposition seemed just a little rushed the music is good for the most part but there are awkward moments where the music doesnt work boom clap by charli xcx being the strangest however there are moments where the music fits perfectly like ray lamontagnes without words and m83s waitis effectively brought to the big screen fans of the book and people who havent read it should enjoy it it may not be a movie for everybody but its a solid adaptation,sad
not all movies are academy award caliberthe characters fit their roles there was no pam anderson or similar male lead playing a cancer victim yes there were a few awkward scenes ones that made you think why did they do that but the message of the movie was one that made you feel decent human emotionsif you want to critique a movie based on some higher cinematic criteria something other than reality then review edge of tomorrow or transformers dont get me wrong when i want to escape reality i head for the science fiction or 3d animations and enjoy my time watching these movieswhen i want to see a movie that i think is an oscar contender i go see that movie with that thought in my mind and review it accordinglywhen i watch a movie intended to make us think about god life caring for each other then i want to see something such aswhen i want to see a movie that makes me somehow feel good about humanity that lets me think that we are not all self absorbed money grubbing degenerates then i go see a movie like heaven is for real or gods not deadwatching these movies makes me walk out of the theater feeling good and wanting to make a difference in peoples livesand when i review these movies i do so thinking did they reach their target audience did they make me experience the emotions that fit the storyline did the movie bring me back closer to the people around me and if i answer yes to these questions then the movie was worth seeing and recommending to othersif thats what you want to experience then go see,sad
i was waiting forward for this movie simply because i read the book and the trailer looked promising as a reader i found it represented the novel quite well despite the fact that of course some parts didnt make it to the scene including my favorite line about amsterdam freedom and sin those beautiful actors played their part beautifully although some scenes that were supposed to be painful didnt seem as painful as it should be yes my emotion as a spectator wasnt built as strong as when i read the written version i was a bit moved while isaac was reading his eulogy but not a single tear was shed i came into the cinema with a pack of kleenex and it remained full until the end of the show anyway that okay okay part nailed it it made me walk out of the cinema smiling ,sad
all in all it was a great movie being a fan of the book seeing shailene woodley as hazel was disappointing i personally didnt think she was a good choice still a pretty good adaptation of the book i just have a few complaints in the book gus had an exgirlfriend who died of cancer named caroline mathers gus being in a prior relationship contributed greatly to the story also in the book hazel has a friend named kaitlyn i dont recall kaitlyn being a character in the film a few more forgotten characters gus sisters and nephews all in all a great film however having read the book a few times i was dissatisfied with the character neglect,sad
this movie is about a cute sick love story of hazel grace and augustus two cancerstricken teenagers who met in a support group its not entirely a unique kind of love story but at least its not about vampires  ahemhaving read the book before seeing the film i have to say i have a lot of respect to the director for staying true to the book while im happy the film didnt stray too far from the novel i feel like everything was rushed and compressed into this 2hour moviegood news or bad newsokay bad one i was a little disappointed that the movie made it seem like hazels life only revolved around gus sure its a love story but people dont stop having noncancer friends once they get cancer hazel has a life outside gus she goes out with friends she goes to school or something which leads me to my second disappointment the author john green had a cameo in a mall scene where hazel hung out with someone other than gus but it was deleted i mean the movie would not be possible if it werent for freaking john green third the film almost completely neglected the video game books that gus and eventually hazel were so obsessed about not that it mattered that much and finally this part goes for the novel cause it wasnt included in the film i just dont see anything alright with the idea of gus being interested in hazel the first time he saw her because she looked like his deceased exgirlfriend at least thats how i see it from how it was written anyway the last piece of bad news probably made the movie a little better because it wasnt included moving onthe good the film stayed true to the book the support group isaacs breakdown the funky bones the anne frank house kiss the steamy you knowwhattheydid scene the prefuneral i could go on for another 30 minutes describing how beautiful those scenes and more were brought to life these scenes were how i imagined them as i read the book if not better i love how the mood of a certain scene translates to my own as i watch it so good it gave me goosebumps oh and its true what they say that you have to bring tissues the entire theater will cry hell i usually feel embarrassed if i feel like crying over a movie but with this one go ahead no ones gonna judge you,sad
for everyone who has waited for this in a long time it would be amazing to finally see a movie turn out to be so much like the book they use the little quotes the big lines everything okay not every detail can be in it but we must forgive that look at other movies which dont even come close to the book no this movie is a good one it is obvious that john green was at the set and helped out if it wasnt going the way the book was goinghowever compared to all the emotion in the book i must admit that in the movie it was barely of course i cried im a girl come on however i didnt really cry because of what happened on the screen but more because i thought how that felt when i read it in the book i think that they could have done a much better job with the emotions there were a lot of people crying in the cinema so i doubt if they agree with me but i found it all with all a bit emotionless for the person who watched it it was for example just hazel crying to me it was nothing more still i have to give one compliment for the way they use text messages absolutely brilliant im just a bit disappointed because i thought it would be a real tear jerker but it wasnt,sad
the book made me cry and i am watching the movie tomorrowmy friends say they were sobbing and the book made me cry and i really want to see this movie the book is an inspiration because hazel knows who she is and she knows what might happen to her in a matter of timebut she never lets it stop her she doesnt let anything stop her she is basically fearless because knowing what will happen to her eventually she cares more about other things and other people this book is the reason i need to do what i want to do and im not going to let anything stop me just like hazel doesnt let anything stop her hazel lets augustus into her life knowing the consequences and knowing its not the best idea but she does it anyway fearless hazel is a fictional character but she could never be more real her personality is real her personality is as real as it can be real means fearless or strong enough to get over your fear thank you john green,sad
given the reviews and even the preview i expected so much more from this movie the movie is about 2 teens who meet and fall in love all the while cancer is hovering ominously in the backgrounddespite its predictability there is much to appreciate in this film i was engaged from start to finish the film feels like it goes by quickly occasionally its amusing usually due to gus fantastic wit gus is a teenage girls dream hes superconfident with a very open stance to life shown even by how he stands he looks like a portrait of style and health in his signature leather jacket hes incredibly surprisingly funny at times and most distinctively he wont be discouraged or deterred or successfully rebuffed by any amount of stonewalling or reluctant rejection from hazel but is utterly determined to wear her down with his persistent affection magically as though a hollywood screenwriter wrote a script for him he knows just what to say to slither his way through the 1 narrow crack in hazels heart as the trailer shows this feature could either be a pro or con on the 1 hand the screenwriter knows what teens want to hear and see from a teenage boyfriend namely a guy who is totally crazy about you without you doing anything and apparently even though he barely knows you i really enjoy shailene woodley as an actress she seems habitually cast in the role of a young woman who could easily be a wallflower with a subtlequiet personality but who upon examination has an endearing way about her shailene as hazel is as winsome as she could be within the constraints of the script and plot which is also true of gus character her mannerisms are natural and as always shes a sympathy garnering enjoyable character to watch though i didnt see the sense of humor that gus compliments her on nor any special or distinct qualities that would cause me to view her through gus ostensibly enamored eyes this movie was pure sap through and through some viewers like this but for me it felt very heavy enclosed even suffocating basically all love stories center on 2 people looking at each other but when the 3rd main character is cancer which is present from the start and eventually separates the characters that is a surefire formula for a very heavy drama added to this mix is the storys apparent philosophy of nihilism positing that theres nothing out there and nothing thereafter only this life this makes one question what if gus had never met hazel what about the tons of kids who die of cancer without much love in their lives were their lives then just a drop of water in a huge pool leaving ripples for a few seconds then leaving no sign of ever having existed in any significant way i left the theatre quite depressed and somewhat annoyed by the cloying heaviness of the movie as other reviewers have stated the plot line follows a familiar course and one gets a sense of deja vu havent i see this before this makes me sigh and wonder why this film couldnt have been more creative mixed it up more also even after 2 hours i still dont feel like i know the characters since the plot focuses on their obsession with a book and meeting an author but we are given no insight into the psyches of these characters in many major areas of their lives i feel like im given a glimpse into the romance of 2 characters but that major pivotal information is left out that would enable me to understand them better and care more about their story as a result i cared very little about whether their love would endure or be terminated early by cancer or other circumstancesif youre looking for a better teen romance i recommend shailene woodleys the spectacular now that movie is much better at opening ones mind to embrace life instead of closing our minds with a predictable plot and depressing philosophy,sad
in an amazing film made from a dreadful book which is strange because its usually meant to be the other way around the film brought the characters that lacked depth in the book to life though the plot and monologues in the book seemed a little to convenient and predictable for literature it was perfect for the movie i do give a congratulations to josh boone scott neustadter michael h weber shailene woodley and ansel elgort for resurrecting a plot with great potential from the grave and to the stars for their amazing performances is worth seeing but i do recommend that you see it eitheraon your own or bwith anybody that is not a teenager girl that read the book and saysthis is going to be best movie ever until mockingjay comes out in the fall because she will ruin it when she stars crying in an obnoxious matter at all of the obvious parts of the movie i also recommend that unless you want to be disappointed with this amazing film do not read the book first it will ruin you,sad
i dont know where to start this movie was amazing and magical the characters were just unique the story is very wonderful and so realistic this story is very inspiring and we can learn a lesson from it please read the book and watch the movie because you will be more grateful for what you have in life after this wondrous experiencexoxo gossip isabelleps read the book and watch the movie okayhazel is it really almost 1 gus guess so hazel i gotta get to sleep gus ok hazel ok neither one of them want to hang up the phone gus ok hazel ok they both laugh at this gus perhaps ok will be our always,sad
cant wait to watch the movie in theaters everyone is like going crazy about this movie and im really curious to watch the full movie the story is great the book also i hope the movie is even better because the cast seems to be the right one it is just perfect movies like this are so inspiring they make you think about life love and your dreams on how to live your life and not to waste not even an insignificant second it all matters life is a long time journey we have to live it right fully and always tell what we feel to everyone who is important to us movies like this make you stop for a minute and think what you want to do with your life before it is too late,sad
teenage terminal cancer sufferer hazel attending a support group under protest meets the sparky entertaining and attractive gus also a cancer sufferer but in remission the two of them find much to like in each other and emotions growi havent read the book on which this film was based taken solely on its own merits it is a rather likable and entertaining take on a very serious subject as it tries to draw a distinction between one one hand who people are and on the other the handicaps under which they may live the performances are universally good the quality comes in little moments wellwritten which give the actors a chance to shine for me the best of these was the moment when gus supreme selfconfidence cracks when grace is about to see his amputated leg for the first time shailene woodley as grace gives another great performance of a quality able to carry the film albeit she doesnt need to due to very able support by ansel elgort as gus woodley has the quality of being both beautiful and ordinary at the same time which makes her a compelling screen presence and the fact that she can act doesnt hurt eithera film about teenagers with terminal cancer is never going to have a conventionally happy ending but this film does well by a delivering a positive ending b entertaining us throughout c giving us some surprises along the way and d playing fair with its subject matter if i had one criticism it would be that ugly people get cancer tooi left the cinema dryeyed but i suspect that many may not,sad
i felt like i was watching the book being read to me in front of my eyes every single scene and every single line from the book was in the movie im not lying willem dafoes performance as peter van houten was so well done ive never fallen in love with a movie before until now shailene woodley and ansel elgorts performance just stole my heart away i almost had tears coming out of my eyes this movie was so deep in my heart the charisma between the two main leads felt so real i recommend anyone who is looking for a very good romantic drama to check this one out also check out john greens other novels as well one more thing  nat wolff was so amazing in this movie,sad
if a walk to remember and my sisters keeper had a baby this would be it is just like any other cancer love story one of them has cancer or in this case both and one dies before the other can do something amazing it just seems like the whole scenario is overused at least this didnt glamorize having cancer like most of those movies do it showed how hard it was instead of everybody trying to make the situation better even though it had the starcrossed lovers it wasnt a total clich the only problem was with the dialogue and the whole thing with metaphors not everything is a metaphor and nobody talks the way augustus does and news flash nobody just puts a unlit cigarette in their mouth just because its a metaphor,sad
im not writing this review because i loved the film im simply writing this to argue the 1 and 2 star reviews it got the plot was clichd and done before and boring it wasnt it was something a big different it pushed some boundaries and encouraged laughter acceptance and empathy out of the audiencepeople on here are saying a girl who from 13 knew she was going to die they call her pessimistic i mean come on i bet those people moan about pointless day to day worries such as money possessions and work dying of cancer is a real problem get a gripit was well acted funny in parts it also pulled at my heart strings and i cried a few times sure in some parts its easy to predict but there are normally only one or two ways a film can go so guessing a 50 chance isnt difficult curve balls maybe could have been thrown to make us think omg but to me it was a great movie and ill happily see it again,sad
i mean wow from the moment it started i was immediately sucked straight into the beautiful and traumatic world of these two characters hazel and augustus now i have read the book and the book is so incredible it made me doubt how this film would turn out i had very high hopes for this film and was incredibly scared they were going to ruin the book i could not be more wrong i cried so many times and was completely 100 captivated it is definitely the best film i have seen this year beating out my love for captain america the winter soldierthe chemistry between the characters was so captivating and incredible was so heartgrabbing and i cant even begin to speak about the casting department without getting overwhelmed they could not have casted a better cast for this film shailene woodley ansel elgort and nat wolff are so extraordinary in this film that word does not even do them justice they 100 absolutely created such emotion comedy and beauty straight up i am a particular fan of ansel elgort and the way he played his character augustus waters it reflects the character in the book perfectly down to the captivating smile and quick wit he really made the character come to life and made the film incredible ansel made this film funny and witty and made you instantly fall in love with the character the chemistry between the whole cast was stunning and really showed in the film it made it seem so real which is what this film intended to do the actors brought such emotion issac played by nat wolff was so funny intentionally and unintentionally he was brilliant i would argue he made the film completely what it is brilliant all the other characters were casted perfectly and again consistently with the book they did miss out a few scenes from the book in this film which i expected but they managed to only cut out minor scenes the film was extremely close the book and was just lacking a better word perfect it moved me and everyone in the cinema including the guys i recommend everyone goes and see it you dont have to read the book to be moved by this film but the film will make you want to read it it is that good even the soundtrack is incredible and the camera work is just exquisite you are under direct orders to go and see this film just make sure to take lots of tissues its a nonstop heartwrenching tearjerking beautiful romantic drama and with the help of some incredible acting and directing it is also a little comedic,sad
oh how i cried but oh how i loved this movie learning to deal with cancer while learning to deal with life presents problems that a person will have no knowledge of unless having gone through it or having known someone who has as this film leads us to discover with a strong family a good friend or two as much humor as you can dredge up and love it can be done as well as it can be done shailene woodley as hazel and ansel elgort as gus will grab your heart and break it in the process their roles were played to complete perfection the plot the dialogue the actors and actresses chosen to be these peopleit was all flawless from my point of view i know i wasnt the only member of the audience to be shedding tears but those tears drew us into this picture and made us a part of the story this is a good one,sad
warning contains spoilers i cried a lot at this movie it just dragged me through an emotional roller coaster it was also one of the funniest movies ive ever seen with peter van houten and okaythe chemistry between shailene and ansel really gave hazel and gus romance a real life feel i would recommend this movie to anyonealsothe movie was really close to the book ive never read a book thats had a movie that was almost exactly like it i do think that you should read the book before you watch the movie suggestion bring tissues,sad
these days youngadult fiction is everywhere dystopian stories of moody youths undergoing strife war and heartache as in the hunger games or divergent are dominating the bestseller lists and popping up in cineplexes whats so unusual about an adaptation of john greens bestselling novel is that it locates the dystopia and war within the bodies of its teenage protagonists these kids arent battling an evil regime or fascist overlords theyre struggling to survive against the merciless onslaught of cancer greens book is a bit of an odd beast touching but manipulative genuine and fake all at the same time the resulting film being hugely faithful to its source material thus manages to pull off the same curious trick of overwhelming and underwhelming the viewer often in the same breathhazel shailene woodley has been living with  or dying of  terminal cancer for years her concerned parents mike trammell underused and laura dern wonderfully sympathetic fuss around her constantly wanting her to live what life is left to her after the treatments and exhaustion have taken their toll and so hazel attends a support group for kids stricken with cancer one day she meets augustus waters ansel elgort a charming sweet kid whose remission came at the price of a leg they share an immediate connection one that deepens as they bond over hazels favourite book an imperial affliction penned by reclusive author peter van houten willem dafoe knowing how much it means to hazel augustus resolves to get her the answers she seeks about the novel  even if they have to travel all the way to amsterdam to get themif that sounds like a recipe for melodrama thats because it is theres plenty of that in store of course because these kids are dealing with the worst and most traumatic of experiences at a time when they should be healthy and carefree but the film as did the novel does a pretty good job of maintaining a spark of cheeky life amidst all the doom and gloom hazel and augustus trade banter as easily as they do insults and the affection that grows between them is as entertaining as it is affecting woodley and elgort share a gentle chemistry that works very well whether theyre in the throes of first love or battling through the trenches of disease side by side their friendship with isaac nat wolff the boy who loses his sight to eye cancer and his girlfriend to her selfabsorption is wonderfully bittersweet too  together the trio ride the lows of isaacs depression and the highs of his tiny moment of vengeancebut for everything that feels raw and real in the film also comes across as overly plotted hazel and augustus are designed specifically to break your heart and swell your tear ducts which is why their relationship can sometimes feel painstakingly constructed they are quite literally made for each other which weighs down rather than frees the story in which they find themselves their interactions with the troubled prickly van houten also lose some impact in the move away from the page where his words ideas and general depravity can take fuller form in the film dafoe ensures that van houten remains tough to like but the characters rougher edges are sanded away in a halfhearted bid for redemptionultimately the film  which lifts entire lines and scenes wholesale from greens text  triumphs and suffers where the book does the relationship between hazel and augustus when stripped to its core is a heartbreakingwarming account of a souldeep connection that matters all the more for its tragic brevity theres a lot of welcome saddening depth in the film too about the everyday heroism of children being forced to live on the brink of death everyday but this is also a deliberately manipulative tale one that hinges on an awkward twist present in both book and film that practically dares you not to care and cry about whats going on its an effective tactic for the most part but one that doesnt earn so much as exhaust its audiences affections,sad
i was finally able to see at the theater and i was beyond pleased with the movie adaptation of a book that i thoroughly enjoyed and reread multiple times movie adaptations arent always faithful or as satisfying as a book seeing as they are understandably a different medium and therefore different story than their book counterpart but was an adaptation that i felt was complete and matched the novel by john green very well while also adding extra details that i felt added to the love and life story of two teenagers who as asserted in the movie are more than just their illnessa basic overview rating from me castingacting i found casting to be very well done shailene woodley playing a spunky yet sensitive lead alongside talented ansel elgort who played a confident contemplative and very romantic augustus waters initially i wasnt too sure if elgort could pull off this character but he actually blew me away with his performance and even brought more to the character in my opinion i also really liked the parents along with the fact that the teens in support group were actual cancer survivorscinematically costumes were modern and typical to what one would expect to see in todays world not too fashion conscious or anything but added to the characters personalities settings were realistic and spoiler amsterdam was beautifully portrayed a favorite cinematic scene of mine being the champagne scenei actually didnt cry as much as i expected although tears were shed just not always at the expected parts i believe this was due to the fact that i had read the book and knew the story line well prior to seeing the thankfully similar movie i actually cried some during the scenes between hazel and her parents an odd occurrence seeing that i as a teen and not a parent and would typically connect more and pay attention more to the teen characters of the story however the actual relationship between hazel and her parents is swayed based upon how a person reads the book and in the film the actors portrayal of parentchild relationship was a lot more poignant for me because of actually visually seeing their emotions and actionsseeing the film however added to my understanding and love of the story many visual details and connections could be made through this medium of storytelling that wasnt always as noticeable or possible in printmovie spoilers below even if you read the book the eulogy scene in the church had me crying partly for hazels speech but mostly when i saw gus cry from the book and also his comment later i knew that his tearful reaction was because he was picturing the world without him and hazel grace not being together which he affirmed in his eulogy for hazel it was heartbreaking for me to watch some of the anguish a young person has to knowing his time and subsequent world is limitedas soon as birdys not about angels began the tissues came out of my purse yet again the connections and implications of this song brought out even more emotion due to its direct lyric connection to guss questions on hazels beliefs at the restaurant in amsterdam what about god her answer being no along with answers saying she doesnt believe in angels but shes unsure in an afterlife in that scene at the restaurant hazel states she doesnt believe in angels but now that gus has passed she is considering the question again what about angels does she know have faith that gus could be an angel watching over her from every angle i believe there is a perspective and emotion that every person in the audience is capable of finding in this movie despite its label as a young adult book adaptation even though it is a story involving cancer it does have many cute romantic and even funny scenes and dialogue parts of this movie will be difficult to watch though it is a story about two teens suffering from a world of cancer of course but in the words of john green in tfios sometimes you read a book and it fills you with this weird evangelical zeal and you become convinced that the shattered world will never be put back together unless and until all living humans read the book or in this case movie but dont for a second think this movie is only about cancer it is about life,sad
i quite liked this movie the acting was great it was funnysad and sweet all in one i loved that all the characters felt very real the movie can be very tense at timeshazel and gus are a very believable couple and they do not just hop into bed eitherit takes awhile for them to get there one of the best parts of the movie though was the portrayal of hazels parents they were loving and supportiveone of the best parents i have seen in a movie in fact the only fight they really have is because hazel as a only child is worried what will happen when they she dies and they no longer have a child to look afterthis is a beautiful film and life and love,sad
i was one of those people who had read the book before seeing the film unfortunately when readers read a good book they can use their imagination and create whatever visual they want in their heads and it takes that book and story and makes it wonderful for them whenever the movie version is made the director knows people have high expectations and has to make the characters from the book come alive and be utterly believable i am not a fan of woodley she is overexposed and like lawrence or stewart keeps appearing in too many movies back to back butshe was excellent in this role how difficult to have ansel play your brother in the movie divergent only weeks before then have the guy appear on the screen as your love interest next this is the stuff that makes me crazy about hollywood the same people appear too often with that being said they both portrayed the ill teens in an excellent manner laura dern was a bit over the top for me and too sappy i love trammel and thought he was in the background too much the first half of the movie seemed too slow and draggy for me but then i also knew what was coming so i stuck with it its the last half of the film that grabs the audience the moment he takes hazel outside and sits on that park bench in amsterdam then the movie gets good if there arent at least a couple of oscar nods on this ill be surprised because the film deserves them some reviewers didnt like the music that would swell up during certain scenes but i actually didnt notice the music which is a good sign that the film has you in its grip 8 out of 10 for me only because of the slow first 45 mins in the beginning and some truly sappy moments,sad
lets be honest with ourselves  this is a love story in the same vein as romeo and juliet and well love storyok  spoiler alert aheadthe move concerns two teenagers who are both fighting cancer the girl  hazel  has a cancer that is slowly destroying her lungs the boy gus lost a leg to cancer hazel starts out as tragic but learns to live again by her relationship with gus gus is an unusual character he refuses to be overwhelmed by his cancer or at least tries to make his mark on the worldthis is pretty much the film it would be just another piece of mindless fluff designed for a female audience and to be honest with you there were about 20 women to every guy in the theaterexcept for the teenagers wit a classic line is when gus hazel and a third boy issac he lost both eyes to cancer decide to egg the house of issacs exgirlfriend when the mother of the girlfriend comes out gus announces that between the three of them they have 5 legs 4 eyes two pairs of working lungs and the mother had better get back in the house there is also a meeting with an author of a book that holds great significance to the teenagers they arrange to meet him in amsterdam not surprisingly to me anyway the guy turns out to be a total jerk still the film is not without some heavy handed references to living in the face of death while in amsterdam the kids go to the anne frank museum obviously anne frank is a teenager who faced death at a uncertain time while in the museum some quotes from anne frank that are relevant to the film are conspicuously presented nonetheless the film doesnt drag thanks to the humorous bits nicely spaced into the film it is largely formula to be sure although having the boy die instead of the girl was a bit of a surprise so while it is good it really is not anything spectacularly special either,sad
this film is the saddest film i have watched but it is also great because it shows us that you shouldnt always take everything for granted and that life doesnt last forever there will soon be a day when your life comes to an end or family members does and this film shows you that nothing last forever it would be great and im sure everyone will go and watch another film like this because i know i will cant get over how brilliant this film is and it also shows that cancer can sometimes get the better of you and can come at any time cant stop crying after i watched the film credit to the author it really was such a brilliant movie and i would love see another film like this x,sad
going into seeing this film i didnt know what to expect i havent read the book even though now i really want to the film itself is surprisingly well put together of course it falls into the same formula of the average romantic comedy of having to be centered with the couple and how they fall in love and surprisingly this is very over dramatic i dare say it is one of the best of its kind i would call this a slice of life type of story if you ask me personally it is emotionally driven and provocative each of the characters are well portrayed especially our main female protagonist hazel which is played by shailene woodley i will not be surprised if she gets a oscar this year for this performance cause i was shocked i remember seeing her as this pregnant teenager in the hit tv show secret life of a american teenager and now we can see how matured she is in her acting skills i really recommend people to see this mostly to those who have dates but i will assure you will have a good time and will not regret seeing this wonderful film,sad
ive been waiting for a very long time for this movie and as soon as it came out in the uk i went to go see it i absolutely loved it my expectations were high because everyone around me said it was just like the book and it was amazing and it really was i thought i would be disappointed because sometimes movie adaptations can go horribly wrong take the mortal instruments for example i was so happy when i heard there was going to be a movie out like finally this story is coming to life and everyone can see how amazing all these characters in the book are it was so beautifully done the way the music fit in every perfect scene and each of the cast played their role so beautifully and perfectly im so thankful for shai nat ansel for playing the main roles incredibly and just taking us all on this rollercoaster ride the great thing about this movie is that you can get emotionally attached to it the way the characters such as hazel lets you in on her story and just makes you believe that youre really there witnessing it this movie is definitely a tear jerker and it will break your heart so be prepared this movie was phenomenal and it was a privilege to get my heart broken again but this time by the movie it was done amazingly well and thank you josh boone for making such an amazing story come to life you can really connect with this movie and especially the characters the way they are portrayed in this movie is just sensational and they bring such life to this story and its so beautiful and so lovely,sad
there are so many critical reviews about this title that i shouldnt probably take my chance at doing it since i am pretty sure that all i would have to say has already been mentioned by others more gifted than i am at analyzing and defending their point of view from a movie criticallyatease perspective the movie managed to touch me to transport me just as it did to so many viewers according to what i can read here and thats the point for me so it is wellworth a ten the script the directing the acting they are all in harmony just like a wellperformed symphony where everything is there where it needs to be in order to get the audience well and beyond time and space the point of my review is simply to suggest another great movie i have seen that was reminded to me by well a different movie that is being so much in tune with this one from a different perspective of course and that is hasta la vista so i would end by saying just like on the site of imdb if you liked you may also like hasta la vista a flemish movie of 2011 give it a try,sad
these are films for receiving any luck although based on a bestseller the story about a character affected by cancer should not receive much attention in cinema considering the invasion on tv about this kind of telefilms but nevertheless took the box office arriving at 1st place and temporarily blurring the attention of maleficent on the public but it would not be big news if it were not also surrounded by laudatory reviews in specialized media journalismand truth feels like a tv movie but more budget follow the outline of a tv movie with characters who are collaterally developed only get voice and presence when sharing scene with any of the protagonists and characters which we see for a moment and then not see them again during a considerable time which is a symptom of directtodvd films which are poorly edited or unprepared eg lol featured miley cyrus thats why warning little spoilers in the next sentence the appearance of willem dafoe in the funeral is meaningless and the meeting between shailene woodley and nat wolff in the end has no coherence since they are not strictly friends but their friendship is only appearance maintained by the link gave by ansel elgort then only serves as a deus ex machina to wolff advise about the letter the worst punished is sam trammell who not only has little presence but even his acting is not convincing looking more like a adult friend than a father but what really superfluous are the flashbacks of the protagonist as a child which are completely standard and could have been omittedthe problem of is not to follow the steps of a television drama heres shailene woodley and ansel elgort in a truly bizarre turn of events have gone from being brothers in the hit divergent to be dating in this film although there are not too creepy innuendos that could emphasize this pseudoincest and in case of woodley her performance is not just good but brilliant what is even more remarkable considering her poor performance in divergent elgort is pretty good but pales in dramatic moments and must contend with an overly indulgent scriptand is that part of the errors is the script focused over elgort incurring in the vices of the new hollywood cinema apparently there is now a very strong belief in business where the adolescents should be very confident and loving for the public to sympathize with them while the interpretation and charisma of ansel elgort do not bother the script is so desperate to make him a lovable character who flooded in a sea of improbability of course as soon as he meets the girl elgort does not remove the look in her and even the first day invited to his house where she accepts the invitation who said that a woman is difficult to conquer not only do these exaggerated first steps but some improbable nonsense for a teenager like lending a friend trophies to destroy them or the cigarette metaphor which is good in theory but in practice is shameful moreover in any case would be fine the nonsense about the cigarette within the protagonists circle but the desperate script does not conform and decides to cross barriers so they tell the cigarette metaphor to a stewardess as if the stewardess mattered actually she does not carethis review continues on my personal tumblr reviews and the city tumblr which has no commercial purpose now,sad
im not exactly sure how i feel about film adaptation on one hand i thought the casting was perfect especially gus and issac and i loved that the movie remained completely true to the novel but on the other hand the movie didnt really resemble the novel at all never would i willingly read a book or watch a movie about a romance between two teenagers with cancerthe whole concept just reeks of cheap sentimentality but i read tfios because i was familiar with john greens work and i knew that his take on cancer wouldnt be your average clichd cancer storyand of course it wasnt for all its pretentious unrealistic dialogue and overcrowded metaphors the book managed to turn a clichd concept into a witty cynical but ultimately hopeful story that evoked sisyphus hence the hamster in an imperial affliction being named after the mythological figure cancer was hazel and augustus rock but it was their rock and they made the best of it the point green makes in the novel is that shakespeares notion that the faultis not in the stars but in ourselves is pretty much bs the fault is in our stars in a seemingly random chaotic universe that hands out cancer to undeserving kidsi didnt get that depth from the movie at all while i enjoyed watching hazel fall in love with gus slowly the movie went down hill when she fell in love with him all at once the film suddenly turned into what hazels voiceover kept insisting it wasnt a gooey tragic cancer story the trouble is that i dont know how the script or direction could have been altered to give the movie the books poignancy like i said it was completely true to the novel maybe they could have made hazels mom less of a horribly stereotypical mom she was the worst part of the film in my opinion maybe just as hazel cant breathe without her oxygen tank john greens story simply cant thrive without his prose,sad
this has got to be the first time ive ever given a movie 1010 it was truly outstanding i am a huge fan of the book and for such a long time that my copy is first edition its also my favourite book of all time and im going to say something about this film that i rarely say about booktoscreen adaptations this film really done the book justice ansel elgort was perfect as augustus and shailene woodley was perfect as hazel they kept all the best parts in the book and while they couldve they didnt reduce it to some rubbish chickflick the beauty and the integrity of the book was there in the film and any fan of the book will be pleased with this film i strongly recommend it whether you read the book or not,sad
i was so excited to see this movie and i do love sad movies but i didnt like something about this movie like when i normally watch a sad movie i feel depressed and will think about it for a while but i just didnt think too much about this because it was too depressing it laid it on waaay too thick it did not need to be that depressing i didnt see the point but the movie was smoothly engineered to make the audience sob uncontrollably and yes it achieved it for most people literally you could hear the whole theatre sobbing i think i was the only one that wasnt crying but i never do anywayacting by shailene woodley and the people who played her parents and the guy isaac was really good too some parts were really funny as well surprisingly and it was filmed really well in terms of how it all lookedoverall its worth a watch to see what the hypes about but it is overlong pretentious dialogue depressing great actinga lot of crying in to the cameratype shotsoften funny very saccharine and predictableeven though i had not read the book personally although it was not badi would definitely never see it again,sad
i know a lot of people dont like bookmovie comparison but i am sorry and here you go is a very good movie adaptation of the book with the same name i quite enjoyed the movie and i really appreciated some details and effort in the production the v for vendetta poster in gus room hazels chuck tailors in amsterdam and the almostthesameasbook dialogues i liked the actors particularly van hauten portrayed by the amazing willem dafoe definitely the good details overwhelm some cringeworthy things like hazels room terminal ill kid that need a o2 bottle everywhere she goes gets tired super quickly need elevators to get around in buildings the anna frank scene underline how big of a deal was for her and then you put her room on a top of some stairs under the roof seriously the movie until amsterdam was almost flawless adapted when it came to the last part of the movie i was kinda sad with some choices i understand that they wanted this movie to be liked by a very young kind of public but i kinda preferred the much more adult approach of the book i didnt like the death approach in the movie its too light taken its not spoken enough is not conscious enough and the character of hazel its too much joyful the illness of gus is too simple its not enough dramatic and its way way to fast in the book the whole part of gus dying is a 45 chapters heartbreaking marathon his physical along with his personality deterioration is slow painful inevitable hard to read his mind suffers from the cancer as his body and it is shown to us by the powerless and inlove hazel gus in the movie was looking too sharp too brilliant and too much in a good shape till the end a lot of powerful and heartbreaking scenes are missing from the adaptation i am unsure if rate 7 or 8 i might change my rating later on said this i still think its a very good movie and i think anyone should watch it but most importantly read the book,sad
now the top grossing film in the us josh boones drama of cancerstricken teenagers can be overtly manipulative and traverses a thin line between honest sentiment and maudlin sentimentality yet it succeeds where others have failed because of the authentic emotion generated by its lead actors shailene woodley the descendants the spectacular now and newcomer ansel elgort who display a rare chemistry together based on the bestselling novel by john green and adapted for the screen by scott neustadter and michael h weber on the surface the film is about cancer but is in reality more a poignant character study of the thoughts feelings and connections that teenagers make with each other and the world told from her point of view 17yearold hazel grace lancaster has had thyroid cancer since she was thirteen because her lungs are prone to filling with fluid and interfere with her ability to breathe she has to carry an oxygen tank with her at all times hazel is mature for her age and in woodleys remarkably expressive performance conveys a nuanced emotional range running from a resigned cynicism to a witty commentator on life but always with an innocence and intelligence in a voiceover that begins the film hazel tells us that this isnt just a movie it is the truth sorry it is a bold claim that in spite of the filmmakers sincere attempt does not always live up to its promise and there are as many false notes and genre clichs as there are moments of livedin reality concerned about their daughters depression hazels mom frannie laura dern and dad michael sam trammell encourage her to go to a cancer support group at the local church when her mother tells her that she knows that depression is a side effect of cancer hazel jumps in and says her depression is not a side effect of cancer its a side effect of dying this oh so clever remark might seem pretentiously literary coming from someone else but when woodley says it it feels just right hazel reluctantly attends the support group and shares her observations with other cancer survivors but one in particular catches her attention a tall goodlooking boy of eighteen named augustus elgort whose battle with cancer has left him with a prosthetic leg gus radiates charm and sincerity and tells the group that he is there only to support his friend isaac nat wolff who is in danger of losing both eyes to cancer both hazel he calls her hazel grace and gus relate to each other in a thoughtful way and even the most potentially awkward dialogue comes across as natural when he tells her that she is beautiful and later when he looks in her eyes and tells her how much he loves her it sounds deeply felt and authentic the two talk about their favorite books and what their life is about and the imminent spectre they face of an early death he tells her that he plans for his life to have a meaning that will remembered through the ages to which she reminds him that there will come a time when none of us on the planet will be remembered hazel says that her favorite book is an imperial affliction a novel about a young person with cancer which he agrees to read but is dismayed by the fact that the book ends in midsentence they send each other text messages and their affection for each other grows exponentially until hazel decides they should be just friends she tells gus that she is keeping her distance because she is a grenade likely to explode and wants to minimize the casualties but gus has fallen in love with her and is not about to let go whatever the consequences he invites her to go to amsterdam with her to meet the author of the book peter van houten willem dafoe to ask him what happens to the other characters after his book ends their trip to amsterdam to meet van houten however though beautifully photographed by cinematographer ben richardson turns into a near disaster though it ultimately serves to bring them closer togetherunfortunately the entire middle episode feels leaden highly improbable and incongruous with the tone of the rest of the film hazel and gus subsequent visit to anne franks house while well done also does not ring true if the ending is predictable the tears it evokes are earned because we care deeply about the characters we have come to know and identify with author washington irving observed that there is sacredness in tears they are not the mark of weakness but of power they speak more eloquently than ten thousand tongues if that assessment is valid then for all its flaws is the most eloquent film of the year,sad
i hate films like this but this film was amazing i cant believe how good it was it was sooooo sad i never cried but then again i dont cry at films this film will make you cry its sooo sad but it reminds you how harsh life is for some people and it shows you that cancer sucks and it ruins and wrecks lifes the ending was so unexpected i really didnt expect it i felt so sorry for them when they both cried it really did make me feel so sad the fact that hazel grace knows that one day she is going to die makes you want to cry it really shows you what cancer does to teenagers they both know eventually they will die and they both know that one will die before the other and that will break one of there hearts i recommend to you watch this they both have to get on with there lifes and they both prepare each other and there family that one day they will die and it will hurt them watch and see for your self unforgettable,sad
i love it  i only cried one time  when someone die  thats like the only sad part for me  its like a romance between a girl and a guy theres no mean girls in it  its like a good romance until its tested   read the book first  the book is better than the movie  theres certain parts that need to be in the movie  the author of the book needed to be fat and more of a drunk  than he was the we never hear about isaac that much only parts  i wanted to know more of what happen to him after he went blind and when he got dump i wanted to know more about his parents we only see them in 2 parts  read the book first ,sad
prior to seeing this movie today the movie that ranked number one for me was the shawshank redemption though not a great drop it has now fallen to 2is unquestionably the finest film ive ever seen  a film that will require a package of facial tissues the performances given by shailene woodley and ansel elgort are absolutely flawless this is such a believable film with no pretense there is no sugarcoating this film is powerful and perhaps most importantly realhow do i know my only sibling my older sister passed away from cancer 23 years ago at the age of 40 and i recall from then much of what i saw in this fantastic film today i live my life at age 59 much of the time with her vision seared into my mindkudos to the entire cast the director and everyone associated with this film youve done society a great favor,sad
just this evening i went to see and i adored it it hardly swayed from the original book and that is what made me love it more when i first walked in i was worried worried that the film wouldnt match the book or that the actors wouldnt show the right emotions i am glad to say though that the film matched my great expectations and i came out of it with a sticky red splotched face i laughed cried grimaced and cringed at this film and i wouldnt have it any other way i have given it 10 because quite frankly the film deserved it i wasnt sat there looking for mistakes i was sat there enjoying a passionate love story with a massive grin on my face just thinking about how amazed and happy i was with this film go and see it because you really wont regret or forget it i fell in love with this film the way you fall asleep slowly then all at once,sad
its kind hard to explain the feeling i got while watching the sudden feeling of being glad to be alive hit me the movie was a revelation gods way to make people appreciate being alive this was really a movie sent from heaven i know that im being really positive right now but for real there isnt one bad thing to say about it except that i wish the movie had been longer according to me the movie lived up to the book there where of course a couple of places from the book they didnt put in the movie but that didnt really matter too methe acting was marvelous and you couldnt help but to fall in love with all the characters the manuskript and the conversations were brilliant and only john green could have come up with thatso theres only one thing left to say go watch this outstanding movie i promise you wont regret it,sad
confession is i am the book lover and i expect highly from this film even after countless disappointment of other adaptations i even forgot to compare it to the book while watching it so trust me if you have the understanding of movie and book are two different things to tell a story you would come to appreciate the effort the team put into this movieone flaw though is that there is nothing particularly new in this movie basically the team have done a good job of creating an extension of the book but there is no new exploration in there the movie is amazing because the book itself and the story is unbelievably goodshailene and ansel stunning performance remind me of gus and hazel every single second this movie is a quick way to get access to the story and it does an amazing job but i still prefer the book myself with nothing against the movie and i truly love it1010 rating is base on my love to the story john green gives me more than any things else,sad
i am an avid book reader and im always skeptical about watching movie adaptions because they never really seem to do the book justiceon the other hand was an incredibly poignant and inspiring movie that did the novel every bit of justice it deserved the director was able to make the right moments incredibly sad to the point of tears other parts witty and funny without effecting the overall mood of the movie as a viewer you are able to develop a deep connection to the characters and feel their emotions as though youre on the journey with them youre able to fall in love with hazel and augustus and experience another take on dealing with disease from the perspective of a teen realist itll leave you wanting to watch it all over again1010,sad
ansel elgort and shailene woodley respectively play augustus and hazel grace both suffering from cancer as both actors are up and coming and woodley as come a long way since the secret life of an american teenager as both meet in a cancer support group that hazel dreads but then begins to like due to gus as she calls him as both start a friendship than ends up something moreboth acted with both emotion and with great character depth and having had two family members myself suffer from cancer and defeating the disease still it is very sad but also very hopeful of two young people with their lives on the line each and every single day over their cancer but still would would rather live life to the fullest rather than face the disease and be defeated by ithelping one another out despite having to live each and every single day fighting for the fight of their lives in the form of a dreadful diseasegreat supporting cast by laura dern and sam trammell as the supportiveloving yet very scared parents of hazel grace nat wolffe of the naked brothers band and tv show as comic relief and another cancer survivor does a great job wilem dafoe in a small yet scary role of a drunk and mean spirited author whom both main characters adore but later find out he is not that kind of person and suffers his own demonsreally a bittersweet but at the same time sweet film not just another teen movie or a cancer movie but one of love and hope amid trying circumstances,sad
this does contain spoilersill start by saying i consider myself a movie guru in the sense that i love film and mostly everything about it of course not the petty predictable clichs by petty i mean hollywood and any writer should know better and know that there are no new ideas out there but merely new ways to perfect them and mold them into stigmas know one would ever think to do because well clichs are indeed clichs however i do appreciate the refreshing writing of mr john green because he delivered a wonderful book to millions of shelves and wonderful words scanned millions of eyes is heartfelt and beautiful it is one movie ive seen sticking true to the book and with that being said i only have minor complaints of things that were altered in the movie 1 that funny scene with issac and hazel in the hospital 2 the swing set ad which may come across as a movie mistake because it was never mentioned and gone at the end of the movie 3 the ambulance passing in the gas station scene 4 eating outside in amsterdam 5 the argument with gus and his parents 6 kaitlyn 7 guss family 8 the whole antm obsession 9 guss ex girlfriend theres more but i wont ramble on i get it things have to be altered this is such a phenomenal book and movie i love it you will too dont forget people get used to beauty though  hazel grace,sad
ive seen many book adaptations harry potter watership down secret life of bees perks scott pilgrim etc ive never hated a film adaptation of a novel which ive cherished save for percy jackson  why chris columbus whydespite having liked each book adaptation ive seen in their own unique way aka tfios has to be the best adaptation of them allalmost everything about this film is perfect ansel and shailene brought my favourite literary characters to life in a manner no other actors ever could they are hazel and gus i particularly loved ansel he captured guss character perfectly he was the exact gus of my mind as another member on the imdb board mentioned he even seemed to act a little like john green  eccentric and giddy yet reserved after all john did create gus its natural thered be a bit of his essence within him some critics have been unfair in re guss character with ign calling him a manic pixie dreamboy that he is not at least not to me ansel played the part so well capturing every side of gus it was as if gus walked straight off the page and in front of the camerashai was amazing as hazel she portrayed her extremely well  she kept hazel true to her form that being she was humble yet elevated positive yet realistic grounded yet not without fantasy shai captured hazels mature stature her girlish charm and her witty personality all while treating her hamartia with respect with her fear of exploding bubbling in her eyes right under the surfacewillem dafoe surprised me i thought he was going to be a terrible van houten he was not dafoe was van houten as elgort was gus he was incredible van houten if youve read the book is a right ahole but he does extract sympathy and dafoe brings both the bitter meanspirited drunk and the sorrowful depressed man whos lost his way right to the table dafoe captured greens semiantagonist an in a way i never thought he could i regret doubting himlaura dern was lovely as mrs lancaster and nat woolf was hilarious as isaac i wish ol isaac had more screen time and that his bond with hazel was deepened a little he had the best one liners the whole trio did the only disappointment to me was sam trammell as mr lancaster he seemed very underdeveloped and his character didnt have many lines it was a shame since himself and hazel had a great old repore in the booksome things from the novel are omitted of course others added all in all its the most faithful adaptation ive ever seen faithful in the sense that not only is it loyal to the source material but it captures the message themes and spirit of the book in ways that ive never thought possible in a film adaptation you can sense john greens eccentric yet humble personality oozing from the characters the core message of the film is not lost in translation the actors and filmmakers put their blood sweat and tears into this production in order to transform a beloved book from print to film reel without anything vital being lost in the process theyve succeeded in my bookthis is the definitive tfios it was a privilege to have my heart broken by this film and i look forward to it doing so many more times in the near and distant futureokay okay ,sad
when john green announced that his book will go on the big screen i was excited but also a bit skeptical because how could such a good book be abel to turn into a movie but after just have return from my local cinema all of my doubts was put into shame for the first time in a while a movie was just as good and even more than i was hoped forthank you john for write the book and all a huge thank you to shailene ansel and nat for being the best hazel gus and isaac go see it and you will love itdftbarasmus,sad
is an incredible ride of emotion from start to finish its a touching love story that really pulls on the heartstrings and manages to make prolific statements on life and what we as humans should do with such an amazing gift that we are not bound by the life we are given and we can do whatever we want so as long as we dont let our circumstances bind usi am really impressed by this films script and how thought provoking and heartfelt it is the relationship and the genuine emotions are so well written that not for a second i dont believe what they are saying or feeling towards one another i also enjoy how it doesnt take a strong sentimental or sappy approach on the subject matter as these characters are really sick and it could have come off as trying way too hard or manipulative the script instead focuses on celebrating life as apposed to the darker side of deaththe director josh boone does a good job with handling everything that is going on and directs the cast well as they are the strongest parts of the film i really enjoy some of the stylistic approaches in the film such as how they show the text messages one small fault in his directing is that the film gets a bit conventional near the end and it manages to lose some of its magic the soundtrack is well used and really drives the movie home its filled with upbeat and fun songs that really makes the film feel like a celebration of lifethe cast is top class and they truly give some wonderful performances shailene woodley gives a magical performance that conveys genuine happiness and heartbreaking sadness she easily portrays so many emotions realistically and convincingly ansel elgort plays woodleys love interest and if not done by such a good actor he could have come off as annoying and in your face his character is a bit loud and egotistic but he is a nice guy and really loves everyone who he encounters woodleys and elgorts on screen chemistry is incredibly good i really bought their relationship and felt every pain that they felt the actors are a true highlight of the filmoverall is a really good movie that is a fresh of breath air in this summer blockbuster season filled with high octane action and ridiculous special effect its a emotional ride that does not force its message or manipulates its audience it is a genuine movie that shows a brighter side of life and death while the film does get conventional in its third act it still ends on a high note i give it an incredibly high 45,sad
shailene woodley is so hot right now young adult fiction is so hot right now put them together and you should have a solid gold certified success right well not quite dont get me wrong woodley is terrific as cancerstricken teenager hazel in josh boones the cinematic adaptation of john greens popular ya novel of the same name its just that the movie doesnt always live up to the quality of her performance woodley wowed all and sundry with her golden globenominated performance as george clooneys recalcitrant daughter in the descendants and then backed up with a sparkling turn in the spectacular now before detouring into blockbuster territory with divergent with a screenplay by scott neustadter and michael h weber  the duo responsible for writing the spectacular now and the excellent 500 days of summer  is about real teenagers doing real things and therein lays its strength of course many real teenagers can be very annoying and teenage boys in particular are often cocky and selfassured to the point of being obnoxious gus is such a creature played by ansel elgort who also featured in divergent gus has good looks charm and confidence in spades all of which he uses to ingratiate himself with hazel the two meet in a cancer support group he has lost a leg to the disease while she has damaged lungs that requires her to be permanently attached to an oxygen tank by no means a shrinking violet hazel is intelligent witty and selfdeprecating she demonstrates maturity in balancing the seriousness of her situation with her desire to experience life to the fullest furthermore she understands and appreciates the burden that her illness has placed on her parents both financially and emotionally gus on the other hand is prone to make light of his circumstances and seems happy enough to grasp every advantage that comes his way as a result having survived a brush with osteosarcoma perhaps gus has every reason to embrace life to the full and can therefore be excused if he occasionally comes across as a bit too glib about his experience and what it has cost him such as when he allows his friend isaac to smash the basketball trophies that adorn his room his socalled metaphor though which consists of an unlit cigarette dangling from his mouth almost all of the time  you put the thing that does the killing right between your teeth but you never give it the power to kill you  comes across as pretentious and is infuriatingly annoying the duo bond over vocabulary venn diagrams and literature but it is their mutual love of a novel titled an imperial affliction that seals the deal the story resonates with them through their shared experience with the central character but they are frustrated by the ending and set out to contact the author in search of answers gus cashes in on the benevolence of an organisation akin to australias makeawish foundation to enable him and hazel to meet peter van houten willem dafoe the author of an imperial affliction who is living in selfimposed exile in amsterdam however van houten is a bitter man with no interest in indulging these two young people in their quest for answers dafoe is great as the rude dismissive van outen and it is somewhat disappointing that late in the piece there is an attempt to redeem the character somewhat in the eyes of hazel and the audience why do filmmakers or authors for that matter find it necessary to dilute the venom in such characters when they are almost always more interesting and believable when they are at their most despicable woodley seems much more at home in smallerscale productions such as this which rely more on acting than acrobatics she is a naturalistic performer who articulates the emotional rollercoaster of hazels experience to perfection whilst elgort is serviceable as gus the problem lies in the character more so than the performance sure gus seems like the type of boy you would want your daughter to bring home but he is just too good to be true laura dern and true bloods sam trammell are fine as hazels parents while nat wolff provides comic relief as isaac a fellow cancer patient who is more upset at losing his girlfriend than he is about losing his eyesight there is nothing showy about boones direction of the drama and he lets the story which no doubt will have people reaching for tissues play out without it ever becoming manipulative or overly melodramatic,sad
   you transform a userfriendly term for sweetness and light into an ugly truncated verb as in they cut short my basketball career when they cut off my leg or the film would have made more sense if they hadnt cut it to just 126 minutes teaches us that theres no i in cancer at least when it strikes youths of a certain age these sufferers spend most of their time kissing each other because unlike adult victims of the disease they never have cancer breath the constant sniffling from the young audience surrounding me prove that it is very sad when young americans glowing with the pink of health actually are dying of cancer even though they get to go to disney world and amsterdam of course for every one fatally stricken us cancer youth there must be a hundred or a thousand more youthful africans and asian lives snuffed out by ebola aids war and starvation with a degree of oblivion unimaginable to fault lovers gus and hazel tragically theyand wenever get to hear willem dafoes trolley tale,sad
john greenhow should i start this reviewfirst and foremost i have read the book even before the movie tiein book was published and i have never come across john greens books before i read this one what captured my attention on this which made me buy and read it was the beauty of the cover which was also the reason why was i addicted to the selection series i thought it was cuteso as the movie was announced i got excited i looked forward for posters promotional videos behind the scenes and even the official soundtrackthe movie was released on the same week as of tom cruises edge of tomorrow i had foreseen the possibilities of it beating edge of tomorrows sales on the opening weekend and it really did film makers should be more careful on choosing the rivals of a films opening week before releasing them the movie was great i agree that this film really stayed true to the book unlike what happened to percy jackson trust me do read the book instead if you havent seen the filmthe main stars made me believe that fictional characters can have life in motion picture despite the imaginary motion picture a reader envisions from words both characters had delivered their lines well and gave justice to the book shailene was good and ansel was simply gus theres nothing about him that you couldnt disagree more of the fact that he really is the perfect gus hes charming cute and funny as well i cant literally say which scene of each character is my favorite but one of the really funny ones that i can think of as this moment is the trip to amsterdam ansels gus portrayal on the oh my gosh were flying was really comical it was one of the scenes that you would really pity the boy whod never been in an airplane before but still feel sorry to the boy for not being able to be in an airplane before its a bit confusing but youd understand when youll see iti like how the film was mostly about hazel and gus despite being the lead important characters who i think really did own the entirety of the films chemistry but i was looking forward to the isaac scenes unlike in the book that isaac was often mentioned the film featured isaac only in the first few and last scenes one of isaacs best scenes is the part where he sang his lungs out after monica broke up with him and the part where released his heartbreaking anger breaking guss trophies while gus and hazel were talking about aia and one last thing about isaac i think it was really cute when isaac was pronounced like eyesac sine i had always pronounced it as eyesuhuck which i typically use referring to friends names and the bible characterthe egging scene was short but fun i expected to have it a bit longer though it was focused merely on hazel and gus despite i have imagined it to be fun as hazel watching the bestfriends bondpatrick was well played like the book he was the funny divorced guy leading the support group talking about the heart of jesus but i think one of the things they missed about patricks character is the humor that he brings whenever he mentions the deceased support group members in his prayers i think the film producers didnt think of it as important though but i really think it was funnywillem dafoe was a good choice of van houten though i kind of pictured him like a proud fat bastard willem delivered van houtens meanness well though aside from van houten i never thought lidewij was pronounced as leeduhvie and i was also looking forward to seeing how big and handsome her boyfriend is because before the end of the book she mentioned that she needed to bring her boyfriend along to check van houtens mail for guss letter in the film it was van houten himself that delivered the letter during guss funeralspeaking of letters maybe it was just me or did anybody else notice that the explanation of the title wasnt mentioned or maybe there was just something else important that connected the films plot to the title maybeanyway i feel bad for not really crying at the end of the film though there were really emotional and touching scenes that i think would be better in the film it only made me almost drop a tear dropping a tear and crying arent the same technically but anyway i didnt really cry like i did in the last song im not saying that this isnt a good film maybe it was just because the last song was more about families and stuff another reason i suspect i didnt cry ive been listening to the ost and found it incredible since it was released and this is the side effect of italso i think the film makers agreed to omit mentioning green jokes of isaac and gus which i think isnt a big deal they also omitted the mentioning of the real movies gus and hazel watched which i think wouldnt justify why hazel told van houten that she reminds her of other people after funeral partfor me is a modernday fairytale whose characters struggle through a deadly but captivating journeythen you might ask why a fairytale when the supposed prince had died and there wasnt really a happily every afterheres my answer despite all the odds they both fought to be loved despite all the odds they both fought to be cured for love despite all the odds they both had their infinities and were in lovego see it,sad
as a fan of the book i was extremely excited when i finally got to see this movie and for all the book fans it is one of the book to movie adaptations that are actually accurate and not stealing the name to rope in fans and then disappoint themi am number 4 the book was good but the movie was terriblethey had included all of the quotes that everyone loved and it was just as sad as the book i dont think a single person left the cinema without there sad crying facesthe actors where also amazing and it was an all round amazing moviefans of the book will absolutely adore and love this moviewarning bring tissues,sad
i have never come across a movie where i felt completely 100 satisfied that was a book adaptation until today the tear jerking unique humor and realistic compassionate love that i experienced and felt through reading the book was perfectly displayed on the screen before me 1010 i would honestly rate it more if i possibly could from the second the movie started i was sucked into the world of hazel grace lancaster although the overall plot may sound just sad i can honestly tell you that i and everyone in the theater laughed sooo hard at every joke that was included in the movie every moment was on point tears were everywhere by the end it was amazing it was perfection i loved how it ended because they didnt leave us hanging at a depressing spot but a happy one and that is very hard to do with a story like this congratulations to john green for his first film adaptation well done,sad
all too often i see melodramatic cancer movies ie my sisters keeper that try so hard to make you cry and just relieve the target audience of the book so many of these films along with the other horrible love stories eventually become the same level of cheese as anything youd see on the hallmark channel you watch to get a few laughs in your days but in fios it may be the sense of self awareness it has or the beautifully crafted characters director josh boone finds a way to make a genre defying love story that will undoubtedly stand the test of timehazel grace lancaster presented in the oscarworthy performance by shailene woodley has established herself in the beginning as a cancer patient who has long since come out of the acceptance stage of dying and transformed into the waiting stage which makes for an extremely interesting and immersive character to gain a mind set never has a simple love story delved into such raw human emotion and been so genuine in presenting true human thought process when hazel is introduced to agustus waters played by ansel elgort she is given a little infinity that blows any charming a man has ever done to a woman in a movie a series of events happen and a depressing final act ensues but for some reason you come out of the theater feeling refreshed relieved that is that there is still some hope in the romantic genre that films still know how to develop multipleleveled characters all the while creating an iconic film still accessible to the mainstream audiencethe major and only flaw this film has is in the character agustus while he is very touching and genuine as the recovering cancer patient he seems to have a tad but too much selfawareness of exactly how charming he is i dont want to use the term cock to describe how he comes across but in some instances thats the only term i can describe his reactions to lines of other characters etc he has one scene in particular that is supposed to be sad but i couldnt help but burst out laughing from the facial expressions but other than that fios is a leap forward in the romance genre and will provide grief for all romantic films to come since they will not be able to live up to this film grade a,sad
beautiful film with exceptional acting by the entire cast shailene woodley should expect an oscar nod for her performance i was prepared to have tissues ready for this film but i did not expect to need them throughout the entire movie the plot while some feel that its already overdone was fabulous telling the story of cancer through the eyes of teenagers who had never really had a relationship if you were not moved by this movie something is seriously wrong with your moral character it moved well over the topics of death religion point of view from the parents and friends and had a lot of symbolism of how it may be like to know youre terminally ill but never know when life will be over best money i have spent in a theater for myself and my daughters since divergent,sad
its very rare that i leave a movie with the mindset of that was a near flawless film this is going to become one of favorites this has happened twice so far in 2014 the first time was after disneys frozen which i saw in january and the second time was after this filmand i didnt expect it either i mean sure i knew i was gonna like it i read john greens novel this past winter and i did quite enjoy it so yes i was looking forward to seeing this movie i thought it was gonna be good but it wasnt just good it was incredible not only was it probably the most faithful booktomovie adaptation ive ever seen save for those bazillion christmas carols but it was one of those movies that was both heartwrenching and heartwarming at the same time not many films can do that and this one pulled it off superbly,sad
i cant stop thinking about this movie having loved the book i was skeptical the movie would be super fluffy  cheesy but it far exceeded my expectations it was filmed so beautifully really capturing the magic in the moments the actors exquisitely brought to life creating characters that everyone in the audience fans of the book or not fell in love with the music is exceptional as well really adding to each and every scene im listening to the soundtrack as i it here and write this remembering scenes from the movie and guss smileim going to have to go see this one in the theatre again it truly was one of the best movie experiences ive had in a long time reminded me of why im such a fan of movies they can be truly magical,sad
nobody likes getting sick its unpleasant it changes our daily routine and were brought down to a level in which our souls have been weakened by the disease making us feel bad about ourselves and giving us an everlasting fear that sickness can strike at any moment no matter how healthy we try to live we arent invincible and we could drop dead at any moment from something that scientists have yet to discover thats whats troubling about the universe the air and land we breath has so much we dont understand that were still young at fighting one such disease is cancer this has been around forever and people to this stay still get sudden announcements from their doctor that they too have become one of millions of people with a disease they have yet to find a cure technology has gotten better but most cancer victims are stuck to taking chemotherapy as a treatment but its no guarantee i think that people with cancer or any other kind of sickness wants the world to know that they are regular people like us with interests family and love two teenagers reveal their lovesick story in the adaption of the critically acclaimed novel hazelgrace lancaster played by shailene woodley is a sixteenyearold cancer patient who has had this curse ever since she was a little girl she has gone through many treatments and has had a couple of encounters with death fate has kept her alive as she struggles to live a normal teenage life at the insistence of her parents she attends a support group for teenagers like herself yet doesnt find much that interests her this changes when she gets stares from a new addition to the group augustus waters played by ansel elgorthe has a rebellious spirit that many of the other cancer stricken teenagers lack that intrigues hazel yet she writes off his affections and ask that their relationship only remain friendly as the weeks pile on their texting sessions become longer and the two get to know each other including hazels dream of meeting her favorite author peter van houten played by william dafoe augustus uses his wish from makeawish to take her and her mother to amsterdam where romance finally draws the two to each other the trip goes well and they continue to prosper their relationship until one of them hits further complications i wont be the one to say whocould have gone a million ways wrong from adding a dumb misunderstanding to having them instantly fall for each other right on the spot love stories are like horror films as few of them are any good but this one is a very good love story shailene woodley and ansel elgort have some excellent chemistry that makes them look very precious together its a real relationship where theyre seen talking to each other about this stuff and how far is too far for this kind of loveits a rare mix of funny and sad just how sad is it never reaches a point of phony smultz but rather heartbreaking facts of life that our characters have no choice but to face them ill say that i enjoyed 5050 a little better then as it is missing something that was needed more scenes with augustus on his own we get a lot of scenes of hazel watching tv or reading but i never got more out of augustus then that he used to play basketball and hes a rebellious amputee the best way to describe the movie is something that i also used with her had last year cute its a cute story that i sure plenty of people are going to bring tissues with before they watchill give this eight and a half cityscapes of amsterdam out of five as both characters would have loved this is a nice love story that the books fans are gonna love and will become as much of a valentines staple as 500 days of summer and love story has become,sad
a couple of months back i read the young adult novel by john green in anticipation of the movie it is the story of hazel a teenager living with cancer at the start of the story the cancer is seemingly terminal but she has survived for the time being her mother makes her go to a support group in the basement of a church  to get out there live life make friends etc in this support group she meets agustus also a teenage cancer patient in remission who has an amputated leg due to his illness the two fall in love and i will stop thereif you have not read the book or seen the movie your mind can imagine where the story goes i wont spoil it for those who have read it  it is a good adaption of the book the first half of the movie while not bad is not perfect at times  the second half shines shailene woodley has some very strong individual scenes as hazel she is one of the most popular younger actresses out there lead of the divirgent franchise and it shows why in those scenes she is bubbly when she needs to be and can turn serious when its time i think she hasnt even become the best she can be yet ansle elgorts agustus is as likable and charming as you want him to be laura dern is very effective as hazels mother and in his brief turn  william dafoe is effective as van houten  the author of an imperial infliction  a book that ended with some unanswered questions which hazel and agustus desire to get prompting a desired trip to amsterdam to meet himi know it is clich  suffice it to stay  if you have a heart you will not helped but be moved  and you dont have to have read the book 3  out of 4 stars,sad
kudos to john green for proving that popular young adult fiction need not always be set in dystopia think divergent or the hunger games or the supernatural need we mention twilight rather his bestselling novel is a love story between two witty engaging teenagers with cancer and before you go thinking that this is no more than nicholas sparks for a younger crowd trust us when we say that it is nowhere near that instead as those who have read the book will stridently attest it is wise warm funny and touching all at the same time and the best thing one could say about this film adaptation is that it retains all these qualities which made the book such a sensationgoing into a story like this you know that it is bound to turn mawkish at some point especially as it deals with the inevitable progression towards death of not one but both of our endearing protagonists what makes greens novel  and by extension scott neustadter and michael h webers screenplay  such a winner is just how it earns each and every drop of your sympathies for the two leads hazel grace lancaster shailene woodley and augustus waters ansel elgort so much so that when it does play that tug at your heartstrings youll not begrudge for every tear you shed and oh yes unless youre defective and we say this with not a single hint of spite youll be moved to tears by this story of dying lovepreserving hazels narration of the events that follow and clearly benefiting from the strength of greens prose our first encounter with hazel is through the thoughts in her head as a teen she came perilously close to death but an experimental treatment has managed to beat back the cancer and so she goes around these days with a tube inserted into her nostrils thats tethered to an oxygen tank she lugs around in a trolley bag it is at a support group for cancer patients that she has her meetcute with the strappingly handsome augustus a basketball player whose career was cut short when cancer took his right leg and where a metal support now residesboth are immediately taken to each other and its not hard to see why not only do they match each other in intelligence they are just as whipsmart making an instant connection as they trade barbs with each other  and yes in case there was ever any doubt fall in love most prominently they bond over their rejection of the usual cancer story sentiments finding much to talk about in hazels favourite book an imperial affliction by the reclusive dutchamerican author peter van houten which just happens to be about living with cancer hazel counts herself as van houtens biggest fan so augustus takes a chance and tries to reach out to van houten himself who unexpectedly replies to the latters fan mailone thing leads to another and pretty soon hazel and augustus are travelling to amsterdam to meet van houten willem dafoe in person  better still that it is an allexpenses paid trip sponsored by augustus makeawish type foundation we wont spoil the surprise for those unacquainted with the story but suffice to say that the trip marks a turning point in their relationship not only because it deepens their personal affections but also in how it gives them an unexpected lens by which to reexamine how they have come to terms with their condition it is a sobering turn of events no doubt and even more so when you consider on hindsight what happens afterdoes one or both of them die at the end well certainly death is pretty much written into a story like this so in that sense it is still an unabashed tearjerker what differentiates this from the rest of the sappy melodramas is its refreshing sense of honesty about the real life issues it confronts yes it doesnt sugarcoat the realities it wades into  the disease mortality and the impermanence of our temporary existence on this earth  and instead deals with them with insight and selfdeprecating humour in particular the recurring theme of oblivion makes for a heartbreaking moral search by one of our protagonists to find meaning in sufferingto his credit director josh boone handles the material with sensitivity and restraint but he doesnt add much to the cinematic language that greens book was already brimming with instead the real stars here are woodley and elgort who embody the amazing chemistry which green describes between hazel and augustus this is easily woodleys standout role bringing just the right mix of strength and vulnerability resistance and acceptance to make hazel a living and breathing character that invites her audience to feel her struggle and share in her fate her divergent costar elgort is confident but stops short of ever becoming cocky but most importantly makes for an extremely appealing couple with woodleythe best assurance we can offer to fans of the book is that it remains faithful to greens tale and by that we mean it is equally sharp funny and wellobserved it is also a weepie all right but one that earns its emotional kick with wit and earnestness at no point does it ask for any pity from its audience instead it regards its characters with the respect and dignity that they deserve acknowledging their everyday struggles and the uncertainties that the disease has on their relationship its not always you get a cancer picture that you get characters saying lines like pain demands to be felt or life isnt a wishgranting honesty but that is also the reason why rises above the trappings of its genre to become something exuberant perceptive and genuinely stirring,sad
i read about 2 years ago and had not revisited the book before seeing the movie i remember the majority of the novel and was pleasantly surprised to see that the movie stayed fairly true to the book this movie brings out every emotion i cried a lot laughed out loud and got chills on many occasions during this movie i think that everyone that read the book will probably cry a little bit more because you have read the book and know what to expect and what is going to happen nextthe actors played their roles amazingly the personalities of both hazel and gus were brought out perfectly through every scene not one scene seemed forced or awkward the scenes connected smoothly and made this movie seem like real life i felt as though i were watching the life of hazel grace unfold as if it were a true story everything was perfect about this movie definitely the best movie i have seen this year the emotions and wonderful quotes from john greens book were all there i couldnt have asked for a better adaptation from the novel what a beautifully made movie i want to see it again right now and you all should see it too 10 out of 10,sad
as someone who loves books and reading im not sure whether i should be excited or worried when a book gets made into a movie sometimes the movies dont live up to the fans of the books expectations and never does the book the justice that it deserves when youre reading you create a picture of what you think the characters and scenes in the book should look like and when you see it on screen you can either be disappointed or happy with how it turned out im always bad at describing movies to others because how do you say is a romantic comedy about two teenagers who have cancer fall in love without it sounding like it could be another sappy love story but the truth is really isnt another sappy love story at all this is the type of bookmovie that will make you want to readwatch it over and over again and share with as many people as you can so they can enjoy it as much as you did not to my surprise this movie was wonderful the movie completely did the book justice and followed it in the way i thought it would i was happy to find that many of my favorite quotes from the book were included in the movie i definitely cried while reading this book so i was prepared when i saw the movie but being prepared really didnt help in the end considering the fact that i was almost crying before the movie actually started shailene woodley and ansel elgort had amazing chemistry throughout the movie and i really believed that they were hazel and augustus my favorite kind of movies are the ones that make you just sit there and think about them after they have ended this was one of them to me this isnt a movie that you watch then continue on with your day this is the kind of moviebook that will stick with you for a very long time and you will come back and think about it over and over again even though i would recommend on reading the book first this is a truly beautiful film that will make you laugh and break your heart at the same time and you will still love it i fell in love the way you fall asleep slowly and then all at once,sad
movies about terminal illness so passionate so well done but somehow so sad yet for some reason we are drawn to them like moths to a flame often for the quality tales they spin and the emotions they stir up this week released another movie based on yes you guessed it a book so naturally after coming off my latest science fiction high it was time for me to return to my local theater and calm myself with this dramaromantic tale what did i think as always please read on to find out for those who havent seen the plethora of trailers or read the book this movie is the story of hazel shailene woodley a girl who suffers from cancer and the associated depression that follows just when everything seems lost a charismatic man named gusansel elgort enters whose positive outlook and bright spirits send them on a journey of self discovery and wonder i know the story sounds like all the other terminally ill stories but that doesnt mean its not worth checking out is an incredibly passionate movie filled to the brim with amazing scenes of beauty wonder and emotion it all starts with the characters who at first are like yin and yang opposite approaches to the same situation woodleys portrayal of hazel was fantastic the dismay and depression flowing out of her so naturally it was as if she herself was suffering from the disease it was so refreshing to see her not playing an overly whiney teenager as ive seen in her past roles instead showing the true abilities she had beneath yet the character that really brought the movie to me was gus this mans positivity and will were infectious brightening up the negative energy of the situation and keeping the movie fun despite the dire outcomes that awaited elgort was like a low key jesse eisenberg arrogant but not as much of a jerk that makes him lovable the characters are strong on their own but together they evolve into a duo that breathes so much life into the movie and hooks you into the twohour ride even when they are not speaking these young actors portray their feelings in simple gestures an eye roll here a smirk there that translates the thoughts going on in their mindssupporting the characters is a some creative dialog that was synthesized from a variety of styles to help get the point across at first it is nothing more than the ire filled thoughts of a cancer patient that reflects the suffering they face depression eventually turns into casual conversations when gus arrives balanced in comedy romance and other emotions that continue to shift as the story unfolds what could be a laugh fest at one point can turn into a sobfest at another but one thing that holds constant is the realism of the movie unlike some movies there is no magical word saying or moment that erases all the hurt but instead a realist approach to handling the cards life deals you i for one can learn a thing or two from what this movie preached and perhaps if you open your eyes you can see it too to help sell the point the cinematography exploded with symbolism and emotion at the time of the scene when the characters were down the camera maximized emphasis on the face if they were trying capture love the scene focused on finding romantic imagery to bring out the scene the musical score they selected only further enhanced the feelings somehow working behind the scenes to synergistically pull at your heartstrings you would think i would have gotten annoyed by all of this repetitive themes but somehow they balanced all of this and kept the pace going avoiding the cheesiness many romance movies contain in my eyes of course what i consider cheesy others find to be inspiring and beautiful being the robot i am i did not cry in this movie mostly because i knew what the ending would be well into the movie despite the lack of tears ill admit that the movie still moved me sending my emotions on a roller coaster ride as for the other audience members though the water works flowed through the entire movie what do these observations mean it means that you can experience a variety of emotions and learn a lot of things from this movie which can mean multiple watches of this movie though the tale will still remain predictable another warning is that there are some very tough struggles in this movie perhaps not appropriate for those with a personal connection to this story if youre like me though youll be able to find happiness in this tale hopefully being inspired rather than depressed surprisingly impressed me despite the fact it is a story ive seen before the balance in it impresses me the most brought to full force with the wonderful acting the cast has to bring yes it is a predictable ending but the delivery is so solid i cant really dock it too much i strongly recommend checking out this movie hoping that you will take away something from the messages crammed in this movie those who have less control over their tears are warned to bring tissues or at least the supporting arm of a loved one to get you through the journey my scores are down belowdramaromance 85 overall 85,sad
is a tragic love story from the beginning to the end going into the movie there was many questions i haddo i have to read the bookare the actors going to be awkwardis the movie going to be awkwardis it going to be like every other love storyand honestly coming from a guy who isnt really a fan of spending money to go see chick flicks the answer to all of these questions is no the movie was great with an outstanding amount of emotion played by all the characters ansel elgort did a great job in this movie i think he was outstanding just like shailene woodley nat wolff as isaac added a much needed laugh to some pretty intense scenes this movie is filled with some pretty intense scenes the only reason i wont give it a 10 is because it wasnt one of the best and some of it was dragged it was a long run time but you know what pretty solid movie and i would go see it just make sure you bring some tissues with you because things can get really sad really quick okay,sad
i will not spoil the movie for anyone the movie is great for several reasons it is a simple love story that occurs in an unexpected scenario and emerges as the true stories of real love where that are with only look feel they are known to always come up i say its the love story of 2014 because it reminded me of love story with ali macgraw and ryan ooneill 1970 a story of tragic love like this and it was all a success in those days elgort and woodley performances was very good for a drama i like a lot of the naturalness of both with a budget that is a fraction of the budget of dozens of movies that are made every year i seem to manage to create the perfect environment to frame the story the picture is good the acting of the kids is good the direction is good willem dafoe accomplishment that people hate him again anyway its a drama that appeals to the reality of thousands of people suffering from cancer that in their anonymity have the pain and anguish well achieved,sad
shailene woodley is 2014s jennifer lawrence is magnificent great writing wonderful direction marvelous editing and shailene woodleythe only question is  will the oscar nominators remember her performance in a mid year release filmwho is ansel elgort a young new actor who hopefully will not be a one hit wonder  wonderful facial expressions added so much to the film and his smile is infectiousi must ward you that this is a tear jerker  not just at the end but throughout the film the emotion builds throughout the film and the soundtrack had competition from the sniffling and nose blowing pervasive throughout the theater from about the halfway point ondefinitely a must see film for 2014 and years to come,sad
being that i very much enjoyed the book when i read it about two years a go i was very nervous for the cast to be released when it was i felt that the casting choice for hazel was appropriate i had seen other performances by shaliene woodly and had admired her before her casting however i had never heard of ansel elgort and questioned his casting for the role of augustus after seeing the movie i realized i should have trusted the casting directors and of course john greens judgment i went into the movie expecting some overhypedaverage teenage girl movie and what i witnessed completely exceeded my expectations by far the casting was perfect and i did not feel that the movie was a disappointment to the book which is how i had assumed i would feel although i wanted to rip my heart out of my chest and throw it on to the freeway for millions of cars to run over the movie had some comical moments that really made you laugh out loud it is definitely a tearjerker as the book was but that is practically a givenit gave the audience a great pain and that pain definitely demanded to be felt there were also parts of the book that i was disappointed to see had not made the movie like hazel letting a young girl wear her oxygen tubes and when gus discusses his exgirlfriend however i understood that they could not be portrayed due to strict timing as for the movie overall congratulations to john green josh boone the cast and everyone else for successfully bringing one of the greatest romance stories of all time to life i completely recommend and i can not wait to see this movie about twenty million more times,sad
or tfios is a faithful adaptation of the book by john green green was inspired to write the book after working in a hospital setting with sick children and young adults when he was contemplating being a chaplaintfios like the book shows cancer patients as your everyday person not as just victims of misfortune this movie had two strong lead actors portraying augustus and hazelthe actress who played hazels performance is especially memorablethough the third act dragged as some critics agrees a little it was so minimal at no point during the 2 hours length was this movie dull the movie has enough comedic touches to give a delightful viewing with also a lot of highly emotionallycharged scenes it really shows a realistic inside view of people who live their lives with a foot in the gravethe love story is central it is really incredible that these situation surely happens in real life where two people with highly limited life spans find each other and are meant for each other as compared to people that are healthy and live a long time that may never find or appreciate that kind of lovethe movie is powerful it is hard not to be emotionally affected and moved by it i highly recommend it,sad
i have read the book and loved it so i automatically knew that i would have to watch the movie i bought the early showing tickets and when i got there i was totally unprepared it started off beautifully the cast was remarkable the script was amazing the script was quirky and funny but with such inspirational words left you thinking about the words over and over the last half was more intense and very emotional well for me and makes you think about the mark you leave on the world it also makes you appreciate the life you live and to cherish the time you have and to live life to the fullest and delivers this message through remarkable ways augustus death was very emotional but sent out a great influence for young girls dealing with relationships i mean hazel was definitely sad but she reminded you to move on to not grieve and to not forget about the life ahead of you i left the theater feeling like i had to do something that i had to leave my mark on the world i definitely recommend this movie and book to anybody wanting to appreciate life a little more hope this helped,sad
this movie is a beautiful adaptation of john greens beautiful novel it could be better i admit but it did not disappoint my great expectations about ithazel grace is a 17yearold girl who was diagnosed with cancer when she was only 13 she knows that she will die soon so she considers herself to be a grenade and thinks that her life is boring since her routine is based on taking medical exams and watching tv series and reading always the same book are her best sources of fun like any teenager she wants to have a normal life and friends which she does not really seem to haveher life changes for the better after meeting augustus waters a boy who also had cancer and wants to do something good with his life and not just wait for the worse to happen they immediately fall in love and start living their own infinity even though they know that some infinities are bigger than otherswhat i like about this story is that hazel and augustus accept their condition and even make fun of the privileges that they have for being sick instead of putting themselves in a condition to make people feel sorry for themthis is a touching and very very sad movie you will probably not be able to stop at least a few tears from falling if you watch it with an open heart,sad
i have never written a review for a movie before but this one has gotten me to do so the movie to me was literally a rollercoaster of extreme emotions ups and downs ups and downs throughout the whole movie and this is probably one of the best if not the best movies i have seen during my entire life this is a fiction and john green states that before anyone reads the book so anyone is looking for any kind of realistic feelings about realistic relationships and what not this is not your type of movie i can guarantee you that however it gave me some real emotional feelings while watching it for example when gus tells hazel about his cancer coming back shailenes acting is so perfect in that scene she leans her head on his shoulder and silently cries because she knows its too unfair but she also understands that cancer isnt no games overall i loved it,sad
perfect casting perfect quoting and adding humor at perfect places make an almostperfect movie despite small detail differenceswasnt monicas car pink in the book the movie follows the books path go out and watch this you wont regret it it was everything i imagined when reading the book if not more if you go and see it with lots of people in the theater expect people to be crying around you if youre not crying yourself this movie is beautiful because you can see the true meaning of what im sure john green intended the book to show the world is not a wishgranting factory pain demands to be felt and some infinities are better than other infinities and if you havent read the book and are planning to go see the movie its still worth it but you may be confused at some parts because it follows the book pretty closely but doesnt have as much narration since in the book the story is told from hazels perspective in the movie its more objective,sad
i was thoroughly amazed by this movie i read the book a few months ago knowing that a movie was being made and fell in love with the characters after reading the book and loving it so dearly i couldnt wait to see how they put the movie together when shailene woodley was cast i dont deny that i was a little iffy about that decision her looks are perfect for the role of hazel but shailene is seemingly too cutesy to play such an old soul but i can admit that i was wrong about shailene she played hazel almost perfectly there are two things i would criticize in this film the first is minor which was the way hazel and augustus met they never bumped into each other in the book but having to explain why augustus stared at her for such a long time in the literal heart of jesus would have taken more time and more money to film so i understand their reasoning with that one the second criticism i have is that hazel was much too happy throughout the majority of the movie her eyes glimmered too much and she smiled much more than she had in the book her attitude was too positive for the role of the hazel grace i grew to love within the novel though the aspect of augustus cheering her up as they fell in love with each other could have made her happier it wasnt like that originally i wanted a darker hazel than i got other than that i dont have a single negative thing to say ansel elgort is a dreamy onelegged augustus and he played the part perfectly the gas station scene was the hardest scene to watch as he realizes that he can no longer do normal things watching him realize that hes dying is heartbreaking especially after you grew to love him so deeply over the course of the film i was in awe of the beauty of this movie and will gladly watch it again and again,sad
having read and loved the book twice naturally i was very excited to see this film but my initial thoughts were quite different to how i feel about it now of course it is a tearjerker its a cancer story what do you expect i was still crying after i left the cinema trying to process what i had just seen i loved it but now that ive had the chance to think more critically about it there are things that i would have done bettermy first impressions are often wrong and no exception was made for ansel elgort i honestly was not too keen on him playing augustus but kudos to him he did a wonderful job shailene did everything i thought she would and more she was fantastic in fact all the cast were great no fault in the stars there were just some issues with the plot and things that were left out that i felt were important i was excited to see the mall scene where hazel is approached by a little girl who asks what is in hazels nose her cannula but we didnt get to see that half of the swing set scene was missing paedophilic swing set seeks the butts of young children which for some reason i was disappointed about and the snow in amsterdam would have been visually amazing but josh boone decided against it while these are all little things being a big fan of the book it is my job to be picky about thema visual technique that i didnt enjoy was the display of text messages in the books font it made me feel uncomfortable for some reason but i can understand why it was done hazel and gus texts are important in telling the story and it was an easier way of showing them rather than constantly cutting to shots of hazels phoneoverall i give this film a 910 it has the right amount of happiness humour and heartache i was going to rate it an 8 but elgorts performance pushed it up that bit further booklovers you will all love it okay okay,sad
this was one of the best movies i have ever seen but the only movie that could make my best and worst movie lists there were only two little things that i didnt approve of but in the grand scheme of things those details are extremely negligible however i cant say enough about the movie the actors the script the music everything about it was just perfect so perfect it was almost too perfect but again it was just right nothing bad nothing to keep me from seeing it again i say just go see it okayps bring tissues and enjoy youll see why i rated it a 10 and could have rated it a 20,sad
i will admit it was rather interesting to see shailene woodsley and ansel elgort reunite again but this time as lovers compared to playing brother and sister in divergent hazel grace lancaster suffers from stage 4 thyroid cancer which causes her to wear a breathing tube on her nose and an oxygen tank in order to breathe and wonders if there is more to her life than just cancer and support groups however while attending one of her support group sessions as a favor to her friend issac which suffers from cancer in the eye she meets the charming augustus waters who has a rather playful personality and also a fellow cancer survivor who lost a leg throughout the film the chemistry between the lead stars is amazing and you feral as though you want them yo stay together despite their health problems the film also a wonderful cadet including laura dern and sam tramell as hazels parents who help out their daughter the best they can i would say it is a great movie for those who may or may not have read the book,sad
i like to think i read a lot and this being my favorite book ive read in a long time i was ready to rip this movie to shreds and say everything i hated i went to see the movie last night and was blown away with every movie that they adapt from a book they take things out and add things in yet what they took out wasnt too important no mention of caroline mathers whatsoever they take out kaitlyn completely etc it still left a bit of disappointment the director kept true to most dialogue between the characters so i went in and could practically quote the movie i was impressed with all of the actors and they way the presented their characters it truly stood true to the book i like to believe its so good because john green the author was able to come on set and offer advice on hoe to portray all of his characters i give this movie an a for the amazing work they put out and the way they held true to the book and for the things they left out and changed in some of my my favorite dialogue i say bravo and applaud this movie,sad
this movie was absolutely amazing i have waited so long for this book to be made into a movie and there really couldnt have been a better way to adapt it the cast was perfect for the roles described in john greens book and it really just captured the essence of what so many people fell in love with reading it for the first time it had its differences but you fall in love all over again with their story and even not having read the book many people will love this movie this movie was everything that i wanted and more when i heard about the adaptation i applaud the cast and crew for such a wonderful movie it is definitely one you have to see,sad
my thoughts are stars i cannot fathom into constellations to sum up this magnificent movie is saying it was absolutely perfect i have been a nerdfighter for a long long time to say that i am proud of john green barely kisses the surface i am truly amazed how exceptionally true they stayed to the book it makes me proud to see how the characters that i have connected to and loved in such a deep way on screen makes mei dont know its hard to put into words to those who havent read the book and to those who have you will walk out of the cinema a different person it will make you appreciate the people you have in this precious thing we call life it was beautiful,sad
is an amazing movie based on the novel by john green it shows that bad things happen in life and you have to move on there are so many messages that come from this movie the movie is extremely inspiration you only get to live one life the tale shows of the time hazel grace lancaster and augustus waters spend together though they didnt get to spend as much time together as they wanted their love for each other was infinite cancer was the problem that caused their separation but it was also what brought them togetherno one wanted to get hurt they didnt want it to be perfect they wanted it to be different they wanted to be happy they were but without so much pain they fought for love they may have lost a few battles but their love would be eternal foreverokay okay,sad
trying to review the movie i face the same challenge as i had in reviewing the book its such a fantastic tragic ecstatic funny thoughtful story and for me theres just too much going on too many wonderful aspects to it to ever properly convey it in writing or speech i read the book five times the first time canonballed in six hours one time out loud to my girlfriend the story is important to me on so many levels and as a result i was immensely nervous walking into the theater id seen that john green loved it id seen him interacting with the cast id seen the trailer but i had to see the movie for myself to be sure i wanted the movie to do the book justice it did not disappoint it was noted above my review but for those of you who havent read the book there are spoilers below more than anything the movie conveys the emotion of the book extremely well hazels apathy and depression at the beginning of the book the spark created by augustus the elation and disappointment from the on and off state of the trip to amsterdam and the absolute dread when augustus says i lit up like a christmas tree its all there and it does all of that while being able to make you cry one moment and burst into laughter the next just as well as the book did or even experience both simultaneously some scenes were cut that i would have preferred be left in but i am happy they werent afraid to take the film over two hours in length if only slightly i do look forward to seeing deleted scenes including johns cameo later down the road when the dvd comes out until then ill wait happily knowing that theres one more movie out there in the exclusive club of excellent and truly good movie adaptations of books,sad
i read years ago without any idea of it becoming as big as it would it was simply a recommended book on amazon and i needed something to read to keep myself from going insane due to school work so i read chapter after chapter finding myself so in love and envious of the relationship augustus and hazel had hoping despite all odds there would be a happy ending amongst the infinitiescharacters  storysomewhere in the world there was a girl named hazel shailene woodley who spent her time reading a book people watching and drowning her days in television then her world is shaken by this pest named augustus ansel elgort like her cancer he came uninvited and infected her being finding his way in first through her eyes and mind before eventually working himself into her heart she tries to reject his pursuit knowing that ultimately things wouldnt end well but after the denial that someone could find her beautiful the short term anger which came from thinking he smokes cigarettes came the bargaining she would let herself be happy and let him try his best to do sothis lasts for quite some time and then depression kicks in for as happy as they are it doesnt take away from the fact both are cancer stricken but there is an acceptance that they both will eventually die but with a finite amount of time to do an infinite amount of things why waste any moment thinking about that which is out of their control when the opportunity of love has entered their lives something once thought of to maybe not be an optionpraiseone of the most difficult things when it comes to book adaptations is getting the characters right woodley as hazel i admit didnt seem to fit at first but with me seeing more and more of woodleys work since the secret life of the american teenager it is easy to see why she is quickly becoming the go to girl for films like these as i said in divergent the abilities of woodley to portray a simple character and make her into something with a heartbeat is astounding for while arguably none of her characters seem that complex on paper or when introduced she pushes past that and helps us see the hope and genuine desire in each character to live a fulfilling life making her casting as hazel impeccable woodley is able to express hazels downtrodden nature without the shedding of tears and as jaded as hazel is you can see her vulnerable to the idea of being happy when gus enters her life and the hope he brings you can see it in every hug kiss and tear being like a shot of happiness she thought no make a wish foundation could ever fulfilland thankfully while like any adaptation some things are cut or reduced the story keeps the big moments when it comes to gus and hazels relationship which will surely put a smile on your face for while they are a bit overly cutesy it does remind you of the time when the concept of love wasnt tainted by past relationships or heartbreak and it seemed like all there could be is possibilitiescriticismhowever as i watched the film i must say that sharing the experience in a room filled with squealing young ladies really does ruin the experience though i could also say that it might have to do with the casting as elgort as well as with any film adaptation there is the issue of what you envisioned characters to be versus what you will get with the film and for me elgort as gus was much more arrogant and douchelike than i pictured gus also he does not have the same ability woodley has to take a character and bring them to life arguably i felt he was more so trying to charm the girls in the audience than hazel in an effort to make himself elgort that is into a heartthrobwhich isnt to say as you got used to elgort you cant be seduced by his charm but i still had such a difficult time seeing this young man as gus which leads to perhaps the biggest issue which maybe because of me not agreeing with the casting of elgort and that is that despite how sad certain moments in the movie are i didnt find myself crying surprisingly i got teary eyed when woodley did her thing but for everyone else it just was this weird recognition that yes i am witnessing a sad moment but the majority of the actors never fully got me to that place where i couldnt hold back my emotions overall worth seeingwhile i have small qualms over things like casting which surely kept me from fully being immersed though knowing what was to happen surely didnt help this isnt to say this isnt a good movie to me has all the makings of a genuine classic for this decade and perhaps generation you have your usual male lead willing to do and say anything to make his love interest smile and said love interest is a witty smart and sweet young woman who needs to hear feel and experience all the guy has to offer making for a film which inspires you could make you a bit envious and furthers your thoughts on the ideal life partner and relationship for while hazel and gus time is finite seeing all they are willing to do for each other in these finite moments it can potentially leave you speechless and balling in tears,sad
there are film adaptations that dont even scratch the surface of the original book there are film adaptations that blow the book so out of proportion that it isnt even about the book any more and then theres having read the book prior to watching the film i had very high expectations simply put this film adaptation nails it the screenplay doesnt copy the book word for word but it doesnt need to the plot casting setting and props are nailed to a t and of course as with any film adaptation the screenplay has its own quirks but it fits so perfectly that even the most ocd of bookreaders wouldnt twitch an eye over them if youve read the book you will definitely approve of this movie and bring a tissue box to the theatres youre definitely going to need it try not to mind all the ugly sobbing youll hear around you ,sad
first and foremost for those die hard fans out there the film does a great job of following the book is it just me or are filmmakers finally understanding that fan viewers really like to see the story they read visually portrayed with that though does come some downfalls i loved the fact that the story swayed very little from the book but because it did so i think the film lost some of its magic it was less of an emotional journey as in the book readers were in the first person narrative of hazel grace in the film not as much not just that but there were definitely some pleaser lines if you will that is the welladored quotes from the book are loud and clear throughout the film almost as if picking out the popular items from the novel and using them as items in the storyline to help sell it to the audience it felt somewhat disconnected to me like the story existed to tell these insights i understand the audience will love it but i didnt think these insights were delivered with the personality the book intended i was surprised that the title line the quote that identifies the reasoning behind the popular title was left out unless i just missed itas for the casting woodley and elgort delivered the personalities of hazel and augustus perfectly woodley had the cool and distant demeanor and elgort did a particularly good job with his facial expressions which were slight but delivered quite the blow these two are going to become headlining actors after their performance in divergent and now personally i think both woodley and elgort were more suited to the roles of hazel and augustus than they were meant for tris and caleb in divergentduring the film i was most looking forward to the confrontation between peter van houten and hazel and gus this scene was very good even though peter wasnt quite as i expected him william defoe portrayed the actor with ideas i actually liked better than i originally imagined him the scene followed as expected but again lost its touch of magic as we were outside hazels thoughts and certain things such as peters assistant and the swedish rap music seemed underdeveloped in comparison to the novelthe scene i was most impressed with actually followed the author confrontation scene when hazel gus and lidewij went to anne franks house whoa the symbolism here and hazels stubbornness were more dominant than what i remembered in the book at one point the symbolism became a touch overdone but i suppose the whole thing suited the taste of the film following the major ideals and metaphors of the book hazels comparison to anne frank and their two stories two struggles met in that house i was impressed with the interpretations in this sceneeven though i continue to say the film had less magic than the book i understand that novel and film are two completely different mediums with two completely different ways of presenting a story while i was grateful for the filmmakers to keep the story so close to its original script john greens book i admit i wished to see a touch more interpretation its one thing to make the characters move and say the same things as they do in the novel but another to make the audience feel the same way about them josh boone really did a superb job directing this film but as usual the novel holds more emotional impact than the film was able to deliver of course i still shed a tear or two it is an emotional story after allas for the elements of film im much less educated to this aspect however i was constantly impressed with the costumes of all the characters isaacs character probably surprised me the most but it was a pleasant surprise as i realized i hadnt spent too much time creating isaac as a character while i read hazels loose somewhat baggy clothes suited a cancerridden frame of a sick child she wore simple tees in basic nottooloud colors that suited her whatever careful nottogettooclose to anyone attitude and augustus wore that brown leather jacket like a hero it suited his athletic build  a shadow to his life before cancer but it also reminded me of a fighter pilot a motorcyclist or some other action figure that perfectly suited augustuss consistent desire for heroismwhile i know little about the mechanics of film other than operating a few digital projectors at work i really enjoyed the way this film was shot the scenes didnt hover around the characters but made them part of a larger picture the images were sometimes blurred and bright  beautiful simple yet artistic i dont always notice the cinematography i hope that is the right word but the way was filmed seemed another artistic filter for the story directly it is how hazel and gus would have imagined it i believealso the soundtrack was amazing there are probably about thirty seconds of film that i entirely missed is that ray lamontagne it is im sure of it oooh i havent heard this song before  and so on again the soundtrack was another artistic element that persuaded the film to be a touch more of john greens beloved novelis a film that will please audiences whether they are john green fans or not it is emotional but happy as well you shouldnt leave sad and you wont cry uncontrollably so its probably okay for a date night movie for more please see my original review on my blog rawr is for reading  and check out other book to box office reviews,sad
no movie genre makes me cry more than a movie about cancer a walk to remember my sisters keeper now is good are a few films that destroyed me emotionally but i adore them the book by john green is great read and this film serves the book justice if not more so i felt a lot more closure at the end of this film than i did reading the book now is good is so similar to this film but both stand on their own as individual films about the destruction of cancer i think fault in our stars is actually better than now is good but id say that has a lot to do with john green amazing amazing film broke my heart but a good movie should be able to do so ansel elgort is just beautiful and so believable as the character of gus shailene woodely does a great job as hazel too the casting was spot on highly recommend this film,sad

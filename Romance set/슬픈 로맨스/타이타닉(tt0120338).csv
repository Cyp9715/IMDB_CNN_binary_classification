every once in a while the conversation will turn to favorite movies ill mention and at least a couple people will snicker i pay them no mind because i know that five years ago these same people were moved to tears by that very movie and theyre too embarrassed now to admit iti just rewatched for the first time in a long time expecting to simply enjoy the story again i was surprised to find that the movie has lost none of its power over these five years i cried again in all the same places it brought me back to 1997 when i can remember how a movie that no one thought would break even became the most popular movie of all time a movie that burst into the public consciousness like no other movie i can recall yes even more than star wars and today many people wont even admit they enjoyed it folks lets get something straight  you dont look cool when you badmouth this film you look like an out of touch cynicno movie is perfect and this one has a few faults some of the dialogue falls flat and some of the plot surrounding the two lovers comes together a little too neatly however none of this is so distracting that it ruins the filmleonardo dicaprio and kate winslet are wonderful leo is one of the fine actors of his generation wait til you see him in gangs of new york before you call him nothing more than a pretty boy kate winslet was so strong in this film the movie really was hers and she held it together beautifullyjames cameron managed what many believed was impossible by recreating a completely believable the sinking scenes were horrific just as they were that night how anyone can say the effects were bad is beyond me i was utterly transfixedthis film is one memorable scene after another leaving port in southampton rose and jack at the bow flying iceberg right ahead the screws hanging unbelievably out of the ocean the screams of the doomed after she went down and that ending that brought even the burliest man in the theater to tearsthe music which has also been a victim of the films success was a key ingredient james horners score was simply perfect and the love theme was beautiful and tragic too bad celine dions pop song version had to destroy this great bit of music for so manyi confess i am a buff as such i relished the opportunity to see the ship as we never got to see it  in all its beauty perhaps watching it sink affected me more than some because ive had such an interest in the ship all my life however i doubt many of those i saw crying were buffs i applaud cameron for bringing this story to the masses in a way that never demeaned the tragedy the film was made with such humanityanother reviewer said it better than i ever could open up your hearts to and you will not be disappointed,sad
back in 1997 do i remember that year clinton bans cloning research the unfortunate death of princess diana the marlins won the world series and a woman gave birth to septuplets this was also the big year in the release of one of the biggest films of all time a tale about the ship of dreams about a boy and a girl who fall in love but are torn apart by their social class and at the height of their emotional commitment the ship meets with disaster i dont think anybody could have expected to be as huge as it was the movie was bigger than life and had millions of fans 85 of them being teenage girls i was 12 years old at the time and of course saw the movie multiple times it was the film that made me believe that the love that jack and rose shared was so real and beautiful at the time i felt that could do no wrong of course i grew up and didnt watch the film since i was 14 a couple years ago i saw the film on dvd for 599 and figured that it was a good price and to see what i thought about the movie now was it worth the hype was it really the best movie of all time was that leonardos real nose ok i know thats silly to say but i did rewatch the film being completely honest here is a great movie it delivered in romance humor disaster emotions and took us on this incredible maiden voyagethe film starts with brock lovett and his team exploring the wreck of the rms searching for a necklace set with a valuable blue diamond called the heart of the ocean unsuccessful they instead discover a drawing of a young woman wearing the heart of the ocean dated the day the sank 101yearold rose dawson calvert learns of the drawing and contacts lovett to inform him she is the woman in the drawing when asked if she knew the whereabouts of the necklace rose calvert recalls her memories aboard the revealing for the first time that she was rose dewitt bukater in 1912 the upperclass 17yearold rose boards the ship with her controlling fianc cal hockley and her desperate for money mother ruth dewitt bukater distraught and frustrated by her engagement rose attempts suicide by jumping from the stern before she leaps a drifter and artist named jack dawson intervenes who convinces her not to jump jack and rose strike up a tentative friendship as she thanks him for saving her life and he shares stories of his adventures traveling and sketching their bond deepens when they leave a firstclass formal dinner of the wealthy for a much livelier gathering of dancing music and beer in thirdclass after revealing their love for each other and wish to leave together when the ship docks they then witness the ships fatal collision with an iceberg and now must escape togetherso does live up to its hype i still say that this is a great movie to watch i think that there were and still are quite a few haters that for some reason just want to trash the movie because it had won a ton of awards and leo mania was born at the time everyone is entitled to an opinion but please dont let the haters bother you from watching this great movie it has great acting amazing effects beautiful costumes outstanding sets a wellwritten story and still looks flawless love it or hate it you have to admit this movie didnt get a lot of hype just because of leos baby face or kates amazing ability to cry on sight this film is something special otherwise i dont think wed still be talking about it so many years later kate and leo had this amazing chemistry that in my opinion made it one of the greatest love stories of all time despite the story not being the most original with the rich girl loves poor boy plot i think it worked extremely well because they fit so well together james cameron the extreme perfectionist that he is went over time and money budgets for but this was his baby and it paid off very well james had captured everything about and the sinking so well he respectfully shows what terror the victims went through that night and made sure that this wasnt just a love story but to remember those who lost their lives on the tragic voyage he had every right in my opinion to scream im king of the world at the oscars because this movie blew everyone out of the waterno pun intended you know what im going to admit it i love even past my teen years i absolutely adore this movie it will always hold a special place in my heart it has too since i saw this film 8 times in the theater when it was released remember one thing be true to yourself dont follow the crowd lovers or haters if you go with the hype youre always going to go crazy over a film before viewing it then if you thought the film was just alright for some reason it comes off as the worst movie ever i do recommend its a great one and sure to go down in the classics one day1010,sad
ah yes the film that propelled leonardi dicapro to super stardom became the first film to gross 1 billion and stayed on the top of the box office charts for 12 years only to be kicked off the top by another james cameron film avatarit is said is the film with the most continuity errors of all films despite this though the film was indeed a masterpiece the sheer scale of the sets and entire production were simply mind blowing the sinking of the was the greatest ship sinking scene ever and was done with such meticulous detail that one would think they actually really sunk the ship off course that was not the case though as it were all very elaborate sets most of which were destroyed during the making of the filmleonardo made for a very likable hero quite frankly one a lot of guys can relate to the young lovers were so different and yet so alike and their love story was almost endearing i must admit the jumping backwards and forwards in time was a bit unnecessary and resulted in an overlong epic they should only have told the 1912 story apart from that the film was thrilling exciting and fascinating in every sense of the word,sad
good lord this movie right here its a masterpiece i am not exaggerating when i say this tonight was the first time i watched this i watched some parts of it earlier but i thought it would probably be boring and that i had better things to do tonight i watched the whole thing with my grandmother i was completely wrong on that this was the best movie that ive ever seen and probably ever will see in my entire life me and my grandmother were both in tears by the end of it there were two scenes which made me cry the part where the orchestra played nearer my god to thee and the end when all those perished on the applaud at the kiss of rose and jack this movie was absolutely amazing and i would watch it over and over again,sad
is one of my all time favourite films im a 24 year old guy who has probably not cried in front of anyone since i was a kid but this movie plays on my emotions more than almost any other we all know the ship will sink does that even qualify as a spoiler but the buildup to this event  the smugness and over confidence assurances of it being unsinkable  tease the audience almost to the point where youre like is it really going to sinki thought the performances of everyone were magnificent i cared about the characters and their lives on and beyond the ship taking the time to introduce everyone and weave their stories together was masterful even beyond the main characters like fabrizio and murdoch the first officer and countless more it was heartbreaking towards the end when you see the panic gradually set in and it slowly descends into total chaos you remember jack telling rose all the places hes going to take her to and you imagine their love filled lives together the irish mother telling her children the fairytale resigned to their fate the violinists trying to maintain a spirit of composure amidst the carnage and the music wow i cried for all of this and especially right at the end when you see the photos of roses life knowing shes fulfilled her promise and survived living a full life probably never having met anyone she loved as much as jack all those years agovisually pleasing in every way dramatic musically astounding great acting and above all a fantastic story make this an undeniably iconic enduring film a romanticdrama unlike any other it deserves higher than 77,sad
firstly and foremostly i am a guy which in most cases means i did not go see to see dicaprioalthough i think he can be a great actor  reading through earlier comments i grew a bit weary of hearing about lame script and shallow characters  i went to see a ship sinkthe plot and the characters were at least to me a kind of icing on the cake  i actually think a lot of the characters were done well that is by the time they die in freezing water you actually felt a tinge of sadness for them  but  by the time was over i was sufficiently moved to make me tell people that it was a great movie  kate winslet was good kathy bates was perfect leo was ok ill give you people that  ive seen him shine like i know he can  basketball diaries romeo  juliet  but ultimately the sinksand it was absolutely stunning  bravo to cameron  he didnt just show us a large ship sinking he showed us the back half of it crashing down on a hundred freezing drowning people he showed us a third class mother attempting to sing her children to sleep because she knew they were all doomed broke my heart  i cried the most right there at that point he showed people who worked extremely hard to get out of the bowels of the ship only to be sucked back in when a random window shattered and the water carried them on back indetail  i like detail in a movie  very impressive job,sad
to all the miserable people who have done everything from complain about the dialogue the budget the this and the thatwho wants to hear it  if you missed the point of this beyondbeautiful movie thats your loss  the rest of us who deeply love this movie do not care what you think  i am a thirthysomething guy who has seen thousands of movies in my life and this one stands in its own entity in my book  it was not supposed to be a documentary or a completely factual account of what happened that night it is the most amazing love story ever attempted  i know that it is the cynical 90s and the millennium has everyone in a tizzy but come on someone on this comments board complained that it made too much money how lame is that  it made bundles of money in every civilized country on the planet and is the top grossing film in the planet  i will gladly side with the majority this time around okay cynics time to crawl back under your rock i am done,sad
i avoided watching this film for the longest time long before it was even released i had dismissed it as an overhyped overblown overly romanticized piece of hollywood schmaltz and i wanted nothing to do with it i never watched it in the theatre i shook my head in disbelief at the 11 academy awards  even though i had never seen it then i was asked to be a judge at a high school public speaking contest one of the girls spoke about this movie it was so great she said you really felt like you were on the ship nonsense i thought i shared my feelings with my fellow judges one looked at me and said you might be right but if she liked the movie that much maybe shell want to learn more about the real the movie must have done something right to get her so interested well maybe thought i then it finally appeared on pay tv ok i thought ill give it a look see i didnt want to like it  and i didnt i loved it what a great moviewhere to start first  the directing my high school public speaking contestant was right james cameron does a superb job of creating an almost you are there type of atmosphere the gaiety of life aboard the most elegant ship in the world the nonchalance as news of the iceberg first spreads then the rising sense of panic you dont just watch it you really do feel it then  the performances the lead performances from kate winslet as rose and leonardo dicaprio as jack are excellent  winslets being the superior i thought but both were good they had their rich girlpoor boy characters down to a perfect t i thought in my opinion though stealing the show was frances fisher as roses mother she was perfect as the snobby aristocrat and you could feel the fear and loathing she felt every time she looked at jack then  the details im no expert on the sinking of the but i have a reasonable general knowledge and this film does a super job of recreating the historical details accurately and then weaving them seamlessly around the fictional romance very impressive indeed then  the song who can watch this movie and not be taken with celine dions performance of my heart goes onproblems well the romance was perhaps too contrived in the sense that i just dont accept that jack could have moved so effortlessly from steerage to first class i know he was invited the first time but he seems to keep getting into first class without being stopped until hes been there for a while the realities of the separation of the social classes were much more realistically portrayed i thought when the steerage passengers were going to be left locked down there after the ship hit the iceberg while the first class folks got to enjoy half empty lifeboats a minor quibble though this is truly an excellent movie my only regret is not seeing it in the theatre where i think it would have been so much more impressive910,sad
james camerons shares a similar motto to marmite you either love it or hate it i for one love this film yes i know its got a drawn out romance story but theres just something about the 3hour fill of the film that makes its such a spectacularly emotional and beautiful movie i saw this a lot when i was growing up this was one of the films of my childhood it is truly a powerfully resonant and visually stunning movie of epic proportions personally i favour the british original a night to remember but this is a pretty close contender winner of 11 oscars james camerons romanticdisaster epic is a triumph of cinema that boasts perfect chemistry between kate and leo as the lovers bound for tragedy many people disregard this film nowadays solely because its become the most popular film ever made alongside camerons other epic avatar and whilst is definitely not one of my favourite films its just so powerfully amazing and no doubt at all it has once brought a tear to everyones eyes the main aspect i love in this film is james horners haunting score that was a key ingredient in the films success it is simply perfect too bad celine dion had to close this on her awful pop version nonetheless is a modern classic and a beautifully spectacular film that will live on,sad
i saw this movie opening day and it took my breath away james camerons fictional story of jack and rose entwined with real life occurances was haunting and absolutely beautiful he is an amazing director and writer that this movie would not have worked without himkate winslet was stunning as rose and this movie belonged to her as you couldnt imagine anyone else playing this roleleonardo dicaprio was really good as jack and  he should have had an  an oscar nomination for this role and the ever brilliant billy zane didnt disappoint in his role as roses fiance cal his portrayl of cal was so evil that despite being an awful person you couldnt help but feel sorry for him especially when despite all his doings he loved rose so muchjames horners music was just as haunting and he always lifts the movie he works on to the ultimate levelkathy bates was equally impressive in a small role and provided quite a few of the laughs of the film everything from the special effects to the sets to the costumes were pure magicthis would have to be one of the most wonderful films of the 20th century and one that will never be forgotten,sad
i find it so amazing that even after all these years we are still talking about this movie obviously this movie wasnt that bad or else people wouldnt even bother to talk about it  i personally enjoyed this film immensly and still do  i guess this film isnt for everyone but it certainly did touch the hearts of many as for those that think that this film is overrated or overhypedwell we only have the moviegoing public to thank for that lol  you see its not criticsarticle writers that make a film huge or a hit with the general moviegoing public  people make the film a huge success  with everyone was in awe  lets face it a film like this had never been made before  at least not with the type of special effects needed to really capture the essence of the ship actually sinking this film is so accurate that even james cameron timed the actual sinking of the ship in the film with the real sinking that fateful day in april 1912 even the silverware for goodness sakes matched  give this movie a break you guys  the critics thought this movie would sink big time  when this movie actually came out and people started hearing by word of mouth which is the best form of advertisement mind you that this was a gooddecentmovie worth seeing then everyone started flocking to the theaters in droves to see this movienot once not twice but maybe 3 times and more  so i really wouldnt say that this movie was overhypedat least not like the buildup for the matrix reloaded or the hulk is being overhyped  ha  critics didnt even think that would make enough money to cover camerons gigantic film budget that it took to make this mammoth of a film  however the films money took care of that 200 million budget and much more  personally i love this film  however this film might not be for everyone dont say that this film sucks just because of romance though  that is the most sexist thing ive ever heard disliking a movie just because it has romance in it  the story was sweet  the dialogue could have been better but lets face itthe real star of the movie wasnt leo or kateit was that gigantic ship    i think all of the actors including dicaprio and winslet did a fine job  its not thier best work ive seen much better work from both of them but it wasnt the worst ive seen on screen before give them a break,sad
directed by james cameron presents a fictional love story on the historical setting of the  the plot is simple noncomplicated or not for those who love plots that twist and turn and keep you in suspense the end of the movie can be figured out within minutes of the start of the film but the love story is an interesting one however  kate winslett is wonderful as rose an aristocratic young lady betrothed by cal billy zane early on the voyage rose meets jack leonardo dicaprio a lower class artist on his way to america after winning his ticket aboard in a poker game  if he wants something he goes and gets it unlike the upper class who are so concerned with their social worries  the two fall in love and the audience sees the sinking of the primarily through their eyesthe movie begins in modern times with the exploration of the wreck by a group searching for treasures that sunk with the which has recently occurred  one of the survivors of the rose dewitt bukater who had heard of the exploration of the wreck on television and is flown to the boat where the search is being led from to tell of what she remembers to help the search  she gets to telling her memory of the one and only voyage of the  with this the scene shifts to southhampton ireland where the set sail from on april 10 1912 as all the passengers are boarding  after another stop on the irish coast went out to see on its maiden voyage across the atlantic bound for new york historically the first few days of the voyage went by uneventful but the fictional plot of the story is developed during this time as rose sees the hopeless entrapement of an engagement that she is in to the wealthy cal hockley and falls in love with third class passenger jack dawson captain smith alledgedly as shown in the movie was urged by the white star line director to increase the speed of the ship so they would make the newspaper headlines and receive extra publicity by arriving in new york on thursday night and not on friday morning as planned  smith then ordered the fateful decision going against his thirtytwo years of experience to stretch the legs out to full speed  the had reports that the waters in the atlantic they were sailing in were full of icebergs but they ignored these warnings and proceeded at full speed as shown in the movie  on april 15 1912 at 1139 an iceberg was sighted  they attempted to shut off the engines and turn the ship out of the path of the iceberg but there was not enough time and the ship hit the iceberg on the starboard side as depicted in the film  the portrayal of the many small holes in the side of the ship and not one large gash along the side is accurate  the crew of sent out distress calls and set off distress rockets as shown until 218 when the lights finally failed  the lights of the california were spotted six miles away but they failed to realize what was going on and did not respond to many pleas for help  the california had tried earlier in the day to warn of the severe ice that had caused them to stop their trip but had brushed them off causing the california to turn off its radio and leave the on its own  the first class women and children were the first as depicted to be put into the twenty lifeboats that were on the ship  overwhelmingly the third class passengers suffered the most amount of deaths of any class and the crew was hit hard in this tragedy too the word of white star line employees and first class passengers was believed over that of second and third class passengers when authorities were trying to gain information of the sinking  also the metal that was used to build the has been found in recent years under conditions of severe cold which were experienced the night sank to be extremely brittle  overall the basic plot is very accurate in its portayal of the events and the times at which these events took place on the many of the characters in the story were not real and created simply for the purpose of the movie or as composite characters to represent possible characteristics and ideas of people on the ship  the core group of rose jack cal and roses mother all were fictional characters added into the story as they represent different groups of people from the time  yet many characters such as the unsinkable molly brown captain edward smith the ship designer thomas andrew the white star line representative bruce ismay and all of the officers were real  the maiden voyage was going to be captain edward smiths last voyage anyway as he planned to retire afterwards  he had been a part of the white star line since 1880 where he worked his way up to his status as the millionaires captain when the sunk  the portrayals of the officers is accurate as only four survived the tragedy except for the officer who threatened to kill all of the passengers of the ship with his pistol  he is on record as acting heroicly and was misportrayed to the point that james cameron apologized and evoked a monument in his honor in the officers former canadian hometown as shown in the movie there was a language problem between the crew and many of the lowerclass passengers from nonenglish speaking nations  in addition officer lowe was the only officer who came back in the lifeboat as depicted  the old people shown in their bed as the water came in their room were based on the strauss  not wanting to leave her husbands side mrs strauss refused to get in her lifeboat and died with her husband on the  furthermore mr goggenheim who was shown sipping his brandy and smoking a cigar reportedly did go out like this dressed in his best  the richest man on the ship john jacob astor who owned most of manhattan died nonetheless as well but his much younger wife was saved in a lifeboat in addition molly brown was saved and later had medals made up for the crew of the carpethia that picked the survivors of up from the water  her ticket on the had cost over fourthousand dollars and by the end of her life she ended up broke  all of the interiors of the ship were masterfully replacated down to the last pieces of china and silverware the gymnasium which is hardly seen is recreated perfectly with all of the machines reproduced to match those seen in old photographs  the wonderful outfits and costuming were an excellent recreation of the postvictorian era of 1912  the rich at this time practically ruled everything as the womens suffrage movement had not quite gotten moving yet  women during this time often married for financial security as rose was considering doing and normally took a back seast status to their husbands as cal wished for rose to do  the rich did not take well to new money such as molly brown as depicted  everything of the time was very formal  women had to be escorted to dinner by a male figure as seen with in the dining scenes smoking was not very common among women of the time but holders of cigarettes which were just coming in at the time were used as seen with rose in the movie  men of the time generally smoked cigars not cigarettes women were constained physically by their corsets and socially by society although james cameron had no background in historical films he brought in experts of coupled with two years spent crossreferencing the history of the and few liberties were taken  the beautiful cinematography and special effects also helped to make the film even more breathtakinga recognizable message can be seen in the movie as the people on the ship had about three hours to contemplate their demise  the director james cameron shows the various reactions to this time of crisis in peoples lives  everyone reacts differently and he gets you to think of how you might have reacted had you been in that situation on the on that fateful night  in addition this film is a reflection of the 1990s when it was produced as it gives a look into the wreck of the  only in the past fifteen years has the site of the actual been found and explored  this movie was able to give us a deeper look into a disaster that many would not have viewed  however the moral question of whether people today should be taking treasures from the wreck of an underwater graveyard is posed  there have been attempts to stop treasure seeking missions such as the one portrayed in but all have failed  as it stands today anyone can make a voyage to the and take whatever valuables they as portrayed in the film showing the general values of our time on this mattertechnically the film is very well done  to get footage of the wreck at the bottom of the ocean it took twelve dives to get all of the footage needed for the movie  in addition a special camera had to be created to withstand the intense pressure at the bottom of the ocean  cameron did not plan on using the probe to go as far inside as anyone has in the 88 years since the ship sunk but it worked out that this provided an unique perspective into the ship  furthermore throughout the film fade ins and outs from the wreck of to the scene of during its actual voyage  this shift between the modern scene to the past scene during the voyage works as an excellent transition that makes the story easy to follow in aclear manner  at the very beginning of the movie a septune recreation is used to recreate the scene when the actual people left the european coast on giving it distinction from the rest of the events of the filmplays almost like a historical biography and is like a work of art a true epic  like most history novels we know the ending but it doesnt take away from the wonderful treats that can be found in this picture certain aspects of this film are academy award material including costuming sound cintematography and editing  if you like interesting characters that will give you an insight into the life of characters in the early 1900s and how they face disaster then this movie definitely is for you,sad
this movie rewrote film history in every way  no one cares what anyone thinks about this movie because it transcends criticism  every flaw in the movie is easily overcome by the many amazing things the movie has going for it  it is an extremely beautiful movie and i doubt many of us will see anything like it again ive seen it more times than i care to count and i still become transfixed every time with a feeling which is hard to describe  one for the ages,sad
you can watch this movie in 1997 you can watch it again in 2004 or 2009 or you can watch it in 2015 or 2020 and this movie will get you every time has made itself forever a timeless classic i just saw it today 2015 and i was crying my eyeballs out just like the first time i saw it back in 1998 this is a movie that is so touching so precise in the making of the boat the acting and the storyline is brilliant and the preciseness of the ship makes it even more outstanding kate winslet and leonardo dicaprio definitely created a timeless classic that can be watched time and time again and will never get old this movie will always continue to be a beautiful painful  tragic movie 1010 stars for this masterpiece,sad

thirteen years after launched and all it takes is the first few bars of that haunting music to transport me back to my first time watching the movie in the theater it was beyond comprehension  the entire spectacle and production i bought the books read the history books and found myself immersed in all thingsi didnt hurt that my great great aunt was on the ship and survived it makes it a little personal for me in fact i happen to own one of the only objects in existence that came off of the ship into a lifeboat and did not go into the waterlove the movie  it still is 1 in my book,sad
its really quite odd when first came outthe reviews were mixed but the public generally loved itthose who disliked the film were definitely in the minority over the yearsit has became somewhat fashionable to slag offeven if a great many of those people who did so were probably amongst those who made it such an enormous hit in the cinemas is flaweddefinitelysometimes greatly so howeverits also a tremendous achievement for its director james cameron mixing a real disaster with romance is harder to do than some might think maybe he did have a right to say im king of the world when the film won best picture at the oscars just oncethe modern day opening is excellentmaking effective use of some of camerons real footage he took of the sunken there is a real sense of mystery than we flash back to the being boardedand the film stalls just a little for around two hours the attention to detail is amazing even all the cutlery matchedyou know and there is nothing wrong with an extremely slow build up to actionthink of the seven samourai howeverthe central romance between leo and kate is often badly written and unconvincing for a start kates rose would certainly not have done two things she does in the film as quickly as she did obviously thousands of teenage girls seeing the film in 1997 would disagree with my views we also have to suffer cameron constantly labouring the point that the poor people on the ship are better than the rich peoplehoweverthe final 80 or so minutesdetailing the sinkingis simply brilliant film making the suspense is built expertlyeven though we know what will happenand climaxes with some technical shots which are still impressive perhaps there is a little two much emphasis on the central couplebut there are some truly moving momentsand it really feels truealthough of course cameron did play with the facts a little here and thereas at least one descendant of one of the survivors has pointed out the following sequence involving the boats is extremely hauntingwith some especially good use of sound as for the final sceneit does manage to be pretty movingits schmaltzy but it works though hardly originalthink of somewhere in time and various 40s romantic fantasieshas some excellent use of cgi watch out for the transitions from present to the past on the sunken ship and one glaringly bad special effectthe iceberg which looks like polystyrene james horners best selling score is really quite poor and only occasionally brings the emotion it should do performances are generally excellent and sometimes succeed in overcoming some thin characterisation such as billy zane as roses fiancewho even has to suffer with far too much eye make upoverall is still worth seeingand sometimes it really does hit the heights that it should it succeeds more than it failswhich is impressive in a film as ambitious as this,sad
for me the best film of all time as a work of art his memory is perpetual in my memory and his greatness to this day excites me,sad
its a crying freaking shame that this outstanding movies rating has been dragged down by small people who hate it because it was successful you should be ashamed of yourselves when i first saw it i thought it was the perfect movie and its still one of my favorites 8 years later its got sexual tension action social commentary and the acting doesnt suck its even got bill paxton one of my top 10 criteria for a great movie whats so horrible about it that it deserves an aggregate 69 the only reason i can think of is this perverse habit people have of hating anything that makes so much money or is otherwise successful that it makes them doubt their own worth thats just sad and you shouldnt take it out on an innocent blockbuster,sad
i dont know how to explain my feelings but this movie give tears for my eyes,sad
even though some of the actual events did not occur in reality as portrayed in the film i feel as if the film portrayed the events to the best of their ability i thought that the film did a good job of displaying the hardships and diversity between social classes the characters interactions and emotions about the situations and conflicts they were faced with were also depicted well leonardo dicaprio one of my favorite actors and kate winslet play amazing roles as jack and rose and they do it justice the connection and relationship between the two is a story in itself within the film as well as the ships tragedyas a young girl i watched this movie many many times with my grandmother after watching it so much i became obsessed with learning about the to this day i still enjoy doing research about the actual ship the people aboard the engineers who built the ship the accident the aftermath and what is still being found in the bottom of the atlantic eve since i was young i have loved the i hope you do too,sad
it really physically hurts me when i dont see it in top 250 in imdbs listi am from india where the general perception of hollywood movies are that they are more action oriented big budget entertaining filmswe consider our films to be more emotional and poignanthowever this movie is the most heart touching story i have ever seen on screeni could see peoples faces with tears rolling down after departing from the cinema halli could hear my father saying  never knew that these people could make such heart warming moviesmaybe i am going a bit too farbut this is my way of paying tribute to the greatest movie ever made,sad
such a beautiful love story one of the most legendary movies ever made and i love it so much acting is really amazing leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet are both so talented and they nailed their parts the plot is super good and i dont think this classic contains any negative things except jacks death and the fact that this movie is very sad but im still giving it a 10 because lets face it its a classic duh,sad
when you have a film this big and successful it just stands to reason that a number of people are going to try to bash it especially when it happens to be a romance and sure enough i am the only male i know who has anything positive at all to say about it is all of the criticism warranted lets seejim cameron didnt need to create this hugescale heavily detailed historical drama to prove to me he was a great director this film did pretty much convince the rest of the moviegoing world though we all know the story of this great luxury liner sinking to the bottom of the atlantic ocean on that chilly april evening in 1912 the substantial loss of life still ranks among the great human tragedies of recent history 911 pearl harbor etc cameron spared no cost of either time or money to make the ship and its furnishings look exactly as they would have on that maiden voyage in terms of technical detail this film is without peerthe cast is generally appealing leo dicaprio is far from a worldclass actor but his enthusiastic and earnest portrayal of jack dawson couldnt have been done better kate winslet looks right in her element as a pampered young debutant trying to brake away from her boring life consisting of endless dinners and tea parties kathy bates as the unsinkable molly brown is always likeable and the rest of the cast mostly brits does a good job of filling out their respective roles of cast and crew billy zane gives the films best performance as winslets greedy snobbish fiancee he is one of our most underrated actors and you have to love david warner as his bodyguardenforcer   as far as the special effects go its hard to imagine the sinking of the ship could have been filmed any better each time you view it you seem to get a different perspective of just how lucky any of those passengers were to survive not only the actual sinking but waiting around in life boats for help to arrive as of this writing only three known survivors are still alive one can only imagine how many countless hours it took to conceive of shoot and edit the last hour of the film the results are terrificthere are flaws in the overall mix however some of the dialogue mostly leos is down right corny when youve got nothing youve got nothing to lose or you seem like kind of an indoor girl are two examples also the notion that a guy from steerage class could go up and mingle with the first class passengers under any circumstances is not plausable keep in mind that a first class ticket on in todays economy would go for 80000 these were some rich people and they wouldnt have let a guy like dawson near themanyone who watches this film will have to endure numerous scenes of sappy romance this film is a romance above all else just tough it out if it bothers you its not that badthis film is tragic exciting sensual pretentious corny extravagant and even a little cheesy and i love every damn minute of it5 of 5 starsso sayeth the hound,sad
this is exactly what i think it annoys me when people say they dont like this movie yes it might not be a masterpiece but this was a damn good cinematic achievement benhur has a higher rating than this and its about a man and his encounter with jesus if they have an epic with jesus mentioned that is in the imdb top 250 then they should have this movie in the top 250 this was a very realistic movie yes james cameron might have stretched some issues but they are very plausiblei always tear up when the music gets intense anyone who has seen this will know what i mean or when i hear the academy award winning song that was in this movie my heart will go on i tear up this is the only movie that has made me cry i dont think ill find another epic like this thatll make me cryive watched about 34 of all the movies in the top 250 and at the very least half of them are unworthy of the place they are in hell about a third of what i watched ought not to be on this list but maybe 150 places above the bottom 100 and thats me being nicepeople just have to watch this movie with absolutely no biased opinion or preconceived notion that they heard it was bad thats how i came to love it its now my favorite movie of all timethe effects are the best ive seen since the epics of the 50s the acting was brilliant and gloria stuart should have won best supporting actress for old rose hell kathy bates should have grabbed a nomination at least not a win but just a nomination maybe victor garber should have gotten a nomination for best supporting actor the same with jonathan hyde thats how believable i think this was the second movie to win 11 oscars in cinematic history and the highest grossing movie of all time this ought to be right up there in the ratings with benhurpeople have to think twice about the rating they gave it and give it a higher rating thats my opinion i dont care what anybody thinks about it it is just out there like it or hate it think twice on this movie before giving it a low rating1510 thats what i believe,sad
it had 11 academy awardsand gets a bad rating its a strange thing,sad
an extraordinary interest still exists in camerons film still argument rages over just how good it is the timing of its release was significant the obsession with the film might be explained as a form of pre millennial tension at the close of the most murderous century the human race has known a century which began with such hope and optimism and in which the was ironically such a proud symbol a night to remember was released amid worries about the bomb and the feeling that science was again out of control amid millennial jitters the most discussed aspect is the script there are lines in the film that are moronic irritating senseless and just plain dumb others were quoted from the ussenate enquiry which proves how people then had a better command of language than we do why do jack and rose board at southampton when theyve come from paris why doesnt the diamond fall out of roses pocket going down with a sinking ship why doesnt she find it in her pocket on the carpathia before reaching new york why is it that you can be rude to the ships owner assault and abuse the staff fly from an offlimits bow run through boiler rooms and cargo holds cause two stewards looking for you to drown distract the lookouts climb in and out of lifeboats damage property and never get into trouble why do the steerage accept rich snooty first class gatecrashing their party why why whytoo much time is spent on the wrapping footage though the unseen sunken interiors are breathtaking the taste of showing the sinking like a computer game in front of a survivor isnt questioned the dissolve of the wreck into the pristine ship packs an emotional wallop every time winslet isnt a great actress she plays the same in every film on leo when leaves port in a classic series of images we feel his joy but its downhill from herethe engine room montage is another classic but its looking artificial murdochs feet are all over the deck the ship looks like its populated by the thunderbirdsrelief victor garber arrives as thomas andrews and gives the dialogue meaning conviction dignity and charm quite a feat since thanks to camerons warped priorities he only speaks two lines a thing apparent in rose is how lacking in charm she is lighting up at table and indelicate no edwardian and as this film isnt subtle but whacks you on the head and biffs you in the stomach we must have the class speech straight away tommy ryan is the most irritating character ive seen on screen and completely unlike any irish ive met the next situation isnt credible isnt there a better way of introducing these two than the unbelievable jumping off the stern there is one good line in the dull walk and talk that a first class wench would have said this is my part of the ship huffs rose but with the spit scene any hopes of a romantic wallow are deadthe cheek of the dinner party is how jack dawson somebody who if rose had chopped his hand off with the axe would have been pushed to earn a living has the temerity to lecture a brilliant engineer a captain with 40 years experience and captains of industry on how to live life when he hasnt started shaving himself we need a unmaterialistic message in films even if it would come better from a director who hadnt overspent his budget by 100million but the portrayal of rich and poor is straight out of a propaganda film for the gulagits a pity there is such a brilliant irish band on board and there arent equally brilliant dancerswhether the film has a christian message at the core or if its proclaiming that doing your own thing is more important its hard to say the divine service was open to all classes so jack being turned away is misleading and pointless a stunning scene on the bow but there hasnt been a romantic exchange yet between this couple that convinces us such models of taste and discernment and the brightest thing they say about monet is that his use of colour is extraordinary the funniest line in film history this is a ship only so many places she could be the next shot bowling merrily along a thousand roomsthe iceberg finally turns up the collision is breathtaking the acting top notch and inseparable from the historical event even if hits the only iceberg in the whole atlantic the surreal party with music and lifejackets shows cameron can write sometimes but jack manacled up is tedious and the crew wouldnt have done that on a sinking ship the real story is lost in rose running around the lifeboats when we see them are done far better than any other version and the timeline makes perfect sensealone and helpless a tiny ship with a futile rocket in an empty ocean is inspired the film takes on a different dimension and has a touch of the sublime the images that accompany the hymn are elegiac and perfect the choreography around the last two boats cant be surpassed now we do feel a sense of the panic and despair the water through the dome a baptism of fire no one can fail to be moved by the 20 minutes of terrible destruction the lifeboat scenes couldnt have been done better and the carpathia is a painting brought to life how exactly rose retains her incognito through the years when shes a publicized actress an aviator and everything else in the known universe isnt explained the ending is a straight pinch from somewhere in time which did a better job of a love story set in 1912 the frustrating thing is how many things are done well there are gems of writing and acting it looks terrific but it proves that you can recreate the cutlery carpets staterooms clothes but its so much harder to recreate history it isnt 1912 and half the film isnt,sad
the special effects are great in this film and the love story is compelling even though there is no uncertainty as to how this movie plays out it is still quite dramatic and interesting plus you have to marvel at a movie that managed to win the academy award for best picture and was also a huge box office hit  a distinction shared with few films over the last twenty yearshowever there are a few oversimplifications of the social situation of the passengers in the context of the realities of the early 20th century that bug me every time i watch this movie first off there is a heavy handed message of rich  bored and unhappy poor  genuine and full of life given that there was absolutely no social safety net anywhere in the world in 1912 there could be nothing more brutal and grinding than being poor in that era as if there is any such thing as easy poverty at any point in history including todaysecond and somewhat accompanying the first sticking point is the idea that rose will somehow be free to be something out of a 1969 virginia slims commercial if only she can lose that rich stiff she is engaged to billy zanes character cal and run off with kindred freespirit jack this illusion not only confronts the fact of grinding poverty in early 20th century america this flies in the face of entrenched sexism enshrined in the law during that time that wasnt even confronted as a problem until the 1960s who in 1912 is going to let rose put on a pair of jeans and ride sidesaddle on coney island let her learn to pilot a plane allow her to pursue her career goals unless they involve teaching school nursing or performing ie doing something that involves serving men and even learning those skills cost money she did not have the fact is at that time a woman in america or anywhere else in the world was considered property she could either be the property of a rich man evil cal or a poor man the only main character in this movie that seems to be facing facts is roses mother who shows genuine terror at the idea of being poor again  and she should be afraid very afraidi once had a 3rd sticking point but it has been nullified over the last ten years that sticking point was that billy zanes character could feel so superior and entitled given that his wealth and stature were accidents of birth not the fruits of his own enterprise and imagination i have since come to realize that some of the smuggest most entitled people on earth are those that were born into their circumstances so i withdraw that objectionthis movie did do a service by dispelling the myth that the slogan on the was women and children first when it was in fact first class women and children first in reality if you were a firstclass woman you had a 97 chance of survival and just about every first class woman that did die chose to stay behind because she did not want to leave her husband if you were a female steerage passenger you had about a 45 chance of survival worse yet third class children had a 1 in 3 chance of survival which was the same rate of survival as the first class men not one of either the first or second class children died on thethus i still enjoy the movie immensely but i think that the false presentation of early 20th century social reality will always bother me a little every time i watch the film,sad
this film goes down in history as one of the best based on a true historical event youll feel the pain of the characters as the ship sinks its truly a human tragedy,sad
i am not a fan of romantic movies the quality of films these days has already lost my interest in it however a classic is nevertheless classic and it does hold up to its name never had i ever invested this much emotion into any movie so glad ive watched it,sad
one of the best movies at all the times there are great scents at this movie and really this is more than a movieit has an excellent score and songthey are so deepalso has won 11 oscars in 1998 leo and kate played very good at this moviealso kate winslet is very beautiful actressthe start and end of this film was very goodthe scent of jacks death was so deepin my idea 14 oscars nominations and 11 wining was worthy forabsolutely it was the best movie of james cameroons,sad
once upon a time there was a director by the name of james he brought us wonderfully thrilling sciencefiction such as terminator and aliens these movies were the stuff blockbusters were made of and he looked to have a fantastic future ahead of him as the dawn of computer generated special effects landed upon the film industry terminator 2 showed gave us glimpses of what was possible in this new eraand then it happened1997countless awardsobscene amounts of moneyoutlandish barrage of advertisingmaximum profit marginwas herei have never ever been one to jump on the bandwagon and be overly critical for the sake of it in fact i have often taken the opposite stance from the majority just to get an argument going however was a film i only took one single positive out of  that of kate winslett being absolutely gorgeous throughoutquickly  the dialogue was like something out of beverly hills 90210 the acting was more wooden than my nephews tree house images meant to terrify were actually comical man falling from ship and hitting propeller historically false dont even get me started because theres too much it had dire theme music up there with the bodyguard for cheese and the pointless love story was so tedious self absorbing and pathetic that it disrespected the plight of everyone else involved i was glad when he died and disappointed when she did notit was plainly obvious from the word go that this picture was designed to appeal to mtv watching bubblegum chewing boywithcar chasing teenage girls decaprio himself resembled something less heroic than the weedy member of a boy band who would drag their sexstarved boyfriends out for a three and a half hour chickflick hoping to get lucky later the worst aspect was that it did not stop at that point millions of dumbed down culture vultures went to see this expensive waste of celluloid because it cost so much to produce it must be great and steve and barbara said it was good and they know their movies the crowning glory arrived when swept the boards at the academy awards king james of hollywood had a serious moment of silence for the victims of the fatal evening on which his three and a half hour farce was based it looked to me as if he was praying for forgiveness after making a fortune off inaccurately portraying the circumstances that lead to the death of a lot of people however if people are stupid and sentimental enough to buy into this kind of rubbish they deserve to get ripped off good luck to hollywood if that is how they want to make money id do it if i had those kind of chances in lifeit is right up there on my all time worst movies list with other silly historically falsehuman interest tripe like the patriot and pearl harbor,sad
there is a lot of obvious hype associated with this film lets just face it though the main reasons why anyone would watch it would be for leo and cate who are not necessarily the best actors in this film im not saying theyre not good actors im saying they stunk in this film the special effects were decent and i will say the film makers did a good job making the ship eyepleasing but it even has several major flaws for instance right before the ship goes under you can see an unfinished bluescreen image behind your main charactersdont get me wrong i love the story of the real but i find this movie an insult to that story editing was atrocioustheres no reason for any film to be over 2 12 hours with the exception of maybe a biographical movie and the writing and screenplay was horribly stiltedi will say that the music was perhaps better than i could have predicted and not just the my heart will go on song either there is one scene that stands out to me when the ship is sinking and pounding bass music is heard that could very well be the highlight of the film as for the mood throughout it was extremely dull i was more relieved than sad when jack died which i know cannot be what the director intendedin a nut shell i find it horrible that they turned the beautiful story of the into an overhyped chick flick,sad
rose dewitt bukater is a beautiful young woman travelling to america to be married to the dashing cad that is caledon hockley jack dawson is a poor irish kid with little hope of getting to the land of plenty  until that is he wins tickets onto a ship making that very crossing in mere minutes jack and his friend rush onto the boat and find themselves in 3rd class with all the rest of the poor people meanwhile on the upper decks the rich enjoy the space and pleasure that comes with privilege but yet rose feels little happiness about her loveless prospects a chance meeting between jack and rose sees them fall into a passionate instant love affair but time will show them that the class divide between them is really the least of their concernsas others have mentioned seems to have enjoyed great praise and great abuse when it came out it was the biggest movie of the day sitting at the top of the charts for months and also sweeping the best picture academy award for that year however as time has gone on it has received more and more of a kicking from viewers and it has now lost a lot of the appeal and shine that it once had to some this is just a simple backlash without basis but im not sure i agreed with that of course there is an element of wanting to tear down the success of the film and perhaps wipe that smug smile off james king of the world camerons face but for me a lot of the negativity comes from people seeing the film in the cold light of day without the crowded cinema without the hype without the partner to hug up to while watchingso it is with me here the first time i watched it i was with my partner in the front room of a packed cinema and allowed myself to be carried along by the sheer spectacle and not worry too much about the finer points however watching it again i viewed it like i would any other film as such the failings came tumbling out the story is consistently weak whether it is the speed and superficiality of the central relationship or the roundly average dialogue within the script funny how a rush to sex is seen as romantic when it occurs in the movie whereas if the same tale was set in a bolton nightclub the view would not be the same part of the reason for this is the forced emotion and atmosphere of the film with james horners manipulative score constantly on hand to tell us youre meant to cry at this bit this is very different from bringing the audience into the characters and the story in a genuine way and you are not getting into this car because you want to so much as being forced in with a hood over your headof course this is not so different from many hollywood blockbuster but it is particularly noticeable here because the script and characters are so lacking director cameron cannot make up for the failings of writer cameron and instead just injects as much of this manipulative schmaltz into proceedings as he can as he waits for his effects budget to kick in when it eventually does there is no denying that it is impressive in terms of spectacle but i do wonder how this will hold up as the effects become ordinary because there is little else for the viewer to feast on certainly the performances offer very little mostly due to the material handed to them dicaprio is miscast i know it has been said countless times before but he looks far too young for the part and as he looks more adult in other films he looks younger and younger in retrospect both he and winslet are capable of so much more but neither really work individually or as a couple zane hams it up as a baddie and actually seems to be having a good time of it unlike his costars bates fisher paxton warner amis hyde and others all fill round the edges with soso performancesthere is no questioning that this was a massive success and will stand up in lists for years to come however the effects are already dating and them to one side there isnt a huge amount else to spend three hours on the love story is clunky to match the dialogue and the actors can do little with it producing an unconvincing love story that is forced out with manipulative and exploitative methods that are exposed as such with a clear eyed viewing a big film but not really a good one,sad
why did james cameron go to so much trouble making a film that presented the physical and visual dimensions of and take the human dimensions on a fantasyromp ofized contrivances there are enough historical documents and memoirs about real people on that ship who had real lives and some were actually very compelling  so why did cameron opt to give these real people bit parts and invent two shallow characters good acting and high production values go a long way to cover up a poor script and is proof of that with the oscar frenzy that surrounded it however it was the first film in a long time that did not earn a screenplay nomination and won best picture  leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet both did excellent jobs acting as did gloria stuart and kathy bates they all deserved an oscar in light of what they had to work with on the page  how conventional shallow and contrived does this sound  rose is in what is for all intents and purposes an arranged marriage but she is really a free spirit ready to fly away from her upperclass roots  if it wasnt for her darn mother  now to make this issue even more clear her fiance is controlling and abusive  the decision is clear  she has to fall for jack a fellow free spirit who shows her real love  alas jack must be symbolically sacrificed so she can avoid being drowned in her life and truly find freedom in the new land  not only are the mechanics of the script clear but the story is old and tired  works because it plays on stereotypical conventions and latent emotions it does not earn its emotional climax on its own merit  this subject has the opportunity to be so much more genuine and powerful if only someone had taken the time to look beyond fictional romance and into true life tragedy,sad
the problem director and writer james cameron faces with a story about the is that the majority of his audience will know what happens so to make his audience care he switches the action and main plot from the ship to a socially inappropriate love story between jack dawson and rose dewitt bukater the trouble is that by incorporating the love story theme into the story he seems to detract from the feel and humanity that previous films like a night to remember have had cameron instead opts for two separate halves to the story rather than melding the two separate elements together the first half concentrating on building an audience rapour with the two main characters while the second half concentrates on the special effects fuelled sinking of the doomed liner this would be forgivable if it werent for several key factors from the first half the main weakness being the utterly one dimensional lead characters we are presented with from caledon hockleys loveless millionaire to roses trapped innocence to jack dawsons poor boy with a dream aswell played as these characters are the performance cant make up for the poorly written characters the actors have been given again with the spectacle of the story of the and the millions of dollars at camerons disposal one could forgive the weakness of the characters but then the  first half of the story is so entirely clich ridden and full of predictability that it becomes obvious it is clear that she will leave her safe life and existence and go with the unpredictability of true love it is almost as though cameron knows how to tell this story visually hes just not sure or not capable of making you care about it camerons writing has always come under scrutiny the comic book quality of films like true lies and the terminator films set the scene for his writing style the childlike quality of some of the dialogue shouldnt but does stand out something picasso and freud is he a passenger are so dire that they belong in a farrelly brothers film not a 200 million blockbuster cameron does seem to be writing from the heart the trouble is that his heart doesnt seem up to the task its payday boys and dicaprios now legendary im the king of the world seem not to be spoken by the characters in the film but by cameron himself he is the master filmmaker who can resurrect the and will make a fortune from itquestions that arise on investigation of the film closely are the gaping plot hole of  roses narration and status as the main narrative agent if the story we see is told from roses perspective how are we granted access to scenes such as the captains death and hockley and lovejoy hatching the plan to trap jack again if the story we are being told is not from roses perspective and is a general overview of the events why are we subjected to roses story telling voice over perhaps this is being overly critical of what is simply meant to be viewed as popcorn entertainment and indeed the film isnt entirely without its merits the hour long sinking of the ship is indeed breathtaking and the film does have probably three genuinely special moments winslet and dicaprios flying scene the ship breaking in two and jacks death which is surprisingly touching and moving the trouble is especially in a three hour long film that these few moments dont make up for the other half of the film in a three hour film half is ninety minutes the average length of a hollywood film perhaps cameron should have sacrificed some of the unnecessary moments and concentrated the story into perhaps just over two hourscamerons back catalogue of films should prepare us for what we are going to see the abyss true lies and terminator 2  judgement day show that as a visionary he can amaze his audience simply by clicking his fingers the problem lies with his misplaced attempts to try and bring humanity into his stories in the abyss cameron wants us to care about the relationship between mary elisabeth mastrantonio and ed harris in true lies we are asked to care about schwarzeneggers flagging relationship with his wife jamie lee curtis similarly in we are asked to ignore the special effects and care about the characters relationship if cameron were to write a out and out blockbuster that did not need characters require the audience to care he would probably create one of the most amazing films ever to be seen unfortunately this doesnt seem to be what he wants to do,sad
so you flip through the cable channels on your remote the same old music videos are running and the reruns get tiring later you find something interesting the evening news entertainment tonight 60 minutes vh1 and every other network airs clips from this the biggest moneymaking film in history emerges as a genuine hollywood classic for the second generation of american cinema never since gone with the wind has there been powerful moviemaking with heavy genius from james cameron its more than just a love story its an allout disaster movie with style and vigor combined with a creative instrumental music score it even began the craze that lured us into discoveries of the gigantic ship that never proved itself when it sunk anywaybrilliant use of photography is what stands out the best imagine every single little piece of detail that wouldnt fit on this message replicas of the engine room and the interior designs are highly crafted to maximize the full experience of being on the while sailing on crisp clear sea water filled with dolphins swimming with grace during the night one can look up the starry skies while the bright lights shine how tragic it is for a luxury liner to capsize in half sinking miles beneath the surface and showing off the greatest achievement in motion picture special effects a job extremely well done who will match this kind of excellence in the near futureas for the players the pair of leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet are now remembered as the clark gable  vivian leigh of the next generation both are young of course and they really can act winslet should have taken home the oscar what blasphemy of those academy awards judges her performance as rose is a show stealer as she did most of the incredible acting far better than todays young actresses from smoking a cigarette to possessing true beauty to posing nude to being a heroine and to become a survivor this will be a role so hard to beat in winslets future films dicaprio on the other hand also does magnificent as a street boy and a troublemaker the second half is the most important time to discover his best talents including the end both are sensational in almost every respectwell you cant always expect a movie to be perfect shortcomings are relatively minor the modernized scenes dont quite prove true to a historical masterpiece made with expensive sets and decorations mr jerry garcia lookalike shouldve changed his shirt instead of wearing the one with happy face shot in the head but gloria stuart as the old ross makes up for the modern touch in telling and revisiting the story through her past experiences its also important that we already know how the disaster had become and that the movie tells under a fictional basisof localized interest diana morgan was once a tv news anchor for an nbc station out here she has recently taken on an acting career playing the role of a news reporter notably in babylon 5 you will hardly get to notice her on that small tv set shown at the start of the film but you can hear her voiceover three hours of powerful and unprecedented movie imagery to date it may very well be the greatest film ever made,sad
what i think ill probably like best about the new star wars film phantom menace is that it will likely blow out of the water if youll pardon the pun when it comes to sheer devastating box office receipts and thereby knock it out of the number one spot every time i hear someone declare is the greatest film theyve ever seen i think to myself you dont see a lot of movies do you what a travesty you could make 50 good films that are a lot better than and for the same price tagwell it won lots of academy awards lots of people really loved it as someone might say in its defence well lots of people like the spice girls and billions and billions of people eat at mcdonalds but that doesnt mean its high quality yes millions of elvis fans can be wrongill be the first to admit that part of the problem for me was the megahype over the film i waited a month or so to see it and ultimately it didnt live up to the expectations set upon it which simply called more attention to the appallingly stupid love story its true phantom menace will likely suffer a similar fate butjames camerons is a  a cheesy action flick thinly disguised as a serious period piece b  a threehour epic that has its finest moments given away in the trailer c  a sappy love story beyond belief or entertainment d  something left better to documentarians which i wouldve enjoyed much more e  a film with arrogance that lives up to the level demonstrated with the real ship f  a  robbery of 3 hours that i will never get back therefore the greatest motivation for a time machine i can think of when i meet someone who hasnt seen it yet i say i wish i could trade places with you g  a slap in the face to any genuine victim of hypothermia how long are we supposed to believe that people can be immersed in freezing cold water and still form intelligible sentences h  thankfully a film that wasnt recognized for any acting achievements at the oscars i  a technological achievement in filmmaking and little elsethe only reason i post this as a anonymous comment is i do not welcome the rebuttal of 10000 thirteen year old leonardo dicaprio fans wholl no doubt come to his defense and i am not really interested in hearing a defense of story acting or length,sad
haters clearly dont understand how emotion is part of the humanity and is full of emotional element and therefore a true humanity in cinematic world if a movie make so many people left the theater in tears clearly haters lost their heart and intelligence haters clearly dont understand how mixed the spectacle visual experience and topclass technology filmmaking process with emotional element and sense of melancholy the movie proved that visual sensation and emotional experience are not mutually exclusiveeyes and heart are synced but haters brain arent synced with blood,sad
what movie comes to mind when you think of compelling memorable characters spectacular visual effects a fantastic score and a beautiful tragic plot what movie has captured the hearts and imagination of people of all ages around the world what movie has retained its charm and appeal for over a decade and has earned a rightful place in cinematic history the answer is the 1997 film that opened with low expectations and then astounded the public with its massive success as the highestgrossing film of all time and winner of 11 academy awards including best picture and best director raises hopes for moviegoers and does not disappointfirst consider an undertaking so daunting that many would deem it impossible recreating the rms and its fateful sinking this task undoubtedly required much time skill and effort not to mention a huge budget  at the time was the most expensive film ever made the ships splendor shines throughout the movie and adds an atmosphere of magic that film sets rarely manageanother element of the films success is the superb talented cast most notably leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet give commanding performances as jack and rose the young starcrossed lovers separated by social class on the maiden voyage of the doomed vessel they are cast perfectly a better choice could not have been made along with the rest of the cast including billy zane as roses wicked fianc and gloria stuart as rose at age 101 they allow the audience to join their journey and share in their emotions and experiences by the conclusion viewers feel very close to the characters and truly care about them which is why the movie is so poignant and tragicso many years after its theatrical release still has not lost what made it such a success this moving simply beautiful story about fate disaster and the power of love has proved to be a timeless classic and an epic masterpiece,sad
sorry to pour cold water if youll forgive the fun on this oscar winning tribute to the programmers art but this film is too long too wooden and captures the atmosphere of edwardian england to the same degree as dick van dyke mimics our accent i have no doubt that the special effects are very clever and took people an awful lot of hours and megabytesbut where do they take us a computer generated ship with generated seagulls looks exactly that the sets are spectacular yet manage to scream out that they are expensive sets rather than that they are the inside of a living working ship and dont get me started on the levels of my indifference towards the talentless mrdicaprio who bestrides the film in the same way as most children do when stumbling into a grownups party watch a night to remember if you want to feel the real emotion of the sinking and watch this if you want to spend three hours seeing mrcameron trying to show us how clever he isand failing,sad
its the love of your life  youre going to just let him freeze to death while you lay sprawled on the doorincredible couldnt believe that part unbelievable,sad
when people started complaining about jack dying and calling them names is ridiculous even when mythbusters did it they seem to try to be as accurate as possible but what they missed is by jack staying off it that is why kept rose as dry as possible when the busters did stuff to get position just right and even tied the life best on the door i can tell you that it would have been more then extremely difficult to do that in north atlantic freezing water your ha d do not work well and if they had to take there time in life suits if jack kept forcing rose in the water to safe himself he would have killed her as well the busters did a test that if jack was able to get out of the water immediately he would have barely survived just barely meaning if he even made her fall in o e or two times she would not have survived let alone probably 7 or more times the busters fell in and the door would have been sitting a few inches i the water at that temp it would have more then enough to kill her so i believe the way it happe was well thought out and orchestrated and last thing if he would have survived the movie would not have been as good its the story of after that makes the movie stick with you if he survived it would have made it a good movie not an amazing top 5 movie of all time,sad
what is it about james cameron and women characters in his movies ive come to the conclusion that they are really all men in skirts look at the female characters in terminator or aliens they are so butch and testosterone fuelled they aught to have beards and scratch their hairy testicles while chewing tobacco i mean look what he did to our lovely english rose kate winslit in this ship wreck of a movie he has this alleged edwardian lady stick her middle finger up at david warner at one point and then slugs unconscious some burly crewman who was getting in her way to top it all she has sex with a total stranger from steerage please with his tin ear for dialogue he should have stuck to doing thick ear action movies rather than this overly ripe disaster movie theres an amateurish attempt to demonstrate the stupidity of ruths mother having her dismiss some sketches of picasso how did they get on board with the words that he would never amount to anything subtle this is not it looks far better than it sounds which is a great pity as some of the visuals are rather good one unexpected laugh happened when cameron picked up his oscar he screams a line from the film im the king of the world of course it fell completely flat on the assembled audience who had never seen this dire movie or had forgotten the execrable script the poor man must have thought his doggerel was memorable in some way if this wasnt all bad enough we had to endure celine dion terrible song going on and on the iceberg was the best thing in the movie and should have appeared far earlier than it did,sad
okay theres over 2000 comments on this garbage so this has probably been said before but i think im gonna force my own opinions to be different so i can feel good about myself lmao contains spoilersyuhthe boat sinks peopledisgusting trash that is an insult to the real tragedy no doubt it was an effort to make and took talentbut so did terminator aliens the abyss and any other of james camerons truly awesome workif you think this is one of the greatest films of all time you havent seen enough moviesit does nothing to showcase the obvious talents of its two main stars billy zane is a joke and the love storycmonthere are so many other movies with better love stories im not even going to bother naming anyshould be obvious to anyone who cares,sad
well this certainly put bums on seats great special effects great cinematography nudity steamy sex scene spitting competitions shootouts and a tragic ending to a beautiful love story  all aboard the ss this makes for id say the worse of the wellknown movies it had a much bigger budget and such better special effects but for extreme lack of sincerity and authenticity it is by far the worse the producers actually seemed to make an effort  in some parts at least  to include 1990s attitudes into a 1912 setting note the rude finger kate winslet gave to the antagonist while escaping down the liftkudos to james cameron for putting so much effort into building the actual ship from original blueprints and for focusing so much attention on realistic fx and making the film in parts so profoundly historically accurate but in those parts in which the film was not profoundly accurate it was profoundly the opposite and disgustingly so shame on cameron for making the focus of the film a soppy clichd love story the kind of which we have seen dozens of times and shame for making those scenes which were historically and poignantly accurate mere backdrops to this standard and fictionalised love storybut in our times this kind of lowestcommondenominator love story puts bums on seats and millions forked out to see winslet and dicaprio fall in love ride on the bow and finally say a tearful inopportune goodbyethis is the failure of the movie it is anachronistic and the film voids itself off on one hand spending millions on accuracy  sets research costumes and special effects  will attract many people looking forward to good quality filmmaking and a solid telling of what happened that night  people who will then be alienated by the nobrainer love story on the other hand the assumed target audience of the film who are primarily excited by the love story are those who could not care less about the millions spent on historical accuracy it is a totally anachronistic situationjames cameron totally wasted a fantastic opportunity to make a brilliant film on the subject a film that could have surpassed all previous efforts instead he devised a storyline totally entrenched in hollywood lovestory stereotype of the type that anyone could see anywhere else and simply set this aboard a historically accurate rendition of the he did not understand that the real events alone of april 1415 1912 were enough to fuel a heartbreaking story of tragedy and bitter irony and instead he used wellworn cinematic tools to pitch the film at the lowestcommondenominator who cant be bothered thinking outside their own experience is just an example of the cultural sterility of our times the 1958 film a night to remember told a more genuine authentic touching and historically accurate version of the disaster with half the budget and half the special effects technology and i think this is testament to the suburban teenage wasteland which is camerons filmstill the film offers good oldfashioned moviegoing thrills and spills it has a classic format againsttheodds love story all it also has great special effects and employs intelligent cinematography so as a form of entertainment it is a jolly good romp to accompany a bag of popcorn as a film about the  which it purports to be  well this kind of story could have been set anywhere and at anytime the merely made a good and exciting setting for the fictional characters involvedthis is a bad film and as james cameron was aspiring to make a film hence the title he has failed as time the harshest critic of all marches on the film will be seen more and more as a marketing vehicle of the late 1990s other better productions will remain holding their own as honest accurate and sincere renditions of what really happened that nightfinally the abovementioned remarks about the anachronistic nature of the film make it difficult to rate and hence the loveitorhateit experience of this film straddles the ridge between well researched triumph and hollywood farce with the dexterity of a threelegged elephantwhich ever direction the elephant falls is up to each individual viewer,sad
best film ever most certainly not best film of 1997 again not in with a chance i have to report that while watching i found myself being totally bored by the stereotypical charecters ie snobbish english battleaxe american cameron has also reeled out loads of cliches and made them 10 times more boring there is also an undertone of class struggle which is direly executed as for being called a love story that could never be said as there was no chemistry between the two leads and to me no feelings of love came across james try watching other oscar nominee as good as it gets for a decent love story as for the tragedy that was in the film i did not feel as though the tragedy was fully put across and i left actually feeling numb from this glamourised dross how this truly terrible film managed to get the best film oscar is beyond me as good as it gets a much better and beautiful film and how cameron got the best director award is unbelievable although is unsurprising when people like martin scorsese do not get an oscar for films such as raging bull goodfellas and mean streets,sad
this movie was the most disappointing case of overhype ever could a plot be any flimsier could characters be any more cardboard could you imagine a more pathetic excuse for chemistry imagine every clich ever conceived combine them with a big ship sinking on a zillion dollar special effects budget throw in pseudodiva celine dions lame tune and youve gotgod i wanted leonardo to die hes the overdone tragic poor boy artist this gives him an excuse for the drawnout no pun intended gratuitous nude portrait scene of kate winslet later  really thats the only reason hes an artistall the rich people are bad except her of course shes supposed to be redeemed from her wealth by her love for him but theres zero chemistry  nudity and god how tacky foggedup windowsconsequently all the poor people are goodthank you for simplifying the goodness or badness of any given individual simply by their financial statusesi wanted everyone to die its the only way to justify the lost hours of my life that went into viewing this pathetic work of pseudoart lifetimey based on true incidents crapreally dont bother its not a timeless classic its dumbeddown faux romance in the midst of tragedy drivel spend money on the script not the special effects for gods sake this is worse than a lifetime movie of the week ive seen afterschool specials with more depth infomercials even,sad
the movie had absolutely nothing to do with the it was a love story the was simply a backdrop for the theme i was sorely disappointed to me it was disrespectful of the people who lost their lives on that shipas for the acting leonardo decaprio was quite amateurish and unconvincing the villain acting was about as convincing as william shatner in the star trek series the only acting in the movie that warrants any applause is the old lady reminiscing about the disaster she was convincing but had a very minor partattention to detail in the special effects was awesome few movies capture this detaili would rather have seen historically accurate portrayals of several notable passengers including the captain and people involved in the catastrophe shame on the producers for trivializing such an event with a love storythe best movie of that year went totally unnoticed because it was produced by a small canandian company the red violin was the best movie that year it was more than entertainment it had a redeeming message,sad
although it is easy to see how this brainless saga could appeal to an equally brainless segment of the public it is much harder to understand the honors that have been bestowed on this mediocre albeit expensive production the special effects were pretty good and the details of reconstruction of some of the inanimate objects was remarkable the problem was in the animate entitiesthe main characters are anachronistic essentially 90s teenagers dressed in funny turnofthecentury clothes if you are thrilled by the fact that rose decided to follow her heart instead of the social conventions of the time you should consider having your fianceewifedaughter run away with a gang member she only met two days ago it is easy to laugh at the social conventions of 90 years ago a film aiming at a meaningful social discourse should make us look critically at contemporary mores it is easy to laugh at the victorian sexual code let us laugh at monogamy if we have the couragei expect a historic film to help me understand the age it refers to and to help me relate it to my age placing to mtv teenagers in a 1912 as real as conan the barbarians middle ages doesnt help me do eithersome of the scenes are artificially emotionally charged eg the two lovers looking from the bow of the ship to the horizon but one cannot escape the impression that the number intensity and sequencing of these scenes come from some how to make a movie manual that you can probably buy for 1095 at the nearest barnes and noble all in all i would say that the film reveals a decent craftsmanship but not a single shred of art a situation not uncommon in hollywoodi saw this film in a theatre and i dont feel any need to see it again at home i have better things to do with my time but if all you like in a film is to go see some special effects and saying ooooo when the ship sink and aaaaah when the main characters kiss then this is the film for you,sad
this film is an insult to the intelligence of the common garden slug the romance between dicaprio and winslet is completely unbelievable with no real chemistry between the two the script is complete garbage crafted solely in the believe that the public is as idiotic as the creator of this film though the sinking of the ship is well crafted and visually stunning there is no pity to be felt for the cardboard characters that inhabit this film the 3 hours or so spent watching this horrible film could be more constructively used watching paint dry the plot is slipshod and centered not on the tremendous agony and suffering of those souls lost on the but on the selfcentered interests of a girl leaving behind her obligation to her family for a 3day fling with an artist which is consumated in the back of a car my hope is that this film is somehow exposed to the people as the massive dung heap that it is i suggest people who liked this inane insulting piece of garbage view a film of real emotional power that was also crafted from historical events from the 1910s all quiet on the western front i also recommend those who liked this film view the reviews it got from kenneth turan of the los angeles times who exposes the films huge weak spots and lack of heart,sad
i was reading the comments and someone said that people who dont like this movie are jealousdont ask me of whatthey just are ha how can you prove it what could we possibly be jealous of  i saw with high hopessince nobody would shut up about itafterwardsi realized they shouldve clammed it long before it was even releasedit was horriblelots of better movies that year good will huntingla confidintal and the only reason they liked it was because of leonardoi hope he falls of a very tall cliffi now dont trust hypethey never like good moviesooobut it won 11 oscarsso it has to be good yeahit won special effects adwardsno acting or screenwritingand it won best picture because adolescent teens would boycott them if it didntdo you really want to see a movie adored by teenagers face itonly a few people have good tasteso popular things stink to high heaven dont see itbecause if you do youll be labeled as a sheep in my schoolyou hear that school we lamar people hate this moviei am not a sheep,sad
its a love story a blockbuster an historical account a thriller an actionfest its arthouse its popcorn its its all of these and nonemany others have gone over the historical inaccuracies in great detail so i will try and avoid mentioning them again but as someone with a lifelong interest in the story camerons film is immensely frustrating i have a lot of respect for james cameron he is a true master of spectacle and although ive never met the guy i can imagine he is a gradea control freak whatever the criticisms of his films you do not get to make a 200 million dollar flick without being well and truly disciplined to your art the detail is all there the light fittings crockery engine room the beautiful ship brought back to life in full colour the bridgebowboat deck etc  a small army of crew working to build and light the set costume designers and so on the film should be recognized as a huge technical accomplishment for these reasonsyet the film fails for one very simple reason storylinethe appeal of the real story is multifold it was never just a shipwreck  ships sink all the time some larger than the some with many more losses the lusitania is comparable yet far less populist  but the sinking marked the end of a period of human arrogance no matter how technologically adept we become fate can always intervene and scupper our best laid plans no one thinks planes are uncrashable or that we can somehow buy immunity from a grisly fate and since the real people on board the represented every walk of society from billionaires to those starting a new life the fact that rich and poor perished together on this brand new ship altered our thinking when the story starts there are four classes of people first class second class third class steerage and crew by the end there are two living and deadif the real story was fictional it could not be dreamt up better there are so many iconic moments to savour they would barely fit into a 3 hours film passengers requesting bits of the berg to put in their drinks the californians wireless operator going to sleep the growing realisation that something is seriously wrong etc the list is endless so if it is one of the most enduring stories of human behaviour and nature vs man why do we need camerons waferthin plot as a buff i watch the special effects with delight the ship is back from the deep no question but i find myself willing jack and rose to get out of the way there are some many fascinating real characters that we never get to more than acknowledge what makes them tick i get the feeling cameron is fascinated too but restrained by the demands of a teenage popcorn audience whove failed to imagine that a poor boy falling in love with a superrich girl and sacrificing himself in 24 hours is complete poppycock 1912  or in cameronspeak a bunch of horsest 1997incidentally if i was a first class passenger on the i would feel slightly aggrieved id paid so much since in camerons version it seems all passengers are free to wander anywhere they like except when it starts sinking of course then suddenly its impossible to get above decks head for your nearest imax cinema and watch ghosts of the abyss  camerons slightly cheesy but good documentary featuring much more of the underwater scenes from the film or for a more accurate retelling of the story try 1958s a night to remember if you want a love story go for romeo and juliet for a people out of their time film try les visiteurs or bill and tedin short tries to be all of these things and excels at none of them,sad
they took a very real heartbreaking tragedy and made it into a cheesy love story  then they mixed in two actors who cannot act to save their lives made them read a horribly written script and finished off by adding three hours of unnecessary footage  dicapprio and winslet are painful to listen to  they have virtually no skill in line delivery and the writer wrote things that no one in real life says  they spent way too much money on special effects and thats all it looked like obvious computer graphics instead of using some sort of skill and really recreating the ship  if you take away the choppy computer graphics the horrible script the leading duo that horrendous teenybopper lovesex story and celine dion  you are left with an amazing group of scenes when the ship sinks the incredible makeup work on the oceanic casualties and the indisputably wonderful kathy bates which is the casts only saving grace  it may be a cult classic for lonely love sick teens but i would avoid this one like the plague if i were you  instead write a list of all the other things you could do in three hours and save yourself the nauseous feeling you get every time dicapprio and winslet try to act,sad
only once in a great while does a film of dynamic magnitude and power grace the silver screen  unfortunatly this is not one of those  i can sum up the entire film with just one word pretentious  the special effects are among the best ive seen along with the cinematography and technical poise this could of been a film of immense glory and scope whisking us away on a beautiful journey showing us humanitys undying spirit in the face of ultimate disaster  instead james cameron tries to replay gone with the wind on a ship  his efforts could have turned it all into a success if the characters werent about as interesting as cardboard and if the story was written by someone who didnt flunk 7th grade english  the onscreen chemistry between dicaprio and winslet was laughable at best  i didnt believe for one second that they even liked each other much less love each other they were both victims of an overpowering score by james horner they just didnt even look right for each other  maybe they should have beefedup dicaprio so that he actually weighed over 100 pounds or just found a different actor all together  i just want to know what happened to the leonardo dicaprio from whats eating gilbert grape or basketball diaries  while watching this film i was wondering if cameron was holding up cue cards behind the camera by the way he acted  kate winslet was carried by her looks throughout the entire film she is gorgeous but she could have put a little honest energy into the role instead of it feeling forced outyou have to give it to cameron though  he is a hell of a talented technical director see aliens the abyss or the termanitor movies and when it came time to sink the ship he gave us one hell of a show all in all the 45 mintue climax couldnt float this sinking vessel  how a film like this can win 11 oscars and films of a much higher caliber like saving private ryan and la confidential get snubbed sniffsniff  i smell politics,sad
the producers and writers of obviously believed theyd bore and alienate the targeted teen and twentysomething audience to the point of losing them if the characters had the attitudes mannerisms and style of speech that was appropriate for the time so they had jack leonardo dicaprio and rose kate winslett speaking contemporary dialogue in a contemporary style or at least contemporary for 97 a young man in 1912 would not say you seem more like an indoor girl aside from a certain hostile type of mental patient or the most outrageous and antisocial bohemian agitator young adults in 1912 did not repeatedly tell their elders to shut up the creators of the film are counting on what they perceive to be the teen and young adults lack of knowledge or interest in the values and social customs of the very early 20th century since they want the audience to get swept away by the drama and romance of jack and rose they want them to relate to everything about them i remember that this was billed as somewhat of a a fantasy reimagining of a real event but this type of historical revisionism i think in which human behavior is simply made more familiar is an insult to any viewer with a 3digit iq one continuity problem that really gets me is how when the ship is sinking and jack and rose are still inside the water level is lower and the water becomes calmer around them every time they have a conversation again the makers of the film dont want the reality of the disaster to encroach on or distract us from the passionate young romance theyre trying to draw us into clearly the creators of the film think that the romance is a bigger draw for a major segment of the audience than the story of an enormous disaster that killed over 1500 people and im sure theyre right but often when true and fictional stories exist in the same movie one weakens the impact of the other and its certainly true in this case i havent seen the new 3d version but i assume the only change is the 3d effect this is a bland pandering intelligenceinsulting and epically overrated epic,sad
i really just wanted to vote on this film  contrary to what many say this film does deserve the worst ratings and does not deserve to be in the top 250 or 500 or 5000000 including hollywood and bollywood  come on people get some life experience and develop the right side of that brain,sad
first of all as a long time student of the disaster and member of several clubs i feel entitled to comment on the film i dont really care how many awards and accolades the film won but to me it is still an absolutely awful film cameron had the resources to make a proper semidocumentary film of the disaster but unfortunately chose to turn it into a pofaced romantic mush the fact that so many people around the world fell for it only shows to my mind the sad state of taste and common sense that movie critics and audiences have these days whoever said that all movies should have a hero and heroine falling in love in fact most real events are anything but romantic and the disaster certainly was not one i feel that it needed a better script and director with a semidocumentary approach and as little artistic license as possible i almost threw up in the last sequence where the dead lovers meet among the other lost passengers and crew who break out in applause is this an intelligent film ask yourself,sad
when i was a child i cried bitterly when the fat lady shelley winters bravely dived into the waters in the truly epic poseidon adventure why because the screen playwright and director understood that true human glory is not about special effects but characterisationi cant begin to recount the superficiality and shallowness of this dreadful film  where theres absolutely no foundation for genuine affection much less enduring love and worst of all with his very inapt hands james cameron attempted to repeat the cliche of rich girl meets poor boy which bears no significance whatsoever to the plotif it can be called one in which everybody was subject to a violent death nobleman or peasantthe art of tragedy is a tricky one but there is one simple rule  make your characters genuine realistic and most of all believable so that the audience will feel what they feel breathe what they breathe and in the end partake in the experience,sad
poor dicaprio first he falls in love with ugly kate winslet then he cant convince her to let him on the saving shelves in the ice water but what is the worst the computer generated fly over the hopping animation man we already had 1997 and we could have done better simulations under the squeaking voice of celine d my heart will go on anyway a good example of how to give awards to the wrong film,sad
i see people writing about how great this movie was it was horrible the acting was subpar at best it made a lot of money because teenage girls went to see the movie 7 times in the theaters because of leonardo where the hell did they get the money anyway i wanted to learn more about the why it sank what was running through a lot of peoples minds maybe even a little conspiracy stuff does anyone realize that certain people didnt even board the ship because there was a fire on board before it even took off no you dont because all you see is a rich girl falling for a poor boy and he paints her naked did that corny junk at least tip you off that the movie was stupidi did cry in during one scene though the scene when they showed the water that was filling up in the ship it looked like pool water im thinking this movie made all this money and they couldnt even make the water from the ocean look real unbelievableohhh the band played on while the ship sank just ridiculous this was the worst movie until pearl harbor outdid it in the nothing to do with reality department,sad
everything about this movie its garbage  inane dull or boring are too gentle words to describe how bad is this movie i dont care anything about all the hype that this movie receives or that it won the academy award of best movie so what  many bad movies receive a lot of praise and prizes for the success that those movies have in the box office rather than in the real artistic value  the acting its bad and all the story its a bad soap opera that uses history as a excuse to tell the story of all the days  deep inside its just a glorified chick flick  im not amazed that it was chosen to be part of the list 100 years 100 stinkers   its the most over rated garbage ever made zero stars ,sad
is probably one of the worst films of the 90s cameron mustve sold his soul to the devil for it to get an academy award to be thought of as a better movie over than as good as it gets or good will hunting this will give away the ending one of the things i hated most about this film is the predictability from the first time she met jack i knew he was going to die it was so easy to forsee i also hate how much of a copy this was of almost every simple romance story girl about to marry snob meets slightly poor funny guy falls in love something prevents then at end they are together it was probably as simple as it gets i also hate how farfetched the plot was if cameron had done any research prior to writing it he would have realized how a romance like that would have never happened during 1910s american  england people married and dated within their economic class i also hate this film because it was so shallow unlike past academy award best picture winners had no societal meaning no symbolism and no metaphors usually after watching films bestowed with that honor you feel changed different with i was just disappointedlastly the acting was poor at best except for that of billy zanes which was phenomenal they picked actors singularly for looks rather than acting ability winslet showed little to no emotion and decaprio could never pull off any of the sad scenes i truly hated this film second to strangers in good company this is one of the worst films ever no one should see this film,sad
i believe that is the most overrated movie of all time its plot is unoriginal boy meets girl falls in love than heartbreak its script is unoriginal and its acting is mediocre the only reason its 1 in money is the fame and teeny bopper girls that watch it over 30 times in the theatre during its release if everyone only watched it once it would probably be in 15th or 20th place atleast there cant be a sequal,sad
a poor flick all around the only redeeming value comes from the actual sinking of the which unfortunately doesnt happen in the first ten minutes we do get to watch a pathetic love story between jack  rose actually more like a molestation by rose since jack appears to be approximately twelve years old very creepy oh yeah horribly casted i forgot i cant believe i let my wife talk me into seeing this one when it came out let this be a lesson to you all cameron is definitely a second rate director and a questionable human being to bootjust ask linda hamilton to sum it up run far and fast from this film it will only disappoint you i give it 1 out of ten awful is about right,sad
this movie is pitiful it is abominable in terms of dung heaps it is second only to superman returns thats not a very honorable positionwhy do i hate you may be wondering heres a list 1 leonardo di caprios performance as the lovable but downonhisluck guy could have been played better and more realistically by paris hilton 2 kate winslets fake american accent is the least of the woes left by her whiny imapoorwiddlerichgirl turn 3 james cameron should automatically be disqualified as the director of any real historical tragedy because he makes us care more about the prettiness of the ship than the victims 4 where james horners music fails to nauseate he was really off his game here you always have the classic fallback celine dions mess of a theme songthose are the top four reasons i could write a 52page essay on why this movie is so horrid but imdb doesnt provide reviewers with that kind of space so ill condense it a wee bitif you want to watch a disaster this film is perfect and im referring to the debacle of the film not the incident,sad
i like many people saw this film in the theatre when it first came out in 97 it was a below average film at best defiantly not the masterpiece that all these fanboys like to make it out as first off dicaprio is a terrible actor no matter which way you look at it people just like him because of his looks his acting skills essentially consist of saying a lot of cheesy lines and trying to act sexy second the film itself had a rather boring and simple plot girl falls in love with guy ship theyre on sinks lots of crappy love scenes thereafter anyone with an iq above 50 will realize this isnt ingenious in any way whatsoever nor is it original plus the director felt the need to drag it out for 3 hours i could compress it into a 1 hour block without losing any of the plot in conclusion is the most overrated movie to date why it got so much attention and money is beyond me,sad
i have always been fascinated by the story of the because here is a real story that really happened and was perfect for eventual translation to the big screen and with todays special effects techniques it was truly possible to recreate a vanished ship and a vanished erainstead we gothip of caricaturesthere is enough true history in the story of for some real drama and tension instead we get two 1990s hollywood teens transported back to 1912 we get burlesque chases a cardboard villain and every poorboymeetsrichgirl clich that was ever used in a story and of course the basic theme of rich peopleall badpoor peopleall good and all brought to an end by some diva warbling a song that has nothing to do with the storyi appreciate a good love story as much as the next person and there have been good believable ones in film however in this one we are asked to believe that a girl in 1912 who has lived a sheltered life and no real knowledge of the world will in the space of 36 hours or so1 fall for a thirdclass prettyboy 2 pose naked for him 3 have sex with him in a car 4 spit in her fiancs face 5 tell her mother to shut up 6 jump back onto a sinking shipawwwwcmon mr cameronand cal is such a cardboard villain that about the only thing cameron didnt do in the movie to make that any clearer to the audience is hang a sign around his neck saying villain in big letters and definitely establish that he likes to eat puppies for dinnerdicaprio is too girlish and prettyboy looking to be a real leading man and winslets acting ability is minimalif you took the story of out of camerons script you would have a movie that wouldnt even make it to the teenage hour on lifetime cablenot that the movie was a total waste it was great to see the as it must have really looked back in 1912 and the sinking was riveting and realistically portrayedbut the best movie ever as so many on this site proclaim the best picture oscar maybe for the leonardo is soooo cute typesjust remember it was the that hit an icebergnot beverly hills 90210,sad
despite the millions it may have raked in im sorry this is one of the absolute worst movies i have ever seen  not that i dont think all the praise in the world for the technical side shouldnt be heaped upon it the visual effects were undisputably stunning but this is hollywood at its worst  pure candyfloss  completely contrived sugarcoated and poorlywritten is a waste of any thinking viewers time,sad
i dont even know where to begin there are so many flaws mistakes and general errors hey i know how about starting by saying that the script is absolutely dreadful nothing happens for three whole hours after an hour you just sit there and wait for the ship to sink already i couldnt help cheering when the ship finally sunk ok i admit there are a few good scenes in the film for an example at the end of the film someone falls down and hits one of the propellers and makes a kind of dull bong sound when he does it and then starts spinning rapidly in the air most of the effects are alright but the general acting as well as the weak and boring story makes this the worst big budget film ever made perhaps aside from the harry potter series all in all 1 out of 6,sad
has made movie history its unbelievable that such a bad tearjerker can be doing so well at the box officewhere is the plot well the movie does have  sort of a plot but its very very very weak the love between jack and rose is so superficialwhere are the characters i cant find any real character everywhere i look i find cliches and stereotypes the rich must be arrogant ignorant evil etc while the poor must be the exact oppositecan the actors act sure every single one can but not in this movie the acting is somewhere between soso and bad ive seen better performance from cathy bates leonardo dicarpio bill paxton in other moviesthe visual effects is the only saving grace the sinking of the ship is just magnificent its just a shame they could have spent so much money to recreate the ship but they couldnt create a good story that has characters with substancefor teenagers who are flooded with hormones and a notsowelldeveloped brain its understandable that they love the movie for those who love it because it makes them cry i suggest cutting an onion its much cheaper and tears come out faster,sad
when i saw i thought it was vaguely entertaining and the costumes and special effects were beautiful however i didnt leave the theatre discussing it with my friends and i didnt feel or think any differently than three and a half hours earlier then i heard it had been nominated for numerous academy awards including best picture and i was outragednot surprisingly this bigbudget piece of recycled hollywood trash won even against three of its wonderful competitors la confidential as good as it gets and good will hunting the first has plenty of interesting plot twists and amazing performances the second gives a fresh and cynically humorous look at romance and the third helped me realize some things about myself at least  did nothing like thatthe screenplay was something that had been done dozens and dozens of times before and as far back as the elizabethan era as the ludicrous romeo  julietesque romance will prove the performances even by such normallywonderful actors as kathy bates billy zane and kate winslet were either dry or overdone i imagine that if one had to listen to this movie  rather than have the dialogue and music which is pretty at parts but just a repeat of many of horners other scores accompany the pretty images it would be completely unbearable,sad
ok i borrowed that phrase from a person called red elvis but it was too good to ignore for this formulaic recipemix together a bunch of cliches boy meets girl boat meets iceberg add social and ethnic stereotypes by the shovel stir in a heap of stodgy dialogue and a lot of very good and expensive special effectsadd a million gallons of salty water and what do you get a mess that will make you nauseous,sad
anyone who has even a glimmer of an idea of language thought or customs of turnofthecentury usbritain would be repelled by this film  ive read a number of survivor accounts and people just didnt think or talk the way they thought and spoke in the film  anachronisms aside it was i suppose only a love story  but there are so many better ones that have been filmed was to me a real disappointment,sad
when i was watching i liked it a little but afterwards the more i thought about the more i disliked it the thing that made me more mad was that it somehow managed to steal oscars from la confidentialgood will hunting full montyand as good as it getsi have seen all of them and any one of them should of won leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet are probably the worst people in the world both of them are stuck up and ugly james cameron is a great director but this time he has sunk as low as the,sad
the featured review of this film carries the line the scene shifts to southampton ireland where the set sail from on april 10 1912 a minor point perhaps to our american friends but southampton is in england still i only partly put that glaring error down to the unfortunate american who wrote it after seeing i would have got the impression southampton is in ireland too the ship was built in belfast which was british then and is british now so to make up for that and appease the irish american audience they fill the ship with poor unfortunates from the emerald isle whose only role in the film seems to be getting screwed by the english tyrants who run the ship add a few poor but heroic americans to the mix and youve got a blockbuster to be fair i hate this type of film anyway so it was never going to get a good review from me 2  10,sad
lets sink this ship right now  its over baby theres nothing left this is a bad movie  im not saying theres any harm in enjoying a bad movie but some of you people have taken it too far  epic  greatest movie of all time  deserving of 11 oscars  i spit on the ground all of you people who have seen it five six seven times walk on  bad script  ridiculous acting  egotistical chucklehead director  piece of filth movie i love watching piece of filth movies as much as the next guy but all of you people with your leo posters and your tshirts and your greatest movie of all time attitudes have driven me and others with even half a bit of common sense to hate and loathe this movie  i no longer hold this little travesty in any higher regard than i hold hollywood chainsaw hookers no offense to the hollywood chainsaw hookers people,sad
every time i think about this movie i get ticked off it was just so bad james cameron you made terminator and aliens man what is this schlock leonardo dicaprio you made this boys life and whats eating gilbert grape what is this schlock kate winslet i dont know anything about you but you seem to be pretty good what is this schlock bill paxton well anyways kind of cool special effects but the story is pathetic the romance is absurd and unbelievable the characters are paper thin and i could have cared less who died by the end this was the year i lost all respect for the academy although it had already been severely damaged by forrest gump beating pulp fiction how did beat la confidential goodwill hunting and as good as it gets because of a great marketing and pr job and a fan base of 100 million adolescent girls the academy was afraid would attack their families should lose an epic doesnt need hundreds of millions of dollars thrown a it to be good just look at lawrence of arabia one last word about dicaprio in specific dude the beach was not a good return film from and a big break i only hope gangs of ny makes all the difference dont take this the wrong way youre a great actor in my book but your judgement of choice is poor lately if any director can jumpstart someones career its scorsese,sad
why does this movie suck so bad  more importantly why did it win an oscar for among other things best picture  there are so many holes in the films plot the villian is similar to one in a rocky and bullwinkle cartoon i was wondering why they didnt give him a mustache which he could rub between his fingers the long sweeping shots of the ship look horrible the script is lame and filled with cliched action movie lines and all of the scenes taking place in the present day are worthless and have no placefirst if rose is telling this story from her perspective how is it that she knows what her fiance is always planning  how does she know what the crew of the ship is talking about before and after the iceberg hit  how is it that she knows how exactly jack got on the ship or what he talked about with his friends onboard  you get the idea  now many movies have this problem but not a best picture winner second the villian whos name escapes me  he was so cliched  so evil it was funny  hes like travolta in his new horrible filmthird the fly over shots of the ship look like garbage  they are so obviously fake all the people appear as black lifeless silohoettes walking the ship fourth the script  how did these horrible lines that jack utters get in there  when danger is afoot no matter how great all he can utter is his best keanu reeves impersonation fifth what is the purpose of showing us the salvage crew  who gives what these idiots are thinking or doing  it further complicates things why would these people believe an elder rose just because she says she is the one in the picture  anyone could call up and say that  if they cut these parts of you have a much shorter filmi hate this moviela confidential will always be 1997 true best picture,sad
such a masterful film with great performances by winslet and di caprio he definitely deserved an oscar for this one a film based on a real life tragedy,sad
possible spoiler but only if youre stupidhey ill save you who are considering seeing this movie a few hours  the ship sinks  and dicaprio cant acttoo bad all this money wasnt spent on something beneficial like figuring out how to fill all those holes in swiss cheesethis movies financial success is proof that our society is beyond hope,sad
i first saw in fairly early 1998 i think here in australia i went with a girl i had recently got to know on the internet she had already seen it and spoke in raptures about it after we left the cinema while i was hesitating somewhat as i was not sure about what i had just witnessed since then i have seen the film at least twice more including just now and i stick by my opinion that i have never seen a movie that is so bad and so good at the same time the bad as so many people have said is the script well the characters too the main romance is so embarrassingly contrived as to be juvenile and this is not helped by the character of rose quite frankly i cant stand her and can only wonder why jack did not push the little brat off the ship when he had the chance speaking of jack i liked him he and molly brown were by far the two best characters shown im not bagging the acting of winslett i think she did well i just thought her character was loathsome not much better is cal i couldnt stand him either and yes i know youre not meant to like him but i didnt like the way i didnt like him talk about a corny villain snobby cowardly by the time he picked up the child to get his way off the ship i was thinking alright we get the idea hes a creep really i thought the whole first class and the rest concept was overdone yes i know it was an issue but its so clumsy and obvious as to be cringe worthy but probably the worst and most disappointing character was the captain here was someone i would have loved to got to know ultimately the sinking was all his fault yet there was no depth to him instead just coming off as a feeble human being who did and said little and who looked understandably more and more desolate as he saw what was happening but then there is the good the sinking absolutely incredible i am always fascinated by the fact that the ship started to sink but as is the nature of such events everything looks normal for a while people moved around as usual the ship just kept motoring along and yet we knew it would be under water in a couple of hours the gradual submersion is enthralling and technically brilliant this is why i like to come back to the film and no its not because im a disaster fan which i am who just wants to see people die and not care about things like romance not at all really no a key to such films is depth of character and their relationships with each other no real people means no emotional charge when said disaster happens the effects are breathtaking and the model work stunning i cant enthuse enough about this part of the filmbut the bad comes close to killing it all and my view does not change after each time i see it polarises me like no other film ive ever seen it is awful it is tremendous ultimately the mixture makes it a middling film at best which is a great shame how it won best picture at the oscars remains one of the biggest jokes in cinema history but maybe if we can forget about the bad we can revel in the good and appreciate some of the most stunning moments ever filmed in hollywood,sad
james camerons was nothing short of a phenomenon like so many others i went to the pictures more than once to catch the mustsee film of 1997 when i first saw i was swept away by the whole film i thought it was a thrilling piece of entertainment funny resonant and exciting in equal measurebut again like so many others i also feel has lost a bit of its sparkle over the years its times like this you ask yourself why a film you once held in such high regard now ranks so low lets see if i can answer that questiontheres no denying that on the one hand its an impressive piece of filmmaking camerons direction is slick and economical something thats served him well since his extraordinary debut with the terminator the 3 hour running time zips by without one barely noticing but somewhere along the way cameron fumbles it and like the the film goes down with all handscameron is a selfprofessed enthusiast and hes clearly put a great deal of thought care and precision into recreating the from the jumbo sized pistons in the engine room right down to the tiny portholes on the bow and he exactingly crafts its destruction first explained to us through a stepbystep computer simulationthe collision with the iceberg the gradual flooding of the compartments loss of power the ship splits in half the eventual sinking and then we finally see it enacted in the last 90 minutes it would be churlish not to mention how eerily precise cameron gets the details of theits a shame the human characters arent as well developed camerons clout in the industry has allowed him to array a truly extraordinary cast but save one or two quite a few characters are little more than cardboard cutoutskate winslet shines as rose she does quite well and invests a great deal of resourcefulness and spunk into the part of a dbutante forced into marriage cameron draws a lot of strength and vitality from her characteras for leonardo dicaprio he brings plenty of enthusiasm to jack dawson a penniless artist from steerage but his romance with rose never truly convinces the relationship only works on simplistic terms by pushing all the right emotional buttons exactly why it struck such a chord with audiences especially the female members i remember hearing quite a few ladies in the audience reach for their tissues during jacks rather maudlin death scenei couldnt go into detail describing how many people there are to keep track of otherwise id run out of words the ones that scored favourably with me are kathy bates as the unsinkable molly brown victor garber as mr andrews the ship builder and in a small but memorable role jason barry as tommy an irishman in steerage who meets a tragic endas for everyone else theyre all onedimensional billy zane is cast as roses fiance cal a snobbish controlling tyrant theres no depth to his character david warner is wasted in a thankless role as zanes ghoulish valet and frances fisher takes the prize of worst offender for playing ruth roses heartless mothercameron waits quite a bit before the actual collision so youd be forgiven for feeling more than a little restless for the first hour and a half there are a few moments that stand out i quite liked the way the film contrasts the differences in 1st and 3rd class each having dinner in their own way and you will definitely sit up and pay attention to jack drawing rose in the nude wearing nothing but a priceless diamondbut its really after the crash that the film finally starts getting interesting this is the part of the story cameron wanted to tell he stages the destruction of with breathtaking regard corridors flood with cascades of water the enormity of the hull pivoting into the air is a terrifying sight its in these scenes where the film holds a captive audience cameron shoots them with a fanatical immediacy and watching the destruction of these stylised and impeccably crafted sets is awesome to beholdyet even in these scenes cameron miscues it a little the sinking of the has been filmed many times a night to remember had to have influenced cameron but this is the first to add comedy into the mix i didnt mind so much in the first half because the people aboard didnt know the maiden voyage of was doomed but in the second half when cameron tries to make you laugh its an approach at odds with the dramatic thrust of the story eg the aristocrats aboard want brandies while the ship is sinking this is hardly believable behaviour and even disrespects the memories of those aboard it leaves a bad taste in the mouthcameron does demonstrate far too much of a willingness to guess what the people aboard were like painting them in unfavourable colours portraying the officers as officious bureaucrats and even having one of them shooting passengers even when there is no evidence to support thatthe final scenes for jack and rose go on too long in my opinion his final words which are really hackneyed and mawkish belong more in a soap opera not a multimillion dollar feature film the image of a floating necropolis is striking thoughis certainly an oddity its a film that people embraced as a whole the world over and now they go out theyre way to find fault with it i didnt go looking for faults they surfaced as time went by because it just doesnt hold up too well to repeated viewings i still think you should see even if in a few years it probably wont do for you what it used to,sad
the movie portrays first officer william murdoch in a way that is totally contrary to the truth but instead suits a particular propagandist position this is both immoral and grossly hurtful to murdochs descendants no wonder the chinese government recommended the movie to their people it amazes me how modern american filmakers seem to delight in tearing down the society and values they have grown up in the film is an insult to all those passengers and crew who showed such tremendous courage in the face of a horrific death in reality it was not two 90s style teenagers who were the heroes of the,sad
in many ways is a great movie the effects are realistic enough to let you get right into it and the performances are generally very good especially the gorgeous kate who convinces with or without her kit on it is a story of an ill fated but grand love affair an unhappy heiress falls for a lovely poor guy over the rich handsome total bastard shes engaged to and trouble inevitably follows this epic story is played out against the backdrop of a ship sinking which adds to the emotion poignancy hysteria and general tearfulness of it all and therein lies my problem with this flickbefore was a film it was a ship many real people died their families still remember yes even a century later this movie is not a tribute or an insult it is a disregarding of their memory jack and rose could have had their moment in any one of a thousand scenarios why sully this tragic eventthe sinking of the is a great historical tragedy not only death but needless death plus the loss of a magnificent machine which was a tribute to human endeavour and ingenuity the folly of her reckless handling in dangerous waters  thats the ship not kate the stupidity of mans unsinkable challenge to nature the struggle of the crew to save as many people especially rich ones as possible what a great film that could be they tried to make it in 1958 a story that respected every gasp for air every self sacrifice every bloody engineer why did we need jack and rose is this the price we pay for hollywood,sad
special effects junkies may get something out of this film but i found it long very boring and totally unmoving  the characters in general were shallow and onedimensional  none of the main characters were in the slightest bit likeable and the films potential was ruined by the extremely silly and totally fabricated central story of the upstairsdownstairs romance between di caprio and winslett  this totally implausible bit of the plot succeeds in turning this tale of a terrible human tragedy into just another trite hollywoodisation in which only beautiful people and thwarted love count for much  such a shame  given the dreadful tragic setting which lets face it really did happen it could have been a good film,sad
when i went to see this film i was expecting something truly great  i was sadly very disappointed  the characters were generally poorly developed leaving me with a sickly sweet after taste rather than a feeling of sorrow or compassion whilst the talent gathered winslet zane hinted at true acting ability they have provided far better performances in other films the script is lacking in anything other than schoolgirl mills and boon the technical effects have obviously been done to high standards as the boat looks impressive but that is where it ends as the manchild dicaprio slaughters the basest of emotional lines as makes the romance seem cliched and below par if you absolutely must see this film see it on the silver screen as the lack of grandeur which is displayed on the small screen leaves only the acting to behold,sad
titanicnumber one box office takings of all time by a mile special effects better than any other movie everand nowhere to be seen on the imdb voters top 250why the disparity because special effects do not a movie make and cannot cover the cracks in the pedestrian plot and the cardboard characterisationthe ultimate reputation of this film has been sunk not by an iceberg but a similarly immovable object the judgment of movielovers,sad
i remember the hype surrounding this movie and coming from the same part of the world where the was built i thought this will be great well i watched this on video and was stunned take a historical disaster and turn it into a romance novel lol james cameron has arrived its a real shame because i really liked the terminator but that was when he was broke and visual effects were in its infancy the irony is the more money he makes the worse the movie and its not like this was a one off it spawned other historical disasters like pearl harbour which was a rip off but the main problem for me was the whole movie surrounds the three main characters and everyone else on the ship was just window dressing and i like a lot of other guys couldnt wait until the ship sank the only good thing i have to say is it made a big star out of dicaprio and he has went on to bigger and better things so this movie was a real bummer for me and a lot of others im sure,sad
watched it on the screen a few years back and could not sleep that night i couldnt stop thinking about the poor people who drownedthe plot was not as interesting to me until the started to sink then the mood started to pick up  im sorry that the characters were too onedimensional to make me feel sorry for them when they drowned  kept wishing i knew more about them before they pulled the plug on the everything  i watched the documentary on cable channel then spurred me on to borrow the video  the documentary made me cry more than the movie amazingly watching it on video i could watch the sinking bit 100 times its the best i just fast forward the whole middle section of the movie and watch the start and ending  i can truly imagine myself sinking with the thousand plus desperate people the special effects are truly convincing and fabulous i cheered for the single lifeboat which went back and wonder what were the real stories of the 6 people whom they rescuedim very interested in discovering the stories of all the survivors and what really happened to the people who were on the because of this movies attempts to recreate that fatal night  thank you,sad
given camerons apparent interest in the actual tragic event and the money that was spent this film borders on being a travesty as it was an opportunity lost to tell one of the great stories of our recent historyi watched from start to finish the other night and came away completely disappointed that most of the very interesting elements of the real saga were either glossed over or omitted completely and replaced by a schmaltzy implausible drawn out love storygiven the budget and the state of the art effects used this movie could have been great had it properly examined the tragedy from the point of view of the real characters involved and their reactions and behaviour instead of some hokey fabricated romeo and juliet theme complete with ludicrous villainy and gunplay it could have been a true classic simply by portraying the multitude of real and totally compelling stories that occurredwhere was the retelling of the infamous role the californian played as it was anchored 10 miles away during the whole terrible ordeal oblivious and indifferent to the horror being played out within arms reach where was the heroics of the carpathia turning off all heating in order to make more speed as she rushed through the dangerous ice field to rescue over seven hundred soulswhere was captain smiths refusal to believe the ship could not stay afloat after the collision and the unforgettable moment of grim realisation that the would surely sink and what about all of the heart rending decisions being made as the men hastily and gallantly chose to put the lives of their women and children before their own surely these tragic separations between fathers and their wives and children carried 100 times more feeling and emotion than a pair of smitten teenagers who had only known each other for a couple of daysand no matter how much sentiment one might feel about losing their one true love 70 years ago in tragic circumstances no one is going to toss a 300 million dollar diamond into the drink,sad
i enjoyed watching this film the visuals were good and the depiction of the sinking itself is good but throughout the film and especially through the cheesy romance scenes i couldnt help but think there were 2200 people aboard the ship shouldnt at least one of them have a movie worthy story it was a tragic nightmorning so why would mr cameron need to make a fake story when he could find an actual survivors story a thing it did right was the humanization of the disaster when they focused on a non jackrose character ie a real person like captian smith or andrews or the strausses and especially the band the result was great i dont consider myself a manly man but normally i dont show much sadness for movies however i teared up a couple of times during the film not during jacks death the parts im talking about are the nearer my god to thee scene and roses heaven but there is a very good reason dicaprio didnt win an oscar for this he and winselts acting was bad it was just plain wooden at best and dont get me started on jack didnt have to die i agree yes the panel its not a door could of held both of them but only after they put the life preserver under the panel to improve buoyancy but im going further back than that rose was on a fking lifeboat there would be 1500 people onboard who would kill for a lifeboat spot and she hops back on the bloody ship what does jack say right after youre so stupid rose yeah you are but old rose being old rose doesnt realize that kills jack ok now that thats done it was a mediocre movie at best,sad
is an overhyped overrated piece of garbage it goes an hour too long and winds on for what seems like decades the plot is a poorly written romantic piece of rubbish and the performances by decaprio and winslet are mediocre however billy zane and kathy bates bring some some hope to the nonexistent story line putting the plot and acting aside is a technical milestone the sequences where the sinks are nothing short of mindblowing and you would think you are on the ship it is lucky that the sinking of the ship is so brilliant because after the length of time the viewer has to wait it is much deserved all in all this is a movie that should have sunk in an hour and a half,sad
greetings from lithuaniaim a buff read lots of material watched countless documentaries about the tragedy im a movie buff as well  and it gets me every time i watch this unforgettable piece of work this is a storytelling its at is best visuals are outstanding even at this time after 16 years  is aging wonderfully the actor all of them did a very strong job and i loved the two leads i can not understand why is there so much negative buzz about this film they say its to chezee you can throw a rock in me if you havent saw more chezee stuff years after twilight and all the dancing shxx movies comes in to a mind first well i guess lots of people will always hate what is popular and at the same time really good  and thats a rare combination movies like this arent made every day to say the least and its shame that so many people trashes them well you can always just ignore them is outstanding motion picture in every possible way and it got what it deserved  11 oscars 16 milliard at the box office and hardly nforgettable journey  its hardly gets better than this,sad
this movie despite the inordinate quantity of rewards it received combines clichs and stilted dialogue to produce a passable effort however the length makes it excessively tedious the script was badly written to the extent that the high points of the movie were the mammeries of kate winslet and the death of leonardos character which provides some elation as the movie is at that point bound to roll the credits and leave you in piece the special effects were an achievement but the nauseating level of selfconscious sentimentalism that underpinned the movie burdened these scenes and leave you wondering why you should be compelled to care the overall message is the same love conquers all message with a very familiar method highly recommended for those who suffer insomnia,sad
ill tell you what bugs me about this filmdicaprios pals were irish the dancing was irish the music was irish or had an irish feeli just got the nagging feeling that the dicaprio character was supposed to be irish too but they chose a popular pretty face for the male lead just in case this nagged at me all through the film it nagged me again when we watched the videoanyway enough of this here is the spoilerit sinks,sad
the technical execution of the ship sinking is entertaining the rest of the movie is worthless dribblei can understand why an adolescent girl would sigh over some dumb little twerp proclaiming his love with his dying breath to a woman he has known for two days however anyone over the age of 15 who doesnt have to suppress a gag reflex at the idea has no standards at all there was no chemistry between the leads the writing was atrocious cameron failed miserably to develop any empathy for any of the major characters the movie sank long before the ship dida bad bad bad movie the worst movie to win best picture since forrest gump and that took some doing,sad
hmm i wonder what happened at the end i must have watched 68 of this film before washing the dishes seemed a more appealing chore many actors can perform convincingly in period films but this cast did not convince me at all that they were anything but 1990s actors with 1990s dialog trying to look like people from the 1910s the script was inane leaving the viewer with only special effects for interest in the verynear future when hightech special effects no longer dazzle audiences this moneymaking venture will be reevaluated ill give it a 210 in order to be fair to the special effects staff who clearly labored the hardest on this film and deserve some credit,sad
i will never understand the common man and therefore will never understand the mass hysteria over this movie  i did not care about any of the passengers james cameron took the time to introduce us to  in fact we know none of the true heartbreaking tales of the rms  only the fanciful romantic tale of a spoiled brat and the only american in steerage it is frightening to me that america embraced this movie without ever learning one bit of true history about the disaster of the  5 will get you 10 that most of america believes there was such a jewel as the heart of the ocean  we already know many fools clamored around the graves of anyone known as jack dawson  most offensive however are mr camerons comments at the oscars without any regard for the 1523 lives actually lost on the rms  life is not a movie and love does not conquer all,sad
this film was the worst collection of cliches i have seen in years something like a 30s costume epic with soupedup special effects except of course mgm crankedem out better in the 30s the true story of the has more than enough material to make a few films i could have done without the harlequin pulp novel plot for a good film see a night to remember uk 1958as for dicaprio and 97  turn blue and sink already,sad
the greatest film of all time hmmmi vowed to never watch the film but i did what a waste of time and 2 video cassettes i did give the film a chance i am a james cameron fan i own all of his other films on cassette what can i say the film was boring the acting was horrible dicaprio was laughingly bad and he actually thought he deserved an oscar nod billy zane played the best character in the film honestly his character was the most entertaining charactertoo bad so many people were blinded by dicaprios looks and did see the bad acting flowing from him the special effects were poor cmon long black bars representing the night sky mushy looking computer generated faces put over stunt peoples faces to make them look like dicaprio and winslet there is no way that dicaprio could swim up to the surface of the water after being pulled in by such a huge undertow the special effects guys forgot to add frozen breath in many of the sequences that take place in the frigid water also during that scene you can here soundstage echos dicaprio sure spent a lot of time talking about places he had been to which is fine considering they did not exsist back then oh yea it was sure nice of dicaprio to turn his back on his apparent life long best bud for winslet what a nice guy look closely as leo enters the dining hall you can see the reflection of a big camera and some crew guys carrying it and if you adjust ticket prices for inflation is not even close to being the highestgrossing film of all time gone with the wind et and even the star wars trilogy would have earned more too many fans brag about that kate winslet did not need to be naked in that film also her older version in the 90s could not have remembered all those facts about the ship bill paxton was wasted in this film this is not even close to being the greatest film of all time it is not even a good moviecheck out reservoir dogs the star wars trilogy predator even this boys life a good dicaprio film,sad
sure the leo and kate girly fanatics are going to be highly upset but oh well this is my review of this awful movie not theirs is the worst movie ever made why might you ask it has two annoying teenage characters very overweight rose played by chubby kate winslet and skinny teenage bratartist jack played by leo dicaprioyou would think that the film would be about the right no its about these two brats spending three hours playing games with everyone on the ship while waiting for it to sinknot once did i believe that a spoiled and infintile brat like rose would win the affections of such a wealthy person like cal played by billy zanei mean im one of the few people who actually sees cals point of view i mean rose did agree to get married to cal but instead of accepting it like a mature person rose acts like a spoiled brat who seriously needs a good spanking from her mother rose selfishly accepts the advances of jack who has no money and no way to support himself other than to cheat other people out of their tickets i cheered when cal slapped rose for cheating on him if it were me i would have dumped her long ago after all she is not only a brat but extremely overweight as welli found this movie to be completely predictable pretentious and downright boring how this film became a hit shows that teenage girls will see anything with overweight women as long as a pretty boy like leo is starring in itneither leo nor kate can act and someone seriously needs to recommend that kate winslet eat a lot less food she often looked exhausted after performing a simple task and her costumes look like they are about to burstwhen the boat finally sinks all excitement is worn out after spending three exhausting hours with two immature brats who get on peoples nervesnot to mention after the ship sunk and there are literally hundreds of freezing passengers sinking in the water rose selfishly keeps a large piece of wood for herself not bothering to offer any space to nearby passengers who all died while rose selfishly stayed on a large piece of woodi seriously recommend that fans of this so called movie reevaluate this flick but its downright terrible its the worst film ever made and thats my opinion,sad
this film and the adoration it has received from viewers and reviewers alike is one of the dominant reasons why i have decided not to attend any american made films this year my reasons are too numerous and strongly felt to be reduced to 1000 words i think that this picture itself can take the place of my 1000 words of disgust with james cameron and the american film industry,sad
absolutely abominable terrible in all respects except costume designvery disrespectful to the memory of those who died on this great shipforget james cameronrent a night to remember if you want to watch a beautiful film based on survivors actual stories of what happenedjack and rosethey can drown for all i carethis film beat la confidential for best picturethis weepy adolescent junk will go down in history as the worst best picture that the academy ever picked,sad
has a lot of fans and a lot of detractors the movie itself is a technical masterpiece james cameron showed things that people had never seen before such as going down into the actual wreckage with this little machine the movie came out when i was 12 and since i was one of the millions of girls who were head over heels in love with leonardo dicaprio i went to see it four times in the theateras i said technically this movie is just brilliant some of the technology is a little bit outdated if you look closely enough you can pick out the computer images but i dont think those detract from the visuals the sets and costumes are absolutely marvelous the music is also beautiful and haunting and its just right for the films mood ive always thought that the love theme my heart will go on is cheesy but effective in conveying the message of the filmof course the movie is about the but that is really the backdrop for the loveacrossclasslines story between rose dewitt bukater and jack dawson when i was 12 of course this was absolutely fantastic now i see it a bit differently but i do find it appealing nonetheless the idea is a little bit ludicrous considering how the ship was built and isolated the upper class from those in steerage a woman being able to break away from that is also pretty doubtful but nonetheless if you can get over that you can see the love story for what it is and that its message is love transcends all obstacles this is a great movie to watch on a saturday afternoon when its rainy outside and youve got nothing better to doaside from the love story you have the entire tragic loss of life from the sinking of the ship i think this was both welldone by cameron visually and the viewer sees the absurdity of course in roses jumping off the lifeboat to return to jack again though we understand as an audience that were going to be experiencing the foundering of this ship through the eyes of our two starcrossd lovers so the audience just has to roll with the punches here some of the shots here are amazing and it gets a little ghastly when the ship breaks in half and people start falling off and hitting propellers and getting landed on by the stern of the shipthe dialogue in this movie however is far from stellar the worst parts are the modern day pieces with gloria stewart and bill paxtons acting is as flat as the great plains again you just have to roll with the punches to get to the good stuff which is all the material when theyre on the billy zane makes a great villain and so does frances fisher as the mother kate winslet i think did an excellent job given some of her lines are a bit dull but i think she still pulls it off convincingly leonardo dicaprio is also a good actor and although some of his lines are terrible you can see in him the youth and vibrancy that a poor young artist must have when hes gotten the chance of a lifetimeits interesting to look at the roles of these women too as rose is not portrayed as a damsel in distress but more of a young woman whos confused and angry and trapped in her upper class world while it may sound like a poor little rich girl story kate winslet convinces you that its not just about her resenting her position in society if you were rose youd be unhappy toooverall i still love this movie its a great disaster film and has a lot of those classic elements the direction and the sets and costumes are visually dazzling and some of the acting is not superb but overall i still say its a good movie its definitely worth watching once if only for the sets and the sinking of the ship,sad
so many romance movies come out these days and so many of them have characters stories and relationships that are hopelessly difficult to care about who could have guessed that james cameron known for highly visual works like terminator and aliens would create what is in my mind unquestionably one of the greatest love stories ever if i had gone into blind i certainly wouldnt have i will get the few real flaws out of the way first leonardo dicaprio as great as he is in this film is forced to yell commands to rose a bit too much and the 3d is a gimmick nothing more however to my knowledge this is the only way to experience this film in imax so for me at least wearing the glasses was well worth it though im sure i am overlooking some thats about it for the bad on to the good firstly i hope that the rerelease of this acclaimed film will remind directors of romanticallyminded movies everywhere of how to do it right james cameron starts the film in the present day or at least it was when it was released with an expedition to the titular wreck overseen by an enthusiastic explorer bill paxton he finds a bunch of papers in a safe on the ship and restores a drawing of a young woman naked wearing only a necklace this sets into motion a series of events leading to a three hour long flashback detailing rose dewitt bukater kate winslet played in the present by gloria stuart and her passionate relationship with jack dawson leonardo dicaprio i could type for hours about how wellacted emotional and real this pair seems i wont but suffice it to say that all acting awards were welldeserved for the bare majority of the film jack and rose are in the spotlight the length of the film actually works to its advantage because ample time is given to see how their relationship springs wilts and ultimately blossoms jack is a lowerclass man and even he makes no bones about it rose is from the opposite end of the spectrum and hates it jack finds he about to commit suicide over her marriage forced on her by her mother the moments the two share really sell their relationship enough so that the audience becomes invested as well class differences are an extremely prominent issue brought up again and again at one point rose reminds a frantic crewman that only half the ships population can fit on the lifeboats her husbandtobe overhears this and replies the better half the rich are not painted in a sympathetic light they are arrogant selfish and terrible people that throw others off just to have themselves a little more space cameron goes this extra mile to ensure that we are sympathetic with rose she is forced to walk among these horrid humans and finally stumbles upon someone that treats her as an equal and in an almost husbandlike manner as opposed to her stuckup borderline misogynistic fiancee after almost two hours of engaging superb relationshipbuilding the inevitable iceberg looms this of course is where james camerons signature technical brilliance kicks in in full force metal is torn asunder flooding commences everywhere and there are many grand exterior shots showing the going down all of which are done with excellent special effects that look as real as any of the characters in the midst of them this is also where the movie becomes incredibly brutally honest about what probably happened once the ship began to sink hundreds are shown drowning and falling including children the rich shun the poor literally kicking them off lifeboats sos signals are sent and fireworks are launched and in what could be the greatest scene in the film four string instrument players lament the catastrophe the only way they know how and through it all rose and jack find each other through the worst of it and stay alive until the last possible moment james camerons work in this film is truly extraordinary he is not known for crafting compelling characters or stories however in these respects he succeeds brilliantly here in modern romance films characters and their tribulations are about as genuine as cardboard cutouts cameron has created a set populated it with characters that fill it to the last inch and bound it all together with great attention to artistic and technical detail i left trying to sort out what i liked most about it i havent yet decided but i knew then and know now that i have seen a beautiful masterpiece from the unlikeliest of sources,sad
i live in southampton the city where jack and rose embarked on the illfated many of the crew and the captain himself were from southampton many women were widowed and children left fatherless when the ship went down it was a major tragedy for our city and my children went to school with children who descended from those who lost their lives i felt a certain lack of respect was shown at times for the english crew portrayed as bumbling and rude and this is unfair to the families left behind having said that the film was spectacular and i dont begrudge the love story of jack and rose but when the ship started sinking i wasnt interested in seeing cal chase the lovers through the ship more attention should of been given to the disaster itself the other people on board but i still give it an 8 cos it made me cry,sad
in fact i am a logical manbut this movie is full of emotional scenes that i can not tolerate,sad
the best romance ive ever seena very strong and wellconstructed and great moviecostly film was a timeless film in the history of the world of cinema,sad
it all starts off with a 100 year old woman named rose dewitt bukater telling her story full of love and loss the story takes place on the luxurious but illfated rms with young rose boarding the departed ship with the upper class passengers and her mother meanwhile a traveler and an artist named jack dawson and his best friend fabrizio win third class tickets to the ship in a game of poker the story explains a seventeenyearold noblewomen falling in love with a kind but poor artistit is a real life story with a fictional twist the movie shows two completely different worlds and how they connect putting aside the labels and showing the purest of love a great lesson for the real world jack and rose spend their days together experiencing and learning new things from each other the tale starts off with young rose convincing herself to jump off of the ship due to her life situation of being forced to marry a self involved man that only loves money and himself jack spots young rose leaning over the rail and tries to convince her saying i went through some thin ice and im tellin ya water that cold like that right down there it hits you like a thousand knives all over your body you cant breath you cant think least not about anything but the pain which is why im not looking forward to jumping in after you but like i said i dont see a choice i guess im kinda hoping youll come back over the rail and get me off the hook here his attempt to help is successful and is invited to a meal as a result of his heroic actthe whole story with the movie is iconic it has greatly impacted then and is still now it has made a major impact in the movie industry and is still evolving its a story being told while also being lived at the same time now the ship lies at the bottom of the ocean with its remains only able to last another 15 to 20 years the film is here to keep the memory of the alive great success and great things have come out of this movie for many different reasonsi recommend this movie for anyone from teensyoung adults to elders the historic event tying to a beautiful but fictional story its been over 105 years and people are still fascinated with it so if you are looking to watch a love story that never fails to make you cry or maybe also a movie with a historic purpose then i highly recommend watching the,sad
this story follows jack leonardo dicaprio a poor artist who wins his ticket onboard the in a card game who meets rose kate winslet a beautiful young woman who is raised in an uppercrust society who sees her life as too predictable and in control by her pompous buffoon fiamce cal billy zane and craves a life of somewhat uncertainty when rose meets jack an unlikely romance blossoms as the embarks on its ill fated maiden voyagecameron truly put in a lot of hard work to create an absolute masterpiece here yes the movie has flaws but what movie doesnt i love how he made what could of been a dreary and gloomy drag of a movie and turned it into quite an up beat story up until strikes the ice berg this is in my favourites and ignites a fascination for the tragic story that is the so sad and outrageous how mostly third class passengers died in this disaster,sad
i see little point in being the two thousandth six hundred and nineteenth person in reviewing this movie but why not i saw this movie on its release being a ten year old child i was more concerned about seeing a young naked female than watching fifteen thousand five hundred and three people diesuch a movie was shut away in the back of my small silly mind and revived on the odd occasion through out my life over all i presumed this movie had little to no impact on my life until i realized it inspired my artistic talentthat mysterious picture of rose was set in my mind from a very young age and inspires me to this day along with the other pictures in jacks portfolio anyone with an artistic flare would know what i am talking aboutlater on in life i presumed this movie was a propaganda piece and took less care to even notice it until i took noticeit became evident that this movie portrayed two peoples exceptionally well the rich and the poorthat was the division and a sad one at thatits easy to focus on the love life of jack and rose but easier to focus on the indignation of the rich and poor and i think the movie might of underplayed thatwhich is acceptableits easy to say the movie was a tragic one but its easier to say it represents a heart of darkness and it is that darkness that makes one cryits extremely well filmed the filmography is brilliant the music enumerates and over all the entire film compliments itself each secondthere was a dispensation in film making of peak performances this era seemed to last less than twenty years this film was filmed during it,sad

one of my biggest childhood memories was seeing in the theatre i was only 7 years old when it was first released and i had no idea what a hell of a ride i was in for my father always had a keen interest in the and its sinking and i remember a large atlas like book he had of the full of pictures of the wreckage the dive teams efforts salvage operations etcit was just after christmas 1997 we went to my grandparents for a weeks holiday during our visit the adults decided we were all going to go and see so we arrive at the cinema walk in through the front entrance and theres a lineup like you cant even imagine a huge lineup of people all hoping to get in and see we stood in line for a few minutes until an usher came and yelled out all those wanting to see tickets are sold out for today and i think that was my first inkling of wow this movie really is a big deal so dad went to the ticket booth and got us tickets for two days later in a 3pm session that had enough tickets left for all five of usfast forward two days we go in and get our seats for the 3pm session the cinema is jam packed im talking not one seat free three incredible hours later we walk out of the theatre walk back through the shopping centre and get in our 4wd to drive back to nan and pops the second i got in the car i was just totally mesmerized the entire way home thinking about this movie and constantly repeating wow wow wow inside my head as a seven year old kid seeing this all i can say this movie had me gobsmackedanyway onto the moviea 101 year old woman rose sees a drawing of a young nude teenager on tv that was recovered from the wreckage she quickly realizes the nude girl in the drawing is in fact her she gets into contact with brock lovett played effortlessly by bill paxton who conducts frequent dive and salvage operations of the wreckage he is searching for a lost treasure known as the heart of the ocean which is an extremely rare and insanely valuable diamond after a very disappointing failed salvage attempt rose and brock come into contact and rose is flown out to their salvage boat where rose ends up telling a group including her granddaughter lizzy her entire story on the from start to finishher story begins with her arriving in southampton with her mother fianc cal played wonderfully by billy zane and mr lovejoy david warner who kind of acts like family security we are introduced to a young and very beautiful kate winslet the is still docked and the docks are crowded with avid passengers and enthusiastic spectators all itching to see the set off on its maiden voyage we are introduced to the handsome and mischievous jack dawson leonardo dicaprio and his friend fabrizzio in a tense poker game theyre lucky enough to win tickets on board and merely make it on boardthe next portion of the film has various characters talking about the construction kind of as a way to feed the audience some background knowledge i guess were introduced to the ships owner builder and a whole array of other first and third class citizens after rose explains how depressed she was starting to feel after being caught up in the madness of being a first class citizen and being forced to marry someone she denies her love for we see rose upset and about to jump off the ship committing suicide here we have a lovely and eerily quiet introduction between rose and jack for assisting rose her fianc cal invites him to dinner in first class the following evening we see the clear distinction between third and first class jack has no idea how to behave like a first class citizen and portrays that very nicely on screen to the point where its actually quite humorous later on in the film after a few more dramas we see what i can only describe as the most iconic and memorable on scree kiss of any movie in history now we come to the part of the film we came to see the sinking the remainder of the film is pure epic we see the ship slowly sinking more water rushing through the various floors and decks the passengers becoming progressively more panicked the captain trapping himself in the wheel house people turning on each other distressed children and parents people jumping off the ship into the freezing ocean trying to survive and its incredible how much you do actually feel like youre there on the ship all of it was done in studios but it literally does look like its sinking into a real ocean and the scene where the ship splits in two was the icing on the cake for me after the ship has sunk the survivors floating in the ocean become slowly more and more quiet until theres complete silence i still to this day find it a very eerie and disturbing part of the film all in all is quite simply put just a ground breaking piece of cinema the film makers got the era spot on in terms of clothing and how characters look and behave and as i understand got the look of the interior spot on for the time period too it really does feel like youre back in 1912 and its always a movie i can come back to every few years and enjoy it as if it was my first time seeing it as a 7 year old phenomenal film 10 out of 10 fox,sad
being of a rather sensitive nature i steered clear of mostly because i did not want to witness the deaths of the 1500 people who perished in the icy atlantic waters in 1912 thus i only recently saw the film on video months after all the hype the awards and subsequent hoopla had played itself out is certainly a lush beautifully photographed and wellmounted film although it is almost a bit too slick for my tastes i thought leo and kate were blandly likable but i was not very much interested in their characters or their performances the supporting cast however was topnotch in particular frances fishers remarkably restrained performance as roses mother ms fisher did more acting with a 3second tightlipped glance of disapproval then leo did with 3 hours worth of stilted dialogue and billy zane managed to twist his classically handsome features into an oily and sometimes frightening visage of callow shallowness the wonderful kathy bates always lends a touch of class to whatever role she undertakes and as molly brown she doesnt disappoint i would have been much more interested in the plot if the story had been told from mollys perspective rather than roses but the real point of the film is the tragedy itself which is depicted with harrowing overwhelming clarity during the sinking sequence on this level i think the film is fully realized however the fictitious story line is seriously flawed and i have a difficult time believing leo as a romantic leading man in hes more like the arrogant kid who should be taken to the woodshed and spanked,sad
i was just wandering the city one day seeing the city lights so i went to see it the big movie that everybody went and talked aboutill go straight to the point and wont go as to say anything about the plot weve all gotten that in by force i think what i find good about this movie are the small things not where everything is focused upon decaprio and kate obviously the movie has much personality so love it or hate it youll find something about that feels personal i wont let out what i think was my favorite part of the movieis yes a good movie i would be blind if i didnt see the beauty of this movie but maybe is too much larger then life when watching it you fail to remember reality it all seems all too hollywood with decaprios face on the dollar bill with in the backgroundtells us about every living thing on the ship or so it seems even the rats get a little spotlight in but the whole thing seems still to evolve just two characters so it seems to me that the movie gets too shallow sinking a ship just to get a good love story ah well maybe im too picky is good though guess where my favorite part of the movie is youll never guess it ill give you a clue somewhere along the sinking scene  enjoy the movie,sad
a fictional romantic story rapping itself up in a true tragedycameron goes to all the work on the detail of the set and overlooks the time period people in steerage did not have the run of the ship  they were confined to the aft back part of the ship  they were not allowed in the middle or at the bow of the ship  which completely destroys dicaprios little im king of the worldthe movie should be commended on set design but not for details of facts if one is going to do a period piece then one should research the periodthe true story of the would have been a better movie  it could have been a moving about humanitys arrogance and how nature put humanity in its place  it would have also shown how this tragedy should have never happened  they should have had enough lifeboats and had a round the clock radio operator,sad
for many of us maybe one of the great films ever made i beg to differ seeing this movie for the first time did not really gave me the intense and impact as it did on millions and millions of us to be honest i find this movie boring and really a waste of more than 3 hoursthe story is so much predictable you can even guess what would happen and even whats the ending performances i must admit are quite impressing billy zane and kathy bates delivers a standout performances leonardo and kate also did well on this film but truly neither of them deserves an oscar james cameron as far directing is concern really deserves his oscar effects on this film are also great especially when the ship is sinking but most of the time i find it lame to sum up this film has its own highlights but truly i dont consider this as one of the greatest films,sad
ok dont get misled by the oneline summary i thought was a descent movie but in no way was it the best film of the year not even close lets face it if dicaprio isnt in the cast this movie doesnt break the records the performances were all halfway decent at best i could have played jack it was that difficult of a part but the special effects were nice the plot was textbook romance and there was nothing surprising even when jack died all in all this movie was ok i give it a 6 out of 10 if you want to see a real cameron movie see true lies thats a movie that has got it all fun action comedy and a surprise here and there finally the main reason this movie could have been better is if the screenplay was better good will hunting won for best screenplay in 97 and they deserved it a lot more a good movie but ladies lets just leave it at that,sad
all right we get the picture about the great special effects etc the grand scale everything was done in i still after all of my time on this earth find it hard to believe that people can be brainwashed so much by media hypeim not about to say the movie was bad i would probably use the word contrived this movie contains just about everything that a rational human being should be repulsed by a cheesy soundtrack that lingers to this day on radio stations everywhere a mass of zombies who keep talking and talking and talking about the movie an embellished and trite historical plot based on real eventsthere is absolutely no way that this movie should have taken up 3 hours of your time save the fact that it was so expensive they probably didnt want to waste one inch of film  i guess they figured since you already know the ending theyd string you along with overdone poorboyrichgirl cliches and special effects  yeah the effects were great i certainly couldnt do them im just praying for the day when its finlly passe to even talk about special effectsconsider that dreamworks the company stemming from the little project know as the star wars trilogy had to invent special effects invent the tools to invent the special effects and had virtually no prior model to base any of their work or at least techniques on  today its all old hat who can write programs that render graphics quickly who is the resident software expert who can do the most in the least amount of time i guess once we get sick of 100 computergraphicgenerated movies well stop all this nonsense already,sad
i still say la confidential as good as it gets and goodwill hunting were robbed  ok ill give the great scenery and effects but please the story was so simple and lame i could have written it for 10th grade english  if a movie is to be categorized a a truly great movie it shouldnt be about the money it should be on how it advances moviemaking heck give me the kind of money cameron spent on this movie and i could pay 25 of my countrys foreign debt  wasted money on a nice looking but truly uninspiring film,sad
after hearing several people talking about this particular movie and how many times they went back to see it i bought the movie watched it one time put it away and have never gotten it back out again  granted everything was on a grand scale good storyline and somewhat interesting characters  but im afraid the only thing most people females went again and again to see was leonardo dicaprio  i enjoyed what special effects there were and had quite a long wait to see them and then it was over sorry this wasnt one for me,sad
i must admit as a movie buff that this was the worst piece of saporama ever the grace the screen i mean what was the point  it was about two little spoiled kids running around on some stupid boat saying stuff like ill never let go come on  the romantic side of it was so contrived it felt like i was being choked as i watched it  none of the characters were even halfway decent and all the actors were just a waste leo dicaprio is a loser the boat was the main character and the iceberg was the supporting actorbad guy  towards the end of the movie i was hoping the boat would just sink already just to put me out of my misery  when kate winslet was threatening to throw herself overboard i was on the edge of my seat yelling jump do it jump  james cameron uses the death of a thousand innocent people in an attempt to illicit some emotion out of the audience since the characters of the movie cant do it  the only redeeming quality of the whole film was kathy bates but even she couldnt save this boat from sinking  lets face it the only reason there is to watch this movie is if you got a couple of hours to kill and your dentist cant give you a root canal just right now but you want to prepare yourself for the pain,sad
can we say predictable  can we say simplistic  can we say a badly told love story with nothing new that exists only to fill time before a roller coast sfx show happens  can we say 3 hours of annoying drivel written by hacks hammed up by beautiful media darling actorswe dont have to say any of this  cameron did it for us and spent way too much money doing itperfect 1  nuff said,sad
i saw twice as it was released in 1997 my first impression was wow it felt really stunning and visually impressive big and simply the best however the impression was lost soon one thing i realized  good movie is not equal to expensive movie after this i saw hundreds of films and i started to evaluate them from a different point of view and sank to the ocean of hollywood production not leaving a footstep after itthis was a very expensive film but as i now remember the whole story the way it was shown the grandiose hype of it it feels completely banal plain and cheap cheap not in terms of money spent on it but in terms of plot acting and general style of the movie yes i have to pay my respect to the director for such a grandiose work and all those oscars he received even though theyre not that valuable anywhere but in hollywood but to my opinion this film is an expensive and unsuccessful attempt to make a good film yes the views were nice and realistic but thats all theres nothing more i could rate positively in this film except the technical special effects how many more criterions despite special effects are there while rating a moviei congratulate the makers of they did a good business and after spending  hundreds of millions they profited even more but that doesnt make a good film its just another stunning piece of hollyywood production in the bad meaning of it sorry if i sound too harsh but i really mean it for nice effects  410,sad
just outside kursk on a sunny july morning in 1943 obersturmfhrer muller of the 3rd panzer division has a problem his fancy new panther tank in a meisterstck of environmentally sound engineering has come with a two live zebra painfully welded to the rear and as we know germans dont do back wheel drive vorsprung durk technica similar and no less surreal problem plagues james camerons technical tour de force it is impressive groundbreaking and sophisticated but lets face it its going nowhere with a plot like that bolted incongruously to its chassisrenowned to be one of the most expensive films of all time it seems preposterous that a few quid couldnt have been siphoned from the hugeshipsinksdramatically budget into the story budget but there you gothe actors try their best plaudits go leonardo dicaprio for successfully rehashing hollywoods cheesy iorish stereotypes billy zane is excellent as the creepy violent one and of course our kate furthers the plot significantly by putting her famous waps on display they are very impressivein fact the plot is so bad and the dialogue so awful you can sense the huge directorial sigh of relief when the ship starts to sink listen carefully and you can almost hear cameron mutter over tortured screech of ice on metal ah this is the kinda film i understand once the ship goes bellyup things do indeed liven up dramatically things slide around people scream chandeliers crash vast imponderable drops open beneath peoples legs and the huge hulking edifice that is james camerons sinks gracefully and inexorably into the dark watersat least an hour and forty minutes before all this winslet provides one of the more amusing unintentional ironies of the film when she declares to the ships designer mr freud has some interesting theories about men forever striving to make things bigger biggest ship biggest movie biggest budget hmmm save it for oprahso impressive expensive huge and groundbreaking nevertheless remains a towering cathedral to mediocrity  and the only film for which the best viewing experience is achieved by arriving twoandahalf hours late and leaving ten minutes before the end 410,sad
quite possibly one of the worst movies ever made this film ignores the heartrending stories of the 2000 real people who were one the to present to us a redundant romeojuliet storyline kate winslet plays a spoiled freespirit who is being forced by her mother to marry the wealthy billy zane on board the she meets jack leonardo di caprio who teaches her to be free or in other words be trashy and selfcentered the movie is filled with bad acting and even worse writing the only redeeming features are the special effects which are stunning and the beautiful soundtrack,sad
this movie began the sad trend of turning tragedies into love stories after came pearl harbor it really is getting sad the only good part of this movie is the sinking of the ship the cg in that part is really good but really was this that great of a movie no to prove this one must only look at its theme song tired already after hearing youll be in my heart for the 1496th time yes i really did count i was really bored one month i got really tired of it to say the least it is unbearably long and undeservedly so unlike lotr rotk which was a truly epic movie this movie just seemed to drag on and what was with the dropping of the necklace into the ocean yes it was symbolic but really that thing was worth millionsanyways if you are considering watching this movie just forget it and go rent something meaningful like the godfather or any of the lotr movies some truly great movies or if you are looking for a laugh get thumbtanic that was pretty funny and it will basically give you a shorter more intelligent overview of the than this movie did,sad
im one of the cynics and am quite proud of it thanks i cannot fathom why this film received any oscars apart from anything for special effects in that department it excels yes the actual cracking apart and sinking of the legendary ocean liner was extremely well done but as for the rest just one word disappointmentfirst theres leonot a terrible actor but pretty limited here and kate about the same goes for her then there is the story it would have been more interesting if it had focused on the lives of others who were actually on the shipincluding the crew its also painfully overlong and it has a celine dion song to boot how much more wrong can it possibly get an overrated piece of dross indeed,sad
this movie is everything that a movie should not be  who cares about money the feeling is not there like it is in citizen kane or godfather or casablanca  it is just stupid  please do not see this movie which brings down the standards of movies everywhere,sad
so how do you spend vast amounts of money on a film and still wind up with a dreadful albeit profitable end product simpleyou spend lots of money on beautiful sets and breathtaking special effects you hire some very talented andor mostly or attractive actors then you give those actors lines to speak that are so badly written they might have been written by a 13yearold girl trying to emulate a harlequin romancedespite wonderful production values and a serviceable story line may be painful to the ears of anybody who is fully literate why did james cameron spend so many millions to make a film and not spend an extra ten grand to have a competent editor look at his script writing the terminator movies really was not adequate preparation for writing an epic romancegag me with a spoon hmmm did kate winslets character say something like that in what was supposed to be 1912 quite possibly,sad
this movie had its themes backwards the part about the itself was incredibly well done and very suspenseful  however the love story was more predictable than the story of the ship  it was the stock love story which has been beaten to death over the years  leonardo di caprio gave an unconvincing performance which destroyed the movie even further,sad
no sense going into great detail about this film which just about everyone who watches movies saw when it came out i still dont recall a film getting as much hype as this one did i doubt if the second coming would get the kind of publicity this movie received it was disgusting  the pr the story and the favorable box office responseoh once the oceanliner hits the icebergs and the disaster starts its terrific but thats not until the last 45 minutes of this 194minute movie too bad we had to wade through all the baloney before this climactic scenethe baloney in a nutshell was 1 a stupid teen romance between two arrogant unlikeable people 2 most the film being a lie defaming many of the people who were heroes in that disaster instead choosing to picture them as selfish villainsthe latter is all in the name of political correctness some filmmakers like james cameron are filled with something akin to horse manureto make it brief in real life the men in the first class did everything they could to get the women and children safely off the boat just look it up relatives of those people were justifiably extremely upset over camerons totallyfabricated story and i cant blame themanyway even with all the untruths if they had cut down on the leonardo dicapriokate winslet rebeltype attitude and romance it would have been a far better film but then again you wouldnt have the billions of dollars in revenue from the 1215yearold girls who flocked by the millions to see this farce the rest of us would have preferred to see the true story of the famous disaster,sad
the cinema viewer may well wonder whether there can be any real suspense when it is clear from the beginning of the film that the central character rose kate winslet will survive the disaster that befalls the but suspense there is not least because we dont know whether her lover will make it there is also action social class comment drama historical notes  not least several comments on the cause of the initial impact and why it was so disastrous  and good old fashioned romancerarely has a three hour film seemed so short it canters the romance at the centre of the plot develops quickly and my attention was held not only by developments in this story but the events that taken together spelt disaster for the unsinkable ship and then the aftermath of the ships collision with that famous icebergkate winslet was simply gorgeous and put in a fine performance as did leonardo di caprio as jack dawson the makeup of the older rose gloria stuart was one of the less convincing aspects of the movie but it seems churlish to draw attention to such a detail in any case its to be expected that an 87 year old will need a fair amount of facial recontouring and warpaint to play a woman of 101,sad
i cannot for the love of god believe how extremely overrated james  camerons pile of garbage known as is this film which should  have been about the actual sinking of the great luxary ship  instead relies on a 90210 idiotic love story to carry the picture  through if the two main characters had been interesting it might have  been a better picture but alas the two leads jack dawson and rose  bukater are about as interesting as watching paint dry rose isnt  suffering from oppression shes suffering from spoiled brat syndrome  jack comes along like a teenage pretty boy rather than a compelling  character that the audience relates to  the film does have a few assets such as costume design and some of the  special effects are pretty good however its the whole script and  its 90210 meets the setting that makes this the most overrated  film in the history of motion pictures this film grossed 600 million  in the united states james cameron must have put mind altering  drugs into the prints of the film to hypnotize movie audiences and  academy members who gave this stinker best picture of 1997 over the  great la confidential  one on a scale of 110 great costumes and special effects cannot make  up for a ridiculous screenplay and dull leads want a great motion  picture try la confidential or citizen kane instead,sad
rating   12james cameron is one of the best film directors out there  he made the terminator in 1984 which is not only arnold schwarzeneggers best film but quite simply the greatest action film ever made  aliens and the abyss were excellent scifi films and literally invented new technology  terminator 2 was a great sequel and true lies was a ton of fun  he also made t23d a cool theme park attractionthen he made  t2 was the most expensive film of its time at a hundred million dollars  more than doubled that  it went far over budget in fact  and it was well spent  the special effects are absolutely incrediblecamerons script however leaves something to be desired  it concerns unsatisfied 1st class 16yearold rose kate capshaw and her romance with 3rd class con guy jack leonardo dicaprio  his profession wander around paris france drawing girls naked  here is problem 1warning minor but predictable spoiler  in 1912 a 1st class teenaged girl sleeps with a 3rd class teen 24 hours after they meet  maybe maybe in the  80s but in 1912in fact thats the main problem  the film revolves around a romance that is stupid and completely unbelievable  in other words the script stinksthe film lasts over three hours  this is not necessarily a bad thing all of sergio leones classics last about that long  but in the hours are divided up in different qualities  the first hour is fine and somewhat spectacular but not great  the second is really stupid and ruins the film  the last hour is superb in nearly every way  as i have already mentioned the special effects are awesome and camerons directing abilities are at their very bestthe cast is fine but not great  ive never been much of a fan of dicaprio but hes okay here  capshaw is really good but is outdone by billy zane as her slimy fianceethis won eleven academy awards which has only been done once before for 1959s ben hur  ben hur was a true classic and deserved itwon best picture which should have gone to la confidential best director was more or less deserved for helming something on this scale the special effects sets cinematography costumes etc definitely deserved it  james horners score was good but it did not deserve and oscar as much as some of his others like glory and star trek ii  and surely this wasnt the best film song of the yearas i said in the onelinesummary it is camerons worst so far but thats not really that bad  steven spielburg has made worse than thisit might not be a bad idea to see this film just for the spectacle i just cant think of any other reason,sad
watching was like having 2 people wrestle with a remote channel changer just when the movie becomes historically interesting the other person grabs the remote and switches it to a pedestrian daytime soap opera did kate have to be on hand at every step that led to the sinking her and leo are on the side of the deck where the ice hits of course just missing them oh lets put her next to the captain when he learns fate and lack of life boats the tragedy was story enough and james cameron did a brilliant business decision to shove a preteen love opera to the foreground so girls could flock to the theater over and over to see leo alive again and again and again give the channel changer back so we can please continue with the story of the ship yes i heard some crying when leo sank into the abyssbut no sniveling when the little boy who leo tries to rescue before the boy is grabbed away from his panicky father is swept away by the flooded corridor so much for crying prioritiesim a big cameron fan has left him permanently wealthy and hes tapped into a genre the same way lucas tapped with star wars in attracting a select category of people that were willing to see this over and over billion dollar revenue was the result of many repeat viewings worldwide combining history with poster boy imageryspecial effects were brilliant but ill take the 1958 black and white a night to remember movie insteadtodays lesson if youre going to use an ax to free someone shackled with chains dont aim close your eyes tight then swing hard so you wont see the spraying blood this is life and deathbetter leave it to luck7 out of 10,sad
trying to get beyond all the hype the ludicrous praise and the vehement reaction against i tried to rate this movie objectively and and in doing so i gave it a three out of ten it is not the worst movie ever made and its certainly not the best some nice special effects hackneyed twodimensional characters and dialogue written for early teens but not particularly offensive can be watched from start to finish once with only a dozen or so moments of cringinghowever what did sink right along with that ship was the prestige of the oscar award itself now the oscars have given out silly best pictures in the past and there has always been a creeping element of the grammies popularity contest about them that kept them from ever getting too high brow but with the choosing of as the best picture for 1997 i honestly believe that the academy did serious damage to its reputation for many years to come previously serious film lovers knew that while the oscars certainly werent a foolproof measure of quality in retrospect they have produced a list of the greatest films that on the whole stands the test of time just as well as any list created by the cannes venice berlin or toronto film festivals but this year 1997 changed everything not only did they overlook one of the best films of the decade la confidential but they made an obvious bow to box office as a ratings ploy and lowestcommondenominator crowd pleaser with time the decision to crown an overgrown adolescent throwaway flick the best movie of the year will haunt them mercilessly if it doesnt already,sad
not often you see a film where the leading man is prettier than the leading woman the best performance in it is from gloria stuart as the old woman david warner does a very good impression of leo g carroll kathy bates is impressive and so is the ship i found dame kate and leonardo thoroughly uninteresting,sad
first of all i must say that i didnt have much expectations to this movie in the first place but as a dedicated movielover ive promised myself to see as many movies of any kind that i possibly can the plot in the film is no news to anyone and dicaprios arrogant and childish acting is an enormous disappointment after seeing him in films like whats eating gilbert grape kate winslet is excused cause shes probably what they could afford after budgeting the stunning effects and dicaprio as for the effects theyre of course outstanding and the sinking sequence is probably some of the most impressing ive ever seento sum it all up first half hour good the middle is the most boring ever and the end is great technically if theyve made this a documentary instead and dropped the lovestory itd been a movie worth while but as it turned out im sorry but the thumbs should be anywhere but up,sad
it is always the way in hollywood these days why let history get in the way of a blockbuster movie has plenty of good points about it but any student of the disaster could not help but be disappointed especially with the glaring inaccuracies and cliches this movie had to offerthe americans brash and almost looking like they knew the damn ship would sinkthe british stiff and emotionless in first class who would given the chance be quite happy to shoot the irish peasants on the lower decks if the were allowedthe british lower classes were a bunch of thugsthe poor irish as a load of guinness swigging biddly biddly dancing bumpkins clearly the victims in the disasterthe point i am try to make is that the tragedy of 1912 was a multilayered affair with moments of great sadness and bravery throught the two plus hours of the ships sinking i feel that james cameron had sacrificed this for the love story of rose and jack which is a shamei did enjoy but i thought it was a missed opportunity to show what happened for my money a far more moving film about the sinking of the was a night to remember with kenneth more and honor blackman amongst othersthe story is a deeply emotion subject i would truly recommend a night to remember if you want to watch a film about the sinking of the and watch if you want to watch a love story,sad
checking out the other comments one caught my eye somebody had the gall to make a comparison between this film and akira kurosawas masterpiece the seven samurai to compare this film with the seven samurai is utterly rediculous and an insult to great films with that said ill continuelet me start off with the absolute horrid screenplay that is filled with cliches while watching this film you can pretty much tell what is going to happen next its the rich girl forced to marry a rich guy but she finds a poor boy that she eventually falls in love with story youve seen hundereds of times before add a big boat a historical disaster and bingo you have yourself a movie the dialogue is almost laughably bad oh jack jack and the characters are almost as clicheridden as the story theyre in as you watch the film you feel almost as if youre forced to like the charactersa disaster as huge as the sinking of the doesnt deserve a film like this it is an insult to the hundreds that died in that distaster to be represented in a stereotypical film such as this and its winning of the best picture oscar is absolute proof that the oscars are nothing more than a huge popularity contest anymore to even place this in the same category with films like on the waterfront benhur the african queen rebecca the godfather etc is such a shame and just shows you what direction the film industry is headedabout the only good thing i could say about this film is that it is an enormous technical achievement the recreation of the ship itself is amazing but that alone cannot carry a film with a recycled clicheridden plot such as this,sad
this movie is kind of lame il write here some of the biggest mistakes of the movieswhy oh why is one of the people getting on the life boats wearing a digital watch surely they werent around in 1912 young rose has green eyes but old rose has blue eyes later in the film there is a fade between the faces of young  old rose and this time old roses have magically changed to match kate winslets eyesafter rose has helped jack to get loose from where he is handcuffed as he is jumping over a bench one minute he has the handcuffs on the next shot theyre gone then theyre back after rose breaks jacks handcuffs below decks and both race down the hallways outrunning the rising water rose is clearly wearing white sneakers yet she is seen 30 seconds later wearing period shoes when jack retrieves the gate key that the crewman dropped beneath the rising waterthere are too many of them so il stop here if youre going to see a movie dont go and see,sad
that will get you through the interminable story and decaprios horrible performance until the ship sinksi can not comprehend why this movie was so popularand the nonsensical ending will have you chuckling to yourself,sad
ok guys first of all i admit that on that piece of wood there was no space for two people to sit there was only one persons space on itso why cant they take 1515 mins ride mankate winslet as that rose was just too selfishok jack let her to go and climb first that doesnt means that she will just climb and sleep manvery nicely she slept on it and woke up in the morningand its not end over herejesus christ man how can she just decide that he is deadis she a bloody dictator a what did she checked his nerves or heartbeatshe can even be unconscious manno means if his eyes are closed not openthat means that he is dead as per that selfish roseso what man that selfish girl rose kate winslet just killed or can say as willinglymistakely and intentionally she sacrificed and killed my brother jack leo nardo di caprio in this awful love story and pathetic movieso the direction was worstawful and pathetic man the screenplaycinematographylocations dilalouges and music were also worstthe acting from mr caprio was good but he chosed the worst romanticof his careerthe acting from kate winslet as rose was patheticand also man this film is so lengthy and extremely boring as per memy head was paining while watching this lengthy and boring filmthe editing was extremely badthe editor was pathetic in his workand i dont know guys why most of the people have loved this illogical love story and the movieand i think only i have didnt liked this film and everyone else have liked thisso they shud think of somelogicso guys as per me this film is boringlengthypathetic and awfulavoid this for saving ur precious time coz its extremely boring and lengthyavoid this,sad
i avoided seeing this film for all of three years due to the ludicrous amount of hype that surrounded it i can now honestly say it was not worth the wait  in his time james cameron has directed some classic films terminator aliens and the abyss instantly spring to mind for their claustrophobia and generally tense atmosphere  forgoes all said atmosphere and tension relying on treaclelike sentimentality and the unnecessary overemphasis on special effects eclipses any innovation that his vision once had all the money wasted on getting the little plates and cups manufactured by the original white star suppliers could have been better spent getting the external deck sets to within 25 of their original size 5 12 foot high doors anyone,sad
is a fairly good movie but i personally think the historical part of the movie seemed to be more touching and overall better then the love story between jack and rose their relationship seemed to have all of the aspects that every hollywood romanticfantasy has the two young lovers are breaking the social code to be seeing each other theyre both young enough to pass as teenagerswhich in this film i think they are  there is a steamy scene and it has a touch of tragedy well its all very predictable but james cameron did a wonderful job with the story of the ship i found that part more touching and realistic than the love story you really can see the passengers terror and panic during the sinking sequence its all very saddening to watch because as you watch it you know that it actually happened many years ago the amount of detail put into it was incredible from the woman and children first first class first to the musicians staying aboard to play the fireworks all very nice to watch,sad
the fact that this movie won an oscar for best film is one of the biggest disgraces of all time it ranks right up there with madonna not getting nominated for her role in evita  everyone loved this thing for some reason but i found it lame and boring  i was so glad when the end credits came that i almost burst into hysteric joy,sad
why do i love this movie where to begin to start out with im a male and couldnt care less for dicaprio i went to see the film because i thought the sinking scenes looked cool i still remember sitting in the theater watching the opening scenes and wondering what the hell i was watching it wasnt what i expected i sat watching with slight interest a beautiful love story but i was always anticipating the icebergs appearance by the time the ship did begin sinking the love story had worked its magic i cared for rose and jack i cared for the passengers and crew and somehow i found myself hoping against logic that the ship wouldnt sink when jack died and rose begins 1500 people went into the sea i was crying harder than id ever cried and ive never cried at a film before or since it just hit me like a ton of bricks that 1500 people died the same way jack did and while jack may have never existed those other 1500 did some people bash this film for the love story but it helps the audience relate on an emotional level and offers an unforgettable experience if you open your heart to it for the last 15 minutes or so i kept hoping it wouldnt end because i doubted any ending would be satisfactory i was pleasantly surprised though for i consider the final scene in this film to be one of the most satisfying cinematic endings ever when the lights came on i looked around and i can honestly say that i wasnt the only person sobbing  not by a long shot i left the theater at nearly midnight not the least bit tired feeling like i had just seen the best film ever made and that i would never again see something like it thus far i stand by that i tend to find that a lot of people who dont like it did not see it at the theater and im not surprised it doesnt pack the same punch in a lit room full of distractions and on a smaller screen to add to that these first time watchers are expecting to find out what all the hype was about bits and pieces shine through on television but the full experience is in a dark theater nowadays its cool to bash this movie as with anything popular theres always a backlash look at the macarena if you want proof this is the most successful film of all time it is absolutely amazing how far this film reached transcending all demographics it was a phenomenon still unequaled and i look forward to watching it age for it is truly a timeless classic i doubt any of this changed anybodys opinion at all but i hope it shed some light on mine,sad
i fell in love with this movie instantly after viewing it for the first time many people ridicule this film for its idealistic and often mushy romance and for the lovers passionate relationship after being acquainted for no more than two days of course perhaps isnt the most believable story of all time but in my eyes its certainly one of the most entertaining i dont watch movies to see reality i see enough of that every day if reality is what i had been hoping for when viewing i would have been sorely disappointed in the love story despite its breathtakingly accurate portrayal of the ships infamous deathno is more of a fairytale one that sweeps you away and holds your attention until its ending it is the unforgettable tale of jack a poor but kindhearted street urchin and rose a wealthy but misunderstood young woman when fate brings them together on the first and last voyage of the they must face many trials and tribulations in order to pursue their forbidden love keeping them apart is roses mother who insists that her daughter marry a stuckup rich man and cal roses malicious fianc to whom she is to be wedded by force while jack and rose are willing to face these odds for each other there are some things which cannot be faced down one of them being an iceberg the ultimate destruction of their relationshipdespite its joyous fairytale like aspects it is still very tragic a feelgood romance and a tragic epic all in one like a brilliant cross between romeo and juliet and cinderella for the first half of the movie i was overwhelmed with a wonderful feeling for the second half i was near tears finally the movies amazing conclusion was sending chills down my spine and i felt as if i couldnt decide if i was happy or sadleanardo dicaprio is mischievous yet sweetnatured as jack and masterfully brings across what is in my opinion the most memorable and lovable role in the entire film i found kate winslet almost yet not quite as impressive as dicaprio in her role as rose who although seeming perfectly content and fortunate outwardly is misunderstood and desperately miserable inside jack sees this hidden part of her recognizing her longing for freedom and helps her to fulfill it the remaining cast shines as wellwatch this movie enjoy it forget the real world and lose yourself in,sad
ok i dont know what everyone else was thinking while voting but id sure like to voice my opinionloudly1 im very disappointed with the limited recognition this beautiful movie has on imdb i would expect more from movie lovers2 its very hard to find a movie that all ages can enjoy with comedy tragedy truth and love which clearly delivers3 acting was outstanding not to mention the unforgettable music and effectsin my opinion is a milestone in leos and kates careers many of the scenes in the movie stay with you after youve watched it not just the tragedy or romance but the vast gap presented amongst the rich and poor who are treated in proportion with their money i absolutely love this movie,sad
i was so excited at the prospect of seeing i anxiously waited for the film to begin by the end i knew that i never wanted to see it again what a disappointmenti suppose the special effects and set design were great perhaps some of the scenes were enjoyable but the acting was only so so the story was lame the romance banal the billy zane character was a true joke plus so much of the movie lacked credibility wouldnt the character played by kate surely have drowned before being able to be rescued an overlong study in mediocrity at best james cameron gave us a dudi admit some of my disdain is in response to the great marketing rush i feel as though the movie was being jammed down my throat nevertheless i stand by my criticisms and have found many people who agree with me skip this and watch a night to remember,sad
when i was around 5 came out and my parents had seen it in theaters and hated it i however found a big love for the movie my friends played on the playground my friend owned the video and i eventually saw it well half of it since i wasnt ready for the distress and peril as i grew i learned how cheesy formulaic and just plain god awful this movie wasto start off i think that the scenery costumes and sets are magnificent and some of the characters give life in their roles the man who played the captain victor garber and kathy bates the rest however are just irritating and trying too hard to make their performance stand out and they do just not in a good way kate winslet is just a snobby girl who obviously is misunderstood and wishes her mother would listen to her leonardo dicaprio is just a vile poor boy who seems an awful lot like a rude and bratty version of trampwho is from a rich girl meets poor boy story that works lady and the tramp billy zane plays roses fianc cal and uses an accent that mocks the british as do most of the other supporting actors plus cal is convinced that the ship is unsinkable as is everyone except rose who is educated apparently knowing who freud is makes her a smart scholar but shes a girl why listen to her this ship is unsinakble it is she who notices that theyre arent enough lifeboats but is reassured once again by another man that the ship cant and wont sink enoguh on that let us talk about the main plotwas a ship that was to sail from ireland to new york we all know that but it seems that the director james cameron who is usually a good director and who redeemed himself with ghosts of the abyss does not know anything but that small fact and that many irish people were in third class the many wonderful stories about the ship not that the death of many people is a good thing but that the tales survivors have passed down about their voyage on the if james contacted the few still alive or read a book he would maybe make this film get two stars for researching the stories of the ships passengers anyway rose is on the ship with her mother and fianc but she is not happy jack is a poor boy who wins tickets to the in a game of poker and lives his life to its fullest they meat while suicidal rose is about to jump and jack wont let her if this were the real world any chance that these two would meet or that she would even come near the third class deck would be very slim so long story short he saves her from falling while doing so the police hear screams coming from her and when they arrive it appears that he is raping her they arrest jack but rose says that he saved her and he goes scotch free then their bond beginsalready within the first forty five minutes am i bored waiting for the ship to sink and not center around these two bratty kids who never even existed but the story makes them as big as the ship itself so these two become friends and jack teaches rose how to live a little which means he gets her to hock spit and dance at a drunken third class party and escape the upper prestigious class soon rose begins to realize do i even love cal is jack the one for me he understands her and she understands him unfortunately her mother disapproves of their romance because hes poor and shes engaged rose then tries to end her romance with jack but like every other romance movie she goes with the man she just met and apparently the choice was right they stand on the edge of the ship and fly he draws her nude only wearing her necklace cal gave to her as an engagement present if you have been living in a cave or hopefully havent heard of these scenes are none as its most memorable as is their sex scene in the back of a car luckily the iceberg hits and all hell breaks loose after cal insisting it wont sink it does and nobody listen to rose cal wants her but she says id rather be a whore then your wife soon enough jack and rose are together in the water all cold and near death but they can still churn out cinematic waste while watching it i found their love being broken not as important as the many people dying right next to them and before you know it jack dies it would be pretty obvious because when a disaster occurs one of the lovers is bound to die eventually selfish rose is rescued and calls herself rose dawson which makes me laugh she knows him for two days and then considers their little unimportant romance like marriage please the end is when the diamond the explorers are searching for isnt found rose has it she dumps it over the edge and then meets jack in heaven there i saved you three hours of your lifeadding on to the boring love story the music sounds like enya half the time and the rest like music you hear in a nordstroms store at the mallthe theme is sung by sea wench celene dion another disaster for the film the script sounds like a dreary english paper using vocabulary words i learned in seventh grade at least it is when the two lovebirds arent screaming jack jack or rose the star goes to scenery and it stays that way,sad
the movie in question revolves around the infamous shipwreck of 1912 where more than 1500 people lost their lives when the commuting leviathan sunk on its maiden voyage to the states the movie made it big globally had a great box office run and also managed to win a record of academy awards the question however is  was this movie really that good in my opinion while not intrinsically bad is an overrated cinematic venture for a disaster movie it was too foppish and the treatment of a potentially rich subject matter not exemplary  there was a visible disconnect between the storyline and the intended tone of the movie mr cameron the director of the movie is known for his scifi ventures while the present movie required a far more realistic and even subdued treatment strangely the movie devoted more screen time to the on screen romance of the two lead characters than it actually did to the eponymous vessel which diverted attention from the focal event the shipwreck the director could have downplayed the romantic angle and instead given the audience a few moments of pensive repose to digest the enormity of the tragedy being depicted cinematizing real life tragedy is never easy and requires a careful treatment of subject matter though undoubtedly a visual stunner replete with amazing special effects something the director excels in the movie somehow could not achieve the same penetration when it came to dramatization suffered from sufficient thematic and directorial inadequacies to warrant only moderate adulation and not the inordinate ovation it surprisingly received,sad
its interesting to see the extreme opinions pro or con expressed here about ranging from those who feel its the greatest story ever told to those who feel its the worst travesty ever produced in hollywood i dont agree with either  i feel that is a somewhat runofthemill movie that wasnt worthy of the vast amount of hype it generated but can still provide an evenings entertainment albeit with some employment of the fast forward button i can supplement my review with contemporary impressions from first seeing the movie in 1998 taken from an email cum movie review written to a friend of mine in a distant corner of the world who hadnt seen the movie yet extracts from this email are in quotesfirst the good stuff i loved the efforts that cameron made either through sets or through cgi to reproduce the look of the rms as well as reenacting the sinkingverdict on the staging of the ships interiors and exteriors are stunningly realistic  damn near perfect is more like it obviously a great deal of effort was made to get things down pat it was also very interesting to see the underwater film that cameron really shot on the wreck of the  much better than the film shot for the imax documentarya this underwater film the interiors and the digital depictions of the underway are enough to make the film worth watching all by itselfregrettably with the good comes the bad ive always felt that the biggest strike against the movie is the clich love story between the two starcrossed loversunfortunately a good chunk of the film is the socalled love story this portion of the story starring this years pretty boy is hollywood clich from start to finish poor little rich girl meets poor but honest travelersartist aboard the shes travelling in 1st class with her beastly fiance and assorted evil stuck up snobbish rich capitalistoligarch pigs hes travelling 3rd class with the salt of the earth immigrants think for a few minutes and write up a list of 10 hollywood clichs that come to mind i guarantee that 75 of them are in the filmthe real story of the and its passengers is story enough in my opinion  the love story wasnt needed i assume that it was added to add some uncertainty to the story hollywood should have learned from apollo 13 that just because the audience knows the end of the story doesnt mean you cant make a good movie of it in any case the love story adheres so much to clich that it can be mapped out with uncanny accuracy after  five minutes anywaythe only thing i would retract from my 1998 email is the comment about dicaprio being this years pretty boy  ive subsequently seen some of his other work and i think that he can be a decent actor i actually own on dvd purchased cheap and i watch it occasionally but i do so with ample use of the fast forward button ive sometimes wondered what someone could do with a phantom edit of  could they edit jack and rose out of the film almost entirely and just leave a decent semidocumentary account of the sinking,sad
i may not make myself popular with this statement but i hate one reason is that it is far too long for a hollywood movie it spends most of its time waffling on and on and on i went to see it in the cinema when it released it 97 it didnt impress me then it doesnt impress me now i have liked james camerons previous work like terminator and true lies but he has really disappointed this time aroundnow onto the good points the last scene was so moving and the song my heart will go on is one of my favourites leonardo di caprio and kate winslet were very good in their roles i feel that it should have been made like a documentary rather than a standard 90s disaster movie on the other hand there are millions of fans and i have been known to have unusual tastes in movies go and see it and decide for yourself,sad
lets get one thing straight before we embark on this perilous journey into hollywood history the only truth in this movie is that the rms did sink in april 1912 and that leonardo dicaprio is prettier than kate winslet everything else in james camerons is marshmallow fancymovie opens in the modern atlantic with a salvage crew helmed by amiable brock lovett sunweathered bill paxton who haul surfaceward some intriguing artifacts 84yearold rose gloria stuart claims she was a passenger so is brought aboard lovetts vessel to provide informationin a cheeky foreshadowing of the breathhammering visuals to come lovetts crewmate outlines death throes aided by computer graphics probably the selfsame graphics that the actual movie used as storyboard for its final visuals before lovett asks rose for a firsthand account of the rms and she in a rheumy percodan haze starts relating a chick flick with leonardo dicaprio and kate winsletand under the chick flick the films main premise  a story of white pride sauted in eleven million gallons of seawaterroses narration is the anomaly that eats at this films verisimilitude though we humor her spinning her tale of irrelevant romantic rhetoric when it comes to events outside her sphere of experience such as private meetings between the captain and crew she relates them as if omniscient if we are to regard all the films action aboard as her testimony even the iceberg impact is comprehensively covered from all angles from the lookouts to the bridge to the engine room captain and crowd by roses flashback not bad for someone who was backseat bonking her bodyshaved boyman at the timerose laments that she doesnt even have a picture of jack her steerageclass lover leonardo dicaprio maybe thats why she remembers him as so staggeringly beautifulits a pity that writerdirector cameron leaned so heavily on the vapid love story as this movies propeller as the rest of the film is a chestclenching stunnerthe grandeur of the royal mail ship is beautifully captured in its restored filmic incarnation costuming characters and exterior shots are paid the utmost detail  although it must be said that historically at least dicaprios character jack was probably treading a time period more acquainted with the use of recreational drugs with his yells of woooo from the ships prow his friend fabrizio danny nucci didnt help with the authenticity supplied by a casting agency specializing in ethnic stereotypes nucci is about as italian as a dominos pizza sporting the absolute worst movie italian accent of all time  the exact same accent my friends and i would adopt in the schoolyard when we were pretending to be italian winning their tickets in a card game jack and fabrizio are overjoyed even in their steerage

cheesy usually scores low  but cameron gained his points purely due to his magnificent boattippingthe climax of is a startling visualization of an historic event which no one alive on earth today saw first hand drawing from the latest forensic knowledge combined with the physics of the process cameron places us directly on deck during his nightmare vision we see the situation mount from berg impact and apathy to incredulity and ultimately panic capturing the violent and colossal majesty of the ship breaking in half and pulling its aft section downwards verticallythe death throes of the rms are astounding in their realism we cannot help but compare the final scenes of a night to remember with its wholly inaccurate romantic portrayal of the doomed passengers aboard that blackandwhite singing nobly together as their ship slipped away under them at a 45 degree angle not only is collective humanity never that levelheaded the physics of the sinking process was entirely ignoredwith humanity onboard camerons boat ignobly screaming and selfishly grasping and punching and shooting and falling violently onto propeller blades with smokestacks crushing passengers decks splintering

i dont see what all the hype is about this movie  i think its rather pointless that they spent so much time and effort to recreate the ship itself make it as real as possible and then create some stupid fictional love story to go along with iti mean the boat sank  it takes 3 and a half hours to tell that story come on get serious  ive got better things to do  like rinse out my eyes with paint thinnerever wonder why made so much money  four words thirteen year old girls  thats all  who else is shallow enough to see this movie more than once  my little sister in fact saw it eight times eight  thats almost 26 hours wasted watching that pansy dicaprio whine about lovedo you realize that at 1000 a ticket 183530000 tickets were sold each ticket wasting 325 hours of the viewers lives 596472500 hours have been wasted on this show and that if each person lived an average of 70 years 69811 years or 997 lives have been wasted watching the james cameron has effectively murdered 997 people  i say we lynch him,sad
i had few problems with this film and i have heard a lot of criticisms saying it is overlong and overrated true it is over three hours long but i was amazed that it goes by so quickly i dont think it is overrated at all i think the imdb rating is perfectly decent the film looks sumptuous with gorgeous costumes and excellent effects and the direction from james cameron rarely slips from focus leonardo dicaprio gives one of his best performances as jack and kate winslet is lovely as rose david warner a great actor steals every scene hes in the story is very rich in detail and is hot on character development obvious with the love story which is very moving when it needs to be though in the first bit of the movie it is a little slow the last hour is extremely riveting and i will confess that i was on the edge of my seat when the sank i will also say that the last five minutes were very moving the music score by james horner was lovely though i never was a huge fan of the song my heart will go on the 1996 miniseries was good but suffered from undeveloped scenarios and some historical inaccuracies overall i give an 8510 bethany cox,sad
this  comment may contain spoilersor it may notat least it may spoil your appetite for this filmi have to give james cameron credit for a sort of devious ingenuity he created a movie so repulsively bad that a reasonably sophisticated viewer would find it unbearable to sit through hence so many glowing reviewsi watched it once but it keeps popping up on tv and even for free it is not worth watching five minutes these days is my absolute limit each time i stumble across it this movie just seems to get worse and worse the acting is so bad im surprised cameron didnt just make this into a sort of disney cartoon disneys buena vista does this sort of simplistic bubble gum movie better such as white fang ethan hawke as jack conroy was more credible than dicaprio as dawson and the aerial computer graphics look way too much like cartoon animationas to historical accuracy give me a break i cant say this is any worse than the other nonsense to come out of hollywood though frankly anyone who takes any socalled nonfiction or historical movies as more than 1 percent accurate is a foolhey i am willing to suspend a certain amount of disbelief for a good movie but this one demands way too much they pull a drawing that has been sitting on the bottom of the atlantic ocean for 80 years that is in excellent condition and hold it up as proof of why it was worth hundreds of millions of dollars to find the and what is this precious work of art a rembrandt a davinci a van gogh at least no it is an amateurish pornographic sketch excuse me maybe some 21st century girl would pose naked at the drop of a hat but a proper girl in the 1910shey if you believe this nonsense then the rest of the movie will seem comparatively plausible and i can see how you might find this movie historically accurate i dont mind if you enjoyed this movie thats what movies are for tastes vary some people prefer emotional manipulation that is more subtle i would hope you fans would explore cinema a little more and not insist that this is the greatest movie ever made perfect etc whats with all these superlatives does cameron have a claquelook before you say is the best movie ever which implies you have seen every movie every made at least go see gone with the wind i dare you then see if you can even mention in the same breathand i think potential viewers should be forewarned that not everybody is going to like this movie thats what reviews are for spoiler ahead ok the ship was named and it sank that much they got right well sort of it was the rms not the ssif you want to learn the true story try going to the bbc page sinking the myths by paul loudenbrown,sad
sure was a good movie the first time you see it but you really should see it a second time and your opinion of the film will definetly change the first time you see the movie you see the underlying lovestory and think ooh how romantic the second time and i am not the only one to think this it is just annoying and you just sit there watching the movie thinking when is this dn ship going to sink and even this is not as impressive when you see it several times the acting in this film is not bad but definetly not great either was i glad dicaprio did not win an oscar for that film i mean who does he think he is anthony hopkins or denzel washington he does 1 halfgood movie and wont do a film for less than 20 million and then everyone is suprised that there are hardly any films with him in it but enough about in my eyes the worst character of the film kate winslets performance on the other hand was wonderful i also tink that the director is very talented to put a film of such a magnitude together there is one lesson to be learned about this movie there are too many lovestories as it is filmmakers shouldnt try to add a crummy romance in to every single movie out of a possible 100 i give this film a mere 71,sad
perhaps this was a good movie as so many seem to think i would tend to disagree james cameron for whatever good qualities he may have is not an oscarcaliber director the script was shoddy proper girl runs away from her betrothed and gets dirty with a street urchin street urchin is properly glorified and the betrothed vilified and the acting was subpar the only character i actually liked was the ships designer that leaves this movie with what every other james cameron flick has special effects unfortunately theyre not great enough to redeem the three hours plus this movie takes to endure  i was looking at my watch more than the screen when i first saw it and id point anyone who wants to see this movie to films that deserved an oscar but didnt receive one due to the academys buying the hype,sad
the movie is a total perfectionwhen it appeared back in 1997 and i watched for the first time it leaved an influence on me what no other movie had maybe the lord of the rings maybe not  that movie is another greatness of the filmmakingcoming back too with the record 1835300000 worldwide box office that is still no1 after 11 years is amazingly greati cannot understand the users of imdb because this movie is not in the top 250 movies  that is shame this movie it is at least in the top 5 greatest movies ever not too mention in the top 250 a movie at least 89 out of 10 imdb users wake up and see the movie again because you seen something else i cannot find another top with movies somewhere else where is not includedthe movies prior theme beside the ships history is the greatest human feeling love what is universal and timelessthe picture presents us the meaning of true love our main characters jack the poor artist and rose the rich girl from the first class made us all cry even if we willing too recognize or notinn all lines the movie makes us think if we can go further after loosing the the most precious person in our lifewell we can go on because life must goo on but it will remain in our hearts forever with no doubt this is the best movie directed by james cameron among his other great achievements james horners soundtrack is simply beautiful and completely matches with the movie there is no surprise that his soundtrack album has been sold with 30 million copysthe movie is the greatest achievement in cinema it is the top of the pyramid,sad
this may contain spoilers ok just a little bit of background to this review firstly yes i was one of that 001 who did not see this movie at the cinemas when it came out secondly when i did see it for the first time on tv last year i missed the first 45 minutes however i saw enough of this movie to see how ridiculously overrated it was firstly the positives and there werent a whole lot number one yes the special effects were as good as they were supposed to be the design of the was amazing also the bit at the end where the ship sinks was incredible number two kate winslet has a nice body and you do get to see a lot more of it than i thought you would although one could be a bit cynical about that scene that they only put it in to get more people to watch it thats about it for the positives now for the negatives leonardo di caprio cant really act ok i thought he did well in romeo and juliet which is one of my favorite movies but his acting and dialog are just really wooden in the characters as a whole are just onedimensional one of the most laughable points was though how many lifeordeath situations there are for leo and kate in the last hour yes the movie takes forever to finish first leonardo gets locked down below deck as the water level slowly rises ooh will he survive and of course gets rescued by kate winslet after about 15 minutes then kates evil fiance yes not much room for development in that character starts shooting at them so they have to run back 5 levels deep before deciding to go back on top here they face a literal class barrier big metaphor there of course a big iron gate which with help from the other battling workers leonardo bravely breaks down forgive my sarcasm but it was hard not to roll my eyes throughout this whole sequence then after narrowly surviving half a dozen neardeath experiences leonardo dies in the lamest way possible instead of attempting to find another piece of debris to float on in the water he rather unnecessarily lets winslet have the whole piece of wood to float on and lets himself freeze to death but perhaps the worst part of all was the sequences where we go back to the old 101year old version of kate winslet telling the story with a bunch of young scientists passing social commentary on it ive always hated this idea because it gives away the ending of the film the viewer knows that she will survive and leonardo wont which sort of takes away from any of the suspense anyhow i would recommend this movie to anyone not that you havent seen it already but go in with a low expectation and you might find it a decent film certainly dont watch it though expecting to see a film that deserved 11 oscars cos you will be disappointed,sad
simply put is one of the most overrated movies of all time in terms of how much money it made how many people seem to like it and how many awards it won while the performances from dicaprio playing jack winslet playing rose and other supporting roles like the ship captain are solid the film on a whole just isnt to sum up the film in one word would be boring or generic doest become the disaster movie until the very end up until that its an extremely generic poorboymeetsrichgirl love story something thats been done a billion times before the film is also filled with completely two dimensional characters which i guess i supposed to reflect the times with the segregation between the rich and the poor even so the characters such as the one played by billy zane as roses rich husband to be are just lazily written with no character other than imrichandihatethepoortofftoff the film overall is just a bore and gets only mildly interesting when the boat actually starts sinking absolutely nothing special about this film whatsoever one of the most overrated movies of all time,sad
first let me say that the recreation of the rms as a computer generated entity is extremely well realised if ever we needed proof that cgi can add an extra dimension to established technique and effects when its done with meticulous precision  here it isbut what about story the contained over 1500 human stories most of them were to end in terror on that fatal freezing nighthowever mr cameron decided that non of these were worth spit they would serve simply as a desperate backdrop for two imaginary characters who might just as easily have been computergenerated themselves so artificial clichd and crass were their presentationstarcrossed young lovers projected against conflicting circumstances of the larger world have been a staple in human drama for as long as we have kept records perhaps the most famous example is shakespeares romeo  julietwhat have we got here disaffected society girl meets and finds redemption in gallant workingclass hero pass me the vomitarium someone she already has a beau and hes as knavish as can be in an early silent movie you can see him with a big bristly moustache and cruel leer tying his victim to a railroad track hes not going to be put down by a workingclass oik hell resort to murder if needs be cameron turns this mack sennett clich on its head by casting the heroine as saviour we see her wading waistdeep in the icy atlantic waters without flinching from the cold just you try it in earnest search for her manacled hero love isnt just blind  its numbbut  hey wait a minute this is a romantic story from the old school we cant let emancipation stand in the way of a damp hankie the heros got to do what a heros got to do isnt that what males are bred for after all i mean equality in pay is one thing but equality in death i dont think so ohno the male is always the more expendable so in the end we see him slowly freezing to death in the ocean whilst the heroine survives on a piece of flotsam his duty done his grip is relinquished and he slips down to eternity whilst she gets to live another day and find a more durable schmuck you can see that same scenario at the end of equally laughable starship troopers 2 yep the hats that oldand she might have to move pretty damn quick too that passionate little dalliance in the coach could well have put a bun in the oven it wouldnt do to have a child out of wedlock in 1912romance in the face of disaster became quite a fashion at this time with other movies like pearl habour playing much the same card as i say young romantic tragedy is a longstanding cultural staple in human storytelling it just isnt usually so extremely crass and predictable astissues out or vomitarium at the ready depending upon your gullibility quotient,sad
i wasted 3 hours of my life watching this pap and i want them back bad acting too a bad script with a bad soundtrack smeared on top why the money they spent making this pooh could have been better spent ending world hungerpoverty which it probably would have done 3x over so why why why bottom line piece of sht this movie is a piece of shtone day i had a crap and it was ultimately more enjoyable than this utter excrement it also sunk like a ship hitting an icebergalso kermit the frog would have been better cast in the role leanardo de crapreeeooo played and ms piggy could just as well have played the part kate winslet portrayed,sad
i have never seen a more overrated film  the special effects were very good and the nonfiction part of the movie was all solid but the rest of the story was so contrived  the lead acting was pitiful and not credible in the least  i dont understand how anybody would ever want to sit through the full three hours of this movie more than once,sad
its bitterly ironic that the biggest blockbuster of all time is not on the imdbs top 250 even stranger still many who loved it at the time of its release have now turned on it just ask anyone under the age of 25 this is not due to its quality but to its hype it goes without saying that a film this big had immense publicity at the time of its release but what no one learned until too late is that there is too much of a good thing people began to tire of hearing about what the stars especially the new heartthrob leonardo dicaprio were doing and they were sick of hearing gossip magazines never shutting up about the film had the odds against it its a romance and that is one of the most volatile genres in terms of popularity by the time the spoofs of the films most famous scenes came along reputation was already in danger after that people began only to see the spoofs and now the films popularity has sunk to where the real ship isi had fond memories of the film from when it was popular so i decided to perform an experiment even after the immense backlash the film suffered could it still hold up the answer is a resounding yesopens when a treasure hunter brock lovett bill paxton finds a drawing of a woman wearing the diamond that he is looking for soon after releasing his findings an elderly woman gloria stuart claims that its her in the picture so lovett flies her out to his ship to tell her the story behind the diamondas a young woman she was sailing to america to live the life of a boring society lady in a loveless marriage planning on ending it all she is about to jump ship when she is saved by a young man from steerage thus begins a classic love story that is doomed from the start by complications other than those they began withthe reason the film is so good is because the two central characters are brilliantly written and acted leonardo dicaprio became an instant heartthrob to girls around the world something he apparently hated and its not hard to see why dicaprio has everything to make the male lead of an epic romance work hes goodlooking and talented winslet was honored with an oscar nomination for her performance although its hard to understand why dicaprio was left out because he equals her jack dawson is an immensely likable guy he falls hard for rose someone who he knows is clearly out of his league but hes so immensely likable that we want him to win roses heart his new lover rose is no ordinary society girl much as she tries she cant stand the rigidly controlled life shes going to lead and jack is her escape but while she may wear a corset shes no damsel in distress shes independent and tough the romance works because jack and rose are meant for each othertheir supporting cast is excellent the two most important supporting characters are roses fiance cal hockley and her mother ruth frances fisher cal hockley is a vicious snob with a constant sneer on his face he comes from a wealthy family and will do anything to get what he wants he demands obedience from rose something she will not give to anyone much less cal her mother ruth is just as snobbish and cruel but shes also desperate their family was left virtually penniless and shes trying to save face as cruel and despicable as they are neither one becomes a caricature zane and fisher should have dually been honored with awards for their acting bates is especially noteworthy as the delightfully brash new money molly brownwas the most expensive film of the 20th century and its clear that every penny was put to good use epic doesnt begin to describe this movie its huge in spectacle and the sinking of the ship which takes up the last half hour is jawdropping but thats not the only place where the effects were used we never get a sense that were looking at sets or cgi from every frame of the ship we believe that we are on the ship with the characters interesting note cameron actually went down to the wreckage and filmed footage there but that doesnt stop there cameron wrote a script that allows us to view every part of the ship and in a way thats plausiblejames cameron has long been considered a god of action movies but this is the first time his skills were honored not only is cameron a wizard with special effects he is also a master storyteller is a long film as all epics are but not one of the 3 hours of footage is wasted the film moves and there is never a dull spot he knows the speed at which a person gets involved in the story and uses this to his advantage but the biggest accomplishment is that he makes the romance one of the most difficult genres to dabble in work with immense effectiveness the romance burns up the screen so much that were more concerned with jack and roses fates than we are taking in the sight of the sinking ship and the scene where jack draws roses picture is potently erotic especially for a pg13 movie which shows not real nudity or sex but it is strongly impliedi realize that i am not writing this to people who havent seen the movie are there such people i am writing it to those who are now convinced that this is a sappy and painfully bad film i assure you its as good as it was the first time you saw it,sad
first what baffles me about the film before i have even reviewed it was the mpaa rating pg13 this film no this crap does not deserve to be rated that there will be blood was rated r for such little violence it parts of canada it was rated pg this film has much more violence than there will be blood and sex and nudity but due to it being a big blockbuster movie and the mpaa being terrible it received the rating of pg13 instead of r this film has visual effects that are decent and thats where the pros list ends the acting makes me want to cut out my live with a spoon and feed it to myself leonardo dicaprio didnt act at all in that movie kate winslet was passable but thats not saying much it was full of clichs that youd see in a crappy romantic comedy the dialogue is crap why it was even nominated for an academy award baffles me this film didnt even make the top 250 imdb films toy story 2 even made it on that list this film deserves to be wiped out like the mayan civilization only without any ruins for them to be remembered,sad
any human being who considers to be among the top 250 films of all time should be strapped to a chair in a small room and be forced to watch any tom cruise vehicle several hundred times  in pan scan formatlike so many awful best picture winners which came before it does a horrible injustice to its socalled intended heroes in this case by stereotyping them making them dispensiblethe most recent bp winner to have borrowed this technique is costners aberration dances with wolves which pretended to be about the plight of the native americans whose country we literally stole from them and turning it into a fable about how one white man rises above his equals to appreciate the former  see black robe little big man or soldier blue insteadthe politicallycorrect driving miss daisy suffers the same fate it should be about freemans character which is infinitely more interesting than tandysforrest gump is nearly as insulting by changing the book in such away as to take the worst of gumps traits and failings and foisting them on the robin wright penns jenny character leaving sweet forrest a saint and jenny a slut  pulp fiction also released in 1994 has already had a greater effect on filmmaking than gump ever willand thats not even tarantinos best filmdespicablewhile were at it lets add to this list of garbage which has recently won best picture mel gibsons lamentable braveheart which while sporting excellent largescale battle scenes is nearly entirely fictionalmore proof that hollywoods elite still like guys whove paid their dues in front of the cameragandhi  dont even get me started on that best costume design oscar let alone its bpthe trend may have begun in 1939 with the single most overrated flick of all time gone with the wind of course beating out at least seven better films made in the same yearniro,sad
i saw this movie in the theatres back in 1997 and remembered it as a brilliant movie the cinematic experience was one of the best of my life even though the story is tragic and very sad i recently watched this film with my 13 year old daughter the magic is still there this is still one of the best movies of all time and perhaps the greatest love story of all time the new blue ray release is fantastic and james horners score is still timeless great job james cameronfor producing a once in a lifetime film leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet were fantastic in this film and both deserved best actoractress awardsdont be afraid to bring this one back out people its still a beautiful epic that will stand the test of time,sad
pure glop wooden acting astonishingly unconvincing characters boring generic music descending to banality in the case of my heart will go on good sets and effects no surprise considering how much money was spent on them overall the cinematic equivalent of a big mac but even more tastelessthe first time i watched i lasted 20 minutes im going upstairs to read i told my wife call me when it starts to sink the sinking was lots of fun that and the effects are why i rate it a 2 instead of a 1 but not enough to counteract three hours of turgid sentimental ooze if the film had begun with the sinking scene it would rate a 10i did watch it again in its entirety and thats three and a quarter hours of my life that i will never get back,sad
was quite the phenomenon when it came out there is no movie that i can think of at least in my lifetime that became the cultural event that it did there were many concerns within the film community that the film was going to be a disaster james cameron had spent a long time finishing the film and it was the most costly film ever made many people thought it was bring an end to his career all these concerns and predictions were shattered when came out it became the highest grossing movie ever and it won more academy awards than any other movie it skyrocketed the careers of both kate winslet and leo dicaprio i went to the theaters to see it with family and friends it was an incredible experience and several people around me were crying there were very few movies i had ever seen before that had mesmerized me as much as this movie didi watched this movie in its entirety for the first time in years the reaction is much different now and the film seems much less impressive first of all the graphics in have not aged well when the ship is sinking the cgis look really fake and dated also the model ship they used doesnt look very good either it looks cheap and like it was made out of plastic this does not surprise me because most films do not age well a new generation of film lovers will not find certain films as impressive as the last generation putting that aside the story of is not that bad i think most people know what the story is about so i do not need to explain it the acting is slightly above average but the screenplay is so clichd and corny i can understand the acting did not need to be that impressive the last forty minutes of the film consists of the two main characters shouting jack jack jack jack rose rose rose rose they must love each other so much that they cant think of anything else to sayi dont think is destined to become a classic even though it made so much money and won so many awards i think most people now see the movie as an embarrassment now that i am older and wiser just seems like a mediocre film pretty disappointing considering how much the movie was loved when it first came out,sad
in the past 6 months i have looked back on this movie in retrospect and thought what a totally sick premise this film is based upon its a fictional tale of a true tragedy which trivialises the impact of the sinkingjames cameron has the sickest mind i have ever known of lets make a love story on one of the greatest disasters the world has ever heard about back in 1997 the movie execs must have been rubbing their hands together at the prospect of james cameron whose blockbusters have accrued masses of cash doing a romantic movie on a poignant slice of history however around 2500 people died on that ship yet we only really focus on jack and rose running around the ship of course this was camerons intention so as to show the ship in all its glory before it sankthe problem i have with the movie is that its the equivalent of making a movie about a love story in the twin towers a young business man in tower a falls in love with a young business woman in tower b the man goes to tower b gets the girl and runs around all the floors of the twin towers to show what the twin towers looked like before they collapsed then the planes hit the buildings and the story really kicks off you get the idea entertainment based on a reallife tragedy to me seems really sick it is a lot worse than programmes that the daily mail in britain kick up a stink aboutmorally wrong pictures like this should be banned rather than britains banning of the exorcist for 20 years especially as was crap,sad
this was arguably the most overhyped movie of all time some of the special effects were great but others looked extremely amateur indeed the dialogue was full of cliches and the plot was so predictable yeah i know we all knew the ship was going to sink but even the love story plot was like a barbara cartland novel kate winslet looked great but my only thoughts in the final scenes were that i wished leonardo dicaprios character would hurry up and die so the torture could end more quicklyblech,sad
thats it is next to house of 1000 corpses officially the worst movie ever made how is it possible to make a movie about a ship sinking and focus so little on the actual sinking of the ship jesus the only important thing seems to be the relationship between the extremely gay leonardo di caprio and the chubby kate winslet i mean come on there were other people there as well they actually died and didnt get to tell their socalled moving story to others a bit of focus on that would be niceonly women in the age 815 years old can seriously enjoy because of the rubbish acting the unfathomably bad story and the ridiculously dull ending however i havent actually seen because id rather be forced to watch a brick wall for a good two hours instead but these things ive said in this comment i can tell anyway and those of you who disagree with me only do because youre in love with di caprio fact,sad
in honor of the 100 year anniversary of the sinking of the the movie was rereleased in theaters digitally remastered and in 3d having seen the movie in theaters in 1998 when it came out and loving it ever since i was happy to go see it again in 2012 we owned the vhs when i was growing up so ive probably seen at least a dozen times theres nothing quite like seeing it in theaters though its a film of epic proportions in both budget and content and i think seeing it on the big screen does it incredible justice i thoroughly enjoyed seeing it there for the second timei think many people criticize for the cheesy love story jack and rose are the early 1900s version of romeo and juliet complete with a history that spans a mere few days clashing backgrounds and of course jacks death at the end of the movie they even have some corny dialogue here and there ex ill never let go jack ill never let go in spite of that however i thoroughly enjoy their story i feel that unlike romeo and juliet jack and roses attraction to each other is genuine she loves him because he pulls her out of her shell and shows her that there is more to life than money and social status he loves her because she takes a chance on him despite societal expectations and loves him for who he truly is i think its great call me a romantic but im a sucker for their story on a side note its so surreal to see leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet so young theyve certainly evolved as actors sincewhat james cameron and his crew were able to do with special effects construction and design in just floors me is just so horrifyingly authentic every scream every person crushed from a torrent of water every piece of the ship ripped apart just looked so real to me i think thats why i like it so much i dont get my kicks from seeing people suffer but there was something strangely beautiful in how that movie was shot and how the action of the ship sinking unfolds i really felt like i was there with all those people i really appreciated just how many different scenes there were they made it a point to address many different parts of the ship many different people and many different horrific ends so sad so beautiful i hope that makes some senseso now you know im a sucker for guilty as charged,sad
i have given this film 1 because for its time the specialeffects were truly excellent and also because the costumes were and still are breathtakingly beautiful i watched this film backtoback as a teenager out of adoration for leo and now i am an adult i went to watch it again in 3d expecting to be wowed like before oh dear themes of the film  rich people are evil all of them only poor people have feelings cheating on your fianc is fine and he is not allowed to have any kind of reaction to this if we dont both fit on this wardrobe door one of us will surely diebut lets only halfheartedly try once to fit us bothalso kate winslet is supposed to be 18 really come on now guyscome on,sad
apart from being one of the best movie ever produced it is also the second highest grossing movie of all time as well a movie does not make 18 billion dollars world wide with out being incredible brilliantis more than just a movie about a ship that sinks its a classic romance love story about a rich girl and a poor boy an unspoken love that could never truly be the rich girl who is trapped in her high class elegant lifestyle forced to marry a wealthy man who she does not love then by happenstance she runs into jack dawson and their love develops from therethe acting is magnificent the movie was very well written and no expense was spared in bring back to life everything looks as elegant as it would have on the real parts of the story may be a bit clich yet the movie is still very enjoyable,sad
this film is about a love triangle that happens on the the the ship of dreams is also known as the unsinkable rose leaves her rich fianc caledon hockley for this poor artist jack however the collides with an iceberg and sinks on april 15th 1912 at 220 in the morning surprisingly jack dies and rose survives eightyfour years later rose tells the story about her life on to her grand daughter and friends and explains the first sight of jackhow she fell in love and how they fought for survivalthe theme of the movie is that love is worth more than material things cameron uses real actors that some people believe is based on a true story written in 1912 the dialogue is appropriate for the time period located in the atlantic ocean this movie was actually based on some real occurrences the films soundtrack made the movie more enjoyable especially the song by celine dion my heart will go on,sad
there is no doubt that james cameron is capable of putting out fantastic cinema the man just seems to have a feel for what will pull on the emotions and his eye for scene setting has no equal some spoilers aheadi recently rewatched this on video on a small tv and it still blew me away action fans will of course be disappointed perhaps this even qualifies as a chickflick i dont know and dont care its just a great movie and never drags even at over three hoursive tried hard to find niggles to be impartial but the only things i can point to are a couple of instances where the special effects were bad at the beginning where the bow of the sunken looks exactly like what it isa model and later where jack and rose are on the the foredeck and the camera is looking back toward the superstructure where the scenery looks like the backdrop from a school play other than these the story and effects are fantastic and enhance the film rather than overpowering iti always cry at the end with the old ladys scenes of returning to the ship this is one of a very few movies that do make me cry for that reason it will always be a favourite,sad
well im not going to completely bash this movie for what its worth its decent entertainment moves along at a fairly good pace  impressive considering this is a three hour flick  and kate and leo were okay though both can do much better i expected worse knowing it had been horribly overhyped and that james cameron was evil one can argue about how evil also the sets and kates dresses were very pretty thats about it for the positives the story is shallow and full of holes most of the dialog is plain silly and the whole movie is basically spectacular kitsch i honestly think is probably one of the least deserving academy award winners ever  and in the same year as la confidential good will hunting and even the full monty unbelievable,sad
does not deserve all the praise and awards it has received the lovestory is simple the characters cliched and the screenplay has many oversightshowever it is impossible to deny the power of the film once the iceberg hits the detail in the reactions of different characters to their impending deaths how fate conspires against those who worked hardest to stay alive and the emotional impact of the thousands of deaths almost make up for a stupid opening hour and a halfthe last shot of the film a camera moving through the and into the dining room where all the ships dead victims have gathered is amazing,sad
the acting the plot the soundtrack etc everything is so great and finesse,sad
was such a wonderful movie it accurately portrayed how the ship sunk to begin with the storyline behind it all including the cast a film,sad
how could i not give this film a 1010 sure there is some corny dialogue and some romance that gets a bit too sentimental for my taste but that doesnt hold this film back from greatness its the best romance film ever made and will have you tearing up no doubt once the iceberg is hit the film goes to another level the already well established characters are thrown into this tragedy that had me glued to the screen camerons production is far ahead of its time and deserves all the praise that it gets the ending is also something that really makes me think about life and death as a philosophical thinker having a dreamlike state after death and seeing what you truly care aboutmeeting up with the ones you loveis heaven its such a beautiful ending and gives me chills everytime,sad
titanicthis movie will make you laugh cry and learn all in onesuch a beautiful love story one of the most legendary movies ever made and i love it so muchso acting is really amazing leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet are both so talented and they nailed their parts the plot is super good and i dont think this classic contains any negative things except jacks death and the fact that this movie is very sad but im still like this filmalso my familys members are so like this film,sad
i just watched again simply enjoyed and the good thing is the movie has lost none of its power over these five yearsleonardo dicaprio and kate winslet are my favorite and james cameron my all time favorite director,sad
on a purely technical level was considered at the time the crowning achievement of a filmmaker whos always strived to top his last cinematographic entry with the next up until that point and still to this day hes managed to do just that hes always made the most of the technological advantages at the time and always come up with a jawdropping mesmerizing visual spectacle even at times when budget constraints and uncooperative technical crew due in part for his apparent lack of experience and fresh off the boat from his first serious outing on the directorial chair for the terminator like it was the case in aliens hes always managed to deliver it sure does take him a long time to come up with the next one but everytime he does he hits the box offices bullseyethis time around and with one of the more simplistic storylines ever put to the big screen he brings us one of the most memorable and fondly remembered movies of the late 90sfrom the very first shot of the movie those sepia colorcorrected images that convey a haunting feeling of remembrance and loss to the first images of the research vessel subs exploring the entrails of the haunted ship we plunge right into what it must have felt like walking onto the deck of the and we go back to the plot as i said before using the simplest of plot devices a  on the other hand very well told love story with tinges of social clashing we are treated to a 3 hour eye  catching spectacle that moves along at a whiplike pace with very strong performances all throughout gorgeous cinematography and production design stateoftheart visual and practical effects and a perfect score by the great late james horner this is probably one of camerons best efforts behind the camera and a movie for the ages needless to say the strongest asset of the movie is its third and final act with the depiction of the sinking of the titular ship and the resulting mayhem that as always and with the character development groundwork previously laid out by cameron is the main reason to watch this movie and why the audience is so invested in whats happening onscreen as i said great movie and largerthanlife characters to go with it,sad
i watched this movie and i fell inlove with jack leonardo dicaprio and rose jane winslet with their outstanding act its the most heartbreaking movie i have ever watched my entire life and until now i cant move onits like watching a love story and turns into tragedy imagine that how hurtful it is if you were at the and seeing your love dies it is so painful but still worth to watch especially if you like sad endings this is what youve been looking for,sad
of course i know the ending of everybody knows the ending then why oh why did this movie glue me to my seat for 3 hours  in the year 2018 its absolutely thrilling my rewatch was a complete surprise fantastic action great directing even the visuals didnt age as ugly as they could have and the acting performances i remember everyone being very sceptic about leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet back in the nineties but why i dont get it also what a joy to see bernard hill again since i had a lotrrewatch soon before noone can look as doomed as he can be it in the battle of helms deep or on the sinkingbut maybe its the time thats changed they dont make movies like that anymore because they cant if they try something like avatar comes out something predictable a clich maybe the time of the great hollywood blockbuster is just over thank god we can always rewatch,sad
i absolutely like this movie it is the best romantic drama fantastic direct gripping music very good actors beautiful story great combination that predestines good results the film stars kate winslet rose dewitt bukater and leonardo dicaprio jack dawsonthe story is about young lover were so different world rose is very rich girl she is engagement with rich man caledon hockley rose is unhappy she must leave to new york to she could get married in nyc they travel in upperclass with her mother ruth jack and his friend fabrizio win thirdclass tickets to the ship in a game rose want kill herself jack poore boy and painter save her before jump from ship lovers met and love story startedthis story always inspiring me and i often thinking about this film this story about lifes a thousand people about ship of dreammy opinion is that life is too short and we must enjoy every moment with people that we loved is about thisyou will certainly give me the truth when i write that is very movingfor the end a womans heart is a deep ocean of secrets,sad
its no wonder this was so seismically successful it really has something for everyone a sweet tragic love story action and suspense and for history buffs a meticulous reenactment of the most infamous sea disaster of all time really a stunning achievement,sad
while i admit that the effects were good and the costumes worked  the film as a whole was awful kate winslett was horribly miscast and there was no chemistry between her character and dicaprios jack the script was dire and the baddies were just missing their twirly moustaches it was difficult to care about what happened to anyone at any point during the interminable denouement it seemed to me that like many other cameron movies the bottom line was the profit to be made from the extreme overhyping of the whole thing avatar was only just better which is not to say it was any good either definitely the law of diminishing returns was played out here i think it halted leos career in its tracks given the heartthrob title attributed to him conversely and inexplicably it boosted kates career beyond any explanation,sad
this film really does smell of cheese before i describe the overpowering smell of cheese i must point out a few things first i watched it for the first time in 2006 but maybe that only let the cheese mature secondly i watched it in russia which subsequently meant that it was dubbed but before i am attacked by fans for bothering to write an opinion about it even though i saw a dubbed version of it which obviously spoils any movie good or bad i have to say this time i was glad that a film was dubbed i understood the translation and was glad to be spared hearing the ridiculous script from the actors which could of made it unbearable but the dubbing at least made it comicalit is a typical love story that could be used in any film situation but this time it exploited the tragedy i am not knocking any romance films or anything and appreciate that it is an extremely popular genre but is came across as so basic and predictable i wished it was in the hands of david lynch or ken russell to liven things up a littlethe sinking of the ship was the best bit and kind of exciting too but with that amount of money you could probably make a film about pulling the bath plug out your bath and make it look epic however even the actual sinking dieing and drowning had the sugar coated hollywood feel which came across in casting and acting too but i wont even go there back to the cheese factor the icing on the cake sorry was the sound track celine dion whatever you do and however you do it you just stinkto rate this movie i will give it three out of ten why firstly because dicaprio dies nice touch though i do acknowledge that he is a good actor most of the time its just the films character secondly because kate winslet is so fine with or without her clothes on if fact her outfits though out the film are excellent third point goes to the absurd amount of money spent on the sinking bit which subsequently made me think for the first time about how truly horrific it must of actually been in real life which was considerably worse than what we see in this easy to watch catastrophe however we have to go minus a point because of the truly pathetic modern day tear jerker grandma spills her heart out bits boo hoo,sad
i loved the story but felt that leo de caprio was miss cast he was too young looking to play the part and kate winslet was too mature looking to fall for him after all we all knew the ending but there was no real sexual chemistry between the pair no bite and it showed in the film it was a script that any actor could have done because the history of the tragedy sold the film not who appeared in it i personally would have chose colin firth to play the male lead part dont get me wrong caprio was brilliant in the mask beach but he did not suite the the special effects were brilliant and educational for history purposes you cant go wrong because the scene where he draws her naked made you squirm had he seemed too young to be there,sad
too bad about the cheesy special effects at least the storyline and acting were good i firmly believe this film winning best film is the most unjust occurrence at the academy awards along with citizen kane not winning best picture and marlon brando for best actor in a streetcar named desire the screenplay and the acting are the most important aspects of any film and since was deficient in both areas it should not have received the honour of best film granted the special effects are wonderous and should be honoured but as a whole the film was not a masterpiece it did not inspire and they took far too long to die there were far better films in 1997 due to their superior screenplay and acting talent but they were snubbed because of this it really makes one question the credibility of the academy,sad
i admit i enjoyed this film  the grandeur of it all was impressive  the fact that james cameron let this film get to a 200 million dollar budget is also very impressive  however once the grandeur is taken away there really isnt much left  the plot is a simple romance  and since the story is so predictable it puts some heavy pressure on a three hour film  the direction is superb  my distaste for this film doesnt extend to james camerons technical direction  his technical direction is on par with spielbergs  however his humanemotional part of that mix doesnt rate very well  the acting also is not consistent  i didnt find dicaprios performance bad but his character seemed to be very easy to play and wasnt that complicated  winslet whos performance in heavenly creatures stunned me is mainly okay here  the best performances belonged to gloria stuart and kathy bates  the score also rates with the best and the soundtrack is one i highly recommend  in the end i think this film is more comparable to cleopatra than to gone with wind  the budget and the problems making the film end up being more interesting and more entertaining than the film itself  did this film deserve best picture no  but its nomination was also like cleopatras nomination  the big budget and the absolute vastness of the film was enough,sad
people talked a lot about this movie before after and during the time of production one thing i was sure about when the pieces fall in its place that this movie is made to be a cash machine and not a masterpiece everyone knows the story the old well known one nothing wrong with old known stories but the combination with other common regular boring side stories make the whole thing unbearable at last i went to see it at the university philm club theater it started bad and it became worst more than three hour of suffering and i dont talk about the suffer of passenger of i am talking about my own and the other people with me sitting there watching this nonsense the last hour almost killed me i put my head between my legs and raised my head to see whats going on every other minute i didnt miss anything the story went on very slow slow slow  its looked like the producer and the other guys there realized that the have spent a lot of money so they made the movie an hour longer anyway i was lucky to see it in a theater with a break in the middle of the movie and i am happy that i didnt pay to see it,sad
 rating   out of 5 i fear im about to make myself highly unpopular with what follows but i can only call em as i see em besides being highly unpopular is such familiar territory for me and it just wouldnt be the same without the constant slings and pointed arrowsfrom writerdirector james im king of the world cameron comes this 200 million dollar purported epic that in my view only ever reaches the status of cubic zirconiabut never fear hollywood will incestuously look after its own because any movie that costs the amount that could pull a third world south american country out of insolvency and destitution is guaranteed to win eleven academy awards  oscars for categories like the most times actors say no this way  the most soggy extras and the best motion picture where the male lead is snubbed for a nominationthis unfortunate male lead is none other than leonardo di caprio who possesses all the rugged goodlooks of a fourteen year old pimplecream model but its not all bad news for leo because he has perfected the art of being a pipsqueak while painting chubby actresses in the nude  poor old kate winslets dress was so tight around the torso that the hunky leo had to use solvent to get it offrose dewitt kate winslet is engaged to the jerk millionaire cal hockley billy zane cal gives her a priceless necklace that has some significance later on as a wrinkly rose tells the story which is seen in flashbackanyway rose meets jack leonardo di caprio as she attempts suicide and the couple are instantly attracted in roses case as much as someone who is attempting suicide can be the pair eventually fall in love the ship hits an iceberg the ship sinks the ship becomes famous and we are subjected to this hideously expensive selfimportant and timeconsuming movie i had to pause halfway through to bake some muffins as not to suffer the effects of malnutritionhowever i did give this movie two stars and that was for the special effects to be fair they were pretty good as a mass of brave stuntpersonnel tumbled into the icy water i did get the sense of what the chaos and hysteria must have been like on that fateful night in 1912  reminiscent of lunchtime crowds around the allyoucaneat desert bar at sizzlerin a nutshell this film is a love story between jack and rose that never rises above soapopera melodramatics after an hour and a half of this kissy kissy nonsense i found myself participating in open prayer thanking the almighty for his very timely icebergwhat possibly could warrant so much money and effort certainly not a piece of hollywood trivia that tells us nothing about the that we didnt already knowif ive missed the point then to all of you devotees i sincerely apologize but if im right then you have all been the victims of hollywood and its intricate network of propaganda,sad
you know those films where you just leave your brain at the lobby and come back for it when the movie is finished realizing you didnt have a good time without it like armageddonwell this is one of those brainfree experiences however this is really enjoyable brain candy ok so the script could have been better written by a writer from sunset beach but you have to commend this film for its good points kate winslets performance the historical detail the sheer enjoyability of it alltrue the script seems to be the source of all the problems dicaprio is a fine actor but unfortunately his character hasnt been written well enough for him to give a performance with any true depth this also makes the love story seem a little weak and in the end unmovingnevertheless this is one of the most enjoyable mainstream movies of last year and definetly worth 750 of your money or if youre british 4810,sad
i went to see the film not knowing what to expect im not a fan of romantic films but everyone had been recommending the film so i went and i have to say it is amazing an emotional mix of watching while knowing as jack and rose get increasingly closer you know the fate that awaits and it starts you thinking of ways they could have avoided it its one of those films that remains close to your heart foreverexcellent acting from the whole cast especially dicaprio and winslet some scenes which come to mind include the dining room scene rose communicates to jack on a level that the other actors dont even sense a sentence which is echoed on page 95 of james camerons it is a film that will have you hooked and on the edge of your seats the length helps you to really get to know the charecters and connect with them and i hate to admit it but this film has turned me into an addicti had never heard of james cameron as much as i do now and id just like to say good job,sad
the tragedy here was the fact that they took what could have been a great filmstory and turned it into a typical piece of hollywood crud  seriously the acting totally sucked  the screenplay was trite and boring  the contrived scenes with the old rose not to mention with all the other characters were so sad this piece of garbage could only come from small minds that merely used a bunch of special effects to mask the poorly written script  sad sad sad  i know that im certainly not in the majority on this one obviously by the actual take on boxoffice and video rentalsales but i know that i can tell good acting from affected contrived crud  and this certainly was full of the latter  best picture  honestly the academy bowed to box office sales and certainly not to their consciences on rewarding quality film making or acting sad sad sad,sad
no way this novie can not be in the top 100 much less the top 250 and with over 10 casting a 1 one for this novie i smell a fat rat that smells real bad who the hell stacked this deck or just the normal follow the leader mentality this is like watching high school kids decide whos cool and who isnt and once one dummy says it not cool then everyone else is afraid to go against them well best movie ever it may not be but off the top 250 list is a joke and if you doubt it find one other 70 ranked movie with 102 casting a one vote you can look all day it doesnt exist imdb should so some checking and find out who pulled this bs offthen ban them all for life,sad
extraordinary love story and very touching heart its one of the best films ive ever watched i dont know how to explain my feelings oh god this film makes me shed tears even now when i watch this film again it cant be felt not to shed tears it is rare for me to feel this kind of feeling that is even difficult to express i have never been bored to watch it repeatedly and even the power of the film hasnt diminished in the slightest even though this movie has been released for quite a long time maybe there are only a few films in this world that make the audience take part in feeling the story in this filmwhen i first watched this movie i cried and didnt know what to say i thought it was an amazing film with a storyline that couldnt be guessed and there were not only sad parts but also parts that could make laughter so that this film not flat and not boring until now it was the best film in my life no single film could match itthis film for me there are many grooves so we have to really pay attention from the beginning so that no part is missed so we will feel the intention to convey this film i think this film has been very perfectly made with technological sophistication which at that time was very extraordinary i think this character by leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet is extraordinary they are like being able to be interconnected and truly like love stories in the real world young couples who face complicated love stories in the middle of a different background full of struggles and challenges that must be faced but with the power of love all can be passedi think this will be the best film of all time that will never be forgotten,sad
what a wonderful film james cameron done a brilliant job bring this historical event to life everything was perfect the timing of the film the effects  the cast cant fault cameron you couldnt of asked for any better actors actress to fill the main two roles leo and kate have some much chemistry on film and you can feel the love and heartbreak between them outstanding acting the fact this film is based on true even gives you that extra edge that you wanna see the film makes you feel the pain that actually happened the number of awards says it all for this film one of only two films along with avatar to gross over 2billion incredible if anyone has not watched this film they are missing out it is purely just a cult film people off all ages love this film male or female too the thrills love heartbreak excitement will draw you in to the most amazing love and historical film to ever hit the big screen must watch film,sad
is a prescient portent of things to come a metaphor of human conceitwe are all passengers on the oblivious to our fate our planet a wreck most of us doomed to die on the iceberg of climate change exactly when and where disaster will strike no one knows for sure but somewhere an iceberg is lurking in the dark with our name on itthe most cruel part of our fate is we have a james cameronclass writer and director running the show the story is bogged down and going nowhere people are losing interest fast and falling asleep as the movie rollsthe ship we call hms planet earth is doomed but no one seems to care just like the audience in and like the there are not enough lifeboats a whole lotta people are gonna die when the clathrate gun goes off the good news is that there wont many icebergs left eventually,sad
when i was in university i remember seeing jurassic park and discussing it with a friend  i commented on the loose plot the silly dialogue and the fact that it was a poor adaptation of a fairly entertaining novel my friends comment was yeah but dude you got to watch dinosaurs  true enough and for that the film was well worth the cashis much the same  the plot is the same old stuff youve seen before  poor boy meets rich girl promised to rich boy rich girl falls for poor boy rich boy tries to get rid of both  think caddyshack on a boat the acting is ok given the silly dialogue and relentless attempts at tugging your heartstrings  heres the kicker you get to see the ship go down  in the comfort of your stadium seat or in your own home you get to see what looks like the actual sinking of an ocean liner  people screaming tonnes of water everywhere the best and worst of mankind in a tidy package for your viewing pleasure  its frickin cool is what it is  its some of the best eyecandy ever seen on film and thats saying a lotremember dicaprios wonderful performances in whats eating gilbert grape or the basketball diaries  yeah you wont see any of that inis less a movie than it is a rollercoaster  i liken it to pearl harbor or debbie does dallas where you get to see some mindblowing action sequences and the rest of the film is useless  rent the dvd so you can use chapterselect to replay the good stuff over and overnow you might be thinking im a mindless action freak but nothing is further from the truth  for those of you that heard is a wonderful and romantic flick i recommend watching it then renting crouching tiger hidden dragon or the english patient  both these films have better dialogue better acting and are much more romantic than can ever beoh yeah i almost forgot two good reasons to watch kate winslet gets topless,sad
as an epic it doesnt change even a little my perception of life as a love story ive seen better however i have to say  technically  and as entertainment  is great the special effects the replica of the ship and all other technical details are a feast for the eyes and it certainly entertains as it never lapses to boredom and although its over 3 hours long it doesnt really registeranyway id say it is quite worth the watch just dont expect it to change your life,sad
it isnt that this film is bad  it would be good if it didnt receive all the hype that it got  why in the world would it win best picture oscar that should have went to la confidential or as good as it gets  i do enjoy kathy bates in everything i see and kate winslet was all right  but james camerons cheap theatrics with a false love story aboard the doomed ship was just a way to sell tickets and adding dicraprio was just icing on the cake for him  if you like good movies rent boogie nights and if you like a movie rent a night to remember please,sad
as for my comments on  it didnt start to get good until the ship went down  i dont mean that in a bad way but it was too slow and was jammed with special effects the story line was horrible and stupid  the whole love story is so predictable  not to mention the story sucked even more because you knew the ship was gonna go down and the only thing holding the story together were the special effects  it didnt start getting good until the action kicked in when the ship was going down  i suggest skip the first tape and start the movie on the second tape,sad
certainly the worst movie ever made most expensive what a waste i dont think it is worth the paper the script was typed out onthe story line dialogue and cinematography was atrocious i probably would have enjoyed the movie more if the volume was put to 0the final scenes were extremely unreal to say the least and probably the most funniest scene ever madei definetely give this on a 010,sad
im a sucker 4 romance history and leonardo dicaprio so this movie captivated me it felt like u were there on the doomed ship the beauty and elegance of the 1st class captivated me while the fun and free steerage party made me want 2 dance the romance was so carefully done and i loved it the drawing was sensual and romanticit was done so every single girl was left wishing their boyfriends were amazing artists as well my only complaint was my heart will go on it was a cute song but celine dionwhile writing it should not have sung itsorry but she cant sing and with that one song has turned all my guyfriends from watching the movie which sux because its my fave movie and now wen we watch movies at each others houses we cant watch as they r now agsinst the soundtrack when the ship is sinking its amazing the way you feel for the people falling off except for the lady who slid down it and flashed everyone and the guy who fell off the end and fell on the propellersthose were funny and provided comic relief but the way you just felt sad for the lady with the baby asking the captain for help murdoch feeling helpless and shooting himself fabritzio getting killed by the funnels and tommy ryan getting shot kate winslet gives an unforgettably performance and i suggest she dyes her hair that colour again because its so gorgeous i loved what she wore and i bet every girl wishes they had her wardrobe before the sinking obviously leonardo dicaprio was impeccable as the sexy penniless artist who teaches rose how to love and gives her the courage to never let go this is a bawl your eyes out movie and is not to be missed,sad
i remember the hysteria and crazy hype around the movie in 199798 terrible normal film critics got frightened and wrote adoring lines about it they were afraid of mad fans and estonia is a small country you know plain characters banal plot idiotic mistakes about historical facts picassos famous cubist painting maids of avignon sank in as you you know from the movie now huge model of the ship and big big money for brainwashing  thats all artistically the movie was more a tv series cut together than movie for cinemas and dont forget the harm the movie made for movie industry before it even big studios tended to make more experimental movies  tarantino was discovered for example after it they all started to make stupid blockbusters everyone wanted to make his own it all went really wrong,sad
which is currently the biggest film of all time why is the biggest question of them all definitely has divided moviegoers in the last decade since its release many women feel it is one of their favorite films of all time with great special effects and a lead that they can relate to most men on the other hand obviously feel very differently than women do about this filmmany others like myself easily feel that james camerons is easily the most overrated film in history with bloated cheesy and banal dialoge two dull lead characters and a storyline which cheapens the tragedy of the sunken shipleonardo dicaprio and kate winslet play the star crossed lovers aboard the doomed ship while a supporting cast with billy zane kathy bates frances fisher and bernard hill do their best in trying to keep the screenplay and camerons bloated dialoge from falling out of placethe visual effects which looked decent at the time has not held up well there is a lot of pixelation of the ship itself and the crash sequence today looks like something out of a playstation video gamethe dialoge also today does not hold up well and many sequences such as rose holding up a middle finger does not support believability in the least secondly while the two leads are treading frozen water both of them would have died from hypothemia long before the ship itself sank to the bottomthird roses character would have died even quicker floating on top of the piece of wood since the ocean wind is actually much colder than the water itself not to mention the water on her body would have also caused hypothemia as well why her character was one of the few survivors is a puzzlement to credability of this film itselfthis film will continue to divide moviegoers for many years with many of its fans liking it and those who despise and hate will also continue to do sojames cameron had a great opportunity to explore the legacy of the famed sunken ship but instead by focusing on a teenage romance with banal dialoge and two wooden leads it definitely kills not only the storyline but the credability of this film as wellin my opinion does not hold up well to stand the test of time and that is why its easily the most overrated film in history in my opinion his last great film was 1991s t2 as both true lies and contained much of camerons famously banal dialoge and bloated budgets,sad
what a stinker i know that the academy of motion picture arts and sciences is a private club and only members can vote for oscars we the viewing public buy our tickets and have our opinions i have watched the oscars show on tv since they first let us in on their big night it is fun to watch the show and hope for our favorites but it is not a peoples choice award show i have been disappointed many times and happy many times with the winners of the coveted prize but never so disappointed and shocked at the the winning of 11 oscars for one oscar for special effects maybe but the other 10 ridiculous the blue heart yikes i cant understand how anyone other than girls between the ages of 10 and 12 could have liked this awful movie,sad
i decided recently to give this one a viewing against my better judgment i thought that reducing one of the greatest maritime tragedies in history to an illconceived love story was in poor taste previous reviews have said it all really for a more realistic and emotionally involving film about the see a night to remember why do filmmakers feel the need to spice up events of such magnitude with improbable plots appalling stuff 110,sad
is my alltime favorite film this film breathed life back into the hollywood epic sadly many people dont see it as an epic they see it as a romantic chick flick that only focuses on the love story but contrary to popular belief the film focuses just as much on the ship as it does on the love story it blends fact and fiction so well in a way that you rarely ever see on film movies like this are very easy to make but theres very hard to make well and almost impossible to make great it is also probably the most emotional moving film ive ever seen its the only movie that made me genuinely cry it also has one of the important life morals only life is priceless and making each day count although i do have to admit that the dialogue is predictable and at times stilted but that doesnt stop it from being a masterpiece because there is nothing in the film that i would improve im giving it a 1010 rating,sad
the movie opens as researchers try to find out diamonds inside the wreck of the real which gives us the first full look of the wreck of the unsinkable ship which was a bit emotional bill paxton finds 85 years old diary which hold the drawing of the naked women  then later on its been telecast on tv the movie goes into flashback  here comes the glimpse of the beautiful ship the bunch of characters appear in the movie at the port of belfast which also includes the male leading start leonardo winning the ticket of on the lucky hand of poker the movie literally gives you the feeling of viewer being inside of the ship  according to the facts everything in the movie is been redesigned from the furniture to the decks lamps the door way life boats  along with the engine roomthe real movie beings after rose decides to suicide jumping from the rear end of the ship  jack take her mind off the track  saves her as the movie continues jack  rose starts to meet up regularly at the different parts of the ship while on the other hand rose mother  her fianc cal doesnt like rose spending time with lower class standard jack but still young hearts were attracted to each other the best scene in the movie according to me is the flying scene of jack  rose which makes rose realize that she is in love with jack too the movie takes sudden turns when on the same night hits the iceberg which in short left my eyes wide open as it has been directed  executed very well  then the final chapter of the maiden voyage beings the sinking of the unsinkable the final hour of the movie filled with reality  the disaster which people till now hasnt forgotten people struggling to survive  the real history how travelers were saved into the life boats are the key scenes of the movie some true scenes like the creator of thomas andrews died while standing near the dining clock  was last seen the steamer falling on the jacks brother third class travelers were treated during the sinking scenes the breaking apart of ship are the most shattering scenes in the movie there is no doubt even today in 2012 still i wonder what james cameron has achieved in the special effects put into this movie the year 1997 the worked on their best special effects effort to keep this movie alive even for the upcoming generation to watch on the soul of the movie is the background score of this motion picture which is composed by james horner every piece of music is been composed specially to suit the scenes of this movie itself from the opening sequence to deporting of to rose theme  the sinking sequence james cameron specially recorded the score of the movie with real orchestra the team of james horner in one the interviews of the making of avatar one of the viewer asked him  what if you get a chance to direct again what would be your experience in making it   and he answer if i would have been given a change to direct again i will finish within a month very easily cause of hugely availability of special effects team cause for i had to wait for some shot for days for example the shot of rose  jack on the front end of the ship kissing each other he had to wait for days to get proper sunset in the camera as special effects that time werent that advanced like how they are today in one word youre a legend cameron the wreck shot of ship were taken in the year 1995 2 years before the releasing the movie into theaters till now whenever i watch this movie i still feel im watching it for the first time  somewhere there are tears in my eyes specially in the scene where rose steps into the life boats  jacks watches her going away oh geez that particular scene gets tears in my eyes every time i am now waiting for the special edition of this movie to be released in 3d bluray true facts about was constructed to be unsinkable ship of that time but the creator of the ship thomas made 3 biggest mistakes in constructing the ship the propeller of the ship were taken directly from the design of the 18s century cruise liner the water tight compartments had one the major flaws which over flowed the water from the upper decks the propellers turning radius was not designed to turn ship quickly as the ship size was way bigger than the propellers could bear it during the full stern on the night of sinking received 5 iceberg warning but still they ignored the warning  continue sailing the final decision by the mr murdoch to reverse the engines  turning the ship to evade iceberg the decision not to carry enough life boats cause it ruins the overall look of the top deck  it was initially decided to carry just 8 life boats but later on more 12 boats were added the distress call from was actually received by the local streamer waiting for the morning to sail again couldnt reach for help as the streamer couldnt see the as the sky was full of twinkling stars which interrupted the them to see through binocularsthe crew lost their binoculars on the night ship hitted the icebergmy rating  1010 ,sad
c the best grossing film of all time until recently that is but is it really the best film ever even worthy of getting all that money upon initial viewing many probably thought so but im not one of those it does have its strong suits and james cameron has rarely if ever failed me this film stands out as quite different in tone contrast to say aliens t2 or even avatar note the first two fck avatar use lowkey lighting while this film is just so bright all the time the performances are grade a in this film leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet are great throughout  and the end sequence was of course astonishing and a leap forward in visual effectsmy biggest problem with this movie it over does a love story to the point it hits two hours or so and then we get an hour more or less of epic disaster with tragedy and believable chaos but the first two hours just seem to drag on quite unnecessarily at that along with that the score was dismal at best naturally the only scene to defy this was the last song instant as it sank one of the main things that draws me to a film it its score or sometimes a lack there of sappy romantic themes and an unfitting climax music as thousands drown it just was distracting and honestly didnt belong there overall is worth seeing and all but far from being the best movie ever or even close for that matter this a movie where i definitely rent the dvd practically fall sleep an hour or so in then wake up and say what the still not yet and then just use chapter selection to get to see the climax,sad
199711 academy awards  including picture director and scorethe number 1 grossing film of all time  1845000000is a glorious achievement this isnt a film its much more than a film its an experience you yourself feel you are on that ship your emotions your mood corresponds that of the characters james camerons direction is a technical triumph the man did not only manage to put to use a 202000000 budget capture never before built sets but on top of all that he had to show us characters feelings stories lives and the ultimate fate of a doomed liner cameron passes the test that really takes every cinematic element to the maximum forget all that now when you walk into a cinema and sit down for 3 hours which only seem like 90 minutes you will know why is the film it is a masterpiece in every respect maybe not the greatest film ever made but a nearly perfect cinematic achievement in terms of storyline focus and technical superioritygrandeur and love collide with an inevitable destiny in james camerons stunning masterpiece best film of 1997 and one of the most perfect films of recent years,sad
what a dog a wonderful exercise by hollywood in wrapping a tedious love story around an historical event in order to sell tickets the two stars spend the whole of the film in breathless mode trying to inject some life into this corpse whilst we are treated to an occasional reference back to the disaster in order to gain some credibility no clich is left unturned in this film from long lingering shots of the lovers to the wailing drone of the title song endlessly inserted when we are supposed to feel the helplessness of their love when i saw this film people actually cheered when the ship went down  we would have cheered more if it went down in the first five minutes meaningless fodder for the intellectually challenged,sad
rocks combining elements of dark brooding drama with all the ta of a typical late night cinemax show  with the president held hostage and locked in a frigidaire 200 feet under the ocean scotland yard calls in the help of their 1 hit man to save the world  he is a cyborg soldier genetically altered so that his face looks kinda like a bull when he gets miffed  when the enemy organization known as dumb democratic underground mob brigade finds out they threaten to destroy the world with the help of their evil underlings gwar  with the plot laid out the action explodes as our hero fights his way across the world to save the helpless president played by lloyd bridges and maybe kill a few bad guys on the way  check this film out  also starring jake lloyd jake roberts james snuka hhhogan tori spelling tom selleck burgess meredith as satan and pee wee herman as god,sad
the sinking of the titantic is actually quite interesting as anyone who has read a wellwritten book about the event can tell you this film tosses away that story and replaces it with a cornball teeny bopper love story that makes one want to puke all the while slandering historical figures like j bruce ismay whom james cameron has falsely portrayed as a prototypical heartless and cowardly businessman and some others unfortunate enough to be a target of camerons biases in the end camerons film so far removed from reality that its unlikely anything it contains would ever be taken seriously by anyone looking for the historical facts i mean when was the last time hollywood presented real history probably 1964 when they filmed the longest day whose script was religiously close to cornelius ryans book since then not much the fact that cameron had to make up a subplot wouldnt have been so bad had it remained a subplot to the story of the sinking and had it been realistic rather than such a trite piece of romantic nonsense cameron had the opportunity to make a definitive account of this wellknown event and totally blew it to tell history you need someone who is dedicated to historical truth not someone determined to make the audience reach for their collective handkerchiefs shame on you mr cameron what a colossal waste,sad
for those of you who saw the in the theater you are brave this movie is a rip of romeo and juliet it contains the boy who is considered to be in the lower class while the women is a high class person as the story goes on we get crappy flashbacks from the past to the present and hear an old lady explaining her true love and to make it worse the movie is 3 hours and 19 minutes long making every second of the movie even more painful when i first watched this movie at home i checked my watch every other second and got tired of the storyline and skipped scenes in my opinion it would be just easier to cut the movie down to 2 hours and 10 minutes instead but then again this is james cameron known for making long movies and crappy story lines he should of just skipped this project and focused more on the terminator or alien instead at least those films have action to keep the movie moving in conclusion the movie ends with jack dying while rose some how survives the cold water overall i would give this movie a 0 if i could but instead it gets a 1 out of 10,sad
yeah admitted i love this movie which is nothing to be ashamed of great movie great directing great set great scale great canvas great story being a rookie filmmaker myself i have many inspirations but among my core favorites are lord of the rings star wars batman joel schumacher aside and its the quintessential love story and i dont think there is any particular scene or even a single shot that lacks superb creative insightgiven that i cant bring myself to name a scene that wasnt powerful true each scene was more powerful than the one before it but it didnt lessen the awe factor visual effects were done as they should be done so well that its difficult to tell where the line is  digitalrealthe score is phenomenal james horner provides a compelling score to finally go with a compelling movie i mean lets face it his work for jumanji and troy was good but the movies lacked for me the musical score is one of the four key components to a good movie  good script good acting good directing and good musical score thats just my personal analysis true celine dion doesnt do the love theme justice but the love theme is just the icing on the cake the opening montages of the ship in all its grandeur made it truly feel like reality magnificent beautiful with some irish humor admit it you loved the irish whats not to like about this movie it takes everything likable about romeo and juliet and gives it the backdrop of one of the greatest and most tragic moments in history that ladies and gentlemen makes a timeless epic,sad
i like this film and have watched it quite a few times and if im watching it properly ie not doing homework or talking on the phone at the same time the end always makes me cryespecially when old rose says about only 6 out of so many thousand people being saved sniffit also has some comedy which makes it even better because i dont think films that are purely romantic are that good as they always end up being really mushy apparently they wanted to cast matthew mcconaughey from how to lose a guy in ten days as jack which i think wouldve ruined the film but that might just be because you cant imagine the film without leoi give the film 810 because some bits are a bit strange but its great to have a film that you can watch over and over again and still like,sad
i dont get it what was spectacular about sure the special effects were nice for the time but groundbreaking not in my book the characters were well likable not lovable nor classic but likable the plot cookiecutter poor boy meets rich girl poor boy falls instantly in love with rich girl rich girl does the same poor boy dies seriously were you not expecting someone to die you knew the boat was going to sink throw in a historical tragedy and wam instaplot and it gets 11 oscars what happened i mean certainly wasnt a makeup oscar for cameron for t2is one of those films where they intentionally stuff as many things to tug on the heartstrings as possible without actually being engaging or interesting pearl harbor did the exact same formula yet critics panned itits ok yet not sensational in anyway,sad
is an awful movie why many reasons kate winslet is a good actress however leo and the rest of the cast is just pathetic second this tries and fails to be a period piece its not there are too many inaccuracies to even begin to go into this is a hollywood piece not a period movie if you are an ignorant white suburban female youll cream your pants for this movie because you are n ignorant white suburban female the ability of this movie to have that reaction makes it a stupid terrible film not a good film is a really awful movie i wish james cameron and kirk cameron would get married,sad
bloated neoromantic crap are other fine discriptors of this movie i honestly puke my guts out whenever the word is mentioned hype insulting plot nonperiod sets terrible lame dialogue fake history all make this the worst blockbuster this side of phantom menace why do people like this movie so much really popcrap is what this is nothing more people proclaim james cameron as some good director  this is the guy that directed piranha part two the spawning for crying out loud and if i see him on one more type special im going to puke honestly he already made a trillion dollars off of one shipwreck cant he leave it alone already sucks ok sucks,sad
i mean there is no way any of that would ever happen i look better than that girl so maybe she was desperate but you dont just go with some sleazy poor guy i mean have standardsdont get me wrong i feel bad for her being so fat she needs help putting that oldlady girdle on to look skinny for her man and that homeless guy but seriously if you are so insecure that you are into some bum who has no money but wants to draw pictures of you naked because he cant even afford a camera then you have some serious selfesteem problemsluckily theres that iceberg thing so you dont have to watch how bad her life would be with the pervy cheapskate cuz that would probably really suck so i hope they dont do a sequel about that,sad
i held off on viewing until it was let out on tape i had heard horror stories from friends and colleagues they spoke of oceans of tearfilled faces and groups of 12 year old girls singing along with that godawful celine dion song so i dodged the theaters until a friend bought the tape out of morbid curiosity to see this epic film i borrowed the tape and sat down to watch it with her my lord it was the longest freakin piece of schlock i have ever seen as my friend began to sob after the death of leonardo i got about as emotional as i do when i watch those att longdistance commercials you know the ones where a little boy in la talks to his daddy who is on a business trip in new york and the boy always tells his father i love you daddy then the music cues to pictures of the tearyeyed father well i saw a parallel between the commerical and movie both are contrived blatantly staged and chocked full of cardboard characters the film was a filthy attempt to contort and force the emotions of the lowest common denominator an striking example of this films attempt to grab people and literally wrench the tears out of them come with the scene where the frozen dead mother cradles her frozen child in her arms had this scene been in any fillm where the emotions were not completely artificial i would have cried but the fact is that this film was devoid of any real heartfelt emotion so when i saw this scene i felt nauseous and grew full of spite i now loathe cameron for his utterly plastic  inhumane protrayal of the disaster yet it appears he tapped a class of people bountiful enough to garner in excess of 600 million dollars in the states alone i never knew america was so replete with people of such bad taste people who would not only like but view repeatedly this sad excuse for cinema i weeped after seeing but not do to its shoddy screenplay or horrifically unrealistic acting and emotions i weeped for america and the death of american filmmaking i weeped knowing that such a film could garner accolades and billions of dollars and that this bounty would push studios to make bigger films with smaller characters crappy scripts and pretty faces devoid of ability that would pack seats no matter the quality of the film here comes the melodrama i could see a future where coppola kubrick and malick stood on the gallows pleading to the masses now anesthetised and made prostrate by springer and the numerous sequels the directors voiced there thoughts on the death of intellect in america then the masses let them hang as they chanted jerry jerry jerrycue my heart will go on and the sobbing girls,sad
is one of the very most well made movies i have ever seen you can debate about its greatness but it surely is not badi saw on vhs right when it came out i was about seven or eight i didnt really pay attention but i liked the sinking part so it was right after christmas last year and i was flipping through channels and saw that this movie just started on hbo hearing a lot about this film and having nothing better to do at the time i thought id watch it not remembering it at all and watching about thirty minutes in i didnt really expect the ship to sink i never thought about it that is pretty awesome because the people on the ship didnt expect it this movie does a very good job of drawing you into the main characters you know jack and rose are going to end up together but at the same time it also gives you a feeling that its not going to happen watching the movie you know they want each other it finally happens and you really start to get into the movie like i said before you dont really wait for the ship to hit the iceburg you dont think about it then it finally happens that one night the makers of the movie did a very good job on focusing on other characters meeting their fate while still concentrating on jack and rose the sinking part is amazing it does an unbelievable job of showing you how horrific and huge it really was it also did a great job of showing you the event wasnt over once the ship went under the surface the very end scene when jack and rose meet in heaven is brilliantthis movie is incredibly well made and for certain not bad as many close minded people thinkwatch the movie with an open mind and you will not be disappointed many people watch the movie with a closed mind expecting it to be gay and find excuses while watching it this movie is very very well made flawless and excellent one of the very best modern films,sad
it has kind of become the popular thing to kick the film and its achievements its like the love it garnered on release and the colossal waves it made in the history of cinema never happened or as some want you to believe doesnt matter i can tell you now that many of my macho fuelled friends will privately under the influence of liquid refreshments admit to having affection for the film but socially in a circle environment not a bit of it i have no such problems admitting my love for the film i love it as much now as i approach 50 as i did when i sat there in awe at the cinema in 1997you jump  i jumpis far from flawless where even now with the advancements in technology the effects over 15 years later look a touch creaky while its true as well that away from rose and jack the characterisations are thin on the ground but this is rose and jacks story fully fleshed out for an hour and half and then framed by the terrible tragedy that unfolds for the next hour and half the tiein to the present day is superbly constructed by james cameron  the search for the diamond  the real life filming of the wreckage  and the flashback telling of the story by a delightful gloria stuart as old rose and the sinking of the ship and its aftermath is stunning and heart breaking in equal measurenever let goso may scenes and dialogue exchanges stay in the memory for ever the band playing on the captain awaiting his fate the mother ushering her children to sleep before the sea comes to take them the old boy drinking his brandy as the water rushes in or just jack and rose polar opposites in societys class structure making love making art or just professing that neither will ever let go its what makes the wonderful piece of cinema it is where beauty and tragedy merge to create something forever memorable a film that deserved all the accolades and cash till ringing that it once did have 910,sad
james cameron creates a head spinning tale of romance and despair with the characters of jack and rose and the tragedy of the sinking this movie is still captivating people everywhere over 15 years after its original release if one is searching for a solely historical account of the sinking then this is not the movie for them while tying in key historical elements cameron has stated that was not meant to be a historical account but a love story he does a wonderful job of combining the tragedy of the sinking and the story of forbidden lovers but some historical events are not included for example many reviewers ask why cameron did not include the californinan shutting of its radio for the night this scene was in fact filmed but then cut due to cameron feeling that if is powerful as a metaphor as a microcosm for the end of the world in a sense then that world must be self contained however if you are looking for a beautiful heart wrenching love story with a historical setting this is the movie for you you cant help but to be swept up in the elegance of the period the costumes and sets are lavish for the upper class and realistically drab for those of the lower class the dialogue is excellent seamlessly creating a beautiful story line the special effects used along with gorgeous camera work produce shots upon shots of heart stopping images winslet and dicaprio have undeniable chemistry and are extremely convincing in their roles of wealthy and poor respectivelyoverall this film is a must see classic for people of all ages i have seen it several times yet i always find something new to be in awe of 1010,sad
i will not deny that the special effects and sinking ship drama for the other passengers are fantastic but there are simply too many things in the remainder of the movie that tick me off and prevent me from giving it a higher ratingthe romance characters dialogues and situations are way too clich the instant love at first sight scene the shes not for you advice the way kate winslet changes the moment she sees the rich woman mistreating her daughter the evil fiance the lively and dancing 3rd class people it is just far too silly and contrivedtheres also one thing that bothers me everyone is happy that leo and kate are reunited at the end well she got married and had kids didnt she so that means she probably spend several years with a husband soinstead of the father of her children she wants to spend eternity with a guy she met as a teenager for 5 days id be royally mad off if i was the guy,sad
i just went into the movie theatre to see my all time favourite movie by james cameron in all its brillianceits just like those 15 years have never happened its so utterly sweeping to watch this huge vessel rising up in the screen cameron outstandingly managed to shoot his sequences comparing sizes against each other which  by their contrast  brings so much emotion to something we only perceive in real life sizeafter watching the movie i cant believe this is a 2d to 3d conversion this is not just a diorama kind of 3d conversion watching the movie its hard to believe it was not shot in 3d originally even in real life action scenes cameron stems the task of creating realistic 3d perspective throughout the movie it must have been hell to mesh all the fringes in each and every of the frames well as i learned now it took 60 weeks and 18 million dollars to work on this that gamble payed off very wellnot to mention all the emotion that comes with the story cameron is a wizard of timing one moment the audience is just deeply moved by romance when it gets torn out right the next moment by fear anger or laughthis is a very emotional film there are so many different fates one can as easily think hisher way into in 1997 i have been crying about what i saw in a movie  i was baffled because this happened for the first time in my life now in 2012 i was crying laughing fearing so much all the way again together with my girl friendwe personally feel so much like rose and jack there are so many details in the movie that match our situation up to tiny things like dancing barefoot or the butterfly as a symbol for freedom at heart and escape from familys restrictionsto all those who dont like the movie heres my advice never watch this film on tv you can only appreciate this precious work of art in a movie theatre  i never saw this movie on tv and i never will but when itll come back to the theatres in a couple of years ill be right back to watch it there,sad
i really dont understand why people hate on a pure technical level it was groundbreaking the span and width of an epic film was faceted in this film theres a reason why it won 11 academy awards and is still the most grossing film unadjusted for inflation if movie tickets had been the same price as it was in 199798 the dark knight would have to make 900 million dollars to catch up to the amount of tickets soldthe success of was not because of schoolgirls fawning over a story of lost love that is a delusion when people think of now they feel embarrassed because they fell in love with the movie when it came out but now for some reason deem it too corny it deserves everything and anything it got award and moneywise82 percent on rotten tomatoes yet an incredibly unfair 72 on imdb james cameron fans know that both his dream projects battle angel 2010 and avatar 2009 would have never come in to fruition if it wasnt foris big bold touchingly uncynical filmmaking was it the acting that made it fail no leo dicaprio and kate winslet are doing mighty fine in terms of their careers was it the story oldfashioned storytelling was the highlight of many top critics according to rt and to many people though they may be reluctant to say it had their tear ducts on full mode at the end of the moviewatch it again and this time without your preconceived bias and prejudice watch it with a clean slate and you will realize that the talk is really just talktill the day i die i will defend this incredibly clever classy and colossal piece of epic cinema i cant bear to see it wither away like thiswill forever be in my top movies list,sad
this movie should have never have been nominated for any oscars it is mindless drivel i wanted to throw things at the screenbut i didnt because its not the screens fault that the movie sucked i will never understand why so many people liked this movie i saw this movie in the theatre expecting a cinematic triumph instead the only emotion it evoked in me was pain because after seeing all that water i really had to pee it was also painful because the amount of sap in that movie could fill the hoover damif i had known how repulsive this movie was before i spent 7 to see it i wouldve avoided it altogether,sad
i hate this movie it was badly scripted badly acted and very boring if it was just any other chick flick i would roll my eyes and ignore it but because cameron used a historical backdrop i cant help but notice it cameron said he made up his done to death romeo and juliet story line so that people would have a human conection to the ship there were more than 2000 human conections on the ship that he just ignored those were stories of real people whose lives were forever affected by this ship i think that its sick to use the deaths of more then 1500 men women and children just to make money,sad
the only good thing about this movie are the special effects truly incredible including the underwater scenes  what else does it have lets seeone of the worst screenplays ever put on filmonedimensional dull trite characters who are either improbably admirable our lovely rose can appreciate picasso knows all about dr freud and can figure out that there arent enough lifeboats for all the passengers or ridiculously evil cal the guy played by billy zane  not to mention tiresome cliches of the noble poor vs the ignoble richleonardo di caprio basically modeling instead of acting  kate winslet doing a more decent job but nowhere near her performance in sense and sensibility where she was given a real character to playthe only emotion generated by this movie came from knowing that more than 1200 people actually did die on the  and even the disaster scenes werent nearly as affecting as they should have been  because the lives and deaths of thousands became merely a backdrop to the romance between kate and leo sorry rose and jack and the question of whether they would survive  personally i found myself wishing they had both drowned early in the movie when rose tried to jump and jack was going to jump after herif you want to see a good movie about the rent a night to remember  it was made i think in 1948 and obviously had very poor special effects by todays standards but it did an incomparably superior job of telling the story of the ship and its passengers  by the way the only good bits of dialogue in  the conversations between the crew when they realize the ship is going to sink  are basically lifted from that film  wisely a night to remember doesnt focus on a couple of central characters and instead shows us many different people who are much more fully fleshed out in the small vignettes they get than jack and rose were in all those unbearable hours of screen time  in that way a night to remember truly captures the human tragedy of what happenedthe fact that won the best picture award in a year that saw such superb films as la confidential and one of my alltime favorites boogie nights just shows the cowardice of the academy and the marketing power of 13yearold girls,sad
actually reading a lot of the previous reviews lots of them has restored my faith in humanityi half expected to read best film ever which pops up far too often for average films that hollywood rams down peoples throatsthis film was so poor  im generally a fan of cameron and normally his writing is very good but the sub plot to this film was appalling  why did rose who was meant to be english played by an english actress have a bad american accent  why did every englishmanwoman on the boat which incredibly was an english ship you know not american as the film tries to push an evil nasty characterthe acting was probably the worst in film history and the love story was so silly and badly done  all the scenes on the boat looked like hollywood stage setsits very disturbing that a film like this can win oscar recognition  it was bad enough that braveheart won an oscar but that was much better than thisfilm making and hype at its worst from a normally reliable director,sad
a glorified sitcom or soap opera  this is one big hustle im told its the best movie everi must be from mars  its an insult to 1500 who died in 1912 an insult to women and a patronizing film in 1998,sad
spoilers hereini admit to a certain admiration of cameron alone among special effects manipulators he has a solid sense of what works cinematically when he invests he invests in a world that world envelops us with its completeness and magnitude it is the opposite of say carpenter who invests in the stage in the world of the performer rather than the vieweras far back as aliens this talent has been apparent this time he sticks to the formula of a simple story annotated by all sorts of associations no second plotline no ambiguities or any questions open for viewer judgment but he is sensitive to this i think and that is why he chose the most promising young actors that know something about narrative folding thats where you act both in the space of the story and the world of the viewer kate in creatures and leo in romeo did this kate has since grown to master it his intent is underscored by making the color of her hair more brilliant i dont know why yet but this seems to signal such acting at least in womenbut alas except for the brief scene where leo draws her  a natural situation for this type of acting  it is absent probably cameron intended something deeper and more nuanced but just couldnt manage it in this case as well as that of the ship the vast machine winsteds evaluation  2 of 4 has some interesting elements,sad
all of the critics for should really be on line for the new star wars rightthe extent of critcism for even at this late date indicates that even those who hate it are still thinking about it and want to bash in it light of the new george lucas moviehas a solid place in movie history with movie fans everywhere in the world and a couple of bored and angry people are not going to change that  i love the movie and i always will,sad
is a commercial movie with half naked woman scene 194 minutes of absolute boredom  back achei saw this dvd and i could not tolerate sitting more than 3 hours like a couch potato for a commercial movie that is filled with boredomhas sex scene of half a naked woman posing half nude for the painting this scene caused the movie to be purely commercial  perhaps rated r for nudityin my opinion james camerons movie could have been so much better without this unnecessary nudity scene unless he wants to attract people to seeing it we know very much how nudity  sex sells,sad
it wasnt satisfying enough for me boring and repetitive the character of jack seemed to far fetched although a true story the ship sank and that is the only bit of truth the fact that we had to wait 3 hours just for a ship to plunge into the depths of the ocean whilst watching a boring and unromantic love story just really didnt appeal to me i really do not recommend you watch this unless you want to be involved with boring and unreal plot lines that to be frank are all just her words do not watch this appalling filmby matthew,sad
an open letter to 20th century fox james cameron leonardo de caprio and kate winsletdear production company sirs and neato breast packagei am writing you to notify you that i have finally finished watching after repeated attempts over the past 7 years to watch it it took approximately 2330 separate cracks at viewing it right where i left off to complete this task i know that this might seem an overly long time to view all 194 minutes but i assure you the task was accomplished as fast as i possibly could if you wouldnt mind terribly i have a few comments that may or may not be helpful to anyone reading this i really loved the 15 minutes of present day rose talking to the diving crew bill paxton and suzy amis that appeared throughout the movie i found everyone in those segments to be amazingly brilliant actors and the scenes heartwarming poignant and emotionally beautiful  if you stopped right there it would have been a great masterpiece  the choice to ruin such a wonderful movie short with 189 minutes of purely agonizing torturous hell no doubt had a significant upwards impact on the suicide  murder rate of 1997  i think i speak for everyone on this  if you killed leonardo de caprio in the opening credits even that would have been too much face time  in the directors cut dvd even if kate winslets nudey scene replaced 185 minutes of the 189 minutes of agony it wouldnt have been enough of an apology for the remaining pain inflicted upon the audience  in the ending credits kevin owers was mistakenly listed as steward 3 he was actually steward 4 mark capri was steward 3 only an imbecile would have made such a silly gaffe as kevin and mark look quite different  not even five minutes into watching it ive never rooted so hard for an iceberg in all my life  never did i understand why there is a 7 day waiting period to purchase a firearm until the 12th attempt at watching  the movie might have been a lot better if leonardo pushed kate off the railing in the king of the world scene and the whole thing played out as a murder mystery with a british cast actor playing the inspector  leonardo de caprio was in the movie why if you hate us so much why dont you just make a death ray laser and blow up the world make the pain go away you er  a mime could have done a better job with a halogen light waterfilled bath tub rubber ducky and a toaster and more people would have liked it even though it was done by a mime  there was a distinct lack of blood sucking zombies in the movie except for leonard de caprio actually he didnt really suck that would have required talent and effort  for 200 million dollars you really skimped on the iceberg cameron it should have been much bigger a chihuahua could have been hit by that thing and come away without a limp  celine dion would have been most affective as frozen bobbing corpse 35 instead of letting her sing  you forgot to put a camera in the car youre useless you know that  leonardo de craprio was in the movie you bleepershopefully you found some of this feedback worth readingsincerely vincent b navarino owneroperator of the navarino unincorporatedcom websiteps immediately after completing my 7 year quest to complete your god awful movie i taped over it with wbs gilmore girls,sad
i felt this film had some neat effects but not worth the price of the ticket  the acting was weak and the dialogue was horrible if you havent seen it yet you were probably correct to not want to,sad
i gave this film a 1 but thats only because there was no 999 rating this film sucked because there was absolutley no plot how can you have a 3 hour movie with no plot the story was a rip off of romeo and juliette and even that was done badly the only part of the film i liked was when jacks friend is swimming away and that big massive chimney shaped thing drops on him oh how i laughedi remember when this movie came out and there was such hype about it being the most expensive movie ever made and everyone was going on about how amazing it is that was 4 years ago 4 years later ends up in one of those crazy eddie bargain video boxs for 299 and incase you dont know thats where all the lame videos end up the fact is is excuse me was all hype behind the hype the film could not stand the test of time because it is a lame filmand for those of you who think 4 years is a long time for hype to last then think of star wars 24 years ago and still selling strong seven samurai 50 years later and is still inspiring new directors 4 years later crazy eddie bargain video box 299,sad
i truly cannot believe how a movie of this calibre won 11 oscars great special effects can add additional excitement to a good movie but theyre not meant to carry a film like many another modern blockbuster strip away the computer fx any youre left with a mindnumbingly large helping of schmaltzy unbelievable dialogue and acting this movie is a total waste of ones valuable time not tomention money avoid at all costs,sad
really why all the commotion over this movie this schmaltzy soap opera bubble gum puke is way overlong with every character some cartoon cliche with dialouge so frickin corny that just made me want to throw a brick through my tv screen even at the end that rotten stupid cow could have let leo share the plank she was on but no she decides to let him die what the hell is up with that when are people going to realize that all the special effects in the world arent going to compensate for jejune scripts such as this one it too bad that cameron didnt line a few bird cages with his script to this manipulative sugar coated borefeast if he would have it would have put to good use,sad
ive never been into long movies when a film starts growing longer than an hour thirty perhaps an hour fortyfive i cant help but yawn and perhaps snooze off it happened to me with the greatest movies in the history of cinema i fell asleep with gone with the wind and yawned plenty of times with schindlers listbut with however hours seemed to dash by without me noticing i watched the story on screen with my 3d glasses on and i was instantly captured by jack and roses story three hours twenty nonetheless and in all that time i didnt let out a single yawn neither did i look at the time on my phone i felt how the magic of really got to me and when the credits came in my face was flooded with tearsperhaps what i like the most about this movie is how it has made me feel yeah it has made me feel things i had never felt before for instance i had never cried with a movie and it wasnt just the sad romantic story that involved the two characters  but how all the characters that had interacted with them died one by one sunk with the ship of dreams mr andrews captain smith little cora mr murdoch tommy fabriziobecause isnt just a romantic movie its also a historic movie that shows what happened on a fatal april 14 morning in 1912 one thousand fifty souls sunk down along with the into the deep waters of the northern atlantic and i could see all that pain and suffering portrayed in james camerons movie perfectly and it was during that dramatic hour sitting still at the movie theater in which tears dared to slide down my cheeks along with most of the other viewersas the movie credits slid by in the theater screen my brother asked me if i was crying and i shook my head its just the 3d glasses you know they get my eyes tearyyes it might have very well been the 3d glasses or perhaps the fact that i had watched a great modern classic that will not be easily forgotten,sad
is one of my favorite movies and it is a timeless classic that did not receive the acclaim and respect it deserved i know that it got oscar nominations and it received the hype but its not even in the top 250 which is very disappointing because is as least as good if not better than many of the movies in the top 250 it is unfortunate that it was unpopular among so many people during its day it was the highest grossing film of all time unfortunately the success and hype of the movie have spawned vicious criticism a lot of viewers love but many more bash the film and dissect it for problems such as its lack of originality weak script and poor acting all of which are overly critical and not true maybe the script could have been a little better but it was good enough for me it may have been simple but it was still wellwritten in my opinion i dont know why everyone says the acting is bad i thought all of the cast did very well in this movie as for the originality its not the first love story to be told but in my opinion it is the most believable epic and heartwrenching love story to ever be depicted in a movie the love the two characters have for each other is totally convincingdoes use a historical setting to set the foundation for the movie but so do a lot of other great movies a lot of people say they dont like because it was too long but i dont think the movies length is a problem because its so good that its worth the 3 hour commitment sure it could have been a little shorter but i dont know that it would have been made that much of an improvement is indeed a very lengthy film but the movie is breathtaking because of its strong plot gorgeous cinematography phenomenal special effects and superb acting a lot of people dont like leonardo di caprio in this movie in fact many of the people who didnt like this movie blame di caprio leonardo di caprio is not really respected as an actor but often dismissed as a pretty boy leonardo di caprio is not the greatest actor ever but he did a good job in this movie and i find the attacks on his acting to be unfair in my opinion he did his best work in this moviekate winslet is perfect in she is a very gifted actress who is part of what makes this movie so good but she didnt do it alone the chemistry between her character and leonardo di caprios character is so natural that it does not seem like they acting at all kate winslet plays a young woman from a rich family named rose and leonardo di caprio plays a poor artist named jack the two meet on the voyage of the and fall in love but rose is strongly encouraged to marry a rich man named cal hockley roses family and cal disapprove of jack throughout the movie rose and jacks relationship develops much to cals dismay cal becomes the enemy of both rose and jack he hires a man to capture jacka real ocean liner was built for the production of this movie it is not quite as big as the real but it is close to it the replica of the ship looks very authentic it looks just like the real ship may start off a little slow but it is still very engrossing in my opinion the second half of the movie is unforgettable it is tense suspenseful and compelling watching this movie makes you feel like you were really on the ship the movie does include some characters that really were on the ship but jack and roses characters are fictitious im not sure how accurate the rest of the movie is but the reality of it all is impeccable is a riveting movie that really draws you in to the disaster and the tragedy of that nighti would certainly recommend to all audiences do not listen the hype though and do not listen to the criticism either just watch the movie and make your own opinion if you leave your cynicism at the door then you may just discover the beauty of this movie,sad
say what you will about the gooey love story but do not contest the film being a masterpiece never has a film inspired such emotion in me such a feeling of belonging to the thrills and struggles of the characters on the screen the music a rich blend of instrumental and vocal is far from archaic it inspires emotional power that would have otherwise been lost the story is obviously wellresearched the images are heartbreaking and breathtaking and unlike many epics is not arrogant and it does not drag on in fact despite its being one of the longest movies i have ever seen it felt rushed it was over too soon it was that good i did not even think that the love story was that distracting from the grandeur it was just another human aspect masterfully explored by the film greed hate panic and above all love a love so profound so passionate that it should inspire viewers with envy not laughter no is as close to flawless as anything can get with characters that should rightfully be hated and loved characters to whom we can all relate a recapture of the world of the past and the ship itself synonymous to a time machine and a story replete with comedy tragedy and thrill is a classic that time can never erode and that shall always inspire laughter and tears,sad
i saw the hype of this movie and immediately thought it would be too much and i decided not to see it in theatres i made a huge mistake in 2001 i saw it on television and couldnt believe it this movie has an amazing script that kept me watching the love story made me sigh and cry not saying what happens even though most people already know might be spoilers ahead anyways the jack and rose story was enough for me but after hit the iceberg it was like a completely different movie i loved how they kept the love story afloat haha while the ship was sinking there are so many elements to this movie that i cant even explain every time i watch it i cry for jack every single time the fact that he loved her enough to sacrifice his life wow i mean i cant get a man to open a door for me let alone give me the door to float on while he freezes to death thats love the way this film plays out is amazing all the special effects the costumes the acting dont even get me started about the acting and even things right down to the sound the lookouts bell makes but i have to say after the 80th time i watched the movie or around there somewhere i started to notice that some of the lines are just a little bit too cheesy but that really is the only flaw in the 194 minutes of perfection some people i know wont watch the film because of the long running time but i think if it was any shorter i wouldnt be satitsfiyed i really wouldnt all in all this movie is beautiful it makes me feel things i almost never feelcomplete perfection,sad
i didnt watch this film until recently because i couldnt stand all the furore around it when it was released and then i forgot all about iti wish i had remained soits trash in the same vein as pearl harbour overproduced overly sentimental claptrap which highlights the lack of imagination in the american mainstream cinemawhat exactly do you all see in it there are much better romances much better disasters better characters and better period piecesperhaps discussion can help me to find out,sad
but not because the movie is an oh so tragic story about two young lovers and a boat sinking in the sea but because of one person  one person only  spent about a billion dollars on this movie while about a billion human beings cant get food for the day a house to sleep in or clean clothes and didnt succeed to make a great movie three hours is how long this was thats at least about two and a half hour too much one thing if it they spent the money on a documentary on the subject or at least spent the money on better boats but not on this awful movie the silly plot ridiculous jokes bad actors an unoriginal subject  what more can i say o yeah  it has great special effects but thats at least something you might say no  its  not its just another problem because special effects are not all and if they had to spend money on special effects they could at least have made a greater movie i hope the producers and the director will spend the rest of eternity in hell watching this movie over and over again,sad
let me start by saying i really truly and without a doubt mean every word i am going to say herewhat is so special about this movie  this has got to be the longest most pathetic boring excuse for oscar bait i have ever seen and thats even comparing it to some of the other doozies that hollywood has honored in the past  first of all leonardo cant act to save his life  what was the official word at the casting call  must be able to stand in front of the camera and bring in teenage women  and kate winslet who i have respected in the past completely lost her abilities as well  you wait two hours for anything to happen and when it does it happens so slowly that i hardly even noticed  as for the special effects ive seen better special effects in movies with much smaller budgets  want to know what the best part of the movie was  when i went to go see it right before the end credits the film melted and the projector caught on fire  i was quite happy to realise that a copy had been partially destroyed  this is a terrible excuse for a film  how can you not agree when the machinery showing it commits suicide,sad
having read real accounts of the disaster from eyewitnesses as in walter lords stellar book a night to remember i can only laugh at how ludicrous james camerons rendition of this historical event was all for sensationalism and turned into a megasoap opera focusing on the plight of two 1990s teenagers decked out in costumes as if they inhabited 1912 but nobody was fooled the whole thing was ludicrous as they slogged their way for hours in freezing ocean water in soaked clothing ending up in the ocean of course  but only she was saved the only good part of this movie disaster was the first few minutes where they showed the salvage operation on the real,sad
well what can i say you gotta love a good disaster movie set on real events and checks all the boxes for a good movie set in april 1916 the movie opens with an elderly woman named roseplayed by the late gracie stuartwho talks to the reportersone played by bill paxton from mighty joe young and she talks to them along with her granddaughter about the story of the so we cut in to see all the people being sent aboard the famous ship and we see a younger looking roseplayed by kate winslet who looks so different with her dyed red hairand her boorish fiance played by billy zanefrom the phantomwho is by her side as she sets sail on the ship meanwhile a charming man named jack dawsonplayed by the gorgeous leonardo di caprio before he morphed into eric danes love child nowas he and his mates are playing cards so his friend decides to abort the ship with him as he yells the famous line im the king of the worldbut later in the film jack falls in love with rose while his staying on the ship and the two become really close with each other but what will roses boorish egotistical fiance think of itthis film maybe 3 hrs long but its definitely worth it the music by john horner is brilliant theres this one scene i can recall where jack and rose are dancing to some irish music and they had a lot to drink and their smiling and laughing at each otherthat was just so well done also you gotta love the celine dion hit my heart will go onthe story is brilliant in fact this is what really happened on the and if you come across another movie that says the legend goes on i suggest you avoid this one and watch this overrated flick instead of it as the animated version well if you seen it you know what its likealso i loved the chemistry between winslet  dicaprio which was so realistic and genuine bottom line if you havent seen it then check it out im telling youthat you wont regret it i seen it a million times before and if i catch it again on tv at an earlier time than ill watch it again1010,sad
this film should of never won best picture this was just a glamorized version of pretty women special effects were good in this movie and deserved any awards that they got but if you look at the other films that year like la confidential good will hunting and as good as it gets those are original films that deserved the best picture award i dont know how anyone can watch la confidential and not wonder why that film did not win best picture good thing the acting in did not win any awards because there were about one hundred better performances that year before you get to the first one in james cameron is overrated yes the terminator films were classics but curtis hanson really should of got the award for best director,sad
ill start with the good in this movie the production design and some of the supporting actingnow the bad pretty much everything elseeveryone says no youve got it wrong because its truly beautiful well i hate to break it to you but i am a film lover who does like touching beautiful dramas im not some guy who sits around criticizing movies but this is just disturbing the message of this film is basically americans can fall for soapopera material that looks like a movie and it can become the most overrated piece of trash of all time i mean seriously its just a really shallow and overlytouchy love story with really obnoxious tendencies to take itself waaayy to seriously honestly james cameron directed terminator 2 which i thought was really fun and enjoyable because though it had a coherent story it was purposely farfetched and seemed to understand that is threeandahalf hours of paininducing mediocrity except for the previously mentioned design with completely overthetop sappiness and the cheapest tricks in the book as far as getting a simpleminded audience to feel really tingly inside and this won 11 academy awards ive got a review for the only other movie to achieve this feat return of the king which i didnt like either but ive got to say it was better than this my only question is why america why does crap like this become so acclaimed i think the reason this won all those oscars was its popularity and why is it so popular in conclusion is a bad episode of days of our lives with a little spicingup of the visuals and a little more emotional manipulation but it amounts to what should have been a little blip on the radar that everyone understood as mediocrity instead people consider this art and beautiful powerful compelling so the only productive thing this movie has really done is to show us that america has pretty low tastes in entertainment and seems to think that its somehow artistic,sad
dont wanna bother too much with this one so ill give 2 points for the technical partship sinking  good and so on as for the rest childish screenplayidiotic intriguea goodhearted robin hood picassodecaprio in a relationship with msrich bitch i thought this looked like a lesbian relationship with winslet being the dominant partneras for the depiction of the class issueit reminded me of some communist propaganda storiesthe whole feel of the movie is secondrate sentimentalismthe other characters are incredibly onesided billy zane looks like a bond villain and the rich people are the worst bastards i have ever seen1 billion dollars wasted in a giant corny videoclipthis movie made me sickas for celine dion and her overhyped songno commentexcept i had no idea that cheesy and corny are the qualities needed for an oscarwinning songnow i know actors were really alrightbut the movie is so melodramatically over the top that its just insulting,sad
 and yet not nearly fast enough when this movie first splashed onto the big screen i was in the middle of the prime target young teenaged girls who all too easily swooned over the new it guy leo and wanted a taste of adult love thank heavens i somehow missed it on that round only to have one of my friends pull it out nearly a decade has it really been so long later for a girls night i was stunned the hype created by the oscars and gushing of my peers set this movie on a pinnacle from whence the movie plummeted to the bottom of the ocean to join its namesake if only they had left the story there the first two hours were spent dillydallying aimlessly along the ship following rosea girl who is deprived a life by her dominating fiance her conniving mother and ultimately her own self she goes back and forth from suicidal to equal rights to you are not of my element with schizophrenic dexterity i have great admiration for kate winslet but this character was gratingly awful to watch mr dicaprio was little more than a pretty face during the movie his lack of drive proves him not a knight in shining armor but meh hes just not as bad as the villain and somehow they fall madly into doomed love because gasp the ship is going to sink so now the ship has fiiiiinally begun to sink but wait you still have another hour to watch the main people get stuck cut to people drowning oh wait rose and jack are safe cut to more drowning oh wait the ships still sinking so rose and jack arent safe again oh theyre safe wait no die already so after three hours rose finally says ill never let go upon which she immediately lets go and is magically found unfrozen in a colony of frozen solid bodies yes its amazing how it goesso why 2 stars ill chalk it up to the romantic notion behind the ship which has managed to still fascinate people a century later the recreation of detail was admittedly stunning although i got just as much out of a mystery computer game normally even if i dont care for a movie id say knock yourself out if you still wanna see it but at 3 painful hours long id definitely go with a no,sad
well this movie took me away from reality from the moment the lights dimmed in the movie cinema but that was only because i saw a decent trailer for some action flick i would never see bucause lets face you just know how there going to end but started and by that time i thought all the hype was going to be worth itinstead i was treated to 194 minutes of clichd romance and crappy songs by equally crappy recording artists all 194 minutes of this to boil down to what we all knew was going to happen the ship sankso by now ive left the cinema picturing james cameron rolling around in pools of money and laughing as he watches us on a 13 meter television set from inside a hollowed out volcanothe only good thing about this movie was watching leonardo decaprico drown in icy cold water because they couldnt possibly share a huge chunk of wood not because hes a bad actor i just enjoy watching rich actors die,sad
i thought this movie was unbelievably great i say unbelievably because im all into sci fi comedy and action adventure movies i always disliked dramas and romances however this movie moved me in like a trillion different ways so i never thought id like it and i didnt i loved it ok leonardo decaprio i had honestly never seen one of his movies i think he was amazing and he should have been anakin skywalker in starwars iiiii nicekate winslet did fantastic and her character grew throughout the movie from the snobby brat to the down to earth person she became i thought she was perfect for the rolei highly recommend this movie its very well put together the sound track is amazing i cant get that song out of my head i saw it about 15 minutes ago and im still affected wowz1010 hands down to the bottom of the seawilliam,sad
aimed precisely at those with the emotional maturity of 13yearold children while technically impressive is perhaps the most overrated tripe to float out of hollywoods shipyard of overblown hype here you have perhaps the worst single tragedy of the 20th century and what do we get  a phony forced class struggle love story so poorly written that no one with half a brain cares one whit about the characters obviously the producers of this shipwreck of a film assume that the public is too dull to let the sheer drama of the event itself sustain the story so were assaulted by perhaps the worst script ever written not only is there not one once of truthful human emotion in the screenplay its insulting as well the poseidon adventure as trite as it was had more veracity than this muddlewill lower your iq guaranteed and probably cause warts too if you need to see a film about this fateful night that actually treats its audience like an adult rent a night to remember a vastly superior filmtwo stars for technical achievement only,sad
much has been made of director james camerons attention to detail ironically leonardo dicaprio seems incredibly 90s in his demeanor and appearance  additionally his hand is perfectly manicured and ages some 20 years when he sketches kate winslet later in the film  the story line is borrowed from for whom the bell tolls and the effects are only okay low budget genius like john carpenter and able ferera could have made this film much better with a fraction of the budget  i cant believe this film was showered in awards perhaps some of the budget was used as bribe money,sad
it is appalling that james cameron hitched his disaster movie to the late1990s fascination with the rms  he can now lump himself with other filmmakers such as oliver stone who distort history in an effort to make a film about something other than the historical event they end up teaching the american public about  but even setting aside my disdain for his gross inaccuracies in history and going with my deepest feelings that films are for enjoyment and escapism this movie lacked the most important part of any film developing characters i didnt care about rose or jack  rose was spoiled  jack was a foolish brat  this film also contained the fatal flaw in triangle love stories i liked the bad guy billy zane beauty aside was still the only character who probably was on the and the only one i hoped made it off the ship alive  it is better to see the film that should have won the oscar that year la confidential rather than waste anymore time even reading more comments about the movie that did win the oscar,sad
i cant see what so great with this film for me its just a lot of noise and terrible fx skip this one and see a night to remember,sad
alright where to begin this is without a doubt the most over hyped movie i have ever seen all i can figure is that either the academy is full of teenage girls who swooned over dicaprio or james cameron threatened to smash everyone with his oversized head if they didnt give him all the awards the characters in this movie were there only to look good and smile broadly whenever the camera focused on them and as for the award winning effects they didnt look remotely realistic they were so obviously computer generated shame on the academy for not giving the oscars to la confidential with its vastly superior cast and in depth storyline,sad
one of the monuments of the cinema which won 11 oscars in hollywood in 1998 a huge success well deserved all over the world the revelation of two actors until then virtually unknown this is james cameron masterpiece he chose to relate the tragedy of the that took place on the 12th of april 1912 through the intermediary of a love story lived between a wealthy and pretty young woman kate winslet and a modest painter lonardo dicaprio cameron succeeds in making it fascinating in the first part of the movie the love between jack and rose is so strong that can hardly believe the will bump into an iceberg and will sink its also together with a model bravery that the two lovers will try to escape the ships sinking although historically accuratelonardo dicaprio and kate winslet will stay among the famous mythical couples in the cinemas history its obvious that they are between the hands of a conscientious and carefully organized filmmaker james cameron doesnt leave anything high and dry he adopted a sustained rhythm not spoiled by the enormous means that hes got its useless to say that he masters them perfectly thanks to an important budget not only has this budget enabled a meticulous reconstruction of the ship but it has also enabled a reconstruction from the traditional life in 1912 with its contrasts its oppositions moreover the movie enjoys an outstanding performance from all the actors even the minor ones and several sequences and dialogs dont lack humorbut is also a limited place where takes place the confrontation of two different worlds the proletarians and the middleclass persons this confrontation is particularly well described during the ships sinking the rich are by the lifeboats whereas the poor are still inside the ship and theyre forbidden to go outsidethe second part of the movie is remarkably well filmed and follows a logical advance based on the increase of fear and distress cameron emphasizes particularly on the madness that spread to the passengers but also on the officers little by little these last ones are becoming mad one of them will kill unwittingly one of the passengers who was trying to get into a lifeboat besides a few touches make the movie surrealist the four musicians keep on playing while the ships sinkingthe other obvious qualities a gorgeous music some smart costumes at the end a movie that creates a deep emotion and where everything contributes to a perfect success,sad
well this movie had a great success because it had all that you can require from a movie  a love story historical background suspense a nice jeune premier social differences special effects everything to be sold  the best example of a commercial movie or how to kill the only true cinema le 7eme art,sad
i am one of the few people i think that has not seen all of i saw most of it and couldnt sit through the restyou see i have a great interest in the real and i truly believe that this threehour epic is the greatest insult to the tragedy ever to be put on film it has nothing to do with the ship or what really happened the story would have been more realistic set in some city as it is the ship is just pushed into the background of a love story that could never and i repeat never have happened in true life rose would never even have met jack and most likely she would not have wanted to steerage passengers on the and all other ocean liners of the time were strictly prohibited from association with the other classes and first class held themselves so aloof that they did not even look on second class let alone steerage as human beings let alone material for lovers rose would have been raised with these attitudes they would have been engraved in her no matter how freespirited she was and what are the chances that a noblewoman who has likely never done a lick of work in her life could ever swing an axe without chopping off someones hand nilthis movie is nothing but hollywood capitalising on a tragedy that cost hundreds of lives the only really fitting tribute to the doomed liner is the musical which has done its research and is a triumphant tribute to the ship and the world she sailed in in which the characters become secondary and the doomed liner takes on a life of its own,sad
i find it difficult to comment on this film because it was so bad  as far as i can see it has no redeeming features at all  is too long boring and the special effects arent really very specialthere is no attempt to develop the characters and the narrative far from being a great love story is just silly  if the script cost more than 1 it was robberyi saw this with a friend who commented as the credits revealed written and directed by james cameron  and he should be thoroughly ashamed of himselfthis is the sort of film that makes europeans despise hollywood it may have made a lot of money but it was basically worthless,sad
i almost always refrain from posting negative reviews  what i find ridiculous may be sublime to others  however this is one movie that i find so disgustingly revolting that i cannot resist adding my unwelcomed twocentsif youre one of the three people on earth who hasnt seen the film please take my advice and find something more constructive to do with your timedirectorwriter james cameron has reduced a truly horrific event into a ludicrously trite love story that makes days of our lives seem like a shakespearean tragedy by comparison  instead of focusing the story on actual people and events  cameron took the easy way out and created a cast of dull sterotypical characters who spout inane dialogue seemingly lifted from a tvmovieoftheweek  rampant historical inaccuracies cliched directing uninspired acting and ridiculously cheap sentimentality all add up to one overhyped overrated spectaclethe only thing more nauseating than the film itself was james camerons moment of silence at the oscars for the real victims of the disaster the movie has about as much to do with the actual disaster as the police academy movies do with law enforcement  this film isnt a testament to human tragedyits a disgusting marketing ploy aimed at bilking moviegoers out of money  while making a mockery out of those people who experienced an event that no one should ever face,sad
are there lesser films in execution and entertainment of course but i felt a one vote was deserved here for the overratedness of this movie by boxoffice and awards i think the oscars should be embarrassed this won all those oscars including best picture as another commenter pointed out it is funny that such a bloated film won best editing honestly this winning best picture would be like ghost winning that award a popular sappy movie with pretty leads only this lacks the actually humorous whoopithe romance is laughable i like winslet she has at least tried to steer clear of this type of stuff since actually mostly so has decrapiomalcolm x and gandhis lives those are worthy of three hoursplus of filmnot this eternal romancesome people are simply impressed by the sinking im sorry but if there isnt one person on the ship i care about the sinking does not mean much to me spectacle try nature go watch a volcanobtw i will say i think it is hilarious that people refer to winslet as a cow in this because she isnt an anorexic actress i honestly initially was perplexed whom they were even referring to because bates isnt even all that fat like they wouldnt want kate as their girlfriend come oni would certainly never want to see this one againthe script fails to portray an eternal love rather it gives us a bit of lust while it is believable winslet doesnt want to be permanently with zane why she has to be with leo is not showni t is encouraging that this is not in the imdb top 250perhaps the worst film to ever win best picture,sad
ive always enjoyed the british version a night to remember based on walter lords popular book yes its black and white and a bit dated but its a straightforward telling of an awesome disasterthe 1953 hollywood version was a boring soap opera which was set aboard the simply so that some exciting and dramatic scenes could be tacked on at the endthis one is more like the hollywood version only with a budget extended to the power of n what a wreck in some shots the ship doesnt seem the size of a manmade artifact at all it seems impossibly huge twenty leagues long when the stern rises into the air and a figure falls from the fantail the figure dwindles down toward the sea which seems a million miles away and vanishes except for a minuscule white spot marking its splash point the in this movie is colossal stupendous magnificent gargantuan or  in a word before the fxresplendent climax we endure a romance between a lowerclass handsome young man and a pretty rich young lady now few people realize this but this is the first cinematic exploration of the theme of true love overcoming class distinctions yes its true love conquers all and you can be sure that threepence or so will be no more than grist for its millthe films full of stereotypical character and theyre not worth going into well one example  the wealthy coward who tries to buy his way into a lifeboat more examples there are so many here are the two lovers clinging to the flagstaff as they plung into the see this is where we first met she says breathlessly earlier the couple find a brand new automobile in the cargo he leaps into the drivers seat and beeps the ancient horn gaily as in a walt disney movie she sits elegantly in the coach where to he asks take me to the stars she chirps theres a subplot involving a stolen jewel straight out of basil rathbones sherlock holmes movies basically this is a megabuck special effects extravaganza built around a bmovie scriptso much is lost like the irony of the california sitting a few miles away watching and misinterpreting the distress rockets the piling up of personal telegrams that kept the radio officer too busy to tend to the ice warningsthe disaster was an interesting lesson in sociology though factually speaking women and children only right very gentlemanly very edwardianand most of the women in first class passage were in fact saved a far lesser proportion of women and kids in second class were saved and only a handful from third class you can actually measure the relative impact of social class gender and agei dont want to make this film sound like the catastrophe that the first voyage was if you liked say pearl harbor youll probably like this it has pretty much the same structuretheres something else that occurred to me while watching this though when should we just leave the real alone some years ago telly savalas was featured in a tv program called something like treasures from the in which he displayed and described items retrieved from the wreck and the surrounding sea floor savalas gave his best imitation of a carnival barker you know smiling holding up a boot for the camera pronouncing this was somebodys shoe imagine someone wearing this shoe as the stately liner made its final descent the disarticulated carcass of the is a giant necropolis filled with human remains and who knows benthic ghosts its a burial ground of sorts should we really go searching among the bodies for watches and gold teeth,sad
why is this the biggest grossing movie of all times why was this movie academy awardedi cannot tell in all honesty maybe its just me being male and stuff i was told by women how unromantic it was not to love this moviethere is nothing new to the moviegoer here we have a disaster happening almost everybody will die at the end of the movie  and hey we know all about it even before going to the movie and as with every proper disaster movie we will get to know everybody so we care when they dieproblem here after having to watch the cast for what seemed to me like 3 hours i really looked forward for the ship to sink,sad
your average american loves this is why they are considered average this movie is unimpressive in every possible way from the bland acting to the bland script this movie is well bland the script by the way was cowritten by james cameron and the captain of the girls tetherball team from the local junior high schoolthe only extraordinary thing about this film is the special effects a boat sinks a really big boat it looks really really real           but its still just a boat sinking not that excitingall in all this is a movie geared towards illiterate 12 year old girls,sad
many teenage girls with too much time on their hands apparently were furious with the academy for not even nominating leonardo dicaprio for a best actor award  well ladies i can tell you why  he stunk  that year people like jack nicholson and matt damon were nominated and for good reason they know how to actthe rest of the cast in was brilliant  they portrayed people from early this century  in contrast dicaprio came acted like some aw shucks kid from 1997  he didnt blend at all making his performance the weakest part of this film  add that to a story thats been told a million times over and becomes a weak movie overall,sad
ive seen some shockers in my time but this excuse for a film takes the cake  i had some respect for cameron and winslet before this one but all that was ruined by  easily the academys biggest mistake of recent years and certainly the aforementioned film stars i had little respect for dicaprio however so he isnt tainted any more billy zane must have been desperate as even if hes not the best actor around hes still a popular choice for me a script that couldnt have been recycled into toilet paper combined with bad acting and a bad story make a disaster rather than a disaster movie  for a good romance check the princess bride and for disaster see a good war movie  try gallipoli,sad
well its been a year since my last review of this film this is review 3  i saw on the big screen in 1997 and bought the dvd when it came out which i still watch from time to time maybe about twiceyearstill works for me as an epic spectacle and blockbuster  the love story is ok i dont really care this is the movie to watch for eye candy and epic scope not emotion  i never did get caught up in any sobby or sentimental emotions with this film  the overall story isnt bad yes some of the lines are cheesy and the dialog is corny so what  the low point of the film has to be dicaprio sinking beneath the waves not sad at all to me but so whatstands as a fabulous spectacle and a great movie watching experience  the years have not diminished that in the least and the special effects couldnt be done any better today than they were in 1997 the nitpickers are still picking sentimentalists are still getting outraged at the realists bashing the film and im still sitting back and enjoying a couple times a year a film that was highly overrated at the oscars so what else is new but where every penny of the budget shows on the screen the spectacle of it the scope it can sweep you away  turn your brain off turn the lights down and enjoy on the biggest possible screen910 pieces of popcorn from this 38 year old male,sad
such a classic romantic film this will always be a great film the story and characters give a great feel to the movie,sad
in every age mankind attempts to fabricate great works at once magnificent and impossible  the musical like the itself this movie is a masterpiece that stands the age of time it gives me the shivers every time i watch it i love this film not for the love story but for the depiction of every passenger on board you see the hopefulness in every one when boarding not knowing what awaits ahead and you see the tragic horrors unfold as the sunk cameron portrayed the human condition when everyone fights to survive and the social differences very wellconsidering this is a 1997 film its still better than a lot of new films today both storywise and special effects wise,sad
a typical james cameron movie ie all style no substance and excruciatingly long plot is basic  love story set against the tragedy thats it just basically drifts for 325 hours around that central plot the direction is all about the amazing special effects another cameron trademarkon the plus side leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet are excellent in the lead roles and their interaction is spoton this movie pretty much launched their careers well in dicaprios case shifted it up several notches,sad
the work done off screen was completely worth it i suggest you check the trivia of the movie to understand that this movie deserves all the oscars it got and more it is a timeless movie with strong acting ive heard people complain bout the acting of the main actors but without strong acting the movie would have never succeeded as much as it did leonardo dicaprio was born for the role of jack dawson he makes the audience fall in love with him rapidly and not just because of his looks kate winslet represents well the role of a young girl in need of freedom everything about the movie was outstanding the setting is a very similar replica too the actual rms it is very realistic since several characters did in fact exist the special effect are great seeing in 3d must be quite the experience the music my heart will go on also one of my favorite songs i dont believe there is anything bad to say other than why did jack have to die couldnt they write a happy ending why make people sad when you have the power to make them cry of joy instead i love you jack rose dont let go of jack once you overcome the extreme feeling of sadness and anger because jack was too nice and died you realize that the movie is amazing perfect in every sense of the word,sad
i am guilty i am guilty of raving about this stupendously horrendous film initially it took awhile to well sink in history wont forgive james cameron who had the nerve to take one of the biggest tragedies and reduce it to a sappy love storyjust imagine yourself as one of the passengers on that illfated ship imagine the helplessness the horror you experienced before drowning now imagine someone showing you this flick which makes it look like this disaster was all about a pair of stupid lovebirds who thought they were at their charming best in a spitting contest god knows im sorry we all should be,sad
i detested this movie so much when i first saw it that i really wanted to give it one star but as bad as i still think it is it is fairly wellmade and at least the technical department earned their salaries here though quite frankly i thought that some of the cgi effects screamed fake louder than the scale models used by roy ward baker in 1958s a night to remember what sinks this movie for me pun very much intended is the fictional love story forcibly inserted by cameron doubtless with the cynical intention of attracting teenage girls which it did by the millionswhen oscar time rolled around hollywood apparently decided that 1997 was the year to call the movie that made the most money best picture to say nothing of the other ten oscars it won plus three nominations now i have not seen every movie ever to win the best picture oscar but of all the ones i have seen this one has to be the least deserving of the honorfor starters aside from the fictional romance there is nothing new here i made mention above of roy ward bakers 1958 film a night to remember which is the definitive dramatic film about the disaster there are no fictional characters no romantic heroes or heroines baker chose to tell the story plainly in an almost documentary fashion that still carries a huge wallop fiftytwo years latercamerons film by comparison though it is wonderful to look at obviously no expense was spared from costumes to special effects is a curiously cold and uninvolving piece of work except for when leo and kate are on the screen camerons fatal mistake was that he forgot that the disaster was a reallife human drama roy ward baker knew this and his film fully an hourandahalf shorter than this one yet manages to show the terrible loss of humanity of all classes that terrible night camerons film has little feeling for any of the subsidiary characters with a couple of exceptions such as a lusty kathy bates delightful as the unsinkable molly brown and gloria stuart who at eightyeight came out of retirement to play rose at age one hundredoneunfortunately these bright spots are too far and few between in a much toolong movie that cannot escape the fact that the central romance is uninteresting at best and irritating at worst cameron shows a shameless disregard for his actors in this film leonardo dicaprio is not the least bit convincing as a young man from 1912 he comes across as a typical california brat who grew up eating sugar pops kate winslet a terrific actress is horribly misused here left to her own devices she often fails to find the right notes most noticeably towards the end when she and leo climb the ship to the nearvertical stern and she turns to him and squeals this is where we first met the line is awful in and of itself especially in the context of that moment but had she delivered it with tears streaming down her cheeks and a great deal of pathos it might have been palatable instead she sounds like a teenage girl going to a highschool dancethere are a few other good performances in the supporting cast in addition to the two i have mentioned but unfortunately they and the rest of what was a truelife story of hubris heroics class divisions and selfsacrifice are buried under the cheap datemovie romance that cameron inserted ill give him credit for one thing he knew that the love story was what would keep the viewers coming back had he chosen to simply tell the true story i dont know if the film would have sunk faster than the ship did but it most certainly would not have gotten all the undeserved acclaim that it did,sad
this movie right here is overrating in its primethe most compelling movie of the century thats a jokemy question is why why cameron why did you do it youre way better than this but since cameron created some cinematic masterpieces like the terminator and aliens im willing to let this one slide you got lucky this time cameronthis movie was nothing but one misplaced drama scene after another and it wasnt like you could sit through them easily either this movie was more than 3 hours long i understand that a lot of people liked this movie and that maybe im being biased but i really did not like this garbagedont get me wrong there were some very good scenes and some music score that was decent but the tear jerker moments grew tiresome quickly why are billy zane and bill paxton wasting their time here good scenes and some interesting plot points could not save this mess of a bad drama im sorry but this hollywood trash reeks and stains the true story of the almost to the point of disgracing itif you like too much drama and romance badly put together with bad acting by leonardo dicaprio is what you want410,sad
when it comes to pure visual spectacle is one of the best movies ever made but the love story is great as well leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet have such wonderful chemistry that it makes the occasionally poor dialogue tolerable their scenes together are some of the most memorable moments in romantic movie historyhowever the visuals steal the show the scenes of the sinking are some of the most beautiful yet terrible scenes ever filmed beautiful because it looks so real and terrible because we know this actually happened but thats not to say the love story is shoved into the background the romance takes up most of the film and their tragic ending is one that is sure to draw tears from the sensitive onesoverall the film is wellacted visually masterful and unforgettably romantic by now it is an absolute classic and in my opinion it certainly deserved its best picture win at the oscars,sad
this movie is so so overrated it boggles my mind how this piece of garbage was voted best picture over la confidential in 97 the acting in this film is beyond poor with billy zane yes billy zane giving the only decent piece of acting in this movie this movie is comparable to pearl harbor in where we have a historic event get skewed by some sappy bogus love story about a misunderstood painter i was surprised and jubilant to find that this movie is out of the top 250 on imdb as voted by its users thankfully many other educated users agree with me herein closing do not waste your time on this film if you enjoy any realistic moviemaking james cameron should stick to the terminator 210,sad
there are many who say is overrated overhyped or some might inexplicably go as far to say boring and pointless the hardly arguable biggest blockbuster of the 90s grossing near 2 billion at the box office and winning 11 academy awards including best picture has attained some hate from people over the years people who love to hate this movie for everything they so wrongly think it is not and never will be it has however attained a very positive social status among a lot of people whom their hearts were captured by this masterpiece those people can see just how magnificent of a movie this really is and how underrated a classic it appears to be in todays film society a dazzling and striking accomplishment in itself and never overlooked but unfairly maligned by manythe movie aside from being set on the and called actually has a love story that renders up most of the movie time as most would already know this love story is positively brilliant in every sense of the word i am always amazed and captivated to watch it play out on screen because leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet who were furiously snubbed out of best actoractress awards have wonderful chemistry giving me chills in lots of scenes and they both separately give incredulous performances that enthrall and charm every step of the way as well these two characters strong likability along with james camerons directing and the entirely fascinating special effects make this movie something much more than mere entertainment the movie is excellently executed in the best manner it could be the bill paxton and gloria stuart present day story being very interesting as well and a lot of the films aspects are quite simply riveting and aweinspiring whether its the love story the intensity in all the performances or the infamous brilliantly portrayed sinking and sets that give true heart to the story of the and shows its revelation quite undeniably like any other film on the subjectwhile my heart will go on receiving the academy award for best original song has attained some criticism from people as well it makes the perfect score and theme song for every scene it is used in regarding the movie especially the climax which has had millions in tears had me in tears and always has me in tears when i watch it even if it is not the saddest movie of all time because it isnt its a film about love a film about disaster a film about memories and it is beautifully shown how all of those three attributes tie into peoples lives but i am not melancholy i am merely pleased with how stunning of a film it is and how remarkably well it has held up over the years not being overthrown by any blockbusters in recent years in likes of quality in my honest opinion james cameron even if not one of my favorite directors is very talented and it shows with this movie i do not understand a lot of the reasons why so many hate this or do not find it as remarkable of a film as fans like me do but i ensure you this movie will always have a place in my heart and will go down as a classic already has even and will contine to whether haters like it or not because of how many people were touched by it and are still touched by it underrated powerful breathtaking movie that since holding up in quality on every watch i intend to love for many more years to come,sad
i think this is one of the wort movies i have ever seen an awful script combined with awful actors the only thing i found more valuable are the special effects but on a 200 million dollars movie this is obvious i simply cant understand why so many people loved this movie it has nothing to be remembered the car scene is the most remembered but not because of his quality i really think this film is too too bad awfully awful i recommend you to not watch it because you will regret of it you will waste your money thats all if you want to see the worst movie ever you have to see it but if you dont,sad
well maybe thats a slight stretch  but hey im sure there were and are numerous good reasons for this movies unprecedented success like mainly the invincible combination of two hot young actors an established actionadventure director a bloated budget that nevertheless served to show off some seriously cuttingedge sets costumes effects etc a classic love story set against one of the most tragic backdrops in earlytwentiethcentury history and of course leading from all aforementioned reasons the sheer curiosity from countless critics and moviegoers alike to see just exactly what all the hype was about  which obviously paid off making it the highestgrossing film worldwide still after nearly a decade and one of three tied record holders for the most oscars won by a filmyes i understand that boxoffice status does not necessarily reflect quality though i think recent failed releases like deuce bigalow european gigolo prove otherwise however im of the opinion that maybe  just maybe  the massive mainstream viewing public got it right one time,sad
why did this movie made 600million dollars at the box officeits because you people loved itwhy is this movie only rate 69 out of 10its because 10 000 people in the world didnt like it and those 10 000 votes on imdb and the hole world wouldve voted on imdb for this movie wouldve been and 88 out of 10why is this movie not in the top 250well because there is not enough voters on imdbi dont know why people didnt like this wonderful masterpiecemaybe because you dont like love stories and who ever doesnt shouldnt of watch this one then and go do bad comments on itand maybe people didnt like it because it is a remake well get over it i like this one way more then the 1953 version and plus i like all the remakes because if iwonna watch walking tall well i have the choice between the good one or the bad onei dont know why people didnt like the storyi think the story is great there couldnt of been a better one that shows the gigantic boat sink in the middle of the atlanticevery thing is wonderful about this movie the actorsthe characters the music the visual effects the scenery and every thing elseleonardo dicaprio shouldve gotten en award for his great performance and kate winslet shouldve gotten one too,sad
overwrought all the way through nicely shot not too bad for acting but predictable overthetop sentimentality kills what could still have been a great plot with suspense and surprise instead its so predictable as to be boring the effects are good at the end but theyre hardly worth sitting through the rest of it to get there borrow somebodys dvd and skip to the sinking then find a good flick on the tube,sad
perhaps the most overblown and ridiculous flick i have sat through also did picassos les demoiselles davignon really go down on the i thought it was hanging in the museum of modern art in new york am i the only person who thought this was odd then again the movie was so unbalanced and ill thought out that this doesnt seem out of place,sad
so much hype the acting was just terrible people flocked to this movie like sheep the dialogue was so contrived how could people not notice it is a shame this movie is seen as romantic rather than as the monstrosity it is,sad
i saw this one in the movie theater and kept cringing through the whole film this film is so full of moments and actors etc which done a little differently would have made me like the film perhaps the film isnt giglibad it is fairly typical of camerons new found style of making three digit milj  budget films i liked the original terminator it worked even if it sometimes looks a bit dated the looks outdated already and it doesnt have much going for itself except the remnants of the marketing campaign 110,sad
my job requires me to travel every week to some other part of the country and i usually come home on the weekends this summer i traveled from washington to california every week so twice a week i was on a 5 hour flight i will not mention the airline but they decided to capitalize on popularity and show it as many times as they could well guess what i ended up having to sit through a total of 6 times this must be what hell is like i had to sit through a movie 6 times more than i wanted to see it i saw it at the movies friends payed for the ticket because i wouldnt see it otherwise and i thought to myself what a crappy movie but after being subjected to a whole month of cameron and leo i hate this movie more than anything else in existence you see the flights im on either have one big screen for the whole cabin or strategicaly placed monitors so even if you dont rent the headset you still have to be subjected to the visual majesty of those of you who dont like this movie dont need me to tell you whats wrong with it and those who love it probably wont get past a review that doesnt start with this is the greatest film ever so i just wanted to share my experience and offer to you this little questionwhat if you were trapped in a room where where your eyes were taped open and you had to experience over and over and over and over and over,sad
for a movie that had so much money wasted on it i found the very expensive computer animation to be quite bad have you watched jurassic park recently and thought hey that dinosaur animation looks really fake now when it looked impressive the first time you saw it  i think that is how the animation in will look like in a couple of yearsyou will notice that the computerised people in the film have perfectly spherical heads they waddle rather than walk and they all waddle in exactly the same way its a bit like watching a synchronised dancers in a music video because the computer animation scenes were interspersed with live action scenes i found the jumps between the two jarred a lot lighting and fog levels did not match very well between the two computer animation technology is capable of much more than demonstratedin a few years will look cheap  but just like jurassic park people went to see it for the special effects unfortunately the special effects will not last the test of time and with such a weak storyline this is not a movie that will become a classic,sad
when i first heard that james cameron was going to make a film about i had big expectations i thought that it was going to be a movie that would stun me sadly it was a big disappointment the movie never interested me i was bored and never stunned by the special effects the sinking of was a disaster and cameron never gave me the impression that it was a disaster i never saw real emotions it all came down on overacting and commercial emotions i guess for someone who doesnt see as many movies as i do will be a great movie the movie never worked up to its expections and it never showed why it had cost so much money i think most people love the film because the commercials told them it was the greatest movie ever also the acting of both main characters was below every expectation this is proven by the fact that none of them won an acadamy award,sad
i was impressed with detail they put into the facts of the circumstances and the detail to the time period  but the dialogue was cliched and predictable plus the acting was not at its best,sad
a tear jerking fiction based on a diaster long on boring details with a plot that any grade 1 student can write complete with totally lousy acting terrible screenplay and over rated directing worst movie of the century a must see movie if you have a sleeping disorderthe money spent to make this movie could feed millions of starving childrenjohn cameron maybe an okay director but cannot hold a candle to robert wise,sad
how on earth this movie gets this all noise and fame its simple because its a silly love storyjust like  love  it self this movie is way too sloppy to be overratedi give it 1  stupid tai tenet,sad
was massive and so is the movie watched it again after a long time still as pure as in 1997love emotions sacrifices dialogue screenplay actingand slowly movie will takeover youyou can watch this after a decade too it will feel as fresh as before kate and leo is wonderful as rose and jackmovie depict the downfall of huge and evergreen love story of jack and rose and james you nailed itand wait a love story cant be completed without a song celine dion did a true justice for this moviereally a masterpiecewhether you like watching love stories or not do watch thisi bet you wont get disappointedits a must watch before you die,sad
is my personal favorite filmever it uses the best special effects and technology of its time and even though those aspects are outdated now i still find myself drawn in im drawn in after so many years because of the great talent of kate winslet and leo dicaprio and their great chemistry together those two combined with the fantastic music artistic direction storyline along with the technological aspects ive already mentioned creates an incomparable cinematic experience i have never been so captivated by a single piece of media before or since i think its the bestbottom line,sad
my name is brian joseph bonish i was 6 years old when i first saw this movie in 2002 i absolutely loved it it is the best movie that i have ever seen in my entire life i watch it all the time it reminds me of cape may my second home and i never was sure why and i still dont know but it makes me so happy i feel a true connection with the movie i could watch this movie and only this movie for the rest of my life and never get sick of it i love it so much there is no movie in the world that is better than it it is so romantic and dramatic and the two blend together so perfectly that it makes the whole movie such a beautiful piece of life for me and this movie has brought so much light to my life i love it so much with a burning passion brian joseph bonish the number one fan in the world,sad
ever since i saw avatar i began to develop a strong respect for james cameron so when i found out he was the genius behind the cinematic legend that is i got excitedthe film is really well written i love the way it is told in flashbackit begins with a group of presentday treasure hunters exploring the wreckage of the which results in some brilliant underwater footage they find an old safe thats completely empty save for a drawing of a woman an elderly woman suddenly phones them and says shes the woman in the picture she then tells the divers and her granddaughter the main plot of the filmone thing that i really like as well about the flashback format is the editing each time the film always shifts between the past or present via a match cut such as a video of the wreckage of the in the present day changing into the before it left in 1912 or a closeup shot of oung roses eye to the eye of the elderly rose in the presentthe characters are all really well developed i love how the film manages to blend some of the real historical figures ie the crew of the with fictional characters ie rose jack and yet it is still incredibly believable as if this really was a true story the story is largely focused on the relationship between rose and jack but the film constantly manages to develop other characters even the presentday characters are really well developedthe story is very well written and i love the way how it changes in tone throughout the film starts off exciting with many people excited yet still manages to portray rose in a somewhat sympathetic role a large portion of it is the romance between jack and rose but the film manages to have some dramatic scenes with a large subplot of the story being the conflict between rose and the rest of her upperclass family the film even manages to include a bit of humour here and there but doesnt take it too far however everything changes near the end when we have the iceberg and all of a sudden the film becomes very dark and tragicthe climax is very impressive it takes place once the hits the iceberg at this point the film manages to successfully shift focus between different people it manages to focus on the protagonists but also manages to focus on the chaos and tension as the ship sinks and the crew struggle to keep order and get the passengers off safely it brilliantly manages to capture the tragedy and horror of the disasteroverall this movie is a cinematic masterpiece and one that you definitely should see if you havent already,sad
the first time i happened to watch the movie i was barely into my teenage years and barely out of primary school naturally what i found to be most appealing apart from the delights of a naked kate winslet was the brilliant way in which this true human tragedy had been brought on screen  the grand sets the accurate reproduction the seamless special effects in case youre wondering i grew up to be an engineer it left quite a mark on me  i confess to have seen hundreds of documentaries on how and why the unsinkable ship dropped to the bottom of the ocean on its maiden voyage so much so that i had become a selfprofessed guru on any and every factoid many repeat viewings later ive developed a slightly different perspective towards this piece of cinema that still never ceases to amaze me im in my twenties now and have had my fair share of experiences  crush heartbreak love et al all the necessary experiences that are a prerequisite for one to truly appreciate the worlds favourite chickflick ive realized that with time my favourite portions from the movie have changed whereas earlier i would happily skip the first half but never fail to catch the second now i find myself to be fonder of the first hour and even fonder of the last half a part of the reason would be the advancement in digital effects since that time which have given me the ability to grudgingly spot sections where the seamless computer effects dont seem to be so well seamless any morethe main reason however is that ive developed something akin to an emotional bond with this film its brilliance lies in the way it manages to tell the story of a very personal tragedy while always focusing on and never diluting the epic tragedy that was the and the moment where it never fails to touch a chord relax its not the moment of jacks death  im not even that clichd is when the now rather old and spotty rose tells her listeners i dont even have a picture of him he exists now only in my memory a simple yet beautiful and poignant moment one that we can all relate with especially for those among us who particularly cherish their memories whatever they be memories always leave a mark and sometimes they leave behind scars such that ever so often a single instance can stay with us for an entire lifetime memories shape us mould us and are an integral part in the development and continued growth of what is known as an emotionally intelligent being they truly are the human part within us animalsthen is really quite a reflection of the true power of human memory,sad
ive seen this movie plenty of times about the time it was released well a few years later about 1999 but its not so important the point is i was about 10 or 11 years at this time but now in the german christmas tv programme i saw this movie again only partly but i was amazed of it i became aware of things i didnt became aware of in this young age as there were 01 it might sound a bit bathetic but is a really romantic film its kind of a love manifesto there are two people who really love each other with all consequences this is really great to see this true and honest love between two people which you dont see too often in real life even though this is just a movie02 when you look a bit behind this romantic facade is also a deeply social critical movie on the one side it shows those affectedly luxury and all those needless problems of the rich as well as the belief that with enough money you can buy anything we had an arrangement mr murdoch on the other side you see the misery of the third class people you see how they are trapped in the sinking ship like animals and you see how the rich are treated much better only because they have money but on the other hand there is rose who only cares about jack dawsons personality and not about his financial situation03 the last thing i love at this movie is quite simple it is a great document of one of the sadest stories in younger human history it shows it all in detail the arrogance of the white star line people the desperation of the passengers as the ship is sinking the fight for their life the desperate try to find other ships to help all showed really realistic and also strictly written after the reports of survivors i think those whole thing is very interesting and so i like the movie for showing the happenings of this evening very realistic and fascinating,sad
when someone mentions 90s blockbuster movies one of the first things said is alwaysthe 1997 movie staring leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet broke boxoffice records both in the usa and internationally still holding the record as the highest boxoffice grossing movie internationally by 482400000 leading over lord of the rings return of the king it won 11 academy awards tying it with benhur for the most one by any single movie it was nominated for 14 oscars it had another 76 wins and 47 nominationsthe acting was great not wonderful but still very good in every sense of the word not only by kate and leonardo but many people on the cast that were overshadowed by the stars gloria stuart gives a heartbreaking performance in her return to the screen victor garber portrayed thomas andrews and did a magnificent job his best scene being the meeting between ismay ej smith and himself andrews declaring will founder the main story in itself is one that has been told a million times over a poor boy and a rich girl meet by chance and soon fall in love but her parents will not allow it because of social order has one thing going for it as it tells this story the backdrop of history and tragedy tied into one as the lovers meet on the illfated ship we are introduced to rose dewitt bukater a young woman of society who is engaged to caledon hockley the son of a rich steel tycoon we find

of 100 who upon seeing a drawing on television decides to contact brock lovett a salvager who is exploring the he is the one who found the drawing and kept it only because he noticed that the woman in the picture is wearing a diamond necklace rose and her granddaughter lizzy are brought upon brocks ship where she tells the crew she is the woman in the picture brock then tells them the diamond is said to have gone down with the ship and would be worth more than the hope diamond if discovered rose says nothing but starts into her account of what happened during her experience withjack and rose continue to grow to love after he saves her from death rose tries to deny her feelings for him but cant help herself despite threats made by both her fiance and mother she longs to be like jack free and independent something she has never done before she tries her hardest to do this by having jack draw her nude wearing only the blue diamond necklace her fiance cal bought for her this is the drawing brock finds 84 years later but fate has a twisted hand of cards making cal frame jack into stealing the diamond and having him being locked away rose chooses to believe cal but not for long she soon comes back for him saving him from being drownedthey continue their race for survival staying on the ship until the bitter end despite a gun chase by cal and his manservant lovejoy and rose choosing to jump off the lifeboat and back onto for she cant leave jack behind it is at this point rose realizes that she does love jack greeting him with the words you jump i jump right subsequently they continue trying to stay alive as the glorious ship is destroyed the band is shown playing their final song nearer my god to thee making for a emotional montagefinally as the ship goes under jack ushers rose to a broken door it can only hold one of them and he offers it to her they listen to the screams until it gets quiet and jack realizes that he will die soon his final words tell rose to keep on living not to let herself die he makes her promise never to give up and not to let go of that promise she agrees saying that shell never let go a light appears out of the darkness and rose barely clinging to life tries to awaken jack to tell him theres a boat coming back but theres no use as she is shocked by his death she remembers her promise to keep on living so leaves him there in the ocean saying once more shell never let go old rose then speaks of how the 700 saved people floating in lifeboats were waiting to die to live and for an absolution that would never come it then shows her walking on the deck of brocks research ship standing on the railing to show that she had the diamond brock had spent three years searching for another flashback is here showing young rose feeling the pocket of the jacket cal put on her feeling in the pocket and pulling out the diamond old rose then looks at the deep blue diamond one more time then tosses it into the oceanthere are many ways to interpret the ending of the movie in my opinion she passes away old rose is seen going to sleep then cutting to a dream sequence where young rose and jack are reunited on and then a cut to a bright light on the dvd the name of that scene is called a promise kept,sad
at the first time i watchedi didnt like it very much because i was 11 years old and i was not a big fan of romance the only thing i remember that i payed attention and really liked at that time was the sinkinglaugh well 8 years have been passed and now more mature and having read about the real accident i can say that i enjoyed this movie very much the romance between jackdicaprio and rosewinslet is fictional but make the movie be even more dramaticsince we have a chance of be closer of some people in the story the way the movie begins showing some people making the search of and even some shots of the ship forgot in the sea is very interesting and in the last scene when the old rose dies its a beautiful and symbolic scene to see her meeting again jack and all the people that were killed in disaster againpsthis is one of the movies that i saw kate winslet and i found her astonishing,sad
now firstly i was impressed at the effort put into this film however after seeing it i have come to this conclusion this would be a great movie were it not for the lack of originality what you see here is an ancient plot line marketed on the blood of people who died in this tragedy if you want to see a similar film get out romeo and juliet another dicaprio film which contains exactly the same appalling rigid acting from young leonardo and practically the same plot line boy meets girl girl already engaged or to be engaged with a fatal divide in rj its the family divide montigues and capulets in it is the barrier between the rich and the poor the only reason this desecration of shakespeares work romeo and juliet  boat sold is because it had special effects involving the sinking of the liner the that was its usp what else is there the story already covered that the acting hell no a girl in one of my classes at college was praising the writer on such an imaginative story  how did he come up with the idea of creating this story of a large ship sinking and adding love now dont get me wrong i wouldnt base this review on one silly girls remark but if you reverse that there was no creativity in it the only creativity involved was part of the tarnishing of the past of real people who were on the boat the man who shot himself for killing a passenger it didnt happen he gave his life to save others where is the conscience of the hollywood pigs who tainted this guys past the best part of this film was the end and i love this film solely for the sweet consolation of the absolute poorness of this film that is the drawn out death of the character that is jack dawson,sad
good film overall the plot is good too however there are mistakes within the film itself eg 1 the fact that when rose is arriving in new york half asleep she looks at the statue of liberty which is the colour green but if you visit the statue of liberty youll find a plate telling you that the original colour was brown and it took over 35 years for it to change colour the statue of liberty was placed there in 1886 so in 1912 it should have still been partly brown eg 2 in the engine room as the ship is sinking the smoke and steam coming from the machinery rises at the same angle as the ship about 45 degrees so the shot was filmed level then tilted afterwards,sad
this movie is the biggest waste of an opportunity of all time it could have been a great movie about one of the greatest tragedies in history they didnt even focus on the ship at all it was like two and a half of hours of some crappy romance movie and then at the end the director was like oh yeah and the is sinking could have been a great historicaldisaster flick the only reason it is the highest selling movie of all time is cuz prepubescent girls saw it 100 times because leo is so hot instead they chose to focus only on two people in a ridiculously cheesy and clichish love story between a poor boy and a rich girl could have been one of the best movies everis one of the worst extremeley disappointed dont watch it or you will be too,sad
i have said it before and ill say it again along with gone with the wind are two of the most overated films in history with no plot stupid characters and irritating dialoge think romeo and juliet aboard the and that best sums up this three hour plus filmcontinues to be one of the biggest movies of all time why on earth did moviegoers pick this mess to be a hit it involves a very spoiled and irritating girl known as rose played by kate winslet who goes aboard a state of the art ship known as the with her snotty finacee played by billy zane she doesnt care for him so she hooks up with a drifterartist named jack played by leonardo dicaprio the majority of the film is about jack and rose trying to avoid her fiancee while the ship itself hits an iceberg and sinks killing many of the passengers aboard the reason why so many teenage girls went crazy for this film is because it has a story that only a teenage girl could love with its simplistic dialoge and cliched characters i was hoping by the end that rose herself would be hit by an iceberg as her character was really becoming annoying fastnow what bothers many moviegoers is that instead of being about the ship itself and the people who died the film focuses on another silly 90210 teen romance we have seen this type of romantic film hundreds of times before and the romance in is about as interesting as a can of flat sodawhile there are some nice costumes and effects work done on the sinking of the ship audiences must endure over two and a half hours of some of the most irritating and cliched dialoge ever written im just a tumbleweed blowing through the wind as well as a lot of boredom waiting for the ship to sink i had to be woken up by my wife when the ship sank while seeing it on dvd i never saw it in theaters because no film could live up to that amount of hype and after finally seeing it on dvd i was right everyone i have talked to says that seeing the movie on the big screen makes a bigger difference in the special effects well i have a hdtv big screen and thats about as close to a motion picture screen you can get watching a home video dvdall in all rose isnt a woman searching for herself but rather a spoiled brat looking for attention and i never related to jack one bit i guess the only characters who i felt any real sympathy for were the captain and the ships designer as the film doesnt really focus on any of the real victims of the event other than the ficticious jack and rosei enjoy some of james camerons films true lies and strange days which he wrote are two of the best action films of the 1990s but wasnt the classic many have hailed it to bea 1 on a scale of 110 if you want to see a real film about the rent the original not this awful messsure most teenage girls will go crazy over this but ill take good will hunting anyday over this mess,sad
sweeps aside every great work of the cinema blinding us all with its amazing incompetencethe script for this film is dry dead wood floating around an icebergthe pace is so slow that there is no escaping the sheer horror of this parade of stereotypes and cliches not a line works history is ignored and rewritten according to the directors egocentric vision this is a dreadful film dreadful beyond beliefthat it is also one of the most successful in the history of the cinema says something very sour to me about human intelligence i only hope and pray that the reason for its success can be laid at the heel of leomania i would hate to think that there are people who liked the film for itself,sad
as normal i break with most people i know since they generally loved this movie i didnt like it at all for a large number of reasonsfirst of all it was too long they showed detail in scenes that did not need detail and even within the movie they rehashed scenes multiple times in fact it almost felt like the second half of the movie was a poorlydone sequel to the first half of the movie in the first half we saw way too much detail about the daily life on the ship most of which i found boring and not worthy of my time to watch  in the second half we saw a 90 minute pseudodocumentary of the sinking of the an event which even in real life only took 2 hours so basically james cameron showed us almost every single minute of the sinking this is poor from a technical dramatic standpoint good drama glosses over the boring nittygritty details to focus on the important stuff cameron decided to show the nittygritty details with as much care and attention as the important sequences some interpret this as great attention to detail i dont see it that way i see it as boring depiction of events that are neither relevant to the plot nor worthy of my time to witnessthis brings us to my second complaint about this movie the plot basically this was a glorified very expensive version of the old tv show the love boat indeed most episodes of love boat that i can recall were of a higher caliber plotwise and dialogwise than this movie was i thought the dialog was forced and stale and did not ring true at all cameron was too present in the movie  that is i felt that he was forcing the characters to do exactly what he wanted rather than having events take their natural course probably this is because he was depicting something based in truth the sinking of the and so he had no choice about where the overall story would end up the ship sinks  i assume this is not a spoiler for anyone heh heh thus he had to force the part of the story that leads up to the sinking in a certain direction and he did this in a poor manner that was too blatant and made the whole thing seem artificiali also thought both the principle actors kate winslett leo dicaprio turned in terrible performances i didnt really believe in either of them worse yet they annoyed me and their characters really irritated me this is a terrible flaw in a disaster movie if you dislike the characters to which the disaster in this case the sinking of the ship is going to happen then you really dont care whether they live or die in fact i was actually rooting for both of them to die because by the end of the film they had irritated me enough that it was the only way i thought id get any satisfactioni will admit that the film had excellent special effects normally i like special effects movies i even dont mind ones that openly honestly have no interest in plot characters or story however had none of those things except special effects but tried to pretend like it did its that presumptuousness that really irritated me the movie so blatantly lavish scenes were so clearly done just to show they could do it that i could sense the arrogance of cameron and the entire cast and crew in every scenethis movie was a big waste of more than 3 hours of my time my rating 110,sad
this film must be one of the seven plagues theres no escape from it even though anyone can see the script was bad the acting preposterous and the characters ludicrous i still have no idea how this film could be seen as great when the far better a night to remember has been forgotten by almost everyone,sad
we waited until it was on video to watch it suspecting rightly that the stars would be agonizing and the story ridiculous and it was a relief to be able to fast forward through the silly parts but the visual detail of the ship was impressive in fact we thought it was a shame the ship couldnt have been the star  what a movie they could have made centered around the physicality of the ship its size and power its ultiimate demise perhaps using the ships officers and crew in multiple interlocking stories,sad
i have grown quite sick of this movie and the celiene deon song  if there wasnt some much said about it i probably would have liked it more frankly the dialogue and much of the plot was silly  the way they told the story by starting in the present was quite interesting and compared to other disaster films its outstanding but best movie of all time no,sad
what can you say about a film that believes its own hype james cameron script writer and director has attempted to tackle many social issues but has failed at every attempt all english people are either dim or evil all other nationalities are downtrodden and good the message of this movie appears to be that money is the root of all evil however he probably felt very differently when he was given a budget for this turkey although the special effects were impressive i found my jaw dropping not so much at the effects but at the appalling script and juvenile plot line this could be renamed the poseidon adventure in frocks but the poseidon adventure was much better than this film will ever be all in all was a giant ego trip for cameron  one which the academy fell for hook line and sinker,sad
anachronistic dialogue pathetic direction did they really all sleep through it at oscar time  impossible behaviour for that day and time absolutely nothing worth spending any money on  even the sets and costumes reeked of ineptitude and a vast failure in researchnot even leonardo dicaprio such an excellent young actor in films likegilbert grape can overcome the soggy asinine totally erroneous script and amateur direction of james cameron who should go back to alpo dog food commercialsi have heard that people have seen it more than once  they must have gone back to count the howlers,sad
this is by far the most overrated movie of all time it won something like 13 academy awards simply based on box office grosses how do i know this because it came out the same year as la confidential one of the greatest crime dramas ever made the set design and direction of are actually very good well the set design is amazing however the acting is so bad it makes me wonder how leonardo dicaprio was ever a good actorthe basketball diaries whats eating gilbert grape kate winslet wasnt bad but surely overrated billy zane plays a cartoon villain very poorly not that he ever proved he was a good actorthe phantom and the rest of the cast is just blah i still cant get past the fact that people really believe this is one of the great ones maybe after the teeny boppers that gave this movie 614 billion dollars grow up and see more movies theyll realize that this is an overall mediocre movie,sad
this is one of the most boring unexciting lame worthless pile of dog heap i have ever seen i know some overly stimulated people love this film for its emotional romantic story and great acting by leo and kate i cant help but feel this is less than rubbish if this deserved best picture and most successful film of all time im sure the stupids and godzilla deserved to be in the afi top 100 list this has no meaning at all and encourages stupid teens to steal girls from their fiances i mean who is the villain here if a poor tryhard gambling artist who seduces rich women and goes into a rich mans car and makes it dirty and makes her think not to marry the man she truly loves and wanted to get married with thats either a very sick surferdude or one dumb woman when he dies he only makes it worse for kate and basically ruins her life she has no mother no husband and no life anymore it was that sob who made her live with her daughter in a haystack cabin 80 years later if dicrapio wasnt there she would have died happily rich and loved by her familyyes james cameron did a good job wasting his time here he did probably deserve responsible for the biggest mistake ever but he did much better in t2 the abyss aliens and true lies those films actually entertained me and jim youre not the king of the worldthe script was wonderful glorious is all i can sayill never let go jack ill never let go rose lets go of jack audience cries oh jack oh jackdo you love him pardon me do you love him none of your business its a simple question jack stares at rose very angrily audience holds each others hands anxiously waiting for an answertouchingall in all is one overrated pile of nothing which does not deserve its acclaim im telling ya and to all you men out there who love this movie what is this world coming to,sad
movie was cheesy awful overrated crap clich stuff like thati think the message was true love conquers all so if it does then why didnt rose love cal back i mean you know cal was deeply in love with rose he wanted to be with rose and yet rose didnt love him back and now im supposed to believe that true love conquers all she just met jack in the and next thing you know they fell in love with each other crap i tell u crap i mean five days in a ship then they were kissing and stuff like that im saying that rose was easy to get jack was desperate in letting a girl fall in love with him i think at least thats what my friends think  i dont know if i hate it or if i like it one thing i know for sure is that i guess true love doesnt conquer alli mean poseidon is very different he he why am i comparing them because im an idiot i like poseidon better more suspense and action but hey what should we expect from after all it was created in the 1990s and the actor starring in the film dies in the endbig whoop wait i havent even seen it yet no i havent seen yetnotethis comment was created by 4 people so dont be confused if its totally randomsome of us has seen this movie but i have a friend here who havent yetwere so randomill never let go jack ill never let goposeidon is much better i tell youyou should watch poseidon why r we comparing poseidon and because theyre both sunken ships but the love story in is much intense poseidon is full of suspensespoiler it will sinklike duh everyone knows thatanother comment,sad
this is probably the best example of a critics grudge against a terrific film yes the love story is clichd and unoriginal so what everything else is flawless the effort james cameron spent with the historical accuracy is commendable at least not so many times we can see a film set in a certain time period with appropriate costumes set designs silverware etc even the actors were cast to be almost identical to their real life counterparts unlike other reviewers i didnt find the dialog bad at all there are no lines passing for catch phrases like in other big budget movies the visual effects im speechless just to think about them even the love story cheesy as it is was greatly written like in the old days the acting was great almost obliged to be great the characters were amazingly portrayed and cameron made sure every single death would ache your heart except for lovejoy something nobody really can do nowadays of course there is the nude scene with kate winslet something for all those preteens out there and the little sex scene inside the coach aside of building up the romance between rose and jack both scenes prove to be a little pointless even though james cameron is who actually draws the rose picture so that really gives more of an artistic merit music well its good and i dont mean just that song you all know james horners score is actually very good part of his list of great worksone critic spotted several technical errors in the movie one of them being the suns position during the im flying sequence at the wrong side but hey if you want to find the bad stuff youll find it thats not what filmmaking is about you dont go to the theater to shred to pieces any single movie you see we got mst3k for that is one of those few movies that is timeless to this day i can only compare it to casablanca or more specially to gone with the wind its larger than life its long as hell but its enjoyable every single time you see it i forgot how many times ive seen it on tv alone,sad
on a scale of 1 to bread i give it 3 this movie moneyd its way into our lives selling us a tragic historical event without giving us an interesting plot good acting or a good script i think the only saving grace was the directing they take a sappy love story package it around the sinking of the and make millions the idea is not creative at all under that premise i can make a movie called civil war and have it be about a girl from the union and a guy from the confederacy who fall in love then at the end theres this whole war thing and the guy dies id make millions heck that movie has probably already been created subpar unoriginal stories like this pollute the movie industry with the same ignorant recycled message that love conquers all even death we get it if you find yourself at the movie store with your girl or gal and you want to rent a good romantic movie youd be better off renting american psycho at least american psycho was good for its genre,sad
ok this is easily the most overrated film in history beyond the fancy cgi and epic scale is a generic love story with poor charisma between the lead characters now im not gonna leonardo bash hes actually a great actor and its a shame this shitty movie put him in lame teen heartthrob statuscause hes got talent just watch whats eating gilbert grape but this film is typical james cameron as in it takes no risks and plays out with little to no surprises im not saying hes a bad filmmaker his kind of directing can have great results aliens the abyss the terminator and not so great results this film i think hes better suited for action films than serious dramas since he was basically the only person that could make a decent film starring the ridiculous ahnuld,sad
titanicthis movie on the surface would normally strike fear into the hearts of film fans like myself who usually despise most typical mainstream drivel while i am a huge film fan i rarely go to the movies in theaters anymore because everything just looks so bad the last film i have seen in theaters was actually spiderman a great film marred by the horrible cartoonish special effectsmy tastes in film vary greatlyi love the classics cagney bogie etc romance bflicks godzilla films car chases superhero stuff and much more however almost all the films i like were made before the 90s when film started to get really bad i also love to observe a good phenomenon  whoch became almost instantlyi read all about before it was released how the budget went up to a staggering 200 million making the film a tremendous gamble when it was released in late 97 it did very good but not great numbers  but the word of mouth on this film was unlike anything seen since star wars probably  the box office take remained steady for a long time as weeks went by it actually earned more and more and the phenomenon had startedthen in late 1998 when the film was still playing some theaters almost a year later and for a whole year weve heard how unbelievable was and how leo was adored by girls all over the world and how hot kate was  i finally kicked in 2 bucks at a discount theater to see what all the fuss was finally about alone in a packed theater as not to be distracted by a friend i got my snick snacks found my seat and watched with a completely open mindthree hours later i who again hates virtually everything mainstream these days said to myself that was one of the greatest films i had ever seenmany say is fomulatic typical hollywood drivel and the famous but we know the ending the ship sinks i say was an extremely rare presentday excursion in oldschool grandiose filmmaking huge sets were built as opposed to having everything drawn with computer effects it was a great romantic story which the audience was compelled to feel for especially having the knowledge ahead of time that it would be doomed the ship sinks it had great drama great music even the one song i can stand hearing celine dion sing and a lot of heart from james cameron who love him or hate him showed amazing dedication to getting his epic on screenand say whatever you want about leonardo dicaprio  he was excellent in and is one of the very best actors out there right nowanyone who has read some of my other reviews would know that i hate computer effects but the cgi in is the one instance where they actually do work a little because they do not overtake the picture and arent the focus it definitely is not the same as watching a cartoon spiderman battle a cartoon green goblin in a film that is not supposed to be a cartoondare i say is the gone with the wind of our time its a huge movie a blood sweat and tears movie a movie with some real elbow grease behind it and never boring for a secondis arguably the best film of the 90s only goodfellas gives it a run for that title in my opinion and is probably one of the greatest 40 films ever made now that may be a surprising thing for me to say given i am such a huge fan of the classics but however rare it may be there are extremely rare instances when something new is in the same league as something classicone last note  it is surprising that this film has such a barebones dvd out while there are rumors that a special edition dvd is in the works the present dvd is a disappointment with no extras at all considering this movie at three hours long had two hours cut from it alone would make some good extras in deleted scenes add on the commentaries a few makings of and add on a bunch of other crap and you have got a killer proper dvd release for,sad
many people complain about the problems regarding this film a flimsy script flat characters overhype etc   but its still a good film in comparison to the cinematic garbage that is being churned out of hollywood today is a landmark production the two making the film as excellent as it is are both james cameron and james horner the scenes are well done the music fitted excellently to them and the acting is done finely is a good movie,sad
is the most over rated movie i think of the decade it contains boaring scenes bad acting on the part of leo and unbelivable romances i dont understand why this movie was so loved young girls may enjoy leo but i feel that he is totally over rated and a horrible actor when i first saw him in whats eating gilbert grape he was remarkable what happened i must admit that the special effects were great but a movie cant ride on effects alone especially when its 3 hours long i thought it would never end lets get over leos cute little face and be true to our selves,sad
how can people say things like  great movie classic and best of all time when talking about this excuse for a film its terriable the story is boring and has been done about 1000000000 times before the story has been fashioned to suit the directors vision of what happened history goes straight out the door this film makes bill and teds bogus journey look lika a film of epic proportion which is probably the greatst film ever madewhich of course its notif you want a classic may i suggest the usual suspects or pulp fictioni give 010,sad
the story was really bad everyone knew from the beginning that how its gonna end dicaprio was extremely harsh presenting himself i guess i would give the ampas awards to the la confidental what was good then directing was quite okay and the visual fx were superb,sad
while i will admit that the special effects were pretty good they better be for 280 million the rest of the movie was absolutely horrible  the most believable performance in the film was by the iceberg  the characters were entirely plastic and i felt no sympathy for any of them when they diedwe have selfish brat rose who decides that she is going to get what she wants no matter what her parents say she even laughs when her much older self tells of her fiances suicide she changes her name and allows her mother to think she is dead not a word of hope for the poor mother of rose not to mention that despite its size she must have the entire board to herself when she and jack are in the water  whatever happened to you jump i jump  wouldnt they have been able to keep warmer if they had been huddled together  it seems she forgot to mention this 2 day incident of true love to her eventual husband of some 80 odd years too hmmmthen we have overglorifiedrepresentationoffreedom jack a gentleman who doesnt bother to s rose in the bedroom when she is naked but waits until they are in the backseat of a car now isnt that romantic wouldnt a true gentleman especialy one of that era not have done anything at all  great job of accurately representing the time period jamesthe acting was indeed bad but i cannot entirely blame the actors for this it is hard to make stupid oneliners such as this is bad when the ship is vertical sound good and kudos to cappy for tryingthe success of this movie at the box office is not too hard to understand i know at least 7 people who saw it 5 or more times each and have heard of others who have seen it more but how anyone at the academy could have thought it deserved any nominations other than perhaps best effects is beyond me,sad
who says that old fashioned romantic films dont sell they certainly do if theyre done right as the story in certainly isthis blockbuster version of the most famous shipwreck in history is a homage to maytime in fact in casting gloria stuart as old rose through whose eyes we see the disaster unfold director james cameron went back to a contemporary of jeanette macdonald and nelson eddythe film begins with the discovery of the wreck of the in the middle eighties which did cause great excitement at the time searching the wreck divers come upon a safe and a nude portrait of a woman wearing a necklace with a diamond thought to be lost and the portrait is dated april 14 1912 the woman is still alive and its gloria stuart who tells her tale the way an aged jeanette macdonald did in maytimewinning a card game that got him a third class passage aboard the maiden voyage of itinerant artist leonardo dicaprio gets on board the vessel he meets and woos a younger version of gloria stuart who is played by kate winslet unfortunately shes about to enter a loveless marriage for money urged on by her mother frances fisher who wants her declining years not be spent in the poorhouse her prospective fianc is billy zane a rather arrogant young robber baron heir of his time who has a factotumbodyguard in david warner who has one of the best roles in the film still leo and kate get a few stolen hours of romance before the disaster strikesone thing that james cameron did is that he never allowed the spectacle of the disaster nor even the issues of wealth and class that were omnipresent in the story to overwhelm his romantic leads in fact they are an integral part of the story as young leo reaches for what was unobtainableleonardo dicaprio remarked that his part of jack was the least complex role he ever did the part is a romantic lead the guy has no secrets or hidden issues hes just a young man in love maybe that was the reason he was not nominated for best actor in the face of all those nominations did get it won for best picture and best director and a flock of oscars in the technical area kate winslet and gloria stuart were nominated and lost for best actress and best supporting actress respectivelyis a story thats been filmed since the silent days almost in the wake of the disaster itself the germans made a propaganda film of it in 1943 which nazi inspired though it was did make a few points against the british upper classes and that the first class got saved and those in steerage mostly drowned there was a fine version in 1953 with clifton webb and barbara stanwyck as an older married couple with problems on the doomed ship and the british did the classic a night to remember which is a documentary like recreation from the ships officers point of viewstill theyll have to go some beat this one is a film for lovers of all ages and run maytime back to back with if you can get dvds andor vhss of both films,sad
hands down one of the worst movies ever made just a shame that the french cant take credit for this one paper thin plots characterizations and with an excessive running time that makes you wish only that the iceberg had been bigger the acting is awful and completely under uses the talents of both dicaprio and winslett dicaprio is capable of acting look at whats eating gilbert grape and winslett has had some charing roles as well but neither of them can give much in this straight jacket of a script directing a large boat into a chunk of floating ice is hardly a talent worth accolades cameron has done better once upon a time he made movies that were marginally imaginative certainly puts an end to that its a pity because youve already probably seen and suffered through this one but if not skip it chasey lane can give more feeling and night of the living dead more story,sad
when i watched jack die i literally began to cry because i knew that i would never see something as funny as that  it was sentimental and it warmed many peoples hearts  you actually think that this movie is so funny and fake that you cant bear it and then you get to see his lifeless body frozen in the water  the only thing that could have made this movie better is if old rose had been thrown into the water or killed and eaten  if you like this i suggest you rent the texas chainsaw massacre the movie is not quite as graphic or shocking but you will also like it,sad
if the director would take the whole loveydovey richbutunhappygirlmeetspoorbutnobleboy story line out of the movie could be actually pretty decent and mildly entertaining there were some touching andor ironic moments however the amount of cheese made it obnoxious and annoying waste of time,sad
i cant believe that people actually enjoyed this movie it is a terrible movie with horrible actors and a horrific script it feels like a 3rd rate tvmovie i went to see this with some of my friends and about 5 of us cried and the rest of us were laughing hysterically at stupidity of the dialogue i would only see it again if you paid me all of its profits,sad
this movie reminds me of my teenage times i was 14 years old when i went to the cinema with my family and some friends the first time i would have never imagined that one day this film would become one of the greatest masterpieces in the world and that it would have an emotional impact on me i love not only for the movie itself but also for the history that lies in it james cameron is not just a movie maker but a great poet who talks through his heart to us he also tells a story in a way never done before its not just a love story or a history movie its more its hard to explain it in words but if one reads the books about the movie one can understand what i mean i will always thank him for his work his expeditions made to the relict also impressed me much but i also want to thank his crew and all the people who worked with him also a special thank to all the actors obviously was and will always be the ship of dreams to all of us,sad
usually not very fan of romance movies this one is a must and i understand why although it is very long and we know the end of the story even before the beginning of the film it is captivating were not bored ,sad
kya btau yaar maja aa gya matlb yaar such stories tell me how to think about this movie story,sad
so for me it is some kind personali the problem of choosedo not die in routine man try to grown up and find something new and usefuli need to rewatch it in couple of years,sad
i was so surprised and disappointed to see that the sank at the end its such a sad and unnecessary twist that nobody saw coming,sad
am i the only one who finds this film unsettling and beyond upsetting i mean dont get me wrong its an amazing film and personally jcs best work but some scenes will scar me for life and the fact it is marketed as romanticdrama is crazy as i felt myself more terrified than loved up in my opinion this is essential viewing for any film lover but be warned its the scariest film ever made,sad
this movie is my number one favorite of all time the acting production music story special effects i could just talk all day about everything that makes this movie amazing ive seen it so many times that i know every line i love jack and rose and their chemistry and how their lives intertwine and change each others just definitely a movie that cant be topped,sad
im rewatching this now it has held up very well after all these years i saw this in the theaters when i was 22 it was just me and my boyfriend who i recently just started seeing we are no longer together but i still remember him saying that the way the two were holding each others hands at the bow of the boat reminded him of the way we touched each others hands at the time we were in love just as rose and jack were this movie also touched home because i too came from money and thought most of the rich people i knew and had dated were uptight and didnt seem to let loose enough and have funand i was afraid too i would fall in a trap to it and live a boring existence it gave me more strength to branch out and not search for someone to love just because of their wealth and status in the world but instead find love for whats inside a person my world is better now because of that decision so i thank you,sad
this is going to be a short review forplot the plot of the film is really amazing if you want a threehour long love story this is the movie for you another movie worth watching is a walk to remember starring mandy moore and it is a movie that i have seen and it is spectacular the entire 196minute picture centers around two lovers one rich girl named rose dewitt bukater and poor artist jack dawson portrayed nicely by kate winslet and leonardo dicaprio as members of different social classes who fall in love aboard the ship during its illfated maiden voyagecharacters and story james cameron wrote a story that shines out but the dialogue is very clichd and cheesy in a few areas the characters are all well portrayed and i give to the two main actors also credit to billy zane who plays cal he is the character you want to hate kathy bates bernard hill frances fisher johnathan hyde danny nucci david warner bill paxton and the late gloria stuart who plays older rose in this film and she should have deserved an oscarvisuals this is where the movie shines james cameron wanted to make a movie about the and it shows with its 200 million dollar budget and he made this movie historically accurate as possible the ships sinking scene is one of the coolest thing they could do with cgi and practical effects and it is awesomesound  music the music is awesome and fantastic james horner composed a musical score and he is fantastic the films theme song my heart will go on performed by celine dion and i love it and a lot of people has did covers of this song and i listen to this version and it was fantasticenjoyment is a good classic epic romantic disaster film that i have no problem watching once in a while the film won 11 oscars including best director best picture and best original song it made 2 billion dollars worldwide and it is just fantastic 1010,sad
i am 24 i watched for the first time with my mother at the tender age of 7 years old no cause for alarm we were taught to close our eyes in age restricted scenes which i did technicallyis the best movie that i have ever seen i have probably seen it about 500 times since it was first released and i aim to see it once a year at least till i die the glorious tale of tragic love upon the maiden voyage of a doomed luxury liner every time i see i see it in a new light i notice something different that i never noticed before and i cry all over againthe beauty of a movie like this is that it has the ability to cripple the strongest of men with emotion being a skeptic on love myself i have to say that i am slightly glad at jacks demise not because hes a bad character in fact hes my favorite character but because there is some realism to that aspect of the story up until the doom of sets in its all very romeo and juliet the obsessed illusion of true love after barely days of knowing each other at least rose is hesitant of it at first whereas jack is smitten beyond comprehension alas their supposed true love does not overcome the wrath of a very angry looking iceberg and of course ismays blatant challenge to god and all elements of an unsinkable ship that being said we all know the fate of but this is not what makes this movie so wonderful it is actually the integration of all characters both little and large whether it be the distraught murdock the grief stricken captain ej or the delightfully despicable hockley they all merge together in a beautiful picture while the main characters and those closest to them were made up and given a slightly mediocre presence it all fits in so well tragedy love jealousy arrogance greed honor dedication and lust all get together to dance upon the ship of dreamswhether youre male or female im pretty sure the i want you to draw me like one of your french girls scene was a tasty reminder at how erotic cinema can be without actual sex sensuality at its tender best but not my favorite scene in the movie the most notable scene for me in was when the poorer passengers accepted their fate of death the irish mother and her kids the old couple that embrace as water floods around their bed those were scenes dripping with emotion my favorite scene however is when rose joins jack below decks to party with the third class folk just goes to show that money does not maketh the man a good heart doesthe marvel of the ship in all its grandeur made me realize that mister james cameron is a visionary the attention to detail of a simple thing like cutlery was admirable shining performances did not come from dicaprio and winslet as some foolish viewers believe the shining performers were kathy bates billy zanefrances fisher and gloria stuarti can go on about what a brilliant movie this is but i should notend note excellent movie that every person should see at least once before they die,sad
the following review was written by francesca an italian student as part of her english language studies the is a moving film the main characters are jack leonardo di caprio and rose kate winsletand they both very well in this film jack is a poor boy but rose is the daughter in a rich familyone day jack wins some money and he goes on the titantic rose is also on board the same ship there they meet and fall in love but their circumstances mean they cant stay together and then something terrible happensthe movie follows a great storyline and i think it is very beautiful,sad
this story started off quite slow giving you time to observe and appreciate the the scenes seemed to look very realistic and it really puts the in the story of the james cameron really knows what actors suit certain films and here he was spot on yet again leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet make quite a duo for this film and are very believable lovers dicaprio was and still is one of the greatest actors and this film was kind of a boosting point for him as he managed to move up in the acting hierarchy this too for winslet was a boostinglift off point for her she became more well known and began to feature in larger films i also loved the part of jonathan hyde he also was a large actor of his time and he played a believable character very few people are not moved by this story most people are in tears by the end of the film certain scenes are very moving and easily reduce the viewer to sobbing the music was perfect it couldnt have suited the film any betterjames cameron was seen to have done the impossible to create such a realistic true story of a great disaster such as the this film became so popular and has made people appreciate those of the for this i applaud cameron for his fantastic work,sad
to admit this is the first time i have watched from a to z might hinder my credibility as a serious film critic as least a selfacclaimed title i have had several sketchy viewings during all these years but never conquered it entirely then all of sudden it occurred to me a few days ago this is the biggest loophole in my filmography which i should mend asap so after the lengthy 3 hour saga now i could feel calmer in facing the numerous household names still stuck in my tobewatched list and meanwhile other potential newcomers have never stopped emergingto be honest with oneself no one could deny is a monumental masterpiece the visual stunts are so compelling and marvel me in its verisimilitude of reconstructing such a monolith setting whats more indomitable is the fact that it has survived a 15 year interval which should have been a lightyear in the evolution of digital technology and will still stand out not only among its peers also the film is a wellcrafted emotional vehicle of a catastrophe depicting in an impeccable way to render immaculate empathy towards its audience as if we were literally heading towards our own doomsday i did redden my eyes when the valedictory score was accompanying the final farewell the love story of jack and rose although being a bit predictable and the black or white of the character development is somewhat perfunctory given the ample running time it has could universally strike a chord in any corner of the world dicaprio and winslet have generated unparalleled chemistry on screen especially for kate since she has a more narrative arc to accomplish billy zane whose past 15 years has testified that he could never outshine this tailormade character gloria stuart and katy bates are both in my top 10 list of the supporting category and since im rewatching downton abbey these days whose correlation with has suggested that all the firstclass passengers dont need to change any outfit to be grafted into the redhot show maybe katy bates could reprise her role as the survival of the calamity julian fellowes might give it a shot to be the alltime highest grossing film in north america and the runnerup if put under the international parameter after camerons own brooding avator 2009 910 has every reason to be loved by the majority of the mass and it may not be among the top tier darling among orthodox film critics but will remain as a tenacious one in my list another afterthought is that i hope avator will look as fabulous as now when 2024 eventually arrives,sad
much of the 3d conversion in the earlier part of the film looked phony and actually detracted from the story the images looked like multiple 2d layers pasted at different distances and each layer looked flat and lacked depth making for an incongruous and distracting image unlike a film shot with a twin lens camera to begin withlater scenes shot at greater distances where the 3d effect was more subtle were more effective and sometimes quite stunningnote review policy demands that i have at least ten lines of text i didnt want to repeat any of the previous comments about this movie there are over 2000 messages good and bad about the story all i needed to say was in the first eight lines anyway imdb now you have your ten lines,sad
i am breathless and out of words for this film no its not the best film ive seen but it certainly comes close to being james cameron is a true genius and hes the person to thankis a wholesome tragedy adapted from the historic event when more 1000 people lost their lives this film is pure art and will never be forgotten it is filled with extravaganza effects worthy performances and a simply adorable soundtrackleonardo dicaprio gives one of his best performances in his career he is simply perfect as jack simple yet humanized kate winslet is even better playing rose with gratitude courage and efficiency this is also simply her best performance in her careereffects are simply breathtaking james cameron provides with stuff that you would have never seen in the 90s as for his direction also benefits because of his stretchy camera angles and glorious sights this is seriously cameron at his best and theres nothing more wonderful than thatsmall things like soundtracks dont usually matter in films but this film has the best i have heard in my life racy touching and emotional there isnt anything like itoverall i have no words for almost everything is nearperfect in this timeless classic it is also an unforgettable cinematic experience as well as a benchmark in history for visual effects james cameron has got the big job done and has succeeded thoroughlygo see it now because you certainly wont be disappointed one bit with this film,sad
i did not like i thought the acting was way way way over the top it definitely was not historically accurate and the whole oldwomanwiththevaluablenecklace thing was just way too over the top i am a fan of leonardo di caprio and kate winslet i think shes maybe the best actress working today in films but i couldnt stand this movie the fact that is was so very overhyped to me by my girlfriend at the time who saw it with her friends before dragging me to go see it did not help probably the action was pretty good with great effects of the boat sailing the ocean and especially during the sinking scenes but it felt very long and was trying way too hard to pluck at heartstrings i dont understand why the leads had to have the fate that they did dont want to spoil it but if youve seen it i think you know what i mean when i say why couldnt she share the furniture overacting overly desperate to cause us to have an emotional reaction i think it will go down as a well produced movie that was too basic a story an unoriginal love story and way overhyped because for some reason a lot of people loved it when it came out,sad
after seeing this movie years ago at the cinema i thought it was one of the worst movies of all time as far as major studio pictures go thinking about it before posting up a review here maybe i was a bit too harshin short this story is a fictional tale of two starcrossed lovers on board a real life famous ship the that sank killing a great percentage of its passengers and crew um sorry if that is a spoiler but sheesh you should know thatwhen i am feeling particularly unkind about this film some of my criticisms are only director james cameron could look at the story of the and think hmmm that story could make a good movieif only it had more drama yeah sinking ship hundreds dead needs more dramaanother peeve about this movie is how cameron cant resist manipulating our sympathies to characters by resorting to melodrama and crudely drawn characters who we find easy to hate in order to have us rooting for other characters eg billy zanes character of hockley didnt quite throw a chihuahua into the icecold ocean but nasty enough to do everything short of this really a more sophisticated script could have made him a figure deserving of our sympathy tooa minor peeve is how one of those star crossed lovers kate winslets rose is quite prescient and insightful about the ships situationjust didnt seem very plausible for one so young and unschooled in such mattersdespite thinking this movie one of the all time stinkers for a major studio release i did at the time think it a masterstroke to have the two starcrossed lovers at the centre of this tale kate winslets rose and leonardo dicaprios jack it is just a brilliant device in order to hook you and reel you into this great historical dramatragedy again it was a great pity that cameron chose not to make a victim of people like hockley as well instead of demonising him and its not as if cameron didnt have alternatives in his own script for instance jacks sketching of rose could have provided a more believable foundation on which to base a relationship on instead of the hysterical melodrama cameron resorts to to get them togetherperhaps the timeframe of the sinking made melodrama necessarytruly spectacular but deserved razzies for things like script and directiondespite my criticisms when eventually hits the iceberg the movie is an absolute thrill ride and quite exhilaratingps must put in a word for the great australian song by flash and the pan down among the dead men its not in this movie celine dion does the theme song but the flash and the pan song is actually about the and is a brilliant pop songbeautiful too look it up on you tube,sad
wow when i saw this movie even though i was young i though it would actually be good well was i sorely mistaken its like 3 hours of these people trying to fallinlove when the ship they are on is sinking and everyone around them is dieing theres another thing not to be morbid or anything the best part is when the ship is sinking and for you folks out there who havent seen it you have to sit through some boring crap for a long time there are 3 maybe 4 good parts to the movie the beginning then everyone is boarding the ship for some reason it looks cool when the giant funnel falls and kills jacks friend when the giant dome busts with water and when the ship snaps in twoso for you folks who havent seen it yet i told you the best parts find them on you tube now you owe me i saved you 3 boring hours of your life you would never have gotten back if you saw it,sad
a decent enough movie with near unlimited potential unfortunately marred by a ending that nearly had me laughing it was so bad leonardo decaprio may have been a relatively good catch but at some points repeating the same line over and over and over and over and over again just got old the soundtrack is one of the best parts though some now extremely recognizable music spawned from that movie with slightly better acting and a decent writer it may have fared better with me but it ended up being the butt of my joke if they make a remake in ten years or so i can only hope that it doesnt end up being as bad as this movie wasa 35 for originality a 15 for writing script and ending a 25 for sgi a total of 15 310better luck next time,sad
for the life of me i still dont get why people like this film its got nearly every type of film clichrich girl falls in love with boom town rat hmmm original and that song near far wherever you are celine dions song irritates the hell out of me i think if youre going to make a film about make a film about not some annoying couple i like romantic movies dont get me wrong but this is too cheesy and simple which love invariably isnt in its defence though i would like to comment on the fact that the special effects department did a splendid job but unfortunately i like my films to have a good and varied plot which this film totally lacks the was a great ship ahead of its time and was a icon of its time which makes this film an absolute travesty as it doesnt do memory any justice,sad
in its day was a film that captivated movie audiences all over the world i had to admit that when it came out i wanted so badly to see and watch how the modern special effects would recreate the sinking of the liner however looking back on this picture in 2005 i have come to realize that despite some breathtaking special effects this film really isnt that original and doesnt really fit in to the aura of great american films due solely on its lackluster scriptthe first problem with this movie was its lack of originality cameron had obviously lifted many scenes from the 1953 and the excellent 1958 a night to remember roses attempt to rid herself of her elitist rich lifestyle and its confines reign eerily familiar as barbara stanwyck tries to do the same for her children in the 1953 version also many of the sinking sequences reign familiar from the 1958 antr even the blocking and staging of the scenes are almost identical in their set up aka thomas andrews poetic stance in front of the fireplace during the sinking the film also fails as the 1953 did on a level in relegating the really interesting story of the sinking to the background of the plot we are so in to the jack and rose story that when the sinking occurs it is given less time we are always worrying about jack and rose that we miss out on all the other interesting stories that occurred on the night of the sinking and it is this point that leads to another major flaw in the story by allowing the audience to feel the fear of the ship sinking by watching jack and rose fight there way up flooded corridors it diminishes the complacency the passengers had towards the sinking in antr we are lulled by the lack of panic by the passengers and crew when it comes to the disaster and then are shocked to see the ship sink in cameron is so worried about jack and rose that he compresses those scenes in which the lifeboats are being loaded off and thus creates a panicked feeling amongst the passengers when in reality they should be more reserved about the danger until almost the endthe second problem comes from the the archetypal and caricature way in which cameron tries to explain the class division on the ship painting first class passengers in an ugly way and third class passengers as selfless heroes is a tremendous error on the part of the filmmakers showing them in such a black and white way may help the audience see why rose wants to flee her life and join jack in his but in doing so cameron has severely misrepresented the actuality of the time he almost makes it as if on the night of the sinking it was as if the first class passengers ardently wanted the third class passengers to not make it to the lifeboats there was a whole array of behaviors in all three classes on the ship at that time painting the characters into such rigid one dimensional ways was a big flaw on camerons partthe third problem lies in the acting and the lovestory leonardo dicaprio isnt one of the better actors out there despite the praise he gets from a lot of people i feel hes just a mediocre actor who happens to get cast in some high quality a level films dicaprios jack seems dramatically out of place in 1912 this is not mainly dicaprios fault as cameron script is weak he is written like a 1990s free spirit idealistic artist dicaprio obviously did not take the time to gear his los angeles valley accent to that of a boy from turn of the century wisconsin his intonation in speech is indicative of that and he insults the british winslets fine execution of an american accent he does not seem a product of his time jacks vulgarities throughout the movie which where suggested in part be dicaprio himself seem out of touch with 1912 vulgarities would be expected by a man of jacks upbringing but the way he says st makes him sound like a 1990s teenager we also never get to see jack from the prospective of being dirt poor and the effect that fact has on his life instead cameron only shows the idolized side that in the end inspires rose to set out on her own that in itself is a major flaw in the script jack does not seem to be a person by just an ideal to allow rose to break free from her ties and if jack is just an ideal than how can we really believe that the two of them have found a love with one another that will last all the while one has to wonder what life would have been like for the two of them once the honeymoon was over now that would have made for an interesting movie unfortunately dicaprios popularity as a teen star was just at its zenith when the movie was released creating one of the main reasons why this film had such a major draw at the time dicaprios is not the only actor who is bad billy zane gives an over the top caricature performance as cal yet his less blameless due to the attitude in which his character was probably devised as rich mean  and arrogant the only actoractresses who seem to shine are victor garber as the astute and dedicated thomas andrews and kathy bates as the brassy maggie brown she was never called molly during her lifetime unfortunately there parts are tiny in the filmall and all i say that although visually impressive falls flat just about every place else you should only see it for its visuals and not for anything else 4 out of 10,sad
ok  five years ago wow has it been that long i went to see this movie after a month of listening to people rave about how it was the greatest thing since sliced bread  after 3 hours of my life that ill never get back i walked out of the cinema having watched the only movie i have ever giving zero stars  ill give you a star for getting a movie made  i tried in vain but i couldnt find anything redeeming about this movie  its a shame that james cameron the man who brought us such classics at the 2 terminators and alien is also the same man who gave us this worthless piece of pond scum,sad
an interviewer recently asked woody allen why he doesnt attend the academy awards presentation those people give oscars to films like he repliedother than the biggest show on earth is probably the worst film ever to receive a best picture oscar sure a godzillion people went to see it and took in more money than do most small nations but that doesnt mean its good or even watchable independence day and wild wild west both made scads of money and both stunk to high heaventhe damn boat does not start to sink until an hour and a half into the movie and when it does the film shifts to level of awfulness that is eclipsed only by the stunningly unbelievable slop that comprises its first half what can you say about a picture that focuses obsessively on capturing the look of the ships interior the clothing of the passengers even the dinnerware off of which the passengers eat yet completely flubs the actual story of the sinking james cameron obviously did not believe that the loss at sea of the most famous ship of the 20th century presented an interesting enough story to modern american so he proceeded to distort the historical record with his own purely fictional dramatic flourishes as huge water cannon hose down those expensive sets he gooses up the drama by staging a gunfight in the first class lounge this occurs after 1 kate saves leo from  certain drowning by applying an ax to the handcuffs that chain him to a water pipe ironic huh 2 the two jointly rescue an abandoned waif inexplicably separated from its momma 3 kate tells her upper class snob boyfriend to stuff it because shed prefer drowning with leo to a seat next to him in a lifeboatvery climaticthe film does provide some great camp moments for example when kate presents to her insensitive beast fiance a little bauble shes picked up in montmartre picassos the desmoiselles davignon hey didnt this go down with the ship and when the big vessel is about to slide into the freezing north atlantic kate gets weepy and nostalgic as she hangs for dear life off the stern jack this is where we first metthe ending is ludicrous and not only because there are survivorsif you want to view a good movie about the try a night to remember or even the barbara stanwyck version both from the 1950s both made for less than 150 million bucks each even adjusted for inflation imagine2 one for kathy bates the other for billy zanes fab toupee out of 10,sad
i know i am at a risk of being looked upon as an unrescuable geek but i did not like this movie yes i am the one people around me kept telling me it is a great romantic and anguishing movie i found  none of this in there it is obvious from the start from her surroundings at home that winslet has survived without her love that she has lived her whole life in memory but on a more technical side i found the fx lacking the immaculate touch that was needed and by many seen to create the real feeling of the disaster signs of bad fx are everywhere from the boats surrounding water to the people falling from the deck once it has gone vertical it all feels fake and that is for me an instant turnoff i also failed to see the magic between the two main actors although i do think dicaprio is a good actor and winslet is usually ok at least for me only not here so here i am out of curiosity having finally seen a movie everybody thought wonderful and feeling very disappointed missing any suspense from the situation and nonthrilled by the lovestory i found myself wondering what all the people saw in there that i did not all i saw was a vain effort to boost an empty plot with a shallow historical pretext if anybody would like to discuss it further and calmly the signature is my address,sad
we should be reviewing the hype because it was more creative more interesting and says more about our warped society than this turgid drama ever could the movie was a triumph of clever fx and the manufactured yearnings of hormonallyconfused 14yearolds over such irrelevancies as acting script etccynical product for a dumbeddown undiscerning consumerati repulsive,sad
i first saw this movie with my best friend who absolutely loved it  a few days later i showed her part of aliens neither of us can believe they were both made by the same guy  forgive my bluntness but i think james cameron really bombed with  he almost saved it with the whole shipsinking effects and the ten minutes of interesting story line but not quite  if it was up to me i have to say that cameron should go back to exciting movies with unpredictable endings like his earlier works,sad
but ergh too frilly and mushy for me i must stress that me for me i have been interested in the ever since i was a young boy but everyone skitted me for it and said it was sad but now it is the only thing to talk about and if you have not seen it you are some kind of pariah and freak the special effects were the best we can do at this time wait till you see star wars though and the acting was ok but the story was a disgrace portraying the ships first officer as a murderous villain is a travesty he was actually one of the few crew members who knew what was going on after the captain went barmy the mass of hype is a bit sickening and people going to see it 13 times or more need help the most i have watched a movie is 25 times and thats over a period of 14 years a good try but not deserving of all the oscars it received i come from liverpool where the was registered and i know that this great ship holds a special place in many scousers hearts but lets have a film that tells the truth,sad
can i just say that kate winslet is magnificent in her portrayal of rose the emotions she shows in her facial expressions and pitch and tone of voice are something to behold billy zane as the dastardly cal is also quite superb well done to all concerned on the movie and i wait with eager anticipation for the directors cut on video,sad
it was really a good movieit shows the panic of the people in who are about to die and how cruel they became the love story part takes away our sadness till jacks death you mustnt miss this movieit is really wonderful,sad
is actually two films the first film is a very unlikely love story so syrupy it can cause diabetes then it suddenly mutates into a james bond film where  wait for this  bond is played by kate winslet maybe this isnt entirely accurate because james is total fantasy  but never becomes as unbelievable as this oh and at least in a bond film the brits are the good guys unlike here where they are invaribly cruel  stupid andor cowardly also at no point in a bond film does a script change the laws of physics where its possible for someone to escape from the undercurrants of a ship weighing thousands of tons oh and the special effects are better in bond films  are not entirely convincingbut the most fantastic thing about isnt the fact it made so much money at the box office  this is explained by 14 year old girls lining up at the cinema to watch leonardo for the 25th time  but the fact this film won 11  yes elevenyou read that right  oscars equalling the total held by ben hur what the hell were the academy thinking  i know they didnt give any awards for the quality of the acting or even nominated the screenplay for an oscar  they got that right  boy did they get that right  but for it to win 11 oscars including best picture  didnt any of the voters watch la confidential   really upset me because films like gone with the wind  etc didnt get that many,sad
i had the misfortune to be taken to see this film and spent an agonising three hours with the will to live seeping away from me all the time so whats wrong with it decaprio from a purely unbiased mans view i can see the appeal to the more uncritical female section of the audience however he was totally acted off the screen by the glorious kate winslet this is not the first time consistently he is given parts that most actors would kill for only to find himself completely upstaged by much better actors remember mercutio in romeo and juliet daniel day lewis in that abomination gangs of new york i rest my case the soundtrack by celine dion left me with the urge to scream with tedium good voice shame about the material the film is over long and i can not see the necessity for the length the plot certainly didnt present any challenges or surprises the disaster in reality was about people and peoples responses differed to the in relation to it it was not only the rich who were cowardly and oppressive in reality there was a lot of bravery shown as well in other words humanity at its best and worst i found the hollywood gross oversimplification at best insulting at worst the stereotype portrayed about the irish deeply insulting and approaching racist in summation i would say that the experience was something similar to visiting a slightly dementing older relative and being left alone in their company for a day the relationship between dicaprio and the glorious winslet ok im biased could not carry the entire film especially given its length i ended up praying for the iceberg and virtually cheering when dicaprio sank without a trace somewhere there is a more over rated film but for the moment it escapes me,sad
it reminds me of star wars in the sense that it was a good film even maybe considered a great film yet no way should this film have gotten the media hype and numerous awards which it did i like star wars a lot just like this but one thing i hope to never see is a kate winslet l dicaprio dont get me started about his acting skills if any even exist model figurines in an antique shop for 200  or maybe 12 stars for this flick but dont bother to see it more than once james cameron is rich enough as is,sad
i didnt see the in the cinema when it opened it was my pure pride not seeing the most comercial film of all times but that after some time 3 months i got a free ticket for a small cinema matinee so i said screw it lets see it at the start it was ok but than soap opera started man how can you stand to hear that bs all the time  leo is dying so what and hes doing it at least 30 minutes and three hours long film please  the movie made for the little teenage girls who go to cinema just to see the di crapio the only good thing in the movie are the scenes which are really cool made,sad
this movie made way too much money  cameron shouldnt direct a love story there was way too much hype behind this movie the music got old very very quickly mostly due to the radio stations playing it several times within each day decaprio isnt a very good actor and he kinda looks like one of the hanson brothers meaning very feminine  this movie was also way too long for a love story  if you want to see a good love story see what dreams may come  due to this film i now dislike the name cameron and thats pretty bad coming from someone who loved abyss terminator2 and aliens to put it simply i hated this film,sad
it looks very good and the technical aspects are to be admired but when you get to the nuts and bolts script and acting it just sucksim never going to get the 3 hours of my life back that i wasted watching this movieyuck,sad
this movie is tiresome in the extreme totally overhyped overrewarded and ridiculous i first saw it when it first came out and the interminable amount of time it took before the iceberg hove into view was mindnumbing so many problems the opening framing device was totally unnecessary and felt sooooo long while adding nothing to our understanding nor even piqueing our interest wasnt that supposed to be the intentionthen the cast of stereotypes awful and all saddled with flat uninspired dialogue or worse still retrospective smartalec bits picasso he wont amount to much freud who is he is he one of the passengers groan the fatal casting of leonardo di caprio still in his baby face mode as a well travelled man of the arts  while kate winslett mature and a little blowsy nothing wrong with that appears almost old enough to be his mother is a serious misjudgement her fianc a luckless billy zane lacked only a moustache that he could fiendishly twist in his most unctuous moments a total pantomime creation the villain in avatar was a similar one dimensional character i saw the beginning on tv recently and watched again up until kate is rescued from leaping off the stern i hoped that i might be able to reassess it no chance it got me just as annoyed as the first time the improbabilities just as ludicrous would the crew really have allowed leo and chum to the bow to yell king of the world the only reason this got two stars was for the technical sequences during the sinking but as for the fate of the protagonists by that stage i was past caring if only they had employed a talented screen writer such a waste,sad
this is one of the most overrated movies of all time i didnt find a single reason to love itits long boring and ends in a pathetic way those who say the ship wrecking scene is great in terms of visuals need to watch 2001 a space odyssey which has much better visuals than this movie and was made in 1968 its a scifi about spacethis is a complete waste of time its way too long its so boring its a bad love story there are no great visuals as people say the fanboys are worst cameron is a great director but sorry this movie sucks i wasted my 3 hours on this piece of garbage,sad
and avatar are very different one is about a forbidden love aboard a doomed ship the other is about humans trying to exploit an alien race in order to profit yet both have something very similar in common they are criticized for having unoriginal storiesis a love story about a doomed couple people complain that its been done before romeo and juliet and that its boring they only enjoy the second half which consists of everyone dying im here to say that is an unfair callthe goodtheres nothing wrong with an unoriginal story as long as the execution is good after all were running out of original stories even shakespeare had a tendency to take other peoples stories he just told them really well so is well executed yes on the most part while it does have its flaws i think the bulk of the film is amazing its well paced the characters are welldeveloped the cinematography is aweinspiring and the conflict is one that continues to exist today people being forced into loveless relationships due to different pressures like romeo and juliet this film is a classicthe badthis is a nitpick cameron decided to make the film as if an older rose is telling a captain the story via flashback thats fine and it works well the entire film but the ending is just rushed and not much of a lesson like ti should have been the captain of the submarine crew should have disposed of the heart of the ocean not rose that way it would show roses lesson got through to someone why even introduce the captain and a conflict if theyre just going to be forgotten at the end of the filmonce again a nitpick but the movie is three hours why is the ending so rushed i just wished they could have gave the future part of the film a more satisfying endingverdictgreat film 910 see it whether youll like it or hate it this is one of the four essentials of the 90s along with pulp fiction terminator 2 and forrest gump,sad
is exceptional this is what a real film is all about the love story topped the icing on the cake for me its increasingly sad and all the while you still know whats the come its a real treat to be able to watch the theme of the film is self explanatory however there is so much to it regardless whether the love story is true or not it doesnt matter because without this it would not be as emotionally galvanising as it is its astounding its obvious that jack dies at the end and rose is very upset its a brilliant film def a classic highly recommended to anyone looking for something to weep at for days enjoy,sad
i saw this movie again and again  noticed more and more dedication and love for this moviecentral aspect is the love story between jack and rose and the crush it has on cal the romantic story isnt original but this is not a bad thing cameron reinvents the story to fit the time period and its characters everything fits perfectly with nothing ever seeming contrived or awkward jacks immediate interest in rose and rose likewise is completely understandable she is suffering emotionally and jack is there to support her themes from romeo and juliet are included such as rose being an upperclassman and jack being lower class but the emotional connection between rose and jack is almost palpable and this fuels the films first two hours we watch the trials of jack and rose and as they overcome them the ship comes closer to destiny with a ship as large as the was it was destined to crash and of course the ship isnt stocked with enough lifeboats to accommodate the 2200 passengers in the end over 700 people survive while the rest drown freeze or commit suicide the resolution of the film after the ships gone under is just as powerful as anything else in the movie it ends rather surprisingly with a touching symbolic conclusion most films end predictably or inappropriately but ends just on the right note in fact the symbolism of the final scene is so perfect that many people will contemplate over the meaning for months the film does end rather depressingly and unexpectedly but when you think about it it couldnt have ended any other way all the questions are answered and we are left with a weak smile due to the intense situation we were just put through the sinking is an emotional roller coaster with many more realistic deaths than any independence day the death scenes are so realistic that you find yourself caring for every single passenger cameron never compromises the integrity of his film and the deaths of the passengers is never overemphasized he doesnt linger on each death but takes it as it comes to show us the realism without trying to force emotions out of the audience but emotions do show and almost anyone will find themselves wiping away a few tears hats off for this masterpiece,sad
enriches us with a romantic story of young love passion and feelings full of utopias and dreams mother and child fighting for power and greed idealistic and selfidentified clashes within a consenting human ambitions society and victims of their own vanity and pomposity this is one of the films that most shocked the general public in the last twenty years the huge collections that are logical because they got obvious that has one of those stories full of strength and feeling with great dramatic content if we add the stunning beauty of the image thanks to advances in digital technology success is understandable very successful movie which tells the story of the sinking of the ship but in the background shows a passionate love story it achieves a harmonious balance in that in the mix of history and feelings and makes it almost perfect,sad
this is an incredible movie every bit of it was beautifully shot and the accuracies to the look of the actual were miraculously on point this movie is in one word iconic everyone knew the and now everyone knows this movie it is arguably one of the most famous love stories of all time and although the concept is tired rich girl meets poor boy they cant be together etc the fact that they are aboard the infamous rms is reason enough to consider it different every scene is gorgeously picturesque and makes for some of the most memorable movie moments ever the actors are also great and the characters really make this story although leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet arent quite yet at their prime in their most famous movie they play these characters convincingly and with a lot of heart you feel for them every step of the way and dicaprio and winslet have a chemistry that simply cant be matched you can tell how much they care about each other as people and that translates into a fiercely protective emotionally powerful romance on screen overall this movie is one of the best out there its length around three hours may bother some people but it never feels tedious to watch james cameron is an impeccable director that looks to make every detail perfect and some of the small seemingly insignificant scenes he added were a few of the most moving of the entire film is a passionate beautiful story of a doomed love that will keep your heart racing and your tears flowing until the very end,sad
an absolutely terrific film i saw it when it first came out in the theater and loved it breathtaking romantic epic and terribly sadmy only gripe with the film is the ending granted i understand it makes more dramatic sense for jack to die but the reason he dies is so stupid he tries to get on the door with rose and it starts to sink so he gallantly allows her to stay on the door while he freezes to death in the atlanticum  could you try balancing on either end here rose you sit on this end and ill sit on the other lets just try it maybe it wont work but its better than prying my dead frozen hands off the door at the end of the film or hey maybe ill swim around for a few minutes and see if i can find another piece of debris to float on its just dumb that neither of these options occur to themagain i get the reasons why for the storys sake jack must die it just doesnt make any sense outside the dramatic impetusotherwise terrific film i could see it again and again without getting tired of it,sad
i fell in love with this movie the first time i saw it but what i sometimes get annoyed at and man in the iron mask had the exact same problem is that everyone is oohing and awwing at leos hotness when they dont realize the philosophy behind it the real message of this movie is that if we knew what would happen tomorrow there would be no point in living we just have to take things as they come because there is no predicting what tomorrow will hold so basically caution is lifes curse another philosophical message of this movie which is also political is that we have no control over the lives were born into we just have to make the best of them i love this movie and i wish others would appreciate it the same way that i do,sad
this movie contains every single emotion of a human being the heartwrenching sadness of loosing your love ones is clearly shown in this moviethe music is the best part of the moviejack and rose shine up as perfect loversthe wreck of is shown in this moviethe song my heart will go on is most favorite song of meevery single person has worked hard yo make it a successthis was a very challenging for everyone when the ship broke and sanki love this movie very muchleonardo and kate played the role of jack and rose and became perfect coupleaccording to me it is the best movie ihave seen in my entire life and it can also be called the best film of all the centuries,sad
my favorite films of the late 1990s are defiantly saving private ryan the sixth sense and thiseach shot is so well crafted by a master of cinema james cameron i first saw this movie when i was about eleven i watched it because i became fascinated with the that was almost four years ago since then i have grown from loving flashy and violent movies to more well crafted even though sometimes still violent like the original star wars of lord of the rings movies each shot is well done i like how anything not having to do with roses family or jacks friends actually happened they had more that you can see in their numerous deleted scenes all the actors were brilliant i was surprised when i heard kate winslet in her british accent the music was flawless some of the writing is a little cheesy but it is redeemed by the rest of the movie the brilliant directing the factual accuracy set design and acting overall a brilliant film 1010,sad
i will not accuse this of being the most overrated film ive yet seen because first it has its share of redeeming qualities and second that honor has to go to the illusionist which in many ways was actually a lame attempt to ape the formula but ive already blasted that one into the ground neither can i fault it for grossing so much a film that shamelessly panders to overemoted teenage girls is bound to produce a good showing at the boxoffice but the fact that a sloppy period piece that insults the period it pays tribute to could earn such lavish sycophantic adulation from nearly all reviewers especially celebrity film writers is just more evidence that americas thoughtlitejournalists politicians and academics alikehave got to be the most degenerate gullible and monolithic in the western worldthere are two intertwined reasons why is on balance worth seeing the historical setting and the special effects enough has been written on the latter and on the former as well but as an atlantic historian i cannot express enough love for anything so exquisitely and meticulously designed floating on the ocean of my heritage just around the time my family was making its way over from europe older roses remark that it was the ship of dreams and it was it really was ring so true i beseech my readers regard the volume of immigrant ship traffic in the era admire the interior of the ship and the costumes of the passengers and contrast them to the most luxurious modern cruise liners in an era where ships are often not a necessity and consider how much the western world lost in less than a century this sort of aesthetic history lesson is the same reason i love chariots of fireregard admire compare and consider if that is you can get past a script that hangs together like a soggy potato chip and pays not the least attention to real historical personagesour two protagonists are at best navely laughable and at worst totally unsympathetic their antagonists little more than cartoon characters that the former speak like modern teenagers is quite appropriate because they clearly are modern teenagers pitted against the backward old fogies of the era jack is a romanticized bohemian bum with little that could possibly seduce a beautiful young angloamerican socialite away from her privileged life rose wants us to believeand she convinces jack somehowthat deep down shes some sort of fiery rebel yet what i saw was a girl alternating between doing the bidding of her wealthy domineering cardboardcutout fianc cal and the bidding of her impoverished sappy cardboardlooking loverboy jack theres so much ham and cheese at work youll want to take a fork and start eatingand there is something utterly vile about their story which again is clearly aimed at adolescent females and that fact makes moral tone all the more disturbing this is a film with an agenda all the authority figures are stupid murderous bigots the 17yearold heroine is glorified for rebelling against her mother and fornicating with a wild rover and dont forget that wicked cabin church excluding thirdclass passengers from attending the sunday service on that fateful last day of voyagein reality the whole ship was completely segregated i am told church services were excepted though i have my doubts but not because of snobbery on anyones part thirdclass passengers were largely immigrants without medical certificates and in that era of the great migrations were required to register at ellis island hence us law required complete segregation on all inbound european ships and on these grounds it scarcely needs saying such a liaison between jack and rose far from stupid and implausible was quite impossiblefinally despite the segregation doug phillips has pointed out there is no credible evidence that firstclass passengers were given priority seating rights to the contrary there are numerous accounts of firstclass passengers giving up their seats and assisting thirdclass passengers into lifeboatsthere are plenty of other factual gaffes many of them less severe such as the bad british accents but by far the most appalling is the libelous depiction of the ships crew there is no evidence that william murdoch accepted bribes from a cowardly aristocrat nor that he shot two men nor that he subsequently committed suicide and so far as i know such a portrayal was a completely ad hoc invention on the writers part james camerons apology to the murdoch family was too little too late the surviving passengers testified that the crew performed their duties sacrificially and heroically that evening that is the biggest sin of this film the real heroes of the tragedy with the exception of thomas andrews are washed over or even villanized in favor of capricious brats only one of whom gets his comeuppanceeven so towards the ships final gasp of life we do get a good sense of the imminent terror not only in jack and rose but in all 1500 souls who perished that evening the worst moment had to be the power outage its those last frightening milestones on the road to destruction that remind you where you are headed irreversibly and the scene of the actual sinking captures this perfectly the true story of the rms from its building to its sinking and even its aftermath as grown belfast men whose labor on that ship had been the pride and joy of their city wept in the streets at the news of her demise is beautifully tragic and inspirational would that this film had captured more than a few minutes of that,sad
i dont really like this movie i think its fine and all but it is very overhyped how it beat out good will hunting for best picture one will never know it is so very boring i dont care for gloria stuarts character although i think she plays her very well i dont care about the old boring people looking for the jewels i just want to see the boat sink just like everyone else it is directed very badly and how james cameron won best director is a mystery to me and many other people too kate winslet did a lackluster job and that is hard for me to say seeing as i adore her in everything else she is in i think that it was a bad film and that it shouldnt have won any of the awards it did because it was not good at all big budget doesnt necessarily mean big hit in this case it means big dumb movie,sad
i have a great value for james cameronsthe characters are all so glossily twodimensional and beautifully clich the emotional and mental growth of the characters so splendidly predictable and most of the lowerclass folk were the healthiest and best looking id ever seenits a nostalgic return to the old days of hollywood when it was clear who the goodies were and who the baddies were and when everyone had perfect teethbit like a modern casablancaexcept its in colourand takes 90 minutes longer ander is considerably less wittybut still i have a great value for ityes yes its true that i dozed off and on off and on watching it the first time at the cinema but i must point out that i was feeling particularly tired that day and it had nothing whatsoever to do with the fact that sleeping through it in tenminute blocks made no difference to my ability to work out what was going on indeed when i caught the whole of it on tv another time with my friend who had tried everything else to get her baby to sleep i truly gained an appreciation of its value,sad
is the most famous fictional story tied into real event movie to date it tells the story of a poor man who wins tickets to board the in a poker game he and his friend board the ship in hopes of reaching new york city and starting life anew while on board he falls for a rich woman who is set to be married after he saves her life she begins to fall for him and a passionate love story begins however their plans are halted abruptly when the ship hits an iceberg and begins to sink now its a race against time to try and get off the ship as soon as possiblei dont care what anyone has to say about this movie sure the first hour is chick flick material and it features the clichd rich girlpoor boy formula but this movie is so well made well acted and well directed that it deserves all the praise it gets the movie has a 3 hour running time but its never really slow even in the sappy scenes youre drawn in by the amazing set around the characters james cameron did a great job directing this movie the recreation of the interior of the is amazing its like theyre filming inside the real ship though the first hour is mainly a love story it still can keep the guys entertained because its not a long drawn out drama cameron keeps amazing balance between continuing the love story and telling the story of the disaster in the second half of the film the sinking scenes are fantastic finally the most accurate portrayal of the demise on film this movie has drama action and some comedy it manages to tell a great story and be a highly entertaining action film at the same timethe performances are very good not one performance in this movie is flawed everybody involved is extremely talented and they all do very well in their partsoverall despite what anyone says about this movie it doesnt change the fact that its an epic film with a great story and amazing visuals910,sad
this version of the is a well done movie that blends a love story and an accurate account of the voyage and sinking of the great ship together mr cameron took painstaking efforts to present the as she actually looked and sank using one of the popular theories as to how she sankbut what impressed me most is the statement made through this movie regarding the rich and poorlower class people the point is well expressed how each class felt about the other the differences are seen from the boarding of the all the way to the rescue at sea 1rst class embarked directly while 3rd class required an examination for lice and whatnotbefore embarkation third class was kept below decks until first and second class were loaded onto lifeboats during sinking on the carpthia third class was kept on an open deck in reality one child was lost from 1rst and 2nd class while 52 out of 109 children were lost in 3rd class taken from by thomas e bonsall published by gallery books 1987i would highly recommend  if interested to purchase the dvd and view the deleted scenes and alternative ending it will help tie things together and even mentions the californian along with their wireless operator the califronian was a vessel that if its captain took the rockets fired seriously could have saved all aboard as she was only about ten miles from one deleted scene also shows the heartbreaking end for three third class passengers alluding to the last statement in the above paragraphlastly a good movie has good acting good writing a good film crew and good music the music blends well with the love story the action and the ship itself,sad
i watched the movie in 1997 after it was released in vhs i hadnt been able to watch it while being on the big screen and as a result my curiousness was explicitly bigger than it was at the beginning i dare say i have watched it over 10 times ever since and still havent got bored with it although it is a characteristic piece of pure hollywood cinema nobody can deny its breathtaking and aboveaverage moving first of all although the plot was simple noncomplicated and shouldnt deny itrather predictable it still is a beautiful fictional love story which in fact has a logical base we shouldnt forget that most marriages in the 1920s were a result of parents personal ambitions and financial motivations so they happened mainly for interest but as soon as rose met jack who above all saved her in every way a person can be saved it is natural to fall in love at once as near him she imagined the live she would have died to live then as far as the technical merit is concernedwhat can i saythe work made is just magnificentno other comments and finally its worth mentioning the strongest element of the movie which rises her above all the music which is widely concerned as a classic 9810,sad
ive seen many times now and i get tearyeyed still because i try without much effort to imagine the actual people this happened to in 1912  the very rich the immigrants down below the smug selfproclaimed unsinkable ship propaganda and the tragedy at the end as the ship begins to fall apartit remains an interesting movie because of the mix of recent real time footage intermingled with the love story but as the celine dion song implies my heart will go on and on there was a very real tragedy of these poor people trapped in the middle of a dark freezing ocean with no high tech to help save them the terrifying last half of the movie with terrified people running back and forth trying to escape the inevitable really gets to me the more i see this movie tragedies happen every day in the world but this was 1912dont know what else to say  except that i do get tearyeyed at the ending these poor defenseless people  it could have been any one of us then or now if you believe in reincarnation which i do not  anyway great movie and it deserved to become the huge hit it became ,sad
i will always remember the first time i saw the year was 1998late february to be precise i was ten years old in the fifth grade and had been hearing for weeks about how good this movie was and how it was like nothing anyone had ever seen i was desperate to see it however the forbidden fruit had been rated pg13 so i was afraid i would never see it being too young then as luck would have it one of my friends invited me to go see it for her birthday i thought it would be the classic formulaic love story with some good fun thrills i was wrongi had never had such a thrilling experience in a movie theater in my life i was quite literally on the edge of my seat especially during the last halfthere were many memorable scenes including rose searching for jack below decks the evil fianc pulling out a shotgun and of course the sinkingdidnt end the way i expected it or wanted it to i had imagined both of the lovers would be rescued and live happily ever after at ten i was deeply upset by the early death of jack but i understand today that it was necessary for him to die otherwise the full extent of the tragedy couldnt be grasped someone i know said that this movie is the closest you can get to the real tragedy without experiencing it firsthand and im inclined to agree though i did visit a exhibitfrom the actual shiplast summer and saw the shoes of eino panula the unknown child of the and it was bloody awful to say the least now i understand in some years its become trendy to hate perhaps its because leonardo dicaprio doesnt seem as cute anymore perhaps the special effects seem old perhaps it was some of the at times rather weak dialog who knows but i still like it really like it in fact and occasionally i pull out my old vhs copy and watch it it still hasnt lost its power to move and disturb me,sad
i thought that was wonderful history and romance all rolled into one james cameron did a marvelous job and the soundtrack is beautiful i laughed and i cried this movie is the best to quote from and use in your everyday life i live by these words kate winslet was stupendous a wealthy woman trapped in her own life is a difficult role to play the romance was a great way to catch peoples attention the way cameron captured every little detail so that you could really understand the emotion and wonder in this production was beyond me if you are one of the thousands that enjoy history and a little romance you will surely enjoy this film,sad
this is my 1 favorite movie of all time its a must see this movie made me bawl so hard the music is also really great too especially the love theme my heart will go on performed by my favorite singer celine dion if you like this movie you will probably also like gone with the wind legends of the fall and others usually romance stories on film never turn out to be good considering that they are all mostly romanticcomedies this is a very good story and it has a great plot the dialauge is awesome and the special effects are mind blowing not to mention the acting this movie is great and if you havent seen it rent it or buy it it is definitely worth the money,sad
i have seen many movies in my life and i can tell a good movie from a bad one as soon as i saw i knew it was the best movie ever made i enjoyed it tremendously and i can see it as many times as i want i also love the acting of kate and leo the music in the movie really touches your heart and to tell the truth i believe the people who say this movie is terrible are uncomfortable because there is romance when romance is the best part of any story anyones life sooner or later will be touched with love and you cant deny that is only an example of how powerful love can truly be i believe it is a great movie and i am sure i am not the only one as you can see it is a hit that is going to be remembered throughout the years and will never be forgotten,sad
there are a plethora of reviews here which concur with my sentiments so i will refrain from expressing them in this review i will say one thing though james camerons oscar acceptance speech was the most ridiculous acceptance speech i have ever heard never mind the im the king of the world line how about his moment of silence for those who perished on the perhaps cameron felt obligated to acknowledge the dead since he was making millions dramatizing their tragedy perhaps he was being sincere in his sympathies i dont know what i do know is that it was one of the most cringeworthy moments in academy history but cameron doesnt stop there he simply cannot leave goodenough alone so he continues to babble on incessantly as his head continues to expand whereas most actors and filmmakers at least make an attempt to conceal their egotism cameron is unabashedly vainglorious boldly forsaking the humility smokescreen that so many others in show business rely upon for refuge,sad
if you enjoyed this movie good for you  if you thought it was a load of schmaltz and special effects and were bored speechless try watching a night to remember 1958  its actually about the sinking of the rms and not a fanciful fairy tale  the choice is yours,sad
is a technical masterpiece and the love story between jack and rose have got an epic touch but somewhere the characters dont seem to fit into the time frame of the 1910s maybe cameron meant to put people with the 1990s way of thinking and acting into another time what do i know but this really is the weakness of this exceptional movie but as i said technically it would get top marks and every time i see it i get surprised that three hours have gone so fast,sad
this movie is really just three hours of utter boredom this movie is nothing more than a retelling of romeo and juliet the special effects arent as great as people say and in the end all consists of is hype and then some 12 stars for this film,sad
is possibly the film of the decade  it manages to show that one thing transcends barriers between all the people of the world  ignorance the incredible storytelling ability of cameron his audacity with special effects and his casting prowess who would have thought that by casting an ugly girl against a attractive guy he would create the romance of the decade its incredible hokum what so many of the anticamp fail to realise is that bad acting duff script and glossy special effects dont necessarily mean a bad film star wars as an example the key point here is that camerons huge ability to target the worlds biggest niche audience the dumb middle class is something that should be celebrated he should be a rolemodel for all film makers out to make a financial success  exploitation is the key i can sum this up in one sentence the brains behind this picture deserve to have the 18billion success  the film itself doesnt,sad
the acting was rather mediocre the love story was no different than any other love story and the movie has one hour too long  however the sets were wonderful the costumes exceptional and the special effects unforgettable  the movie was good but nonetheless overrated,sad
how can we live in a world where a piece of  film like can even be considered for an academy award  now i understand that i must give some credit to mr cameron for spending way too much on minor details such as the shipss engine which could have easily been avoided  this is the obvious case of a man who needs to spend as much money as possible for publicity anyone remember the last time that stunt was pulled  it was called waterworld  and was equally as bad and chessy  the only difference was that waterworld did not take place around a real event  and that is the only reason won best picture oh and how i can forget the ludicrous special effects  in my humble opionion no film that isnt at least nominated for best screenplay should be able to take home the best picture award  mr cameron must have written his script after an inspiration of something he saw floating in a toilet  im sorry to say this mr oscar but youve lost my respect,sad
come on people just admit the movie sucked you know you want to come onjust do itthere doesnt that feel good the first step to your recovery from watching this terrible film is to stop denying that it was a bad film now that we are done there i can get to what was wrong with this pile of cinematic puke the acting was bad the dialog was bad the plot was bad the special effects were bad so i ask you what did james cameron do right his amazing special effects were trumped by movies that came out ten years before hand come on how good can a movie be when your headline actor is leonardo dicaprio honestly just tell me what this guy did right here comes the spoiler that will save you rental money and about three hours of agony the boat sinks it hits an iceburg and it sinks okay now you dont need to waste your time on this pile of garbage how can a movie this bad have made so much money why is it that young preteen girls make everything bad a hit why,sad
even if i tried for a million years i could not make this film worse but stick a robot and a giant llama in and hey youve got a decent film its good when the main character dies at the end but the other one doesnt because she gets to experience the same kind of trauma i went through by sticking with watching it the plot is absolutely awful the scriptwriters evidently have no imagination and at 3 hours i would literally rather watch my cat sleeping the actual best part is the theme song at the credits no only joking thats as bad as the film is anyway if you have 3 hours to kill do something else this is absolute tripe,sad
is a staggeringly expensive and elegant love story set against one of the most shocking maritime tragedies in history prior to its release the media had their knives out for director james cameron and were poised like vultures to cut him down to size the budget had spiralled outofcontrol the film was scheduled with a running time of 3 hours and everyone predicted a critical and financial disaster of unprecedented magnitude as it turns out is actually a good film not an excellent film which many people seem to suggest but definitely a good film the second half in particular which deals with the sinking of the ship and the chaos and panic that sweeps through the passengers is very well made cinemain the present treasure hunters discover aboard the wreckage of the a drawing of a naked woman wearing a priceless diamond necklace an old lady named rose gloria grahame sees the drawing on the tv news she calls in immediately claiming that she is the woman in the picture rose is flown out to the dive centre in the atlantic where she narrates the story of how she came to be the subject of the drawing she tells how a penniless american youth jack dawson leonardo dicaprio won a ticket onto the during a card game in southampton she tells how she as a young woman kate winslet was travelling in firstclass with her fiance banker cal hockley billy zane and how the two of them were unhappy in their relationship gradually jack  an aspiring artist  and rose came together and began to fall in love then the unthinkable happened and the hit an icebergfor 90 minutes or so almost lives down to the disastrous reputation that had been predicted of it before its release it is a naive slushy romantic story in which the love affair that develops is unconvincing and unbelievable the characters of rose jack and cal are lifted straight from the pages of a barbara cartlandstyle clichd loveandpassion romance but the film dramatically improves once the iceberg strikes cameron is into more comfortable territory at this point showing his dazzling technical talents and his mastery of spectacle and excitement in a prolonged sinking sequence of true quality the film suddenly becomes more purposeful and urgent more exciting and moving for upwards of an hour we witness an authentic and harrowing event from a perspective of remarkable realismeventually emerged as a phenomenally successful film and recouped all its budgetary outlay plus a whole lot more it also made the critics eat the words of their negative predictions yes the opening stretch isnt up to much but the shipsinking sequence more than compensates and transforms this into a very commendable film,sad
as a maritime historian by choice and having been formerly involved with the big ships  the traditional passenger liners for nearly 30 years i found james camerons handling of and mixing fact and fiction extremely good and an excellent way to bring to peoples notice what it must have been like on that cold night in 1912the idea of using a fictional story of two young people on the edge of adulthood to show the optimism then dispair was a master stroke whilst people may snear at the storyline with rose and jack the fact that this was seamlessly integrated into the story was impressive in my shipping life i have known bigger liners than but in her day she was as big in the national conciousness as the rms queen mary or rms queen elizabeth was to those of the mid 193060s if one takes the view that the film as named was about the all too brief life of a great and majestic ship and as i believe cameron himself said putting two young people into the story as a love story and making them face the harsh realities of life should make people experience the horror of that night so long agofull marks to all that were involved in and around the film and remember those whose ship of dreams took them to their death and to the death of what should have been a great shipas indeed her sister ship olympic proved for nearly 20 years,sad
james francis camerons is a well done film but i think it gets more credit than it deserves  true the film won eleven academy awards including 3 for cameron and 2 for composer james horner but i think it shouldnt had been ranked so high like with benhur statusif you dont know the story of now your probably one of the ones who didnt survive because the story is worldrenoun  so are its actors leonardo dicaprio is not at his best kate winslet is at least hot and billy zane works as a villain who work into jim camerons script about romance on the high seas  luckily the film doesnt go as slow as you may think but still thats no excuse to have the sinking in the movie longer than it did in  real lifebut seriously this film does have many great qualitites  the story is well lay out and the special effects are dazzling it actually looks like the is sinking which also won a oscar  one of the great points in this film is the score by james horner which is his best and one of the best ever but that is overshadowed by fancy fireworks and bad acting  good direction though  b,sad
this film is utter crap praise the lord the boat sunk so the movie could end rms was a passenger liner that sank in the north atlantic ocean on 15 april 1912 after colliding with an iceberg during her maiden voyage from southampton uk to new york city us the sinking of caused the deaths of 1514 people in one of the deadliest peacetime maritime disasters in history she was the largest ship afloat at the time of her maiden voyage one of three olympic class ocean liners operated by the white star line she was built between 190911 by the harland and wolff shipyard in belfast she carried 2223 people,sad
if only the voting ratings were higher than 10    i would give this grand film a 20 i watched it for the first time about four years ago or so and let me just say i bawl like a baby every time i watch it it remains my absolute favorite movie i love the chemistry between leonardo dicaprios jack  kate winslets rose you just dont see romances like that anymore which is a shame i enjoy watching their romance grow until the very end james cameron was right in making sure that the audience gets an emotional doorway to use his words to realize just how tragic the disaster really was by having them as well as jack  rose go through the events that led to the sinking    did cal hockley billy zane ever do stuff like the things jack did for rose risking his life because he loved her so much i dont think so because he didnt really care about her or even love her for that matter    so billy zane did a fantastic job at portraying this character you just love to hate all the other actors in this film particularly kathy bates victor garber gloria stuart  bill paxton did fabulous as well the scenery the music makes me cry even if i hum a few bars the costumes etc are fabulous james cameron you are a genius  will be forever remembered for this epic masterpiece for bringing this tragedy that happened a century ago to astounding life i applaud you for this tenfold bravo well done,sad
james cameron is one of the best directors of all time i have never seen him make a bad movie this and his most recent avatar are in the top ten of my favorite all time films i know when a movie is very good is when i choke up i did that for several scenes in this threehour epic the wonderful score by james horner initiated some of those teardropsthis is about the fateful night in midapril of 1912 when the luxury liner sank also there is a romance story between a guy from the lower class and a girl from the upper classthe acting is pretty great yes there were some cheesy lines but so what the brilliant performances of kate and leo make up for iti cant see why people blast this movie with their criticisms maybe it was successful and it made tons of moneyoverall this is one of the best movie of all times theres a reason why it won eleven academy awards i rate this film 1010,sad
is a film so revered and praised that it can become tiresome and many choose to bash it just to spite its popularity but the truth is that is a classic and is worthy of any praise it getseverybody knows how epic this film is everybody knows the extraordinary lengths that were gone to to make this such a memorable piece and everybody knows of the excellent performances given by kate winslet leonardo dicaprio and the supporting cast the incredible feat that this film achieves is despite its huge scale you can get entangled and wrapped up in each character the simple love story of jack and rose is played out so intensely its beautiful and engaging to watch no matter how many times youve seen it beforewhat i love about this film is the fact that i can pick out plenty of cheesy moments and lines and many instances where cameron has tried to overdramatise an already tragic and epic story as well as one illtimed cut to the modern day subplot but i dont mind i can get carried away in the story and love those moments as wellthe truth is this film is beautiful the oneliners and funny moments early on that highlight the tragedy of the end still touching and shocking despite the action and panic in them are beaten only by the simplicity and beauty of the relationship between jack and rose it sounds cheesy and clich but it is still as beautiful and romantic as ever and this film will always rate highly with me,sad
this is possibly one of the worst films ever created they ruin a tragic moment in history by making a tragic movie the movie focuses way to much on a cheesy love story that is extremely pointless i mean if the dude dies why the flip would they make a freaking 3 hour movie about making sexual pictures and extremely slow story and then he drowns after she says ill never let go jack so here ill just let your body go into the cold depths does that really freaking make since at all the only good part in the movie was when he died i was so happy because he wouldnt shut up and right now my cousin is trying to murder me with an ipod cord while im badly commenting her all time favorite movie i think if i was this age right now and i saw it in theaters i would laugh because of the extreme slowness but i did like the visual effects they were pretty good the special effects werent that good though even though i could go on for days watching that dude who falls off the ship and smacks that fan and laugh a lot until it hurts but as i say in my titlei ts u c k s   nough said,sad
we start off this epic classic with mr brock lovett bill paxton in search of the heart of the ocean necklace that would be found in the wreckage after failing to find it and revealing so on television rose gloria stuart a survivor calls up brock to go for visitrose quickly gets into the story of her experience on we travel back in time to when rose was young kate winslet jack dawson leonardo dicaprio is an aspiring artist who wins himself and his friend fabrizio danny nucci tickets on almost instantly jack falls for rose  regardless of her being with cal hockley billy zaneone night rose runs to the back of the boat she leans off the rail ready to jump into the waters below  hopefully to her death jack sees her doing this and talks her out of it just as he is about to pull her in she slips he does bring her back over but not before cal has come to the rescue jack is seen as a hero and is invited to dinner the following nightrose begins to have feelings for jack and they also begin to see each other frequently rose poses nude for jack wearing only the heart of the ocean they are chased by lovejoy david warner but eventually get away and make love in a storage room inside a vehiclei am not one for movies that go over 180 minutes but this one has always been an exception for the reasons of it not feeling like three hours and for it being a romance leonardo dicaprio is not a favourite of mine i hated him in almost anything else so its safe to say that i think this is his best performancekate winslet was a noname at this point and that was on purpose but she was quickly noticed after this for such an amazing performance its no wonder why she was nominated for an oscar she is just so easy to fall in love withjames cameron wrote and directed this masterpiece and does anyone wonder why it won 11 oscars and made 18 billion it deserves all the praise it gets simply because it is an epic romance movie the only epic romance i know the score is just magnificent and it easily put james horner on the mapit had a great supporting cast kathy bates frances fisher bernard hill victor garber and jonathan hyde the dialogue between rose and jack is sweet and warmhearted the action during the last hour is what really makes this so epic the romance itself is fairy talethe special effects are also stunning i cant think of any flaws in this movie which is why i obviously give it a perfect score any romantic person will love this any couple should watch this together because it certainly speaks to you in that sensei dont know if there is another movie out there in this genre that compares to which is why i recommend everyone to watch this,sad
is one of the best films of all time for many reasons there is not one single problem with the picture not one the effects are extraordinary its well acted well written convincing and spellbindingtwo lovers from opposite worlds fall in love aboard the doomed ship and then the ship meets her doom their relationship is strengthened by their struggle to survive this makes the film an experience instead of just entertainmenthas been bashed by many people for years all i can say is that i think it is the second best film ever behind shawshank and that i dont care what they thinkleonardo dicaprio and kate winslet are stunning and they give the film a basic story structure now these people can actjames cameron cleverly shows the peril that the passengers are in we can relate to them and we fear for them it is horrifying to see them die it is an intense and visceral experiencethis is a beautiful masterpiece about the tragic sinking of a great ship super,sad
i saw this movie few hours ago and i cant help asking myself same question why is it so poorly ratedimdb is the best movie site i ever saw and i noticed when it comes to ratings its surprisingly how users ratings work good for me in 95 cases rating over 7 means that the movie is worth watching for me is without any doubt classic it was brilliant film when i saw it 10 years ago and it didnt loose any of its quality when i saw it moments ago why is it so i dont intent to write because i thing many reviews here did that already shortly lets just say that it was directed perfectly by visionary james cameron in the way that 3 hours long epic film doesnt get boring characters are played excellent by many talented actors in that moment leonardo di caprio and kate winslet were relatively unknown story is also great and connects love story and fate beautifully special effects are impressive even today and hans zimmer did amazing job with music when i saw was rated 69 i was stunned it should be rated over 8 at least why is it so well few years after release it became very popular to spit on it without good reason so it probably got even to peoples mindsi guess even peoples opinions can be manipulated its just sad it affected this truly wonderful movieevergreen 1010,sad
dir james cameron 1997 somewhere on its way to becoming the all time box office champion and biggest oscar winner of all time james camerons etched out a place in my mind as the one film that can most easily send me into a frenzied rant against the dangers of big budget epic film making sure i might not have put it that way when i first saw it i was seven but upon first viewing i knew that this film was nothing special four years later i was able to identify it as simply money thrown onto the screen with little room left for intelligence emotion or character yet even as i professed the evils of this production and its vapid screenplay penned by director cameron there were those who maintained that was an achievement among those people are esteemed film critics gene siskel and roger ebert  both of whom included it on their top ten lists of 1997 those celebratory citations led me to revisit again recently for the first time on dvd a disc which preserves the films original aspect ratio and presents the clearest available picture and sound the verdict as the old truism goes you can put lipstick on a pig but it is still a pigthe film isnt all bad the cast is solid considering the materialbut more on that later the score is rich the cinematography is evocative and the production design and visual effects are impeccable yet as it turns out all these elements do not a great film make greatest weakness lies at its very core the screenplay it reaches a level so wretched that i will be blunt in my metaphoric criticism camerons script isnt just a turd it is a floater it refuses to just be flushed away to haunt us no longer it insists on having an epic length and employing a framing device that may very well be the cause of a sudden onset of narcolepsy im sorry to resort to such infantile comparison but i believe that is best to convey the utter insult that is camerons screenplay i consider myself a romantic yet the socalled romance of this film left me cold with nothing to do except roll my eyes the film lacks any new vision or originality and that can never be commended im fed up at this point three viewing each one revealing an unplundered area of camerons incompetence this film remains an interminable and wildly popular mash of tired formula only be idolized by starry eyed tweens,sad
i try but i still dont see why people dont like this movie this movie is one of those films that makes you completely break down once you realize the full intensity of it they say about 1500 people died that night and 700 were saved due to the 20 lifeboats only 20 boats to save over 2000 people when you really think about it and watch families be torn apart it really shows the severeness of the whole situation i remember i watched it the other night and when i saw a family be ripped apart because only women and children were being let on the boats a dad told his children dont worry theres another boat for the daddies i broke down at that part while i watched jack and rose being split because she was forced into a boat you cant even imagine being there and not knowing what was gonna happen to your kid or your husband or father if you listen to jack teaching rose about life during the movie and telling her to make each day count it puts things in perspective he showed her so many things and like she said at the end he saved me in every way a person can be saved he loved her so much and you can see the chemistry between the two and that makes his death so much harder to watch its not fair that he had to die like that after doing so much for rose but it made the story and it made it great kate winslet and leo dicaprio did such a great job with this and james cameron really pulled it all together as the director you cant picture anyone else playing the partsthey did such a great jobthere were some great sceneslike when jack is handcuffed to the pole and rose has to break him free with an ax off the wall so she takes a few practice swings and then tries to hit it in the same spot and misses by like ten feet even though oddly enough she cuts him free perfectly as she smashes the chain with her eyes closed and then they have to wade through like really deep wateranother is where the mother is telling a story to her two kids so they will fall asleep and not be so afraid when they dieone of my alltime favorite scenes is where jack and rose are flying at the front of the ship celine dions my heart will go on seems like the perfect love song for thisalso the part where rose is on the carpathia and give her name to the guy as rose dawson is one of the sweetest things everthe part where she jumps off the lifeboat and her and jack run to meet each other and embrace each other where he tells her she is so stupid but is kissing her hair and neck and she says you jump i jump rightlastly i love the part at the end where old rosei guess diesafter they show all the pictures of her doing all the things jack was telling her they were gonna dowhere she dies and you see them again going up the staircase and all the people who had died and had gone down withtommy ryan the captian mr andrews fabrizio and helga cora and a bunch othersthen the camera swings to jack at the top of the staircase his back towards us and him looking at the clockjust like he did when he had eaten dinner with first class except he isnt all in his tux and allhe is dressed as himself and not all fancythis movie was so amazing and to all of those who say that it wasnt just that you obviously cant see past what you dont like and look at what it really showedtwo people in love an unsinkable ship that is doomed and a message behind it all,sad
there are some movies that will be remembered until the end of time the godfather sound of music life of brian lord of the rings cassablanca james bond trainspotting star wars the italian job and now not everyone will love these movies  i know that theyre not all my favourites but they will never be forgottenfor every movie i can see reasons why people might not like that movie but in this movie i can see no reason why someone would dislike this movie it really annoys me when people say that they dont like this movie because it is a superb movie with no weak points and the only reason why people say they dont like it is to try and be different as when this movie was released ten years ago everyone loved it but when people keep on singing its praises people want to not like it so they watch it and try to not like itthe acting is superb the director is superb and i dont think that its possible for anyone to watch it without crying it is the perfect love story combined with one of the greatest disasters of all times and they combine brilliantly to give one of the greatest movies of all timethe story moves at the perfect pace for this movie and shows times back then and the excitement at this brand new top class ship which makes you even more upset when the corridoors are being filled with waterof course there is that classic scene when leo and kate who give flawless performances are holding their hands outstretched at the end of the ship which will be remembered forever as a classic scene in movie historysumming up this is an unbelievably good film which is perfect in all places,sad
this movie was a brilliant romance masterpiece it has everything a good movie needs humor plot and most of all drama i wouldnt go as far as to say its the greatest movie of all time or even the greatest love story of all time but it is definitely within the top 10 leonardo dicaprio shows great drama and incredible acting as the part of jack dawson kate winslet is as evenly good at the part of rose dewitt bukater and the narration from gloria stuart is incredible this movie scores a 1010 in my book from the start of the movie with the uncovering of the to the overwhelming sadness of the end brilliant acting plays a huge part in this movie the actors were great the screenplay was great and thus the movie was outstanding,sad
when it came out was a sensation it still stands as a favourite for many but is disliked by many for reasons that i can only guess are due to its simplicity and entertainment value the acting is all good the plot is good though predictable as should be the dialogue is passable and everything else fits into place what are we left with dialogue there arent any iconic lines barring the cheesefilled im the king of the world or any lines with exceeding power or wit as there frequently are in typical classic films alas this movie goes beyond that the my heart will go on melody played throughout the film is touching to say the least despite my untoward attitude of the celine dion version of the song the two main characters come together in such a way typical of any romance movie jack and rose etc and etc until they etc and then the ship sinks good james cameron takes us all along for the journey though and shows us light and shade in the process which most good movies do after all a movie is defined by the sum of its scenes and i cant think of a scene in this movie that detracts from it many add to the experience some less so than others but its sum total rises above numerous other films nonethelessthe first time i saw i was reluctant at best it looked like a soggy chick flick which i dont appreciate at all at the video store i had to get five movies to rent to get the special and i already had four standing at the end of the alphabet i tried to see something that clicked and considering id passed over many times before when left with the same choice i might have been inclined to do so again this time i had no other choice ready my dad was calling and so i grabbed it it was the last of the five movies i watched but even though i cant remember any of the others it was probably the best i get feelings of movies before i see them something clicks into place and i either identify with the music or a character i see in the dvd menu or the opening credits and that happened as soon as i saw the dvd menu dont ask me ive got no idea why either historic though modern brutal though beautiful long though quicklypassing whatever that menu was it did it thinking back it may have been a map of the course or something along those lines silly maybe so but i was right 9 out of 10,sad

this movie is proof that everything loyd kaufman said about major studios is right they force their crap down our throats remove the art from filmmaking and award budgets and names instead of ingenuity and talentthis movie is bad from beginning to end its not just that i hate movies that are hyped this movie is just hard to watch i want romance not people saying i love you over and over again and i want a real couple not a couple of star crossed lovers pulled out of the average crappy teen drama and i want maybe this is too much to feel for the people who died on the not cheer when the ship finally goes downthe special effects were phenomenal but that does not make the movie great i never liked the characters rich girl and poor artist so why am i supposed to like them because they belong together even though they come from different worlds give me more then that neither of the characters was anything more then an empty shell of a being kate winslet and leonardo dicaprio tried their best but could not pump life into the charactersmany films came out that year many great ones this wins the oscar why do people like movies that are driven only by a tragedy that means nothing because we care nothing about the people we have a real story one of the most famous disasters of the 21st century the struggle of the people on the ship and those trying to save them the people who survived those who met their demise we dont need a love story that is completely without love,sad
a fellow reviewer wrote earlier that is among his or her favorite films and sometimes people laugh i myself laugh not at the movie but at that statement i echo what the reviewer said which is that at the time almost everyone loved the movie or at least recognized good stuff about it it was critically acclaimed made more money than any movie in history and received uncountable awards including the most oscars ever tied with ben hur at 11 winsnow i shake my head when i see that currently has a rating of about 67  jeez people view a movie for how it is rather than how oversaturated it gotand thats the problem was a very good movie and since i was interested in the actual ship a decade before the movie was made hopefully i can tell you why i support it the technical achievements alone were grand the scale of the movie was epic and moving and to james camerons credit it was almost 100 accurate to the many different details of the legend of course to accept this one has to ignore the fact that the main characters are fictitious amalgams of real passengersthose two characters are jack dawson and rose buttaker played of course by the leads dicaprio and winslet their awkward meeting and subsequent falling in love is played against the oncoming disaster which as everyone should know happened 4 days into the ships first voyage at 1140pm on april 14 1912 the hit an iceberg and sank 2 and a half hours laternow for the movie itself the acting although passionate is goofy at times due to a script that was much maligned as being stereotypical and bland i dont hate it that much it doesnt sound too far off from what people are like when theyre stupid in love however my problem arises here rose seems to be witty and independent yet she becomes a doeeyed child when she falls for jack who seems to know the answer to everything and even needs to heroically command rose to get back when the iceberg comes by more and more their relationship turns from possible to downright onedimensional as jack becomes a grand hero and rose becomes a helpless damsel granted each character has scenes where they betray that limit rose in fact saves jacks life at one point but thats an exception to the rule another problem is that quite simply a relationship between a first class woman and third class male is possible although entirely improbable people just werent that open minded in 1912 although for this movie it doesnt seem too severely hard to swallowthat having been said i dont have much of a problem with the rest of the movie this is because it stays admirably close to the facts and pays insane amounts of detail to each scene director cameron was in fact often joked about due to his fierce almost anal commitment to the details the ship looks real because most of it is the band played until the very end which they really did the ship indeed broke in half at the 2nd funnel and if you look close the iceberg scrape actually dots and dents the ships hull instead of tearing a solid gash as it actually did in real life although the 1958 film a night to remember had no fictitous characters and sticks religiously close to what really happened james camerons is technically the most accurate especially due to the breaking of the ship which wasnt proven until after the former film was made a couple technical slips do get by such as a terrible blue screen effect seen when the drunken baker is standing atop the risen stern just before the final sinking theres a shot of victims rolling down the upright stern section near the end and we can see one of them bounce off of the cylindrical capstans obviously a soft prop but hey these are just gaffes in an otherwise very good technical achievementin closing i still like this movie as i did when it first came out though not nearly as much now after a dozen viewings it has a lot of emotional impact it stays very very close to the actual facts and it can even be argued that although fictional jack and rose are just an example of what really happened to many of the couples on the real ship when it went down i dont think a better movie about the can be made although the aforementioned night to remember is also extremely good and in many ways just like james camerons film if you see the film for what it tried to achieve you can see that it is in fact a well made and successful film i know its hard to get past the negativity that its oversaturation caused but at its heart i think it is an excellent movie,sad
although was praised as one of the greatest movies of all time it was also the costliest which may have accounted for the eleven oscars it received in 1998 was not the greatest movie of all time but neither was it a complete disaster the acting was atrocious especially from the horribly miscast dicaprio who made up for this and romeo  juliet in 2002s catch me if you can additionally the love story was not very gripping for me the reason why i would have given an oscar for best picture would be the last hour of the movie which was breathtaking tearjerking and very very well done the fact is everyone knows how a movie called will end the boat will sink and people will die but that last hour it really made me feel as if i was on that ship and i felt the horror around me as it sank,sad
despite camerons showboating at the academy awards this is simply a bombastic mess his first mistake was to take on too many roles and crucially that of screenwriter what flimsy story he concocted to precede the disaster is rife with bad dialog and the most tired stereotypes imaginable take a look at the goofs page here too you would think they could have done much better sloppy work for one of the most expensive films ever madei felt like shouting at the screen at times are you kidding they spend how many minutes of the film in bonechilling water and arent even shivering just a little bit after getting out the water temperature would have to be about what 30 degrees after all theres icebergs floating in it they would have been hypothermic within minutes and dead after a few more and he gets the best director award for such atrocious work the man who would be king of the world indeedbilly wilder tersely summed it up in one of his interviews with cameron crowe have you ever seen such horse in your life,sad
i halfexpected an overwrought concoction of incredible high drama but james camerons fictionalized film of a real incident from 1912 is nearly free of derivative devices or sappy puppy love issues before the infamous ocean liner perishes in the icy atlantic ocean two passengersthirdclass gadabout leonardo dicaprio and conflicted firstclass passenger kate winsletfall in love in what is a very captivating romantic interlude cannilymade picture is of course full of marvelous effects but its this key romance that most people will end up remembering and with good reason as the performers are terrific camerons pacing is both giddy and tight and he draws vivid characterizations from the supporting players as well high entertainment 12 from ,sad
a 7 this masterpiece gets a 7 on imdb its sad that is lambasted by some people only because it was such a huge success on all aspects this heart warming and heart wrenching love story set against one of the biggest disasters of modern times is acted and directed flawlessly with sweeping score fantastic cinematography and its three hours pass so fast its amazing such emotional and cinematical power is rarely seen in mainstream holywood movies and this movie deserves its oscars and huge box office success kate winslet and leonardi de caprio are especially good rose and jack are unforgettable characters james cameron is truly a gifted filmmaker,sad
yes i know people all over the world have praised since it was released so im just going to add my own 2 cents worth of course the characters of rose and jack were two dimensional but thats the amazing thing about this film you just dont care about that at all you are able to look past that and see the scope of the film and the tragedy surrounding this the sinking of the worlds greatest ship by looking at it through the eyes of two fictional characters cameron has achieved the virtually impossible giving us characters we can care about without alienating the fact that the tragedy is only moments awaymany people have seen it more than once myself included and a lot of people ask why its simple yes you know whats going to happen and when its going to happen but you are able to look well past that and marvel in the awesome film skills of james cameron and his crew but its not just that by a long way the more you see it the more you seem to appreciate the whole saga of human tragedy that was apparent throughout the whole film james cameron has achieved what most people thought that he could not a movie with fantastic special fx that did not sacrifice the scope of the tragedymy personal rating ,sad
in the story is secondary to the films fantastic photography and incredible visual effects is easily one the most beautifully photographed films ever while the story is rather slow in the beginning it more than makes up for it in the last half of the film with the sinking of leonardo dicaprio delivers the best performance in the film while kate winslet does a good job with the little bit her character is given,sad
you know youre in trouble when a computergenerated oat upstages all the actorsa perfect example of too much attention paid to special effects and not enough to story logic uh or just about anything else  one brief example one of many of the stupidity that fills this movie  everyone stuck in the icy atlantic water at the end of the film is a popsicle in 10 minutes  yet leo and kate are able to swim wade and run through thousands of gallons of that very same water while trying to escape from the lower decks of the ship without so much as a shiver  if youre going to make a movie that purports to be realistic and historically accurate try to at least put a little bit of thought into the screenplay pleasethis is to say nothing of the wooden acting wooden dialogue wooden unmotivated characters the only thing not made of wood was the damn boat and i spent the whole first half of the movie just waiting for it to sink and kill off all the annoying passengers,sad
even if you put aside the fact that this movie could never have lived up to the hype that was put out for this movie it still was a horrible movie the movie was complete fiction except for the boat  it really sank but none of the plot was true  the movie was a disgrace  it used a historic tragedy to get people to watch their subpar movie  the movie was completely predictable and the basic concept has been done over and over and over again  i am ashamed that audiences flocked to a movie that just wasnt very good  it is a disgrace to hollywood that a movie that grossed the most money ever 600 mil isnt even in the imdb top 250 movies of all time it just shows you how hollywood is only concerned with profits and not with making quality movies,sad
i watched this movie with my father on video when jack started commenting on the dolphins he left saying if this is the quality of dialogue im going that about sums it up really it was a good idea and a terrible delivery in want of severe editing better writing and more convincing actors was probably the most disappointing movie ive ever seen with a wellrespected cast kate winslet billy zane and kathy bates to name a few 14 oscar nominations and 11 wins i was expecting a beautiful tale of starcrossed lovers and illfated voyages and it could have been that but unnecessary scenes uninteresting dialogue and wooden performances hindered what could have been an amazing movie,sad
james cameron should be hauled out and shot for even thinking that this screenplay was remotely intelligent and to think this is the same james cameron who made terminator mr cameron stick to making shallow action films and let drama be done by the people with some actual artistic integrity like pt anderson steven soderbergh spike lee and todd field,sad
generally im very much agnostic when it comes to heaven and hell the afterlife what you do in this lifetime decides what your afterlife will be like this film just about changed my mindyou see what scares me is that if there is indeed a heaven and hell then at this time in my life im not quite sure which one ill be going tothat doesnt sound so scary you say let me elaboratei believe that if there is indeed a hell then for me it would consist of watching an endless loop of a grown woman standing on the bow of a ship proclaiming i can fly and a big thank you from myself goes out to the makers of this film for providing just the source of that punishment for me when i do eventually end up in the afterlifeahhh thats off my chest now so what can i say aboutjames cameron i am actually  what youd call a fan of his work terminator aliens strange days the abyss much of the work he has had a hand in i rate as some of my favourite movies ever so what possessed him to do thiskate winslet and billy zane these are two of my favoured actorswhat possessed them to do this if you want to see kate winslet in a good film try to find heavenly creatures which is indeed an excellent film likewise for billy zane get a hold of dead calmin essence this film is 2  hours of cliched low iq utterly awful mills  boon romance that is so sugarcoated its likely to send any diabetic person watching it into a fit the only saving grace of this film is the final hour after the has struck the iceberg and then proceeds to sink which is when we are treated to the james cameron we know and love its just a damn shame that to get to this part i had to sit through 2 hours of a film that made my eyes bleedthe sheer amount of money this film has made at the box office as well as the quite high rating it receives here on imdb is truly a testament to the old adage that theres no accounting for bad tasteoverallthe prospect of hammering rusty nails through my manhood is infinitely more appealing than that of watching the first 2 hours of this film ever again3 stars out of 10 solely for the last hour but having to sit through the first 2 hours of this atrocity to get to this stage is simply unforgiveable,sad
james camerons was something else its amazing to think how this movie came out in 1997 is a film that many will remember that broke ground not just for the actors involved but for filmmaking in generalis very very well made you can clearly tell that this was a passion project for james cameron he wanted to make this movie special and he has the amount of research that cameron had to do to make the film look realistic is evidentthe entire set is a whole world in itself camerons direction transports us to ins and outs of the ship which all look so beautiful the atmosphere and grandness of the ship sticks with you especially during the inevitable sinking scene where you can feel the terror and panic aboard the cinematography is pure brilliance the ship has a very elegant feel and the set design and costumes from the inside also adds to that feeling visually this is one the best looking films of all timethe acting was sublime all through the film leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet are in top form and have some of the best chemistry in a film ever their romance seemed so believable that i never felt bored during it the supporting cast are also great especially billy zanei have to give immense praise to james cameron for handling this film he took a lot of time researching and working to make this movie the grand spectacle it is and feel as accurate as possible to the real incident whilst some think this film is overrated you cannot deny the sheer effort that went into crafting this movie,sad
is the film ive viewed 2nd most of all i am the kinda guy that can watche a good movie once every 2 to 3 months and ive seen some 2530 times and i should know the storyline pretty wellwhen seeing this in the theater first time alone and the next night with my wife i was lost for words each time my wife cried the whole night and well into the next night of this lovestory and whenever i put this in the video i know ill have the tv space for myself cause she made a promise to never ever let herself into a mental state again as when watching it the first timeits not so much the act that does this film its far too cliched to become a marvel of acting but its the heart and the cruelty of life and death that crushes my heart each time i see it the last 15 minutes are the worst and i usually stop when the flag goes below the surface of the oceanthe grumpy old man might be a crybaby but its worth it the second highest on my ever best movie list,sad
good film but unjustifiably anti englishaccording to the film all the irishscotsitalians etc were all down to earthlovely peoplewhile the english were stuck uprude and arrogantthis was especially true in fictitious situations,sad
is a film that truly gets to your heart leonardo di caprio performance in this movie set him in the hollywood radar despite not giving him an oscar the script is carefully think and every detail has been taking care off of course the soundtrack is in my humble opinion one of the secrets of the huge success of the movie,sad
the tale of the illfated unsinkable rms is a tale we all know too well but could not have been illustrated more beautifully james cameron went above and beyond illuminating this tragedy of the 1940s paralleling the pain heartbreak romance and anger from the horrific event directly through the film the two of the strongest performances ever given by dicaprio and winslet that it still remains unforgettable almost 25 years later the gut wrenchingly beautiful score by james horner is one of the films crucial elements displaying a whole new realm of emotions with every note this film is deserving of all of its success and will forever be a classic timeless and celebrated masterpiece,sad
its been a long time since i last watched i remembered some questionable dialogues and scenes from the last time i watched but what i had missed was something i had forgotten the true essence of the unending love for the story told in a way it was told for another eight years i was ignorant to iti recently saw a clip of which got me pumped to watch it again i started watching with my brother who never liked for reasons i couldnt understandthis time not only did i remember what i missed i felt the love with which it was made such magnificence the story style chemistry of the actors and the characters being played direction score everything blended together to show why was ever popular by the end of it i was almost in tears with even the one watching with me praising it and i finally witnessed what i was missing the way the story is told to eventually end on a note which would bring anyone to tears its perfection and to describe my experience in words in really difficult i was enchanted happy sad and whatnotthis is a timeless masterpiece and will continue to be for all times to come,sad
this film is something so beautiful and awe inspiring at the same time stricking you with a meloncholic feel that leaves a dent on your heart for a long time to come this film stays with you as long as you live and dream films,sad
this movie is 3 hours of pure pleasure  no matter how many times i watch it i never get enough of it every scene  every dialogue is a masterpiece which is impossible to recreate again ,sad
if you have not seen im sure youve heard of it and of so please do watch it because not only is the film a great watch or a great thrill ride of suspense and emotional scenes but is one of the greatest films of all time the film has some of the best acting from winslet and dicaprio and some of the best character chemistry between them the direction lead by james cameron is phenomenal the ending to the film is one of the most intense beautiful and sad endings ive ever seen i can not remark one flaw about it the cinematography is great and the film has some of the best and most memorable shots in cinema history yes that including the scene where jack holds rose up at the ship deck the soundtrack is amazing including celine dions fantastic song that totally fits the feel of the film is a must watch one i would have killed for to see on the big screen i will be posting a review of ahs apocalypse episode 3 this evening after the confirmed return of cordelia madison and myrtle so exciting stay tuned,sad
it was the first romance i ever saw in movies i was 11 and cried for such a tragic ending it has 9 years later i lost the count of how many times i saw the movie you can watch it in any mood believe me its not the characters or plot but the whole setting of something bad we knew will happen is the thing that creates the emo connection and there is no other movie that compares glamourous presentation,sad
adventurers delve to the bottom of the ocean to search the ghostly remains of the its a very haunting moment because it still rests at the bottom of the ocean this day they find a safe with a drawing of a young woman wearing a ruby known as the heart of the ocean they get a call from a 100 year old lady claiming the drawing is herthere is great chemistry between kate winslet and leonardo dicaprio who both give great performances its a groundbreaking achievement from the gorgeous cinematography sound effects and editing its a very immersive experience as there is so much attention to detail with the incredible set designs costume designs and makeup giving it a very authentic look james horners sweeping music score is heartfelt and intense james cameron is a magnificent director who before this made action scifi blockbusters like the terminator films and the abyss he proves that he is very versatile filmmaker who can make more than just action films its no surprise the film won 11 oscars and became the highest grossing film ever made,sad
is world famous the film that broke every box office record on release and wore the box office champion crown for many yearsuntil it was overtaken by jim camerons avatar is special because not only does it showcase the disaster in all its glory the film is a technical achievement of the highest order the sinking sequence is astonishing and it feels like you are watching the actual ship sink the characters and actors are amazing and even with a large running length you never dare look at the watch james cameron is a master director and is his stamp of authority,sad
i was 8 at the time when i saw it first time in 99 and man ive watched millions of top rated movies but this movie in every aspect is simply heavenly i cant put my feelings for this movie in words,sad
james camerons masterpiece is incontrovertibly the greatest anecdotal tale ever to grace the film industry this movie has to be camerons masterpiece that has never been rivalled in its grandeur this movie has a phenomenon ability to connect the audience on an emotional level taking them on an emotional rollercoaster as the characters form bonds and face adversity from all flanks of life this story juxtaposes the idea of love and power in different shades and angles leo and kate have a relationship that is based on human emotions and desires for bonding while zane challenges that connection of human connection by flaunting his wealth and attempting to allure kate with his affluence this creates tension between the characters and the story is very effective at controlling the crescendo so that the audience has an opportunity to connect emotionally with the characters that face this adversity with zane always prowling about throughout the movie trying to win over kates heart with his money there seems to always be a sombre feeling looming in the background as the events unfold between the main characters this ominous sense of dread that is always suspended in the atmosphere seems to tie in well with the fact that the entire the biggest commercial ship in the world is also portend to face an unknown tragedy in the future the director effectively seems to symbolize that human love between kate and leo as the impervious ship itself and reveals the vulnerable side of it this poetic depiction is demonstrated with so much gusto and romance that one cannot help but fall in love as the inevitable tragedy dismantles that colossal giant known as love present in all human beings,sad
the best i watch in my life  it has alots of feeling sadness happiness every thing i love it so much,sad
is 3 hours long yet managed to keep me captivated the entire time you can clearly see the effort put into this masterpiece basically everything about the film is amazing the visuals the characters and the story in general i love how the story cut between the past and the present the actresses of both old and young rose are amazing practically all of the actors put on a dazzling performance even the extras the first part of the film for the most part generates positive feelings even though you know whats going to happen the part where the ship sinks creates powerful emotions as the film really involves you and makes you feel like you were a part of it the film also makes you become attached to the characters these scenes are deeply upsetting and this film is the only film that i have cried during due to how realistic it is and that the fact that you know this really happened overall this film is beautifully done and is fully deserving of all the high praise it has gained it makes you feel all kinds of emotions and is definitely a film of the ages,sad
best movie i saw in last few years you should watch it with your gf and hold her tight like leonardo did at this ship sorry for spoiler xoxo,sad
i was sheltered and my mom did not want me to see the drawing scene and for other reasons so i didnt see this until i was 16 ive seen this 4 times now its great its also one of my favorite moviesthe only reason that i give it a 9 and not a 10 is there is a subplot about a necklace set in present day and i think the movie could have done without it still is worth seeingfun fact the movie is 194 minutes long which is how long it took for the real ship to sink it also won 11 academy awards the 2nd to do sobenhur was the 1st and lotr returnwas 3rd very worth watching910 review912 addition i recently watched this movie again and decided to give it a full 10while the 21 minute opening still seems to drag i let it go and fully immersed myself into the movie,sad
this was an epic movie in every sense of the word you knew the boat was going to sink and the movie showed more than that it showed a human love story amidst it the lady in it struggling with her jerk of a fiance good characters the many historical passengers of the ship john jacob astor the unsinkable molly brown etc a great cast and lovely scenery the sinking scene didnt just show the ship sink in a oneminute sceneit played on for an unforgettable length as panic ensued leonardo and kate rushed through the ship as freezing seawater flooded it and the walls and windows crashed the band played people raced for the limited lifeboats and the boat lifted up and broke in two before finally sinking the was great moviemaking although one questiondid kate kill leo at the end she could have helped him up 12 out of ,sad
exploitation is the apporopriate descriptiontaking the worst tropes of exploitation cinema a genre which has a lot of merits james cameron bolted on a sub standard mills and boon romance and made it the central story there are good performances just not by the leads kate winslett is wooden which is supposed to represent uptight dialogue is anachronistic for the period suited for 1997 and not 1912 with the lavish budget and long production time could have been an excellent study of class society and prejudice all of that is lost in favor of presenting a teenage love story the last scene was also egregious a night to remember is a superior film,sad
i dont understand all the bad reviews here im not given to getting syrupy over romance films but this one actually was pretty gooda telling of the true story of the sinking of the ship but this movie is first and foremost a romance movie kate winslet is beautiful and though they could have cast a better male lead leo dicaprio is not too badthe real star of this film is the sinking ship sequence it is quite realistic and the cold weather and fright of that night back in 1912 is at least partly captured  it must have been a terrible event for the poor souls on board that vessel the moment that was most poignant to me was when captain smith went back to his bridge and realized the ocean was about to break through his giant windowsrecommended for all who love a good romance film,sad
hear me out im not saying that is the greatest film of all time but it sure as hell is one of the most successful films of all time  if not the most period it won eleven oscars the record most for any film ever sure its tied with two other films but that still doesnt take away from it its the film that has the most oscar nominations of all time as well as many other accolades keep in mind there are a lot more awards nowadays than there were in 199798 it was the highest grossing film of all time at the time of release officially documented  if you want to talk about gone with the wind or star wars we can have that chat later until another film by the same director avatar came out a dozen years later all the major critics of the time including roger ebert who gave it a perfect 4 out of 4 stars were enthralled by the film absolutely captivated the people of the time also loved it indeed in 2012 upon rerelease people rushed into the cinemas to see it for a second time the film was of a supremely high quality too  especially kate winslets acting or the cinematography visual effects art direction costume design a decent enough plot and so forth there are films that are better than but there are very few that were as remarkably successful as this onein summary dominated the awards season was loved by the people and critics was a huge financial success still plays a prominent part in popular culture and is remembered two decades later whether you hate it or love it it was a smashing success in all senses and should be studied in film schools as an example of a successful film  if we want to see cinema as a business not just art many films nowadays are all buck no creativity,sad
great movieits hard to find a moment in the film that isnt great lives up to the term masterpiece excellent graphics an epic masterpiece ive seen this movie 99s of times and never tire of it with the centenary of the disaster the new 3d version introduces the movie to a whole new generation,sad
went to watch this on a date because my then gf wanted to see it like most of the female population it rumbles along at a steady pace with not much happening apart from some good effects and a boring love story the story between the two lead actors feels awkward and false it is a bit of a bore to be blunt but the special effects save it typical hollywood romantic dross this is not a film for men be safe  stay away510,sad
there are a ton of problems in  the cartoon villains the stilted dialog much of it obviously rerecorded in post production some weak supporting performances the betrayal of a number of historical facts and taking what was already one of the most dramatic nights of the 20th century and needlessly pumping it up with chases gunfire theft scheming etc yet a lot works as much as i didnt want to give in kate winslet and leonardo dicaprio make a great old fashioned star crossed romantic couple many of the effects and stunts are amazing although at other times you realize some wide shots are basically giant videogame like cartoons and it made me cry  while i felt like a fool for being swept up in its shameless melodrama i cant argue that is art or deep or a great film but i can say its a terrifically effective entertainment that everyone should see at least once,sad
may be a spoiled little drama but its the most astounding wonderful romantic movie ive ever known1st half is a bit boring and you may feel this movie is crappy at times also the love story between the lead couple isnt mentioned fullybut from the im flying scene the story gains momentum the 2nd half is spectacular and by the end it leaves the viewers crying the most emotional movie ever gives you an experience which no other romantic tragedy could it is the most magical poetic and picturesque piece of romantic movie work hats off to you cameron for creating an unforgettable drama of emotions trust love ambitiousness endurance survival and of all grief when lose the one you loved i love you ill never let go of you never let go,sad
when they announced this for a film being released i thought oh crap any average film would be very seriously overrated and very cheesy but when this film came out i watched it and i loved it it was so good that it was worth going to watch it again this film is definitely worth watching the romance scenes are filmed and acted out very well because when rose and jack kiss it really brings out the emotion it will express what your feeling and will make you want to cry when theyre escaping from the flooding of the ship because the is sinking words which leonardo dicaprio  kate winslet said in that scene which really isnt necessary like the fact that they kept on using the word sht the word is well overused in the entire film and that is what lets me down it could have been even better but the script writing lacked like it was rushed the cgi is really effective in the studio actually making it look like that it is sinking especially for a 90s film some scenes were just not necessary like the scenes which the old gran was telling the story why cant it all be set back in 1912overall it is a fantastic film and definitely worth seeingmy score is a 9310,sad
rarely does a story so well known by viewers surprise them so wonderfully everyone knows about the and the travesty that transpired but people often forget about the lives of those involved and the experiences they endured the story of the the infamous ship and two starstruck lovers who were merely forgotten displays vast beauty in an otherwise unfortunate event from the characters to scenery this movie captivates the audience with its enthralling imagery and emotional acting stars leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet perform incredibly in their respective roles and demonstrate that going against the status quo is not necessarily bad throughout the film viewers are taken on a journey one that begins with rose happily accepting jack into her life and then jack tirelessly trying to stay in it to say is a romance is an understatement it possesses action adventure drama and all the like and is far from your generic love movie i was gladly surprised by how much i loved this film even after seeing its numerous awards and superb reviews is a movie that will certainly not disappoint and it is definitely one for the ages that i recommend for anyone and everyone to see,sad
its sometimes difficult to assess a movie that was such a phenomenon in its day was a gigantic hit upon release talked about everywhere unavoidable in parallel to its massive popularity there was also a backlash of people denouncing it as clichd and overly sentimental a lot of whom were probably deliberately disliking it because of its ubiquity now its of that awkward age where its too recent to merit classic status but too distant to still really be talked about much as such its standing in posterity seems to be undecided as yethistorical romantic epics like this have long been around and have long done well at box offices and awards ceremonies and yes they may be formulaic but there is a certain craft in ticking all the boxes works by bringing us in with those opening scenes with the position of a clinical observer of the wreck as we might have seen it in books or documentaries the framing narrative has a modern familiarity that we can relate to we are then gradually eased back into the past and the story of the ship and those who sailed aboard her becomes humanized and im not just referring to the central love story in writing his screenplay james cameron goes to lengths to pick hundreds of tiny strands from the real fates of historical personages to brief flashes of unnamed figures this broad human retelling of a great disaster gives a wonderful richness not to mention a deeper poignancycameron was at this point bestknown for his blockbusting actioners like aliens and the terminator movies so as a director he might have seemed out of his depth on but cameron was always a professional never a showoff and he could handle weighty subjects with maturity he doesnt faff about with the camera usually keeping it still while all the movement is within the frame and of course when the movie turns more actionorientated during the ships sinking his experience puts him in good stead the collision with the iceberg is so suspenseful that every time i see it i still hope the ship will turn in time throughout the movie there are a lot of pointofview shots more than most filmmakers dare to use these days but the idea is to bring us close to the sensation of being there but perhaps camerons greatest strength is his finding of an apt image to tell a story in an instant from a man with his family frantically thumbing through a translation book to find his way off the ship to ismays guilty face against the side of the ship as he is lowered downthe studio took a gamble in allowing cameron to cast two lead players who were as young and inexperienced as winslet and dicaprio but it paid off winslet is not a traditional beauty but she has a vivacious personality that makes her attractive and instantly likable at first glance dicaprio seems to have been hired for his looks but he proves to have a deep sincerity such as the when he confronts winslet and confesses his feelings towards her and after all its moments like this where a performance counts the most but what really makes these two work is their believable youthfulness and that eager rapport between them passionate love stories that take place over a day or two can easily seem a bit false but winslet and dicaprio seem so great together the briefness of their affair is irrelevantthis diamond of a movie is not ill admit without a few flaws despite the brilliant construction of the screenplay the dialogue is woefully trite the special effects are typically overambitious 90s cgi with textureless surfaces and too many fake people although to be fair it still looks better than say a scalemodel would but whereas these problems would stick out like sore thumbs in a lesser picture has such a grand sweep and emotional power that they become insignificant i hope cinematic history will judge well because regardless of hype and counterhype it really is everything a movie should be,sad
one of the wellknown ships that became an disaster at sea was the it sank in 1912 on its voyage out to sea disaster struck when the ship hits an iceberg and cause it to sink the passengers of the were trying to survive many of them died some of them were in lifeboats now james cameron brings back the mighty ship in his film a man named jack dawson played by leonardo dicaprio he goes on the after winning an poker game also on board an beautiful passenger played by kate winslet and her fianc played by billy zane dicaprio and winslet fall for each other in love as the ventures out to sea then the iceberg hits the and that is when chaos begins passengers are frightened as the ship slowly starts to sink the ships sinking isnt about the passengers screaming and panicking but it gives an realistic dramatization of the ship real documentary footage of the real appear on the opening credits winslets character rose now old is played by gloria stuart who remembered what happen that night the movies visionary of the sinking is wonderful made with the special effects as for winslet and dicaprio they have great performances as rose and jack the film itself is a tragedy of what happened is one of the best films of 1997 an great true hollywood epic  4 stars,sad
i have seen the movie so many times that i remember the dialouges now and everytime i see i feel like there is something new to it it is the most amazing wonderful movie i have ever seen james cameroon could not have got better actors than leonardo and kate winslet to this movie i have fallen in love with jack since the first time i saw this movie never really occurred i could write a review about it but today when i am watching it again and had my laptop just next to me thought of opening my heart the music gosh i have never loved background score of any movie as much i love the band that plays when ship is sinking the song my heart will go on well nothing needs to be said about that i have been fantasizing this kind of love and romance ever since i saw this movie it is one grand movie ever made you cannot not like even a single part of this one i really want to have a sequel in which jack would come alive somehow with some logic or something this movie took my heart away its astoundingly beautiful and mesmerizing jack dawson is my love and will remain my favorite movie ever,sad
remember the worlds most heartbreaking moment the sinking of the well memories come back to us when the incredible james cameron and his big imagination create a powerful love story disaster the film is a fictional love story taking place in a historical event set to the sinking of the leonardo dicaprio plays a poor man named jack who falls in love with a rich woman named rose portrayed by kate winslet although separated by the number of money in their pockets that does not stop the love between each other then when begins to sink sacrifices are being made and jack would do anything in his power to make rose safe james cameron let out his heart into this movie and really wanted to express his feelings on the sinking though the film is sad and maybe too graphic the film was a beautiful masterpiece portrayed by an amazing cast a great direction an amazing recreation of history brilliant costumes breathtaking art direction scenestealing sound effects visionary film editing and exhilarating visual effects i watch the movie over and over again and never got tired of enjoying it cause it will never leave your heart ill never forget watching this movie and ill respect that it won the best picture on my birth year and glad it made a billion dollars in the box office this movie will always be epic and romantic in every way this is a visual marvel but it also has great characters and a terrific story to go along with it in my review a beautiful masterpiece of the heart something to enjoy watching over and overoh and speaking of the 3d rerelease its worth your money even if this movie was made in 1997 james cameron is one of those filmmakers that knows how to make perfect use of the 3d and he makes it look like the movie was made in 3d even if you wish that james cameron should have cut the film 20 minutes shorter you still believe that every single detail that james cameron added had to be there in the movie the 3d literally draws you into the adventure frankly because this is the type of 3d that is used perfectly just like in avatar so go out and watch it again in the special 3d treatment,sad
leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet are young lovers on the doomed in this 1997 film directed written and edited by james cameron the film also stars billy zane gloria stuart kathy bates francis fisher and victor garberrather than go into the story ill just say that this film is a true masterpiece meticulously researched designed costumed and acted and gives one the feeling of the desperation fear sorrow and finality that the people on the ship must have felt the entire time i watched it i kept thinking of the people on the planes and in the world trade center on 911there have been several films about the but none so lovingly recreated and so powerful emotionally kate winslet is exquisite as rose the upper class young woman engaged to a brute zane who falls in love with third class passenger jack dawson dicaprio dicaprio is terrific  exuberant passionate and adventurousif you dont know a lot about the this movie will pique your interest when you read more about it youll be impressed by camerons commitment to bring this piece of history to life,sad
this is honestly the best romance movie ive ever seen the effects of the movie were amazing yes i did cry to this movie and i have seen many depressing movies including angelas ashes if you have not seen it then i recommend you do not see it bc you will literally cry to death and this has been the only movie ive cried to and i dont care if you say its too depressing to watch i watched it a second time and i cried just as much as i did as the first time and you know what it was great if you have a girlfriendwife and if neither or one of you hasnt seen it go see it together she will cry maybe but you will get laid how do i know this experience james cameron your movies are the best do not stop making movies i really want to see what you will surprise everyone with next,sad
well i have never come across a film that so many people either love or hate i recently watched for the first time since i was about 12 i am now 23 so i understood it a lot better i am a heterosexual male and i cried during parts of i have no shame in admitting it and i am pretty sure plenty of other heterosexual males would of cried as welli will start off by saying that i understand why people wouldnt like this movie the romance story is very clich and i can understand why people think james cameron should of focused a lot more on the actual itself instead of a fictional love story i completely understand that what i dont understand is people saying the acting was bad  i strongly disagree with that sentiment i think the acting was absolutely superbjames cameron made by setting a fictional love story against a real historical disaster he never intended it to be a documentary if the viewer accepts this then the movie can be appreciated for what it isi found the love story very touching as i said its very clich but the acting from kate winslet and dicaprio is so convincing that you are able to really care about it i think the scriptwriting for this couple was absolutely fantastic as well you really understand roses situation and why she is drawn to jackthis movie tugs on the heart strings more than any other movie i have come across there are some very touching moments for example when rose jumps off the lifeboat and back on to the ship because she cant handle leaving jack behind not to mention how emotional the sinking was and how real it felt rose found the love of her life by chance on only to lose him when the ship sank that is heartbreaking however you look at itthe best part of this movie is the final 10 minutes or so in my view after rose tells her story it is revealed that she lived her life for jack and that over 84 years she never forgot about him when the camera pans across roses pictures note that at the start of the movie rose states that she always takes her pictures with her when she travels it shows her doing the things she talked about doing with jack and that she had lived a great life just like she promised himi believe she has passed away in the scene where she is in bed and the final scene shows her being reunited with jack in the afterlife surrounded by the good people who also perished on the i am getting a lump in my throat just as i type this i found it incredibly emotional i cant really explain it i think cameron did a great job with the romance storythe supporting characters also helped make this movie the characters of cal captain smith molly fabricio tommy murdoch and mr andrews were all fantastic i recommend this movie to anyone,sad
is a fair work from director james cameron sometimes being called on the carpet for its naive plot and dialogue this movie had the rare merit of reuniting the public and the critics in an unanimous way james camerons is an effective work to be remembered this does not happen so often for several weeks this movie had the privilege to score brilliantly on the top charts as well as conquering major movie awards around the world is it fair was it overrated that does not matter if we accept it for what it stands it worked perfectly the artwork is ostentatious and the acting if not perfect is adequate and balanced with the strength of the script written by cameron himself leonardo dicaprio gives the necessary honesty to the role while kate winslet grants the wit elegance and grace that a romantic and troubled heroin should have miss winslet was without any doubt the finest actress for the role apart from the supremacy of the visual effects which are the main core of this movie for most of its viewers dazzles for the truth and sensibility present in every single detail in every scene more than a parade of mere flashbacks from an old lady who once was a dish this movie is a fine drama made with a solid sense of loyalty and respect for the viewer you know what happens before you pay for your ticket you know it is a love story set on a transatlatic and you know people will die what matters most of all is the possibility cameron gives you to imagine what might have been if you had the chance to find true love under the most ungrateful circumstances 8 out of 10 for camerons sensibility and courage to write a story without having any previous experience as a screenwriter 1010 for a brilliant kate winslet a beautiful and talented british actress who proved that acting skills do not have nationality nor beauty patterns i had fun watching it it made me feel like i was sharing the inner conflicts felt by the main characters for its truth and audacity to tell a story already told a thousand times i bow with respect910,sad
spoiler what a crappy movie i sat through this piece of filth and i almost criednot from leo dying oh no i cried because it was probably the biggest waste of time i ever fell victim to in fact the only good thing about this movie was that little jack dawson dies god crappy movies like this  should get checked at the door for anyone that hasnt seen it dont im serious it will only p you off,sad
six years agomania swept across the us it won a boatload of awards and made serious bank which was more impressive due to rumors of massive budget overruns and long delays in filmingfor the record im not a fan put this up against la confidential and its very obvious what the better movie isbut i did find it interesting to sit down and watch it for the first time since its initial release and see whether or not it held upill deal with the romance it works yes its hokey but it holds up well enough to sustain people till its time to sink the damn ship and from a story stucture standpoint its necessary to have some people to identify with where it loses all credibility is the moment billy zane starts shooting leo dicaprio and kate winslett while the boat was starting to go down but by that time were in posiden adventure mode and more concerned about the special effectsmy big beef with is on the acting level horrendous miscasting all around save for leo and kate fran fisher couldnt act her way out of a paper bag billy zane phones in his performance even leo and kate have their bad momentsum the film could lose about thirty minutes and play even better than it does nowfinal verdict is merely average not horrible but not a masterpiece either,sad
romance movies are not my genre  there i said it now all you teenage girls or exteenage girls i should probably say can come with torches to my house and protest  that said i think this movie is not only a dud on the technical level but also on the content plateujames cameron loves creating megadose action flicks terminator 2 true lies etc that usually require little background or very uninvolving plots  the guy has little to no screenwriting ability if you read his scripts particularly for aliens you will see that there is nothing to applaud  fortunately as a director cameron can transcend the difficulties of putting images on paper and creating some impressive images even if the scenes themselves are rather dullby all means abyss and terminator 2 deserved oscars for cinematography but this movie is merely overrated endoftheyear garbage see also chicago that lacks emotion and style in his camerawork  much of his work here in seems more like hes stealing ideas from brian depalma rather than being inventivecameron learned from corman plain and simple and that similar attitude is displayed here  grabbing a cast from a fashion catalogue cameron proves once again that he hasnt lost his touch in how to be exploitive of human emotion  that might explain his love life problemson the rest of the technical notes this movie did not deserve most of the awards it was nominated for  the sound is on par with t2 read awful and the effects were unenlightening  someone want to explain how faceoff didnt get that award  the visual and sfx were fair  fair to poor that is cameron has lost his ability to know when to use cgi and when not to film editing totally awful this was waaayy to long even for me  hence i fell asleep three times during the sinkingmusic james horners score is nothing new it rather reminded me of the ten commandments and benhur  if i had a time machine i wouldve given him the oscar for aliens instead  and as for the director what a joke now cameron has become a recluse crackhead rather than therecluse genius he wasso do the math i have succeeded in knocking off 7 oscars from this overrated pos  now its on par with forrest gump where it belongs overall 15 out of 5 dont waste your time,sad
watching this movie makes me wanna cry not because jack dies in the end but because this movie stole all the oscars i didnt like this movie at all i may have liked the movie if leonardo had taken some acting lessons before starring in it kate winslet is kinda good but the movie it self is a great dissapointment the movie is well done but the acting and the plot is really poor i dont know who should have played the lead role instead of leonardo but anyone else would have done maybe ralph fiennes but he was probably too old for the part but he would have done it ten times better my favorite scene is when the captain dies he looks very calm and sad and my eyes didnt stay dry im sorry if you disagree with me but thats life,sad
i personally found the movie to be extremely well done from a technical perspective meaning effects sound camera work etc  however i felt that the acting was forcedthe accents being some of the worst ive heard since costner tried his hand at robin hoodand the script was atrociousmore resembling the banter of modern high school students than what i would expect out of an early 20th century debutante and orphaned pauper  cameron may be an exceptional director but hes no writer  of course there are many that would disagree but i think that most of this movies more staunch defenders have simply allowed themselves to be lulled into complacency by the stunning visuals and the feelgood love story  i admit that the movie does evoke a warm and fuzzy feeling if you allow yourself some suspension of disbelief but for the pickier among us we like to think of ourselves as having a more discerning or refined sense of taste it simply fell short of being a great movie  i personally found the circumstances of the love story between jack and rose to be exceptionally contrived  how did jack manage to get himself from being a poor orphan in the midwest to a starving artist in europe  how convenient for him that rose was a being forced into an unwanted marriage to save her family thus providing him a perfect opportunity into her pantserrheart the bottom line is that this particular love story would have been fine in a less pretentious movie but this was a 200 million dollar reenactment of a horrible tragedy brought about by hubris god himself couldnt sink this ship and exacerbated by classism  not exactly the proper venue for an exposition on teenage rebelliousness and hormones,sad
i love the story of the rms  love it so much that i myself cannot fully fathom why so ive long since stopped questioning it and went with it i especially love the stories of the people  god how i loved to hear people like eva hart ruth becker blanchard edith brown haisman milvina deanyou name em talking in a documentary or reading their various accounts i was so enthusiastic about the i wrote to the man who discovered her dr robert d ballard yes he replied and answered my questions gee is he a nice person   yes i am a dyedinthewool buff but i hate nay detest this movie  in fact i consider it the ultimate example of hollywood abomination of history nothing and i mean nothing can justify what was done to the real history in the film especially as it pertained to the most important element of it the reallife people  indeed the beautiful  recreation of the cut both ways in that it made the film an even worse travesty of history while being the only good thing about this clunker at the same time the fictional characters are in a word awful  in fact they are so awful as to be laughable jack dawson calvin hockley ruth and rose dewit bukutor spicer lovejoythe whole lot of them are carictures not characters it was claimed that jack and rose humanized the saga  as nero wolfe would say phooey  they didnt even come within screaming distance of humanizing the saga they were so awful what is more while careful attention to detail was paid in the creation of the ship sets and other visual details such attention also was a key part in making a double exploitation picturehows that exploited the appeal of the story as well as the youth market by cutting open the real history of the story and plunking down a love story in its place with a hot couple as the lead characters played by a hunk and a babe that were sure to win the  attention of any and all teen and nonteen viewers thus the film wound up being a frankenstien monster profitable to be sure but still a frankenstien monster the beautiful recreation of the as she looked in her prime dramatically contrasting with the awful teen exploitation story set aboard her in place of the real history even worse it was obviously known that if the film had a true to history depitction of the real people in the background of the love story it would distract from what was inteneded to be the films bread and butter at the box office jack and roses romance  so a crass tactic was employed misinterpretation and assasination of the characters of those like captain smith first officer murdoch molly brown and others while downplaying to the hilt the actions of reallife heroes like second officer lightoller marconi marine operators jack phillips and harold bride and wallace hartley and the other members of the band and even editing out those like major arthur peuchen and arthur rostron skipper of the valorus rescue ship rms carpathia just so jack and rose could stand outespecially jack the socalled hero of the story jack d is the ultimate awful hero in a bad story ever but i digress what is more the stories of all of the above reallife peopleeithier individually or combinedbeat the living heck out of the contrived fictional characters and story in any day not to mention how the tragic unsavory and controversial actions of the ship that stood still and didnt come to the aid the ss californian were bleached out entirely save for one deleted scene in closing no excuse no matter how smoothly phrased can expunge how this clunker so adroitly exploited the teen market as well as the appeal of the sagaand all at the expense of over 1500 people who died in a lonely patch of ocean decades ago when a madien voyage they were enjoying went mad down with this guilded abomination of the saga and up with the real history i say,sad
was one of those movies that get you thinking i wasted 3 hours of my life watching this of course there are going to be those people that tell you to relaxing and just watch the movie how can i it gets so irritating the first hour that it makes me wanna fall asleep then theres the inevitable love story that does not make sense it reminded me of pearl harbor both movies put way to much emphasis on the love story that it makes the actual event just look like a subplot i highly recommend something actually watchworthy something like the shawshank redemption or black hawk down not this massive failure,sad
i have seen many times and i am still captured by the brilliance of the way this movie is filmedi believe is one of the greatest films ever my favorite only because it involves the audience so well  not only has james cameron provided us with a real look at the era in which was present but he has designed a story which will have people wanting moreit is a must watch movie,sad
breathtaking it was not amazing i dont think so brilliant yeah right the best movie ever made not even close yet the box office would make out that this pathetic attempt to reinact a tragic undertaking which has been reinacted more times than i care to count was actually pretty good very good even hell  because of the soppy dogooders of the world that went to see this its the highest grossing movie of all time and were told that its a wonderful tale with wonderful actors a wonderful script and wonderful setspuleeeeeese there is absolutely no talent in leonardo dicaprio kate winslet or billy zane the sets were completely overdone and unrealistically fake the script was complete loservilleish and boringthe only part that was good was when rose was going to fall off the ship and when that guy gets hit by the ship propeller at the end this undeserved multiple oscar award winning film rates 110  james cameron should not have wasted his time and money,sad
i still dont see why this dumb movie got like 11 academy awards well it just goes to showi didnt like this movie at all at first i thought it was going to be ok because i had just seen romeo and juliet and i thought leonardo dicaprio was pretty good in it my friend dragged me to see in theaters and i hated it none of the parts moved me or anything the part were he froze i laughed at it and people were giving me the evil eye haha ugh i never want to see it again most overrated movie of all time which didnt deserve the praise it got,sad
for some reason 2 and a half years on people still take this film seriously 1 why do they have the nudity scene as a substitute for artistic quality although it is very nice 2 why did they cast leo because how else would they attract female audiences all they did was spend alot of money and got some sex appeal and the product was a goldmine of shallow sap okay i understand that people might have got caught up in the hysteria at the time but surely people can now see all the cliches and sentimentality even the academy fell for it and gave this movie a richly undeserved best picture oscar if you are looking for the definitive movie of the decade see schindlers list goodfellas or the shawshank redemption but please think twice before renting this mindnumbing schmaltz,sad
perhaps unique among timetravel science fiction in that there is no explanation given for these 1990s characters finding their way to 1912  the story begins with them in the past but there is never any mention of a time machine or other device bringing them back  obviously they are not natives of the early 1900s given their behaviour and speech and i find it quite strange that james cameron chose not to show us how they travelled back in time to 1912  he handled the time traveller angle much better in the terminator films   special effects are great except when obviously cgi which is often,sad
when billy zane took out his pistol and began firing at the fleeing lovers i thought to myself oh puhleeeeze weve got the biggest maritime disaster in history going on here and the director feels he needs to provide more drama and contrived drama at that to me it just crystallized the absolute creative and emotional bankrupcy of this movie,sad
did i really need to see this no not really in fact i only needed to see 5 minutes of it to know what was going to happen then i fell asleep for the rest of the 2 hours and 55 some odd minutes,sad
i will admit that i did enjoy this movie to a certain extent it deserved the many things that it got and some it did not deserve the 11 oscars all i can say is congratulations mr cameron you are a genius the box office smash good for you but the repititious boring and old hype for this movie went way too far it wasnt as good as it was made out to be for one the whole teenybopperleonardo dicaprio love craze lasted way too long it was not an abnormal thing one of those passing phases but was the sole of the huge amount of money it madei will admit that i did enjoy this movie to a certain extent it deserved the many things that it got and some it did not deserve the 11 oscars all i can say is congratulations mr cameron you are a genius the box office smash good for you but the repititious boring and old hype for this movie went way too far it wasnt as good as it was made out to be for one the whole teenybopperleonardo dicaprio love craze lasted way too long it was not an abnormal thing one of those passing phases but was the sole of the huge amount of money it madenow i saw this almost first in theaters the weekend it came out i saw it twice in theaters and maybe two or three times on video which i own i hadnt read any reviews for it i loved it and cried it had its share of flaws a rather large share at that the critics dont pick up on these sort of things one thing i did not understand how kate winslet picked up an oscar nomination and leonardo dicaprio did not now i am not especially a fan of mr dicaprio i leave that to the girls but he did just as good of a job as ms winslet if not better the performances in the film were marvelous and spectacular and mr dicaprios was exceptionalthis movie had too much of certain elements and too less of others of course everyone knows how the background story ends the ship hits an iceberg and sinks that is not a spoiler anyone living in north america and europe should know at least an ample about of information about it but the emotional sidestory about the love affair between a firstclass rich girl with everything and a lowclass poor guy with nothing and of course what would a movie be without a bad guy a villain of some sort billy zane gives a great performance in this role as usual the kind of guy you love to hate and hate to love but you always figure out a way to do both through the film you get to like jack dicaprio and rose winslet a lot more as their love affair continues through the first tape it builds to the climaxeslets just leave it to the famous car scene and the more famous drawing scene the second tape or the second half things start to go downhill the excitement is more blah and the suspense is still there but is predictable and gets quite silly and sappy the dialouge towards the end is very silly and sounds very rehearsedthe movie would have been a lot better if it focused more on the ship itself the iceberg etc and less on the emotional story is an inappropriate title in this movie this situation could have happened on an airplane be given the name southwest airlines and wouldnt have been half goodwell my point is i enjoyed this movie it was great not excellent but a great movie definitely will go down in history books but not in mine not on my top ten top twenty maybe the top fifty 12 out of ,sad
yes it was wildly overrated in that respect serving only to inflate jim camerons ego  yes it is certainly not the best movie ever made  yes the script was weak and the acting isnt really too wonderful  leonardo dicaprio has the blandest most obvious lines ive ever heard does not act them very well at all and basically suvrives only on his smile and the fact that everyone knew millions of teenage girls would be swooning  i didnt understand billy zanes character but he wasnt on very much so i didnt have to be confused by him a lot  i do think its awful that all those girls cried only over leo and not over the thousands of people who died but for those who were watching for another reason there is still a pretty good movie there in my opinion  the scope is amazing with all the sweeping shots lavish mostly accurate details and spectacular effects cameron really orchestartes the mood of every scene wonderfully though some of it is pretty cheesy for the most part i really was caught up in it while the acting isnt spectacular as i said some of the people turn in pretty good performances  kate winslet did for the most part though in the action scenes where shes given the role of hero instead of doing something with it she just pants away and screams for leo and does nothing else  otherwise she handles the acting pretty well  frances fisher kathy bates the captain the designer of the ship and the many thirdclass passengers were also good  even though the movie focused on fictional characters and not on these people theres enough there to really affect you  seeing them being so cruelly and unjustly shut up in steerage and not being allowed to get to the lifeboats is a pretty powerful scene  and just tell me you werent in some way moved by the mother singing her kids to sleep the old couple who were real hugging each other in bed the people getting shot and killed by smokestacks the captain shutting himself in as the windows break and the band playing on and on and on  i mean come on this really happened  it was the most affecting part of the movie for me i guess it was because i was so affected by it that i felt sad when leo went under  all the naysayers concentrate on the fiction part which admittenly isnt up to the standards of these scenes but also is not the only thing there  perhas if people just didnt look at the first part and only at the second part theyd understand one reason why this movie was so successful yes the teenage girls were a big factor or so we hear but plenty of other people went two and three times besides them and they went because they were so affected by it that they just had to see it again  maybe it doesnt deserve to be the most successful movie ever made but it deserves to be a classic and undoubtedly will be no matter what anyone says  yes it has flaws but what movie doesnt  theres more to this movie besides those flaws if you just look,sad
i liked its a good old fashioned adventureromanceepic with a strong storyline and definable characters sure the tacked on romance is as stock as the characters but that is still better than the alternative served up by most modern movies ieno plot and no characterization at all the thing that bothers me about this version of the sinking is that writerdirector cameron takes full credit for the screenplay when so much of it was directly lifted from a 1958 film about the event a night to remember also a book and a previous film and im not talking about the fact the sunk or any of the other factual details of the storyobviously those will be the same im talking about virtually identical scenes events and dialogue that could not be gathered from public record scenes such as the ships builder standing alone in the tilted ballroom looking at the painting on the wall as the ship goes down or the rich ship corporation ahole being told that yes his ship is going to sink no matter what he says or identical scenes of the steerage rabble breaking through the gates these scenes and many others are mounted and shot in so similar a fashion to the previous film with such similar dialog that i believe they cross the border into plagerism rent the 1958 version of a night to remember watch it and tell me im wrong,sad
so much has been said about that its hard to come up with anything new some people claim its the greatest thing ever directed others say one is too high of a rating i fit in the middle this movie had beautiful setting and scenery some gorgeous shots of the ocean and the sunset three thumbs up to those who shot those scenes and this movie did have a plot it didnt need to be three hours long but non the less it was present was a tragedy and this movie was not a celebration of it it tried to put a story to it which it did although the characters were fictional perhaps stories of the sort did happen certainly not as dramatic thoughcharacters could of been a little more developed because with the exception of sally brown they were all black and white i personally really liked the reactions of different people to what was happening on the ship nobility of the captain mothers prayers musicians attitude etc cameron very well portrayed those peoplesomething was missing from the plot however it in a way lacked emotions as i watching this movie i realized that what was happening on that ship was awful but i didnt get a sense of reality from it i didnt feel the horror to the bones and i certainly didnt feel the pain of those people who were drowning i mean i knew it was there i just didnt experience everything they did emotionally and a good movie should make a person do thati dont think this movie deserved an oscar but it still deserved attention as a good movie with imperfections after all very few movies are flawless,sad
has the world gone utterly mad is the bestgreatestmost wonderfullest movie of all time nooooooooooocome on people lets get a few things straightfirst the good news 1 had lovely and seemingly accurate costuming 2 beautiful sets 3 firstrate special effects okay lets call the fx spectacular and 4 a gorgeous musical score overall i was so touched at the end of the movie that my eyes were filled with tears for some strange reason my wife finds my sentimentality amusingnow the bad news 1 the scripting was awful some of the dialogue that came out of the characters mouths made me winch with pain 2 the characterizations were weak and predictable there was no doubt as to who were the good guys and who were the bad guys all the good guys were totally good all the bad guys were totally bad if you ever want to see a person who has both good and evil qualities all you need to do is look in the mirror its called human nature 3 some scenes can only be described as vulgar disneyesque who can forget that romantic ill jump your bones you in the back of the car number oh and lets not forget the hand running down the window now that was touching 4 blame the script all you want but the acting was weak and finally 5 one of the worst scenes in a motion picture the infamous ill teach you how to spit scene that was in such bad taste with the possible exception of really uncouth adolescents who could watch that scene and not be repelledokay now that ive gotten that off my chest i feel so much betterto conclude no was not the best movie of all time nor was it the worst its a mustsee movie no doubt about it it is a great movie if you like blackandwhite characters with a colorbynumbers story line unfortunately if you demand complex characters solid acting and credible plots you will be sorely disappointed,sad
brilliant visual effects along lavish sets and costumes do not a great movie makefirst and foremost that horrible clicheridden cheesy screenplay with those stereotypical characters right out of central castingthe acting billy zane should be suspended from the screen actors guild as punishment for the most severe case of ham acting ive seen in 30 years of moviegoing leonardo dicaprio who can occasionally do good work is out of his element hes a valley boy trying to a historical piece even an actress as talented and beautiful as kate winslett cant make that cheesy dialogue work kathy bates is good but her role is little more than a cameo and victor garbers delicate performance as architect thomas andrews allows him to subtly steal the few scenes he is in frances fisher and gloria stewart are embarrassing to watch just what the heck is going on between bill paxton and suzy amis in that ridiculous story bookend the rest of the cast seems to have been inspired by the central casting stock character actors of the 1930s the high society snob the bumbling billionaire and his heavily accented manservant the poor pitiful irish peasants the arrogant industrialist the heros comically zany best friend who meets an untimely death the first class gentlemen who behave like gentlemen while the third class men push women and children out of the way to get on the lifeboats i could go on and onjames cameron direction has a few inspired moments mostly some interesting camera angles but for the most part each scene tries to out cliche the previous oneto see a real movie about the with real characters and real story rent a night to remember,sad
for all the acclaim this movie has received a rant is due  i believe i was one of the first to walk out on this movie at the preview showing two weeks before its release  it was like two chickflicks back to back with 5 minutes of spectacular action a redeeming quality  im not going to dispute anyone on the plot the filming of the movie was excellent costume design did a great job and despite several factual errors i can see why so many liked it but to call it the greatest motion picture of all time blew me away  the requirements of the greatest movie of all time has to have some influence on society become a part of our culture even impact those who have never see it on top of being a great movie  more people are taking the day off to see the phantom menace than ever before  lucas is setting strict requirements on movie theaters distributors even the ticket sales are up to him  who else can do that with a movie before it was released now i am not saying that it will be the best movie of all time or star wars either i know blasphemy to some i am not to judge but the jury is in and its definitely not  for a movie to be considered the greatest it has to be accepted on all levels by all audiences young and old male and female  there are a lot of great movies out there even being one but lucas has set the standard for the greatest movie with the star wars trilogy  no swearing no sex violence yea you have to have that but for all ages come on who would have ever thought that  all i know is i need not worry about the advocates they will soon be silenced and records will be smashed by the menace the force is not with them,sad
okay um tell me again what is so good about this movie how did it win best picture next to good will hunting why does everyone obsess over leonardo dicaprio i didnt even cry at now i am a girl but have only seen this movie once and almost every single one of my friends loves bawled their eyes out at the end and adores leonardo dicaprio  co me i think armageddon is sadder than this movie i nearly cried at that one all i hear is this or that im sick of it i have to admit the special effects and set designs are good but this is just romeo  juliet set in 1915 i guess i just didnt feel the romance im not an unemotional person but ive seen movies a lot more moving and entertaining than i almost want the phantom menace to beat its highest box office gross record  if you havent seen dont take everyones word for it if they say its the greatest movie on earth okay thanks2001rulz,sad
dear god this movie amazed me what amazed me more were the sheep that bought into it and the little lambs that were allowed in this is a movie with nudity sex violence and some very disturbing images that are not appropriate for young childrenok now on to the review my friend dragged me to this over the march break last year and i am only now getting past my disappointment to discuss it reasonably to all those who think it is the greatest movie of all time i would love to know what your criteria is do you go by acting outside of kathy bates and some minor players there is none i got about as much emotion out of leo as i did out of my hampster in her final days winslet was bareable although i cannot comprehend her bearing all unless james felt that the teenage male was an important demographicnow you cannot completely fault the actors because the script was hardly anything to shout about unless you are the ranting and raving type i have seen the iceberg and now i see it in your eyes could not be any more sappy it was full of little bits of dialogue that were laughably out of historical context and the characters could not be more cliched which brings me to the story itselfit was as if someone took all the period pieces about class disparity and jammed them through a meat grinder all the juice ie plot and intrigue leaked out of the bottom and a squishy  messy mixed up movie was the result the kind young talented pauper falls in love with the rich testy unhappy girl who is betroethed to the evil industrialist joan collins would be impressedbasically if you want loud noise and dont mind a few tits plus you can survive 2 hours of boredom interspersed this movie is worth it otherwise you havent hit puberty yet or you really need to watch some real movies like citizen kane or on the waterfront,sad
this movie has it all  horrible casting lame dialogue abysmal acting what more could you ask for in an awardwinning film the awards i am thinking of of course are the razziesi wishi started looking at my watch and squirming within 10 minutes this film could not end soon enough for mebesides the above i was furious that cameron also tried to revise history and make rose into a 1990s woman  a gently raised young lady in that time and that place would anever have been the only person on board who knew that there were not enough life boats for all the passengers bnever have heard of mr picasso and dr freud  in addition 3rd class passengers would never i repeat never have been allowed on a 1st class deck and vice versa  i also found it insulting that all the poor people were noble and all the rich people except rose of course were evili kept thinking about joe queenans comment sink the damned boat already i never thought id find myself rooting for the iceberg,sad
features one of the worst screenplays ever perpetrated on the moviegoing public  unbelievable onedimensional characters is the billy zane character a joke or what banal dialogue and not an ounce of believable romance in the love scenes  i found myself bored and waiting for people to die  plays like a dark version of the love boat  how can the academy award it best picture when it didnt even receive a best screenplay award  and when kenneth turan of the la times pointed out how poor the screenplay was james cameron threw an infantile tantrum and tried to get turan fired   decades from now hollywood will be embarrassed that they ever honored this liveaction cartoon  but hey until then the special effects were nice,sad
i personally think this movie is a crime to humanity and a disgrace to the movie scene  i am heavily disappointed in james cameron here just by making this moviemy first problem with this movie is the setting  he turned one of the greatest mechanical travesties of mankinds history into a love story  only on a few accounts did he james cameron show any real pity for those who were on the  by giving the characters a snobby attitude cameron assumes were not supposed to feel bad when we see them falling from the deck of a ship and breaking their backs on railings  the few decent parts of this movie were the examples of illtreatment to the lower classmenwomenas for the lovestoryever hear of lady and the tramp  this is a blatant ripoff of a classic disney film granted the character of jack is charismatic and holds an intelligence all in his ownbut leonardo dicaprio  he did a decent job in romeo and juliet but this was just bad acting  kate winslet also did a subpar jobi didnt find her emotion to be real  billy zane did a decent job as a villain but i think he just looked the part overall the acting was subpar in this movie  next time we have a monumental motion picture event like i would like to see actorsactresses who have not made appearances in seventeen magazinethe whole idea of the tragedy of the on film makes me sick  i cannot believe a human being would make money off this film and be able to live with himself  mr cameron you disappoint methis movie should not have been made into a lovestory let alone be made at all  510 stars,sad
for those of you unfamiliar with the term chickflick  a chickflick is one of those movies that appeals to bored housewives preteen girls and professional movie critics you have all seen at least some of a chickflick  be it the victorianengland costume drama the shakespere movie or pretty much anything starring maryl streepis a majorleage chick flicki saw this movie once and have to say that while the special effects of the last 45 minutes were really cool the rest of the movie was typical chick flick  it was a bad story combined with bad acting bad dialog bad scriptwriting and a really bad theme song if i hear that celine dion song one more time im gonna freakin rip my hair out now some people are gonna say to me oh yeah how do you explain the boxoffice records  well have you ever seen the theater line for  99 of the patronage is young girls who keep pictures of leonardo dicrappio in their purses and have seen 25 times each  if you can get a prettyboy lead coupled with a stupid simple tragic romance and an annoying theme song any movie can be a blockbusterif you are a normal guy you probably wont like this movie  but if chickflicks are your favorite enjoy,sad
there is an unfortunate belief in hollywood that special effects makes a movie good or bad i prefer to think that what matters is the human aspect of it the writing directing acting so it is unfortunate that many try to defend based on the special effects qualitythere were many great movies made in 1997 including but not limited to good will hunting as good as it gets kundun dark city and gattaca and one interesting thing about these movies is that each of them with the possible exception of the latter two could be made at not twentieth the tithe of the production cost of with that money many great movies could be madewhen a movie has a high specialeffects budget it is the job of the effects not to support the poor quality of the film but to serve a spartan purpose of whatever it is they are used for if cameron were to try to show one tenth the sincerity shown in a good movie instead of showing off special effects would have been far better than the disappointment that it was,sad
not only did i consider this movie a very overrated piece of tripe bad acting bad dialogue predictable story great effects  ie your typical american action film of the 90s but now i have to fear the possible repercussions of this film  this will surely send the signal to hollywood that we want more big budget movies that focus more on effects than story godzilla armageddon lost in space sphere  cameron would have done well to edit this into a much tighter two hour movie by cutting out the ridiculous action scenes that clogged the middle of the movie,sad
lets face it nobody wants to spend three hours in a movie theater anymore except those people who have no lives this film was too long and drawn out not only that but it also has the same problem apollo 13 had everyone knows whats going to happen this makes the film dull and boring,sad
ive been a great lover of the for many years and have read everything imaginable about her  ive seen every movie made about her  i looked with anticipation to the release of this movie with high hopes  was i disappointed  i thought the acting was worse than second rate  it was way to modern  flipping the bird in 1912  i doubt it very much  ill admit the special effects were very good but please dont rate a movie on special effects only  it will never be a classic  stick to the facts  why do you have to have romance to have a good movie  the real love affair of this movie should have been with the ship itself it seems that lately when someone mentions the first thing that pops into the conversation is this sad excuse for a movie try to tell people about a good movie like a night to remember and they scoff you who wants to see a black and white movie when you can have this  i do,sad
i think the best part of the movie was from when the iceberg hit the ship and on to the end  the special effects were great  the people falling from the ship hitting their heads on the ship as they fell down into the water looked very realistic to me  i also think the ship itself was very impressivemy problem is with the acting and some of the lines that were used  for example the spitting really irritated me  it seemed so 1980sish  also when jack and rose were running away from the coplike man and rose stuck up her middle finger as they were going down on the elevator that seemed to be more of a current action that people would do not something that was done in the early 1900s  i am not saying that gestures like this did not occur back then it just seems strange to me and out of place with supposed timeline of the movie  also the phrase masters of the universe used by rose as the men retreated to have cigars and brandy really seemed out of place would that phrase really be used back theni think the writers tried to make rose a little too smart  freud monet picasso not enough life boats etc isnt she supposed to be 17 or around that age  yet an 1 hour later shes running around the ship like an 8 year old which i think that part was pretty realistic because teenagers can act like that sometimes just to be having funi still have no idea what the two lookout men said to each other after the iceberg hit  i can not understand the lines they are saying at alloverall i guess the movie was decent but it was because of the special effects  i think all the characters were good and believable except for jack and rose  i especially liked mr andrews  the actor made me really feel sorry for him at the end because he really seemed like a nice guy  the captain at the end was believable too  the mom cal everyone was believable except for jack and rose  they kind of sickened me a bit but i am not sure as to why  i am not into love movies entirely too much but i do cry from time to time beaches schindlers list beauty and the beastdont laugh  the scenes with jack and rose just did nothing for me,sad
too bad the saccharine plots banal dialogue and musicand patently phony seascapes diminished the special effectswhich were well donethe crude behavior and talk of the salvage team in the graveyard were particularly offensive,sad
while the effects and acting were good i couldnt help but be disappointed by the cliched story  poor boy meets rich girl and everyone from the boyfriend and his henchman overthetop villainy if ever ive seen it to the snobbish mother is desperate to stop them  come on  the ship is sinking and theres time for a chase scene complete with shooting weve seen this story a hundred times only the set a good one at that was different,sad
i saw this film at a friends house expecting a nice flick but i was wrong in my opinion didnt deserve all the acclaim its been given it would have made an okay movie but the cliches were heavy enough to sink the ship even if it hadnt hit the iceberg chances are the reason this film was so successful is because it crudely slams together all the various concepts that other successful films have used they include 1 romance between rich and poor 2 stuffy rich folk happy free poor folk 3 an adventurer worldtravelling lead male character 4 a husbandtobe for the main male characters romance with a tendency to be abusive 5 a historical setting 6 the romance genre done very sappily 7 attempts at making the audience cry by showing scenes of various tragedy in case the sappy romance plot fails to make one cry so that people will call it touching the list goes on and on but unlike so many others im afraid ill have to chuck this entire film and all its content in the its been done area if you like seeing concepts all mashed together with little subtlety however this films your ticket to enjoyment a foul movie,sad
james cameron is one of my favorite filmmakersbut i loathe of coursehow can i argue with all the teenyboppers who turned it into a hit this movie is worthlessalbeit beautiful its just so incredibly precalculated and manipulative and annoying,sad
this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen the script is a standard hollywood love story the dialogs are very weak and kate winslet swims around for minutes in the cold water any other person be already dead at the end of movie there is an only empty feeling this movie doesnt work,sad
i am still crying as i am writing this review as of right now i dont even know where to begin i can now see why this film was one of the highest grossing movies of all time the blending of genres was masterfully done through the style of a historical romancedrama and a disasteraction film the writing was absolutely superb for a 3 hour movie i found myself completely engaged not even blinking my eye the costumes music performances characters cinematography dialogue was so magical i cant even put words here to describe the beauty of everything put into this movie the performances just take your breathe away jack and roses love story is so full of life and heart and what true love should be even if its a battle or your not the same class and cant be together ounce you find your soulmate thats what love is about their characters felt so human and that really is what puts this movie at a whole new level the camerawork is some of the best i have ever seen in any film i dont even want to spoil how thrilling chilling beautifully well done the sinking part of the film is because it is something you just have to see for yourself and experience the devastating heartbreaking tragedy that occurred james cameron you are and will always be one of the best filmmakers to ever live and this is your masterpiece,sad
it had a great romance storyline this is one of the most famous movie of leonardo dicaprio and i knew him by this movie,sad
i love its one of my favorites rip bill paxton,sad
lengthy but great acting and rollercoaster of emotions,sad
when it comes to this movie im out of wordsa sensational movie that exceeds your expectations every time you watch it they excelled in the choice of characters  theme  outfits  plot i can never stop embracing this movie the best movie for 20s era,sad
great movie realistic story with some drama a lot of cry in this movieleonardo dicaprio was great,sad
the increasing slight sense of foreboding the humour at the climax that doesnt lighten up the tragedy but instead somehow makes it even more unsettling and ominous the charming and extremely amiable starcrossed protagonists to name a few james camerons is one of the best indirect adaptations of shakespeares masterwork romeo and juliet even when it comes to the issues i have with this film most of them are pretty much similar to those i have with the play and ive always found these issues justifiable to some extent also the visuals are uniquely spectacular and cline dions my heart will go on is timeless8510,sad
i remember that the nude scene kept me uncomfortable because i watched it with my father theni feel sad every time i watch the rise and fall of luxury cruise ship i was impressed with a captain and band left on the shinking ship they accepted to be with the ship quietlyi was so afraid of the scene people came off from the careening ship it traumatized me because i have acrophobia if i watched it in 3d it would be more scary,sad
rose could have moved her body a little bit and jack would have been able to survive since the door she was floating on could easily hold them both on the surface,sad
well the british people made their decision we must respect that result im so sad and heartbroken this film represents the fall of great britain in the years ahead was a british ship and had everything going for it until it hit an iceberg after being manipulated by people only interested in money and power the same thing is happening to britain now and it wont be long until britain hits that iceberg im sorry i couldnt serve the country i love and every time this film is on i play the violin and weep tears of sorrow because i failed my beautiful country the acting in the film was top notch as were the special effects and the dialogue however the sheer sadness of the film all those lives lost and also the way it kinda predicts the future deeply saddens me and makes me suicidal every time i see it and for that reason i cant give it more than 8 stars i wouldve given it 9 stars before the referendum but now its 8 stars may those that died on the rest in peace,sad
so this is basically a typical story where a old woman who reminiscence about her past and tells the story on it so the love story actually goes like this poor class man wins ticket for the in a game of poker i think its a game of poker and rushes to get on the boat that is about to leave so when he is on the a couple of nights goes by and he sees a higher class woman trying to attempt to commit suicide by standing threating to jump of the ship into the deadly ice water so after he intervenes and stops her from doing this they then get to know each other and fall in lovebut as this is just another higher class meets lower class love story the thing that got me was just the amount of innocent deaths that was caused some guy not spotting a bloody gigantic ice berg in front of him which then leads to ship sinking and drowning thousands of innocent peoplei personally loved this movie it is a real tear jerker you will be joining in with rose and telling jack not to let go at end of the movie it does tug on your heart but i do have to say this if your wanting a romantic disaster movie to complete your night then this is the film for you,sad
i am very lucky person bcz i watched this masterpiece i have no words to describe this moviestory mindblowingdirection  awesomescreenplay  the heart of the filmperformances  world class,sad
is world famous the film that broke every box office record on release and wore the box office champion crown for many yearsuntil it was overtaken by jim camerons avatar is special because not only does it showcase the disaster in all its glory the film is a technical achievement of the highest order the sinking sequence is astonishing and it feels like you are watching the actual ship sink the characters and actors are amazing and even with a large running length you never dare look at the watch james cameron is a master director and is his stamp of authority,sad
i dont need to go on about both the actual ship and the movie everyone has seen it by now and the reason is that it is a fantastically well made film it broke every box office record on release and wore the box office champion crown for many yearsuntil it was overtaken by jim camerons avatar  is special because not only does it showcase the disaster in all its glory but the film is a technical achievement of the highest order the sinking sequence is astonishing and it feels like you are watching the actual ship sink the characters and actors are amazing and even with a large running length you never dare look at the watch james cameron is a master director and is his stamp of authority,sad
if we have to figure out what the most precious identity humans have that must be memory we can absolutely remember lots of things happened during our 80year lives our memories construct the great history and is about an old womans memory about a huge famous boat and her lover she met during her endless trip to america the first time i watched this film was in my early age and some precious memory of my own happened during that time maybe this is the most important part of the movie to myself,sad
it has in my opinion not one of the but the best love story out there people saying this movie is overrated or overhyped are just too blind to see the beauty in it of course every movie has its flaws but as long as the good stuff overs shadows the bad then there is nothing to complain aboutthis movie is just great no wonder people are still talking about it even 20 years later95 stars,sad
its the first movie ive watched in cinema on the first seat it was amazingit seemed like the ship was going inside me ,sad
great emotional impact held by a sweepyouoffyourfeet epic romance and disaster movie you can not get any better than this what really made this movie matter was one thing it launched the alist acting careers of leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet dicaprio saw the roles potential when offered it and has had an impressive career since due to his stellar performance here winslet campaigned heavily for the role she got it and the same thing happened to her where her stellar performance brought about an impressive career give this one a try and see if you like it i hope you do also i hope you can get past the displays of artistic license taken with some of the historical facts hope you have fun watching any movie you choose to watch because thats what movies are for its the art of entertainment,sad

the only romance movie that doesnt feel contrived it brings you back to a time where you could love with careless abandon the freeing nature of the two characters and breaking from their social classes to be together is very romeo and juliet but the intense romance between them is something to be seen that love alongside the unusual combination of a disaster paints a strangely beautiful picture of love,sad
was a massive success upon release and still continues to be immensely popular it is easy to see why jim cameron is a master filmmaker and the set for the film the ship itself is so awe inspiring youd be fooled into thinking this was the real ship the film is incredibly well paced despite being quite long and the casting is top notch made stars out of kate winslet and leonardo di caprio and they are quite good here one can see why leo became a heartthrob after this film came out he is very good jim cameron has a passion for the ocean and he seems right at home directing its funny to think that box office record was eventually broken by his own avatar which is a testament to his talent as a storyteller and filmmaker,sad
the largest moving object of her time hit an iceberg and sank on her maiden voyage leaving untold stories behind when she was found on the ocean floor she was still facing west the china have never been used the sheets have never been slept in was called the ship of dreams it set sail on 10 april 1912 from southampton and sank on 14 april 1912 hitting an iceberg james cameron took an interest in this story because of his passion for shipwrecks he calls as mount everest of shipwrecks in the film treasure hunter brock lovett bill paxton shares the very same passion for a different reason he is searching for a priceless diamond called heart of the ocean in the wreck of during this search he discovers a drawing of a young woman wearing nothing but that diamond this woman turns out to be still alive at the age of 101 and has a different story to tell about the illfated shipback in its time was the most expensive film that has ever been made its budget was estimated 200 million it grossed worldwide 184 billion which made the first film to hit billiondollar mark we all know how the film is going to end and yet again we watch even more important james cameron convinces the production company to invest 200 million in a film which is about a ship that is going to sink and a sequel is not even possible one logical explanation to all this madness is he really believed in and his own talents as a director writer and producer of course i havent forgotten his highrated films like the terminator the terminator ii aliens and the abyss all those films were a great reference for but i believe with a possible failure his career would have ended forever he took the risk and it worked faith in made him the king of the world he is still one of the most successful directors of all time won 11 oscars out of 14 nominations making it the film with the most oscars won by a single filmjames cameron used latest cinema technology to make he even waited for years for this film to be possible but the story he is telling is a simple one it is a love story between two people from different social classes what makes this classic drama a special one is that it is happening in a ship which is going to sink and a lot of people will die including the boy he wanted his audience to really feel what it was really like to be on he took a turn from the story and showed us some powerful scenes to reflect that tragedy to its limits this is one of the strongest points of in 195 minutes audience feels every human emotion possible in the film james cameron uses the power of soundtracks intelligent conversations and nonverbal scenes to bring us where he wants us to bethe love between rose kate winslet and jack leonardo dicaprio happens within four days but echoes to the eternity this is why one of the taglines of the film is nothing on earth could come between them you can still see the love and passion in the eyes of old rose while telling her story after 84 years like it happened yesterday in this point of view the transmission of all the emotions through rose to the audience is another strong point of the film it makes people believe and show sympathy in her story this makes sinking the ship even harder but it must happen drama is the main genre of after drama it comes romance because there is a great love acting and chemistry between rose and jack these extraordinary performances helped become one of the greatest films of cinema history the success of the film opened the way to stardom both for kate winslet and leonardo dicapriowhile knitting his story inch by inch james cameron takes a moment to point out how rotten our society is with its gaps between social classes in the night of the accident 1503 recorded passengers lost their lives this number could have been much less if the lifeboats would have been filled up to its limits it is shown that some of the lifeboats sailed with little people because the comfort of firstclass people was still a priorityshowing real scenes from the and combining them with the film was brilliant i have also enjoyed the shooting of the iconic scene where jack holds rose from behind at the edge of the ship opening their hands we see them from different camera angles if you pay attention there are quite a few scenes that gave the audience goosebumps and this is only possible with a good cinematography so here is a special thanks to russell carpentercasting to the soundtracks is a work of passion it is one of the few films that combines a real story with a work of fiction in an artistic way films like this can be made but they cant be made perfect james cameron managed to make it perfect,sad
it is true that this movie was over rated when it first came out it made a billion dollars at the box office and it was on the imdb top 250 with a rating of 96 it was all the rave but the rating slowly started to sink no pun intended and it got low as a 69 the movie received extreme backlash the past few years the rating has been increasing has been going through what i like to call the rating roller coaster its ratings are constantly changing since everyone has so many different opinions on this movie i feel kinda bad for iti understand why so many people dont like this movie the love story really isnt anything new or different and the main character rose can be annoying at times and of course like many other people i am really annoyed about the whole jack could have survived thing like seriously they both could have fit on the giant floating door rose acted like she loved jack so much but she barely even tried to get him to fit on the door all she had to do was move over a little they wouldnt have even been in the situation if rose hadnt jumped back on the ship she should have stayed put in that lifeboat and waited for jack he would have had a better chance of surviving cause then he just has to worry about himself i feel like their love story may have been a bit exaggerated i mean its good that they wanted to be together forever but they had only known each other for like four days most people dont fall in love that easily or that fasti have only watched this movie when it comes on tv and i havent seen the whole thing because its so long its like 3 hours i love the last hour of the movie which is the boat sinking i love how its done and how its handled it fills me with suspense every time i watch it i dont really like anything else about this movie just the boat sinking and no not because people die its because its so suspenseful i think the way it was handled was really what it was like in 1912,sad
well its not avatar levels of disappointment but is far from camerons best work dont get me wrong theres a great disaster epic here but youve gotta work for it the actual iceberg doesnt appear until 100 minutes in a hundred thats a lot of forced love story to slog through before real dread starts to build and the less said about that song the betterthis isnt a bad movie and its technically proficient when the effects take center stage when its actually about white star lines monumental hubris and the destruction raining down or washing in the spectacle lives up to the directors name but the rest of it    510,sad
this is such a good movie oh my goodness i could watch it all day everyday the cast is amazing the storyline is amazing even though the romance part isnt completely true and overall i love learning about it  stories mvideos anything so this is great sad what happened in real life though,sad
is a movie ive seen countless times since i was a little kid and it came out this movie is one that seems to polarize people to extremes some love it and will call it one of the best movies theyve seen and others will hate it and label it one of the worst as far as where i stand on it today i still believe it is a very good film that benefits from marvelous special effects jack wins his way onto the in a poker game and runs into first class rich girl rose when she is hanging off the end of the ship apparently about to commit suicide jack saves her and they start spending a lot of time together which really pisses off roses rich but unpleasant fianc cal hockley the story is told by the 102 year old rose as treasure seeker brock lovett searches for a diamond that was given to rose by cal on the boat the movie has its share of problems the dialogue at times can be corny as can the actions the acting while serviceable most of the time has some terrible moments especially from billy zane and bill paxton also the film suffers slightly from its long run time its not something that bothers me a great deal but had the film been cut by something like 20 or 30 minutes it would have flowed a lot better isnt james camerons best film but it is a majestic and epic one i like leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet as jack and rose and i also really liked kathy bates as a first class passenger that has just come into her money this isnt one of the best films ever but its at times fun sad infuriating and joyful theres an emotional rollercoaster going on here,sad
is a true masterpiece and is easily one of the greatest films in history james cameron has outdone himself with this epic film that is clearly one for the ages it is perfect in almost every way and can be watched over and over again from the directing beautiful photography and an immortal song by celine dion not only is a masterful depiction of the sinking of the but a great love story romance is my lowest rated genre so it takes a really well made love story for me to like it and showcased this worthy of all its oscars and revenue this film has etched itself as one of the great triumphs of cinema it is loved universally and it is truly timeless,sad
james cameron does not do small films even his breakout film the terminator was hitting way above its budget this is down to cameron himself and his extreme work ethic to get the money right up there on the screen this film often gets poor reviews from people mainly due to its immense commercial success however this success is truly deserving there is no other film maker out there who can produce a film on this kind of scale and still pull it off i was lucky enough to see it at the cinema in 1997 straight off to even consider diving to the wreck itself to film it for the movie would be considered insane cameron did it 12 times the film was pitched as romeo and juliet on and cameron immediately got funded the film ran massively over budget and there was huge concern at the time that the whole project would implode however cameron knew he was onto something special creating a stunning replica of the itself along with exact decor and furniture props clothing even tableware cameron cast romeo himself from the 1996 film romeo and juliet leonardo di caprio this was a masterstroke as di caprio was gaining unrivalled stardom after the 1996 film kate winslet is fantastic as rose as a young actress to have that level of scale all resting on your performance to make it all come to life she pulled it off amazingly and often does not get the credit she deserves the real star of the show though is the ship itself and its master film director james cameron when the ship starts sinking and cameron moves into his action mode there is noone better in the world at pacing action them cameron he is a master of suspense at the exact right moments he is an exceptional story teller and fully deserved all the accolades he has acquired i highly recommend and encourage you to watch it on the largest screen possible films like this do not come along often the 3d blu ray is also exceptional and shows what can be done when a 2d film is converted in the right hands into 3d,sad
based on the tragedy that spawned thousands of heartbreaking true stories comes this fake one its time to decide was it insensitive and somewhat cheap of james cameron to throw two madeup passengers who fall in love onto the ship or did these two characters offer the audience an anchor to hold onto as we are guided through the dreadful events of april 15th 1912 without a doubt the latter the fictional story of jack and rose never distracts from the tragic true story it cinematically enhances it we never ever miss the bigger picturefirst of all just look at this film the resplendent wonder of the films set design both interior and exterior places you right on board it looks and feels the part and when the inevitable disaster strikes cameron grabs onto you and drags you through each painful moment in striking detail the sinking of the is brought to life with exquisite attention to detail and astonishing visual effects it makes for the greatest disaster scenes in any movie ive seenhowever a roland emmerich or michael bay film this is not as cameron never allows the spectacle to distract us from the agony of it watching the being destroyed is not fun or in its broadest sense exciting  its intensely distressing unlike most disaster films it never feels like were watching a crowd of extras on a film set flailing around the lead up to the iceberg strike engages you so convincingly in the period such that each person in front of the camera has been imbued with rich character and when the ship sinks it genuinely shocks you to see them go for a good part of the sinking jack and roses fictional plight is quite sensibly placed to one side giving us time to reflect on the truth and how it would have felt to be aboard the ship that horrifying nightso aside from its sweeping spectacle and moving depiction of reallife tragedy what does the story of jack and rose bring to the table in spite of how persuasive the film is one must remember  its ultimately a work of fiction not a documentary like any period drama it is an interpretation of how society worked at the time jack and rose as well as being beautifully played by dicaprio and winslet are incredibly well crafted they are a window into a much more subtle form of racism which is still prevalent today its called class and in the latter half of the movie it becomes a tool with which to decide who lives and who dieshas pretty much anything you can ask for its a romance its a disaster movie its an action film its got a sense of humour and wit its a period drama its a tragedy summed up is about as perfect a cinematic experience as youre ever likely to get,sad
there isnt much to say about this film other than incredible a true epic masterpiece i admit to seeing it five time in the theater an countless times since then once youve seen the film the first time its opening scene and music immediately drives you to tears and they dont really stop for the next 3 hours and 14 minutes as clichd as the story of jack and rose may be a name had to be given to the faces that we lost in this preventable tragedy and what a powerful love story it is to have loved so deeply and passionately in such short a time and have it stay with you forever is what everyone wishes for themselves a lot of flack is given to camerons script and while it could be have been better it certainly wasnt laughable winslet and dicaprio gave incredible performances with what they were given and this film will truly stand the test of time due to its powerful gritty nature it was almost better back in the day when it was split up into two tapes and i would never put the 2nd one in because it was too heartbreaking to sit through this film is truly a masterpiece ive seen it a dozen time and ugly cry every time,sad
the movie of came out in 1997 and then was an oscar award winning the director is james cameron and the actors is leonardo dicaprio as jack and kate winslet as rose this movie is love story the was a ship that sank in 1992 it reorganize show film when play my heart will go on song that will impress the movie and then the love feeling 3 hours long time and then my watching is very romantic every plots what is follow next plot for example rose was flying in ships beside that audiences were touched my heart by this shot and then the scenery of breaking dawn is beautiful and wonderful every girl want instead of rose that is romantic plot second the passengers confused around the ship after the titan crashed iceberg unless musicians played on wedding dance so quiet the shot was satirized by this gimmick pointdiscussing technology the used model ship which have shoot really effect the passengers fall down and slide on the floor after the was sinking in the ocean the technology is very amazing in 1997 that isnt easy play on video so the video is a big making that appreciate the director designing and then the plot had a nervous environmentthe movie is my favorite jack and rose is excellent and then bring me have a romantic feeling it was complete the end from embark to accident lets me watching event i feeling that your life must have once watching you will understand what the movie is successfulfinally no matter how watching again the movie couldnt boring,sad
a seventeenyearold aristocrat kate winslet expecting to be married to a rich claimant billy zane by her mother falls in love with a kind but poor artist leonardo dicaprio aboard the luxurious illfated rmsthe first thing that is really striking about this film is that it came from james cameron who is much better known for science fiction films like terminator avatar and aliens he is not the first person that comes to mind when you think of historical fiction romances and yet he nailed it despite its length of three hours was a huge success and may have sold more vhs copies than any other moviebut beyond the romance this is actually a rather decent movie i cannot say why it is something hard to put ones finger on most likely it has something to do with billy zane who is more or less the greatest thing about the film,sad
simply beautiful full of emotions and lovejames cameron created a masterpiece by taking the concept of and showing us the death of in his own way and by taking the right characters into placethe chemistry between the kate winslet and leonardo dicaprio is awesome james horner background music simply waoo and topped the charts at that time graphics was so good and the computerized technology used by him to create is nearly perfect he brings again into its lifeit never gets old by time you can watch it again and againnow i can really say that after building such a nice movie james can say that he is the king of the world,sad
this is truly one of my favorite movies of all time with a amazing cast of wonderful actors great dialogue and an unforgettable plot this movie ties with the abyss as the greatest james cameron movie i mean dont get me wrong avatar is a great movie with a good plot and unbelievably spectacular special effects and cgi but unlike i cant watch it over and over again like or the abyssthis is a movie of epic proportions and knowing quite a bit about the real quite historically accurate leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet have great chemistry and are perfect for their roles the rest of the cast including kathy bates billy zane jonathan hyde and victor garber make it almost perfect this is and amazing film about one of the most tragic accidents in history that has made its mark in film history and should be viewed by everyone 1010,sad
i watched this movie tonight in the bluray 3d version i thought it was a wonderful movie i have seen the original version at the theater and have watched it several times on tv i think it is one of the most heart wrenching movies i have ever seen i loved the music the actors and the storyline the 3d version is the best in my opinioni ordered the 3d version from amazon several weeks ago and waited impatiently for it in the mail when it arrived today i could hardly wait to watch it on my 3d tvi thought kate winslet leonard dicaprio and others did an amazing jobi looked at the era this was set in and thought about my own dad who would have been in his mid20s at that time and how a catastrophe like the sinking of a ship like the might have affected the people of that eragreat movie,sad
a film of such incredible proportions is a rarity in cinema was recently rereleased on bluray and i took the opportunity to watch the film for the first time in over a decade i was 8 years old when i last saw this film something which probably contributed to my opinion that the film was overlong soppy and incredibly dull how wrong i wasis epic cinema at its finest so many aspects of the film are truly wonderful the scale the performances and the design to name a few james cameron has repeatedly cemented himself as one of the most talented directors in hollywood managing to craft gargantuan products with colossal budgets and still maintain a wonderful human emotion to his works though the sinking of the in 1912 serves as the basis for this film the true meat of it is a love story between two young people from polar opposite ends of society jack dawson played by a boyish leonardo dicaprio a lower class drifter with a gift for art and rose a higher class young woman trapped in the confines of a loveless engagement portrayed by a freshfaced kate winslet over the course of 3 hours and 14 minutes their love story plays out among the hundreds of stories of that fateful voyage that tragically killed so manythe true wonder of is its sheer scale the film was originally released in 1997 yet the production dwarfs that of most large scale films of todays hollywood the costume design and set production is absolutely staggering truly worthy of the oscars the design and production won the special effects are also worth praising especially considering that the film is now 15 years old however with the transition to bluray and the clarity that the image receives because of the transfer some of the effects are unfortunately rather obvious though this does nothing to detract from the overall experience the sound design is also excellent particular praise reserved for the score there is an almost enyalike quality to the score gentle and mellow yet rousing in all the correct placesthe performances are all excellent dicaprio and winslet both carry the production on their young shoulders and do so with aplomb their chemistry is impressive and both actors are pleasant and likable billy zane as roses arrogant fianc is suitably horrid and despicable and zane gives probably the best performance of his career all roles are performed well including kathy bates as a newmoney socialite and bernard hill as the captain of the doomed voyage there are so many moments from this film that are frequently quoted and fondly remembered and theres a reason is an incredible experience and well worth picking up on bluray im certainly glad i did,sad
this film was alright and nothing more  granted the effects were fantastic but that doesnt mean a lot  the story was tired and not exactly original whats worse is that leonardo dicaprio used to be excellent whats eating gilbert grape but just phoned in his performance here,sad
i was one of the few who didnt see in the theaters i am not sure why i am a big fan of james cameron movies having enjoyed aliens the abyss and the terminator movies i really thought i would enjoy first of all i really admired the set design and the special effects those alone really made the movie for me i felt the acting was subpar compared to most cameron movies and the dialogue was very dull at times the sub plots didnt interest me at all also why was the movie given a pg13 rating one of the sub plots was about nude drawings and showing someone nude while they are being drawn couldnt they have come up with something more family oriented than a nude drawing recovered call me old fashioned but i cant understand why this movie made so much money and it contained nude scenes i wanted to see a movie that dealt with the events leading up to the wreck and didnt expect those scenes plus premarital sex i am not sure how much of the film was the truth and what was embellished i know it seems like i am hung up on this but it took me off guard to continue i felt that the sinking scenes were well done and it continues to show how much disaster realism that james cameron likes to include in his movies make your own mind up but i felt that could have been a little better than it was,sad
most all of the critiques on this fartooeasytoregisterto page have been eloquent and precise  some of them havent but thats not the pointjames cameron is a helluva writerdirectorproducer when it comes to action sequences  thats why the sinking scenes were so incredible sfxwise but the audience was not allowed to care all that much about any characters but jack and rosethe dialogue was cheesy but i expected that  thats how people talked back then  i didnt expect it to remain that way for the entire three hours though and i certainly didnt expect cameron to modernize jack and rose s speech while leaving everyone elses alone  but perhaps that was just from the cardboardcutout way dicaprio and winslet spoke their linesjames shame on you  there were at least a halfdozen real tearjerking romances you could have used as your main story but no  you had to go and insult all those people that died for nothing on and invent a romance of your own that was so totally fake a fiveyearold could have seen through itthen you added a few goofs of your own that will go down in history as the truth see the disney version of pocahontas to know what i mean  you insulted heroes men and women that gave their lives so that others might survive to tell the story just to get a few onscreen laughs  example we are dressed in our best and are prepared to go down like gentlemen  tell my wife in new york i did my best doing my duty is one of the sweetest lines ever uttered by ben guggenheim for all you nonhistoricalbuffs yet you cut out the last line and then dared to put stupid words in a dead mans mouth  but we will take a brandy chap which i should have done before walking into the theatrei know cameron is laughing all the way to the bank but still for the ridiculous budget this film received he could have looked over his script just once to remove all the obvious errors and blundersat the oscars cameron made such a fuss about how much he cared for the deaths on the  what a crock  if hed really cared about anything but the stinking oscar he would have 1  gotten decent actors for the parts of the two lovebirds instead of a couple of kids designed to draw preteen girls to the theatres in droves and 2  removed the sex scenes from the film as they had absolutely nothing to do with the tragedy and were put there for the sole purpose of making the people who fell asleep during the first hourandahalf wake upoh and someone get dicaprio a dialogue coach,sad
well what can i say about  it certainly does deserve some credit for its special effects action scenes and realism  but it spends too much time with leo and kate drooling over each other  i got bored even during the drawing scene i found myself saying oh just hit the damned iceberg an get it over with  if james cameron spent less time on the love story it might have been more enjoyable  but im not saying everyone will find the movie boring just the people who dont like romance and kissing will be bored to tears for the first hour and a half,sad
is a nearpersonification of a movie that is carried by one person without kate winslet the entire love story subplot of would have been awful  despite the cliched dialogue and plot and the poorlycast dicaprio she manages to make the relationship seem sweet sincere and legitimate  if the film would have had a good male lead would have been almost as tragic as saving private ryan but in a different less deep way  jacks death scene would have brought even me to tears  as it is i was sad not because of jack dying but because of winslets heartbreaking reaction  her brief but tragic words to the justdeceased jack were quite moving  too bad i couldnt have cared less about him  i personally find it amazing that i cared about the romance as much as i did  because leonardo dicaprio was miscast in his respective role  while i realize that i am risking the wrath of teenybops all over the nation i personally thought that he looked about five years younger than winslet this was especially evident in the dining room scene in which he looked like he was about fifteen  still however he did about as good as he could have  and if they had of offered me as much money as he was paid to do the role i wouldve certianly done it in a heartbeat so you cant really blame him  still though i cant help but feel a sense of frustration at the job that say matt damon couldve done with the partthe sinking scene was absolutely brilliant  easily the best portryal of it in film history  that should be a given though considering the ridiculous budgetif id have made i would have made three changes first and foremost get a different script  cameron is an excellent director but sadly the same can not be said for his writing talents  the dialoge was extraordinarily cheesy and cliched at times  if it wasnt for the strong performance by winslet the whole thing wouldve been laughable  second recast dicaprio  third take out the sexual stuff  the romance was actually fairly well done and it would have seemed far more pure and heart warming without the two sexually related scenesultimately is a good but tragically flawed film  i strongly recommend it but only if you take this suggestion when you watch it don t try to be a critic  i almost disliked the movie for the aformentioned reasons when i first saw it  the second time however i managed to let the flawed parts pass and just watched it not trying to critique every second of it  unlike the first time i was almost moved to tears at the end   12 out of ,sad
lackluster script and bad performances sink the in this  visually beautiful but stupid epic tank girl is still the best movie of all time,sad
the one thing that the contributed to our culture is the fact that the film managed to get a lot of giggly teenage girls to sit for three hours  no small feat  but after hearing so many people triumphantly declare that they sat through the twice four times ten times ect i began to get upset  there are a heck of a lot of better three hour movies they could have seen  the truth is is loaded with cliches and has problems with historical accuracy and did that old woman really deserve a best actress nomination  still to its credit the love story was fairly well done but if it wasnt set on the it wouldnt have been worth filming,sad
has all the elements of a smashing movie  unusually high level of detail comparable to star wars a respectful tribute to researchers and plenty of money  the cast is skilled the soundtrack beautiful and the cinematography masterful  now all we need is a plot after all because history betrays the ending the ships fate alone will not draw audiences  something needs to turn the beautiful documentary into a gripping movie  a love story does the job nicely it was a good idea but then cameron takes overgood lord what a nauseating soap opera  the farmboy hero spunky maiden and evil villain trio all but used up in star wars is disgustingly uncreative  some of the lines and he saved me in every way a woman could be saved are so cheesy even the masterful thespians dicaprio winslet and stuart cant save their characters from being reduced to cardboard cutouts what was cameron thinking  anyone sharp enough to appreciate the detail would vomit from the recycled storyline and anyone nave or stupid enough to fall for the fairytale romance wouldnt acknowledge the historical faithfulnessin any case everybody ought to see this movie at least once its not bad for a brainless love story and beautifully crafted  but if youre an educated movie connoisseur bring a barf bag,sad
in my quest to write up to 50 reviews here at imdb its time for the james cameron flickwell it was definitely not the best film ever made i think i liked it a lot when i first saw it in 97 note i only saw it once at the theater but now its coming on hbo like every few hours and when you catch the same parts playing over and over again you can tell how much you wish cameron wouldve taken a few more writing classes when he was youngerthe very best thing about was just that the ship the ship was the movie and watching it sink was the real masterpiece of filming most of dicaprio and winslets scenes together got tedious and was underwritten on some parts it seemed like they were 90s people sent back in time to learn the ways of the early 1900s and failed to do so which was exactly the casei think cameron is a great filmmaker and am glad the movie was a success so that he cam bring us other movies but he i had wished he learned to be a better director and find out to make great movies without a colossal budget but even if only costed 70100 and came out the same i still wouldnt have liked it any more or less overall it was a nice movie but couldve been a lot better,sad
i did enjoy this movie but with all the buildup that surrounded it i expected the mother of all blockbusters  it wasnt  it is an enjoyable view but not earth shattering like i was expected to believe bob,sad
sure was entertaining but im sick of hearing people say how its the best movie of all time lets face it the movie was three hours of cheesy dialogue and special effects that are commonplace nowadays this is by far the most disappointing film james cameron has ever made even though the movie kept me interested while i was in the theater its certainly nothing that will stick with me for a long time,sad
ok so i was dragged to this movie and gave it a fair shot  it didnt even deserve that  i wont even go into the acting much or the sappy melodramatic horrible plot but i will talk a lot about the much ballyhooed special effects  first most of the blue screen mattes are poorly done and halos aplenty show up in many scenes most notably when kate winslet is hanging off the back of the ship  second  the faraway overly matte shots of the ship sailing in no way fit the colorization of the film not to mention that the ship did not have any bow wave as it traveled through the ocean  they started half way down the ship  granted most movies effects are far from anything real but even low budget action movies look better than this  if you want effects go to ilm otherwise dont waste your time and write them out of the script  and now the acting  utter filth  the proepilouges acting was subbmovie quality along with the rest of the film  the only ok acting in the entire movie was accomplished by billy zane and bill paxton  who are pretty much bmovie actors anyway so their performance was their status quo,sad
i went to see this film because i wanted to see what 200 million worth of special effects looked like  unfortunately by the time the special effects kicked in i had passed the point of boredom and was extremely angry that i had wasted 8 and three hours of my lifei did not believe the relationship between dicaprio and winslet and had a hard time buying either of their characters  the horror began in full when billy zane began taking pot shots at the loving couple with what appeared to be something out of a dirty harry film  the 45 minutes that followed were the comprised and most excruciating filmgoing experience i have hadin short though the special effects did become awesome to look at about two hours in the characters were plastic the story unbelievable and the film a travesty  if james cameron is king of the world i want off,sad
everyone seems to be gushing on about how its the best movie ever made and so on but i think though it was good it was definitely not the best movie of all time there were some good points and some bad points but what i thought was boring was the usual plotline guy and gal fall in love ones rich the others poor and the family doesnt approve the best thing i liked about this movie was the actual sinking the first question i asked when i watched it was when is the ship going to sink leo dicaprio didnt act to the highest of his ability i thought he was better in romeo and juliet and kate winslet was just marginally better cameron definitely is a great director and the photography and special effects were superb though i think spending 600 million to build your own mini version of the ship was a bit expensive i loved the music for the movie and i thought the soundtrack was  one of the best things worth buying,sad
probably the most overrated film of the last few years is not the great epic that every teenage girl has made it out to be  in many ways it is like gone with the wind  beautiful to look at with some fine acting mostly by winslet but with a horribly contrived trite plot and horrendous dialogue  the characters are paper thin and are ridiculous what a waste of 200 million dollars,sad
i attended this movie prepared to see a another blockbuster ripoff there have been many disappointing run of the mill stuff each like the other in content and movement from the start this movie was different what impressed me the most was the accurate detail involved in both the sets and the telling of the story its central story about two lovers destined to be torn apart by events taking place around them is never boring more important is the telling of the ships disaster itselfwith breathtaking special effects the movie viewer is brought onto the ship and made to feel a part of the ongoing action mr cameron has given us a closer look than we have ever had or probably ever will have at what happened that fateful night of its sinking to coin a term from another well made movie on the subject it is truly  night to rememberthanks to james cameron caring and skill and excellent performances all around this is a picture to be proud of and a tribute to an event that should never be forgotten in the annals of history,sad
wow i finally get this you finally understand some of the emotions and dialogs yeah duh their soo obvious they bored me to death thankful i just got reincarnatedi can understand that some people especially those who dont watch that many movies that they like a movie like this a lot of people like soaps and cheap supermarket novels as well any why  because you know what it means what it means for you you get a grip on it and that feels safe comforting but it really has no point watching such a movie or reading such a book other than just to comfort your mind as if you were listening to silence the only thing on earth that comes close as to how predictable and the above named junk is but if you want to use your mind opinions personality and perception try reading real literature and watch real movies like foxfire uturn nowhere the crow strange days all surrealism i think  or  more serieus movies good will hunting 12 angry men  or  more adventurous andor funny movies pulp fiction freeway from dusk till down clerks ,sad
this movie has absoulutly nothing to do with the real its one of the worst movies ive ever seen and it made me cry thinking that i would never get my three hours back i feel bad for wasting my time on this complete bore of a film it has too much romantic involvementand the acting is awful compared to the loin king which was one of the best films i have had the pleasure of viewing it would have kicked its sappy butt everyone likes that stupid love story but what about those people who are sick of hearing everyone yell im king of the world when really youre just an idiot who got overpaid to die at the end while soandso and whatshisface are running around making out with each other and drawing pictures in the nude we wait and wait for a disaster to happen and finish off these two pathedic excuses for characters then celine dion breaks through with the worst song ever which makes you want to gouge your own eyes out and eat them i danced around my living room after seeing whatshisface drown which is the highlight of the entire crapfest in reality this movie is for losers who have crap love lives who wish they could get on a ship and meet some guy who looks like leonardo dicaprio and enjoy bubble baths with harliquin romance novels if this movie was made today it would bomb loin king again the best movie ever i say this after watching them bothone after another wouldve won the oscar and this would be what it is a billion dollar waste the members of the academy must all be single mothers who are on prozac and thirteenyear old girls for this to win all i can say is america is a bunch of morons this is the worst movie ever do not watch it do not waste your time and be like these people who love this movie prepubescent idiots james cameron ripped me off only because i liked jerry mcguire you ripped me off james im coming for your hide twenty burnt popcorns out of ten good onesnotes ill never let go jack opsie daisy i let goi like that part where rose is trying to kill herself i wish jack wouldve minded his own businessthe sex scene sucksin reality the upper class and the poverty stricken youth would not have ever met much less have a love storyaw she changed her name at the end thats the best you can do i remember being seven and hating thisany movie that has two video cassettes will suck example braveheart the academy was smoking a lot of crack so was the rest of america,sad
what the hell is this after camerons classic films like aliens and t2 how did cameron make this ok to start off this movie was long 2 hours too long if they hadnt had the whole love story plot this movie wouldnt suck the actionadventure of this movie is actually quite fun but the whole rich girl meets poor boy love was thrown in there to attract some audience whoops they attracted a bunch of teen girls who have nothing better to do then watch the same movie 40 times a week the acting in this is just terrible the talkative old lady was just annoying and stupid if youve seen the movie you know what im talking about so the movie should really have been built around the actionadventure which i think it was originally supposed to be which brings me to my next point how did this movie win best picture well there are 2 reasons for that 1 it came out in december and the movie critics who chose the movies are all too old to remember movies from the summer despite la confidential2 obviously because the movie made the most money ever in the box office to any guy who wants to impress his woman friend dont rent this movie because your lady will dig leo not you please avoid this movie if you havent seen it and if your going to ignore that anyway then i hope you have a fun time because this deserved the golden globe for best comedymusical,sad
ill be brief it aint that good the characters are lame the script is awful the situations are not entirely correct the fx aint that cool i found godzilla more amusing at least you knew it was bad since the beginning so if you get a chance to see a night to remember go and do so dont waste your time with leo dicucu,sad
i saw this movie twice and i truly loved it  however the overhype made me dislike it  the money does not even come close to indicating quality  i never cried  it was way too predicable  the fx was what made me go again  the fact is the movie isnt that powerful  james horners score sound like rejects from bravheart which by the way is a much better movie at capturing romance and action  you want quality watch a much better actor in mel gibson than flybynight dicaprio,sad
i dont see why people are saw this film over and over and overagain  it added nothing new to the disaster genre its just an overblown poseidon adventure it is nowhere near as romantic as other epics like casablanca  gone with the wind or drzhivago  to me this was just another overhyped romance like the english patient  and can someone tell me whats so romantic about a woman dumping her fiance for some flybynight hustler who can dance  maybe its my artifical heart talking but thats not romantic,sad
one word to describe how i feel about this movie aaaaaauuuuuugggghhhhh  i apologize for being so verboselets not confuse the difference between good movies and entertaining movies  ill admit that when i went to see this movie for that last hour when ship sank i was entertained  im also entertained by that paddle with the ball on a rubber band but that doesnt mean i think its worth over a billion dollars or eleven pointless toy awards  in addition i wouldnt play with it for three hours or even go back and play with it again four or five times  isnt a good movie  as far as the academy awards is concerned im sure there are many many little people who deserved recognition for working hard on this film and they no doubt received that recognition  i dont have a problem with that  as for that arrogant pig of a man james cameron there were at least two other directors far more deserving of an oscar  in fact there were at least two other movies deserving of best picture  heres a little suggestion for september when is released on video  save your money  the ship still sinks and i know that my heart will go on aching because were rewarding a mediocre film for being exceptionally mediocre  use your money to see some of the good movies you missed when you went back to for the fifth time,sad
whyd i watch this movie i coulda been watching something else something i wouldve enjoyed leo made me wanna dig my eyes out the injustice of kates academy award nomination made me want to scream i was so happy when helen won over kate and the fact that they would cheapen such a tragedy with this love line well ill just leave it at that highly overrated for cheap acting minus kathy bates and one weaslelooking ratboy wuss in the lead what was i thinking,sad
i mustve been drunk the acting is wooden the character development almost nonexistent and the music irritatingi hate celine dion the fx are great but who cares of the cast leo has one good moment at the end but it drags on kate looks terrible in her costumes but its nice to see shes not a twig pity she cant act billy zane has seldom shown restraint and this film is no exception oscar winner kathy bates however is solid as an icebergerrock as the unsinkable molly brown but she cant save it jim cameron has been responsible for many screen classics but this isnt one of em the dialogue is extremely funny to give you an indication of how much i luuurrvved this film the federal election was on at the same time and i decided to watch a bit of thatwould i have enjoyed it more on the big screendialogue and characterisation is no different at the cinemas the worst academy award nominated film of the year but thats not saying much,sad
what a load of hype about nothing very much the people who made this movie were so engrossed in special effects and massive budgets that they neglected to notice the cliched story line and consequently missed the opportunity to highlight the real tragedy of the event  that a few minor differences in circumstance would have altered the result of that fateful night entirely what a waste,sad
is definitely by far the most overrated motion picture of all time filled with two idiotic and selfish lead characters that overlooks to true tragedy of the sinking of the great ocean linerwhile the sinking of the is somewhat impressive its filled with james cameron and his usual bad screenwriting cameron has often said he hates screenwriting and his awful scripts for true lies and avatar all prove it his dialogue is atrocious i mean if i hear im the king of the world again i want to vomit and using his same line at the oscars is a new low for how selfish cameron is with his inflated egojack and rose are two of the most annoying characters to ever be seen on the big screen when the boat finally sinks after watching over two hours of endless boredom the film finally has a pulse but suffering with the two lead characters and their immaturity and selfishness really brings the film down to mediocre even awful levelsjames cameron is a hack he has no original ideas he steals ideas from others such as terminator was really based on an episode of the outer limits aliens was a sequel to a far superior original film true lies was originally a french action spy comedy was really romeo and juliet aboard the doomed ocean liner and avatar was nothing more than a science fiction version of dances with wolves mixed with the 1992 animated feature ferngullyall in all cameron is an egotistical maniac who often clashes with his actors and crews and makes mediocre films at best and that is a solid fact,sad
a talentless fedup storyline and overpretentious movie because of a space budget it does not earn his awards except for effects for another it will not be awarded whit a prizethe ugliest thing is that they cut out the great oscars movies because of that vomit,sad
to begin with i liked james cameron as a director as a matter of fact aliens is my alltime favorite movie throughout the 80s and mid 90s james cameron could do no wrong then it happened christmas 1997 james cameron released the most overrated overhyped piece of garbage that the world has ever known i dont buy for a second that cameron cared about the real tragedy the victims or the heroes i firmly believe that camerons sole intention for making this movie was to fatten his wallet critics praised it as a masterpiece teen and preteen girls swooned and before you knew it this rancid vomit inducing cinematic travesty became the highest grossing movie of all time before i begin let me just clarify one thing i dont hate this movie because it was a hit i hate this movie for much more than that so the film begins with treasure hunters exploring the wreck of the theyre searching for something but we dont know what that exactly is yet they find an old safe and decide to bring it up to the surface they cheer pop champagne bottles and celebrate that theyve found what theyve been looking for however once the safe is opened they only find an old drawing of a woman wearing a diamond necklace some time later a local news station does a story on the treasure hunters expedition an old woman watching the news story recognizes the drawing contacts the leader of the expedition and they bring her to where they are we find out that they are searching for that lost diamond necklace and that she is the woman in the drawing so the film then goes into her story and to sum it all up we get the same old clichridden love story weve all seen before two people from two different worlds fall in love and everything is working against their union some of you out there might be thinking that i hate this movie because im a guy and generally guys hate love stories but thats not the case i liked the movie moulin rouge and i loved the movie the notebook the difference between those movies and this movie is they actually did something new with that basic plot unlike in which the only thing new is that that it happens on the in the story we meet characters that have the names of real people these people include captain ej smith designer thomas andrews builder bruce ismay crewman william murdoch and passengers john jacob astor and the unsinkable molly brown do we learn anything about these people or what happened to them no these characters are nothing more than plot devices this is the reason why i hate this movie it is an insult to these peoples family and memory to portray them this way specifically william murdochs and molly browns in reality these people were heroes in this film however molly brown is used as a comic relief and william murdoch is made into a villain james cameron how dare you in 2001 the movie pearl harbor was released and everyone hated it people have said that the movie was poorly written the plot was horribly clich and that it makes a cheap mockery of a real life tragedy what people fail to realize is this is exactly what was why is pearl harbor labeled as cinematic tripe and garbage while a few years earlier did the exact same thing and its labeled a masterpiece if youre going to hold michael bays feet to the fire for pearl harbor you might as well do the same to james cameron i know a lot of people still love this movie and thats fine to each their own in my opinion however there will never be enough hatred for this film even if everyone in the world turned around and suddenly hated it it still wouldnt be enough,sad
to this day i have been unable to figure out why people like this movie so much it infuriates me how people are seduced by bigbudget special effects and cheesy romance and how they cant see past the eye candy to see that this movie had almost no true substance james camerons good movies are the terminator terminator 2 aliens and the abyss is not included in the listthe one good thing i will say about the movie is the special effects the big turning machinery in the bottom of the ship and the ship sinking and people falling all over the place was fun to watch but got old very fast basically the special effects were the only thing that made the movie another positive thing that i have to say about the movie is that leonardo dicaprio was the only character in the movie that i likednow on to the negatives of this movie and bear with me because there are a lot of themi will start with the romance the romance aspect of the movie is probably what most people like about this movie but believe me when i say it is one of the corniest shallowest love stories i have ever suffered through although it is not nearly as bad as twilight jack or leonardo dicaprio is completely infatuated with rose or kate winslet i mean i can tell that she is pretty but come on dude you couldnt have picked a more selfish emotionally imbalanced girlwhich brings me to the thing i probably will rave about the most kate winslets character rose i hated her absolutely positively hated her she is a selfish spoiled little brat who in the beginning of the movie decides to jump off the ship to kill herself simply because things are not going her way as soon as she is out on the ledge outside the railing of the ship where she cant get back by herself especially since she was smart enough to wear highheels she decides that she is too scared to go through with it and has to have jack save her sorry butt so after a while the movie drags on and finally jack declares his love for her and all she does in response is that she tells him that she has to go now are you kidding me if an amazingly cute boy declared his love for me id at least thank him for his compliments a lot later rose finally decides to fall in love with him too alright okay but what about her fruitcake of a fiance who looked like he was wearing eyeliner well something else happens that infuriated me the fiance tries to make it look like jack stole a diamond this is at the point where rose pretty much loves jack and trusts him with her life so why didnt she defend him when the fiance says he stole the diamond and jack asserts that he didnt do it and brings up the fact that rose knew him well enough to know that he didnt steal it i dont know she is an allaround moronic little skank also i got irritated when she asks jack to draw her naked theyve known each other for two days and she is already offering herself to him what is wrong with her she was only seventeen ugh the movie drags on and on and i get more and more annoyed until the end spolier when jack dies end of spoiler it was horrifyingly disappointing to see the only good character in the movie die and the most infuriating character live to tell the stupid tale all in all i would have given the movie two more stars if rose had died preferably by falling off the ship and into the propellerall the other characters except for jack i hated though not as much as i hated rose her mother was a straightup bword her fiance was a total fruitcake and a mean fruitcake at that every other background character was flat and unmemorable the acting was so cheap and i really couldnt feel any sympathy for any of the characters even when they drowned and froze to death which is indeed terrible but i dont care when i dont like the characters or the movie in general i always wish for the movie to end with all of them dyingbesides being an overblown hollywood special effects showcase some smaller details of the movie seemed a little farfetched first of all the elderly woman in the beginning was there at the when she was 17 that was in 1912 it is now 1997 in the movie that would make her 102 years old one hundred and two and still living on her own and taking care of herself is that even possible also how did the drawing of her naked survive all those years underwater one last thing the treasure hunters in the beginning of this threehour movie ask the old lady where the diamond is and she tells this long stupid story only to pull out the necklace from her drawer at the end of the movie why didnt the stupid hag give it to them in the very beginning what was the point of that threehour cheesy infuriating boring stupid storywhen i heard this movie was being rereleased in 3d i felt the rage at this movie coming up again i dont care if im the only one who absolutely loathed this movie all i know is that i know what a good movie is and is not a good movie,sad
okits the best movie in the world to someto othersits just a cheesy movie with a teen hearthrob in itbuthey its been one of the mostin the factthe mostsuccessful movie at the box office of all time and you cant really blame it wellleo dicaprio was at the height of his careerand the yummiest by far ive seen himdroolso that attracted a lot of attention from teenage girlsthe romance and passion that is in this film is great the effects are good as welland the cast all peformed excellently james camerons script wasoka little weak in placesbut it held the audiences for 3 hoursjames cameron created a film nobody in the history of moviemaking had ever attemptedand he did a pretty good jobthe ending was particularly movingand will always remain a hollywood blockbusternow and foreverxxxby alix,sad
oh my god this movie is awful i hate this movie one of the worst movies what the world has ever produced and of course the worst soundtrack ever my heart will go on celine dion big crap it must be a epic but its a piece of craptitanicthe ship of dreams i say the ship of crapi dont i hate people who dead in 1912but is crapits silly and overratedi dont understand why this crap won 11 oscars whyits so boring moviei didnt even liked the acting it was too hammyjames cameron is not bad directorbut this is black piece to his moviesso i dont recommend it to anyonewatch something elsemaybe a lot of people love this movie but i hate this movie 1510,sad
so you either love it or you hate it i personally fall in to the hate camp however i do feel that may be hate is perhaps too a strong a word to be using it really should be reserved for the likes of michael schumacher and roy keanethe down fall of is it success really because if it hadnt been so big no one would really care about it and more importantly those of us who didnt like it wouldnt feel so angry and aggrieved that it made soooo much money if you ignore all the hype and just look at the film a clearer picture emerges as a piece of history telling it is not all that great it is much too involved in its lead characters for that and if you want to know more about the event of the sinking youd be far better off watching a night to remember what really is is a romantic drama on this front it is not too bad slightly too sugary for me and i expect most serious cinema goers but for those who just want to be charmed and loved up it is fine leo and winslet do a reasonable job and the story is reasonable believable and interestingso why you may well ask have i given it a rating of 2 the answer to this is simple i love films and i like to think although i have certain tastes and favourites i do appreciated a good film when i see it is mediocre to reasonable at best but when it was released it seemed to manage to brainwash the nation and in fact whole world into thinking it was the best thing since sliced bread i had friends arguing its greatness at me and at the time and still now all i could do was feel sorry for them for having such a bad understanding and knowledge of films to think was at the top of the treeon top of this i really felt aggrieved at the amount of money it had commanded in cost and sales money which may well have made handfuls of marvellous smaller films but much more importantly could have gone someway to solving the problems within this world instead of lining the studies pockets and so help me god if i ever have to hear that awful song again,sad
typical battleoftheclasses pseudoromance drivel an amateurish script that trivializes the deaths of hundreds of what becomeimpersonal nobodies to focus instead on the dramatics and pitfalls of young loveits like a bad soap opera im rich and youre poorsociety will never approveblahblahblahyawn daytime tv anyonethe attraction isnt believable the chemistry is less than zero the nude scene is gratuitously cheesy but the foggedup windows are clich beyond beliefcharacters are barely twodimensional shes rich and personalityfree not wanting to marry billy zane  that pretty much sums up her whole persona jack hes poor but an artist plotwise this gives a perfect excuse to throw in a nude scene you know for artistic reasonsspecial effects yeah enoughs enough though do you need to see cabins flooding for 20 minutes not really a more imaginative director wouldnt bombard you with such literal tediousnessthis movie fails on every possible level,sad
1997 appears to be one of those movies that you can either love or hate  personally im in the latter crowd  but i have my reasonstheres no doubt that james cameron spared no expense with sets models and the like  unfortunately it was ruined by the two stars winslet and dicaprio and their forbidden romance  first of all its just plain not realistic  my family worked on white star liners and later cunard for years on both sides of 1912 and the romance just plain wouldnt have happened  nor would it have been allowed to continue  and they certainly wouldnt have allowed dicaprio to get on the shipwhether you like the romance the emotion the love whatever this is basically another example of hollywood exploiting a tragedy to make a glitzy sugary appealstothemasses movie out of it   this could have been an excellent remake of a night to remember 1958 not that it needed remaking what with all the great sets and special effects but instead the failed  its just like what they did with pearl harbor 2001 which was poor version of tora tora tora 1970  i think hollywood has learned their lesson by now  but if you want cheesy not terribly believeable romance set against the backdrop of some of our centurys worst tragedies go see 1997 and pearl harbor 2001  if you want to see wellexecuted movies about these tragic events see night to remember a 1958 and tora tora tora 1970,sad
wow  soars effortlessly through 3 hours and 15 minutes and yet you are not exhausted or tired at all  in fact you may be wanting more by the end  james cameron reached new heights with this film and will always be remembered as the man who directed  from top to bottom the film is almost perfect  its special effects and minute details make it a real treasure to behold  one feels as if they are really on that doomed liner  the characters are excellent as well  kate winslet and gloria stuart delivered oscarnominated performances  overlooked but equally potent was billy zane in a wellcalibrated role  however leonardo dicaprio is just there it seems  his character has mindless dialogue that does become tiring at times  despite that small problem it is not enough to keep from easily being one of the best films of the 1990s  5 stars out of 5,sad
yes its the best movie of 1997 great special effects great actor direction great actors great great when a movie combine comedy action romance and spectacular effects its a blockbuster,sad
how on earth did james cameron sign on to make this fortunately at least 13 of the film is spent on a notsobad sinking scenebut still thats no excuse for a twisted overrated love affair that desperately wants to be gone with the wind or spartacus but falls victim to its plain stupidity no one talks about this movie nowadays or even whimpers at the soundtrack anymore which really ticks me off because these are the same people who saw this film 178 times hollywood should stick with budgetbusting action films like die hard that have stayed popular for nearly two decades,sad
i have watched this movie hundreds of times and i have never gotten tired of it if you call it overrated tripe sappy then obviously you are watching something twilight related maybe it isnt 100 accurate but at lest it doesnt insult any body who died on that horrible night my vote 10,sad
this film is so full of absurdities and clichs that it is to all the previous films what airplane is to the airport saga and blazing saddles is to the western genre the unhappy high society girl goes down to thirdclass deck although it is out of bounds for her she wants to jump overboard but she is stopped by a happygolucky nobody with no future and with nothing to his name but the clothes he is wearing on as a reward he is invited by hockley to dine fistclass with the jetset so they can make fun of his lack of education and manners but he gets along without making too much of a fool of himself and charms everyone around the table but stiff hockley and roses toff horrid mother but bored to death from so many starched collars small talk and no being able to scratch his bumbelch or pick his nose jack eventually sneaks away with rose to a merry party down in thirdclass where one can swear spit get plastered on cheap beer belch fart and throw up until they fall flat on their faces the next day a selfconfident and jolly jack enters the outofbounds territory of first class again looking for rose greets mr andrews like and old mate and trots along without being bothered at all although he sticks out like a sore thumb no one seems to notice him feel yourself at home laddie just dont take a leak in the flower vases thats all he is only stopped when he tries to disrupt a solemn religious service that is the only one thing that cannot be tolerated by any means randy rose asks jack to draw her naked and he does so while maintaining his coolness and concentrating seriously on his work as she lies there displaying all her jewels but instead of banging her in the luxurious comfort of her private chamber they go down to the hull meanwhile hockley the wally finally realises that his girl is bending over for that miserable thirdclass gutter rat and boy that drives him bananas then the ship bumps into an iceberg because the two idiotic sailors on watch duty are far more interested on the antics of the two horny kids rather than on doing the job they are being paid for in the first place here we go then the unsinkable commences to sink and the movie finally takes off after 90 minutes of utter boredom mr andrews rushes to the officers room to deliver his diagnosis and now there comes the most hilarious scene in the film as andrews states that the ship is already dead company president ismail almost has an apoplexy you see his face with his eyes almost popping out his choking cry of but that is impossible this ship cannot sink he is babbling in disbelief his blood pressure rocketing up to the verge of a coronary spit flying out of his mouth and andrews turns to him you can almost see his eyes rolling i built her sir shes made of iron it can sink and i assure you it will and that shuts ismail up for good so now theyve got just two hours to get out of there firstclass people go first of course since they are the ones who paid more for being here in the first place secondclass will go after if still there is time as to thirdclass well we just learn now that the lifeboats have a full capacity for only half of the people on board 700 of which are thirdclass rubble well officers you know the procedures women and children first and no paupers jumping the queue or youll be fired and then if there is still time and a few empty places left well just chuck a few ragamuffins into the boats and then save yourselves and good luck a thirdclass ticket for the did cost the equivalent to 1500 euros in todays money and a firstclass cost 115000 so you were treated accordingly to what you paid for as simple as that although time is running out hockley keeps his hair on confident that he will buy his way out with a thick wad of notes in the last minute but meanwhile he is about to play his last villainy accusing poor old jack of stealing the mother of all diamonds and to do that he relies on the faithful assistance of his devoted butler nasty lovejoy frames jack and has him handcuffed deep below so that he will drown quicker but stubborn rose in an almost superhuman feat that will have feminist radicals raving sets him free they get back to deck and try to board a boat the outraged hockley now on the verge of an apoplexychases them with a gun in a comical sequence that culminates with another ridiculous line i put the diamond in the coat and i put the coat on her the ship finally sinks into history but the pair of randy doves manage to stay afloat now the water is freezing and no one can survive in it for more than half an hour at the most yet jack seems to last for hours long after everyone else floating around have succumbed to hypothermia but eventually he dies too because the story was meant to be a tearjerker in the first place miraculously enough rose despite wearing her soaking clothes on all night survives without even getting a cough ,sad
over the years it seems that people love to hate despite its 11 oscars and the fact that it is one of the largest ever box office successesi think 5th adjusting for inflation over the years its almost as if its cool to hate that the love story and the characters are clich and soppy and the story is completely unrealistic that only romantic loveobsessed girls would watch it and cry about how theyll never get a man as gorgeous as leonardio dicaprio the draw me like one of your french girls is probably one of the most made fun of scenes in a movie that ive ever heard these people fail to realize that is a movie its not supposed to be realistic  it shows a blown up exaggerated version of reality to capture our imagination and our hearts and it succeeds impressively leonardo dicaprio is good but not his best watch the departed or wolf of wall street for leos acting abilities kate winslet was probably slightly better but the magic about is the story and the directing from the beginning the characters captivate you they are not superficial  in contrary they have flaws and advantages just like everyone else the movie is long but the pace is not slow every scene is necessary and cameron does a great job in making us want this couple to make it i dont need to mention that the music is exceptional complimenting the atmosphere perfectly the effects are good and very realistic it shows that cameron actually visited the before filming most of all it is apparent that this movie is an epic i definitely consider it as one of the best love stories of recent time it is a little clich and a little soppy but i promise you wont regret watching it so ignore the haters and go and enjoy it for what it is a romantic drama with amazing characters music directing and background even if you hate it at least youll be able to laugh about it with your friends,sad
this movie touches the hearts of many many americans to this day not only will it stand the test of time but it will remain in the hearts of many people throughout the worldthis movie is so touching and moving that it makes you want to start balling right in front of everyone not only that but it takes you on a thrill ride which will be unforgettable the acting in this film is absolutely superb and could not have been any better the casting was selected so perfectly and carefully that it could not have gone wrong and of course the director james cameron is without a doubt one of the most amazing directors ive ever seen he manages to make you cry but at the same time is able to keep your heart racing not many directors can pull this offanother factor in this film which makes it so outstanding is the music the music is very diverse in different parts of the movie james horner did an amazing job with the overall score it can be either very suspenseful or very soft and enlightening and i dont know about you but when celine dion starts singing there is no way that you can keep tears from staying in your eyesokay sure this film can make you cry we know this but this is one of the only love stories to date to absolutely horrify people some of the scenes where the ship is sinking are horrendous the visual effects are exceptional for a 1990s film they really do look real and create effects which are shocking to watchmany people disagree that this is a remarkable movie just because it is not completely factual well guess what get over it it was not made to be 100 accurate alright it was meant to show the deep passion between two lovers and there willingness to save each others lives for all you haters out there we all know that you force your horrible opinions about a movie just so that you feel special i mean who are you trying to kid i know you know and america knows that this is one of the most mesmerizing and astonishing films ever made this is an honorable movie and deserved each and every award that it goti cannot tell you how much a cherish this film and all of its glory it is an absolute necessity for any movie collection and is a landmark and role model for any good film to come not very many films will ever top it if this film does not get your heart racing then you dont have one at all and if this film does not move you as much as it moved me then you dont know what a good movie is it will go down in history as one of those epic movies one that will never be forgotten and all the haters dont worry youll come to your senses one day overall a complete 10 out of 10 an incomparable masterpiece of epic proportions,sad
i watched this movie under the influence that it would be good i dont get it is this supposed to be entertaining the plot was totally pointless heres what happens some kid goes to a boat and finds this dog and then his stepfather says he cant keep it then there is a bear and its after the stepfather but the dog comes to save him then it gets rabies and the boy freezes to death how did that happen i though this was about a boat there was only one in the beginning my friend later explained to me that i fell asleep and had a dream that was more interesting than this movie that sort of explains why instead of credits i just got shoved by the usher and told to leave the theatre oh well it was a long time ago,sad
i have to say when it comes to romantic flicks people seem to go to extremes and i admit ive done it too giving a ten it seems you either love it with a vengeance and woe betide anyone who doesnt agree or you hate it so passionately you would happily murder the poor actors and actresses simply for appearing in itthis is ridiculous while i do enjoy the film i have no problems with people who didnt and if they dislike the romance then thats their opinion which theyre entitled to seriously why turn it into something personally speaking this is still one of my favourite films and i saw it years after it came out as always so the success had ebbed away but unlike so many i didnt go with expectations all those people who went for a documentary on the disaster or endless shots of old leo i saw it without expecting anything i didnt give a monkeys about dicaprio i knew next to nothing about the actual disaster and i was simply hoping it deserved its recordbreaking 11 academy awards and i thought it did franklythe acting was topnotch the music was wonderful the visuals were stunning while the romance was indeed stereotypical and contrived and i gave this a ten it was still pulled off excellently and i really did feel for the character which is a mark of a good film i dont think that the ending spoilt the film which many people think it did i am not saying that they are wrong or that i am right because thats not true its about opinions i just thought it was a nice touch  a sort of backhanded happy ending to round off an otherwise rather depressing nowtheyllneverseeeachotheragain scenario i thought the film had many many memorable moments and the disaster itself was not downplayed  it fitted smoothly around the romance which incidentally helped to give a sense of perspective to the whole thing many couples really will have been torn apart that night albeit probably not from different classes the sheer drama unfolding onscreen cannot really be questioned it can be disliked of course but it is good acting nevertheless,sad
i must say im surprised at the low imdb rating of 73 and that there are a lot of negative reviews on this website but compared with millions loving this and winner of 11 academy awards those voices of discontent against this film are left in the shade arguably for me james camerons greatest film is a true epic of colossal scale the acting is brilliant particularly with leonardo decaprio and kate winslet as jack and rose they light up the screen as the two lovers separated by social class but not love there romance is so beautifully depicted that you cant help but smile the romantic story set aside the sinking is flawlessly intertwinedthough the film is in two parts the romance and the sinking the first hour and a half gives you the chance to come to know these two characters and others like nasty cal hockley billy zane and lovejoy david warner who play there parts excellently well with great support from kathy bates who plays the lively molly brown there are some beautiful and forever memorable scenes between jack and rose when jack first sees her the third class party when they kiss on the bow of the ship jack painting her naked when they make love in the car and when they are both in the water after the ship has sunk and jack dies all these scenes and others are amazing the music score by james horner is hauntingly beautiful and sombre and made me cry when you see the full sinking in all its horrorand you do james cameron depicts everything showing not just the sinking from jack and roses perspective but different people in different parts of the ship as they scream desperately for help so you end up caring not just for the main characters but all the small cameo roles played by hundreds of people morality questions are raised about how things were handled by white star liner these are haunting images that burn in your mind and stay with you long after the most haunting scene is when loads of passengers are in the water and when most of them had died the cameras focusing on one of the lifeboats coming back is the ethereal feel of a mythic force cameron creates suspense and tension at whether the two lovers will survive and you just deeply care about them the costumes and ship itself look simply magnificent and are a wonder to look at the end scene as well where the old rose dies in her sleep and has the happy memory of marrying jack on and when he dies in the water made me cry my eyes out and is one of the best scenes i have ever seen in film is a epic film and james cameron has shown this disaster in all its horror and is a tribute to the victims of this tragedy in 2012 there has been a rumour that he is going to rerelease the film in 3d it will be even more incredible no doubt he proved that with avatar but its the storytellingwhich will recapture the myth of this fascinating tale that has been told throughout world generations even now as one reviewer baybee from austrailia quotes about the filmthis would have to be one of the most wonderful films of the 20th century and one that will never be forgotteni couldnt have put it better myself even after watching this time after time the film still has that powerful impact of making me feel sad truly remarkable,sad
i find it hard to believe people are still spending money to see this the clichs the glitz the kitsch are enough to make one choke  like some plastic madonna designed as a backdrop to a wagnerian opera by walt disney on a sterno binge but the real flaw is that it just goes on and on milking every possible tear from the eyes of deluded teenagers who read one historical romance novel too manyi dont even know why i watched it through the end  except it was on cable and a documentary on the real tragedy was immediately scheduled after watching it free is the only way to see this wretched excess without giving the studio hacks behind it the wrong idea that it might have been worth making  it wasnt anyway i thought the people freezing took an awful long time going to meet their maker but perhaps they were waiting to meet the maker of this movie who obviously took a vacation during the corporate filming of it needed extra time to count the money from the suckers doncha knowa complete travesty of anything like real historical drama,sad
since this movie was released in december 1997 i became crazy about this movie the feeling of the people about 96 years ago the heart wrenching sadness and the mega disaster of the 20th century is shown in this movie the romantic tale of jack dawson and rose dewitt bukater is clearly shown in this moviethe story is a first grade story the recreation of the mega disaster the stunts the breaking of the proud liner adds grandeur to the movie the movie was mostly done is water but the contribution of james horner is much more the slow music creates much magnification to many scenes even now when i hear the music it reminds me of the that night when 1500 perished in that night no other movie can ever take its placeit is so called the king of movies,sad
every once and while there is a film that sweeps the movie critics and audiences off their feet one of the greatest examples would be this film it hits every emotion the human body can produce and then some it bleeds through your mind and heart the moment the film starts it has the perfect mixture of love romance tragedy humor excitement and adventure without exploiting or going over the top this film showcases love can withstand anything and will break through barriers big or small and has a very unique message that says their is beauty and happiness through great tragedy and that heartbreak and loss can only make you stronger the film is epic and has beautiful cinematography with lush costumes oscar worthy performances breathtaking special effects a very universal story that any country could understand and has a score that not only sound gorgeous but contributes to the story through out my life their are very few films that stick out and remind me of the very first time i saw that movie on a scale from one to ten this would be a twenty and is one of the three films to receive eleven oscars major ones including best picture director editing score special effects and cinematography art direction costume design sound effects sound song and received three nominations including best actress in a leading role best actress in a supporting role and best makeup,sad
let me preface this by saying i dont like chick flicks while does fall into this category it also transcends it it is a smartly crafted having the present day scientist explain exactly what happens to the ship so we as audience members are not confused later well acted and expertly edited masterpiece there is no need for me to go into the story as we all know it by now i truly believe that the ones that hate this movie are self indulgent wannabe rebels who would hate anything if it didnt fit into their version of what real art should be ie cheap not made for the masses these people are as closed minded as racist kkk members,sad
seriously most overrated film ever made its not so much that its a particularly bad film its just not that great of one when it came out about ten years ago i thought it sucked most would attribute this to the fact that i was just a small child with little taste in anything which is true when i was young if there wasnt plenty of violence and cool things in a movie i hated ithowever watching this again as a supposed adult i find that young me was quite right was a borefest it was one lame line after the other it was just a fictional princessfallsinlovewithapeasant story set during a historical event what garbage it didnt even stand out as a love story it was bland and uneventful i dont see why it got so much praise it was such a mediocre piece of work yet its supposedly one of the best films of all time this piece of mediocrity receives such praise while well thought out action horror and thriller films get tossed aside and labeled as distasteful exploitation filmsreally im not all about action and violence but lets give credit and money where theyre due and neither are due here this was easily the most bland movie ever made id relate watching this to getting jabbed in the eyeballs with butcher knives repetitively for three hours however that would actually be more exciting than watching,sad
titaniclike gone with the wind is one of the great unrateable movies just as gwtw caught the imagination of the public in its time so repeated the feat sixty years laterneither one of them is a great movie in the artistic or intellectual sensebut both of them are great movies in terms of sheer populist entertainment and their grasp of the mood of the momentpossibly even opportunist might be the right word both of them had huge lead roles and nothing much else for their actorsboth featured highly unlikely romances between people from different social stratasgwtw had the burning of atlantabrilliant state  of  the  art filmingand has the sinking of the ship which is hugely impressive by any standards ten years down the line it looks better to me than it did on its release mr l dicaprioa little like a mixture of james cagney and mickey rooney is feisty and funny as jackkate winslet full of vitality and a slightly knowing innocencehold the film together during its occasional longeursand their coupling is sweet and funny if highly unlikely forget all the buts and allow yourself to be swept alonglingering in the chandeliered dining rooms strolling the endless decks and watch the stokers toil in the massive engine rooms like dores vision of hell the whole thing is a brilliantly assembled mish  mash of movie clichs one following the other seamlessly so that you dont care that youre watching sheer corn because its so well done the opening sequence with the 102 year  old rose on the diving ship is patiently built up with gradually lengthening flashbacks to 1912 the ending where roseafter telling her story goes out on the deck in the middle of the night and lets the priceless diamond she has had all along slip into the ocean thennoon the remote chance that you havent seen the movie i wont go any furtherbut i will pay the ultimate tribute to mr cameron and confess that i have watched six times and every damn timeno matter how much i tell myself i am being manipulated by a succession of still photographs being projected at just the right speed to cause persistence of visioni cry furthermore i would say that anybody not similarly affected would not feature highly on my christmas card list this is film  making of the highest order and i take my hat off to everybody involved,sad
the highest grossing movie of all time is also quite possibly the greatest movie of all time the story of the fatal april 1912 voyage of the quoteunquote unsinkable is told here with mastery and real present time footage the beginning of the film is narrated by gloria stuart playing the part of old rose with superb detail and presence she tells a recovery team about her experience on the ship on that night after that is when the movie officially beginshelped launch the careers of its two main stars leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet jack dawson dicaprio is a poor english boy traveling across to the united states mostly for the thrill of the ship but also to be able to earn some money rose bukater winslet is a rich english girl who is only on the because her mother and father are traveling to america dawson and bukater meet on the bow of the ship and are together throughout the film until the very endits hard to write a review for a movie that simply can not be described in words the movie may just seem like a typical love story with a major trap but it is so much more james cameron is truly the best director around to be able to tell a simple story with such a masterful presence like this is remarkable the movie will get you emotionally involved at least it did for me you dont just watch you experience it first hand,sad
i love this movie and anyone who doesnt is crazy when it first came out it was pretty much the movie everyone talked about its filled with many laughs tears ups and downs its pretty much has it all and the special effects are great and so is the acting it was sort of the breakout movie for leonardo and kate and i feel they did a great job along with all the other actors and actresss may i also mention the incredible score by james horner is amazing and what i dont understand is why some people love to hate this movie the people who walked into this movie and already decided they were going to analyze every flaw should have never even saw it in the first place because there really just ruining it for everybody else i give this move a 10 out a 10 and i think most people would agree that it definitely deserved to win the oscar that year for best picture its an unforgettable movie that everyone should see,sad
this by far is one of the most awful movies ive ever seen the movie was mostly crude and had very few laughs which disappointed me because i was told this movie was very funny i guess you cant always go by what other people tell you the acting was horrible my husband said to me  who told you that this movie was funny were they even watching the same movie that we just sawi just cant figure this out why anyone would recommend this movie is beyond me i would not recommend this movie and i will tell people straight up to not waist their time im a leonardo dicaprio fan but this movie is a poopy tiny baby diaper,sad
i think this is one of the best movie of all times when the subject of favorite movies comes up and the is mentioned many people snicker but you know that when they watch the movie they cry with the rest of them and are just embarrassed to say they did but the other other half of are saying how they love to watch it me personally i cried through the whole last hour of the movie i can watch this over and over and there is still a power in it also the acting is great leonardo dicapreo and kate winslet are perfect for the parts the scenes dont drag on and on as they tend to do in longer movies the special effects are amazing during the sinking scene i was amazed it was so realistic this is definitely my favorite movie and would recommend it to any person who hasnt seen this movie yet,sad
omg is one of my favorite movies of all time wwwwooowwwits just great one of kate winslets and leonardo dicaprios best by far the ending made me cry a lot they were both really good together my favorite scene of the whole movie is after they go to the dinner and go to the party with the lower class people love it their was some mess ups through the movie though like when dicaprio passes kate the note to come to the other party first it is yellow but when she opens it it is white there is another when they are at the party and he asks her to dance and his hair is slicked back but when they are together and about to dance it is more down it is and will ever be a classic,sad
i know there are some out there who snicker at this movie when it is mentioned yet if so many people hated it why is it the biggest selling movie of all time in america it sold more than star wars and george lucas released that movie more than once i found this shocking but it happened ticket sales dont lie and for those who laugh at this movie now they are probably some of the same ones that saw it in the theater hypocritesmy own experience with was a good one and yes i am a guy i enjoyed the back story that followed before the sinking and this is probably camerons best film to date yes its even better than the first two terminator films and aliens and they are all movies that i appreciatedmany didnt like this film because of leonardo dicaprio yes hes given better acting performances in other movies whats eating gilbert grape but in titantic he was still very good of course i dont think people dislike dicaprio because of his acting they just dont like him for some reason yet i never heard anything bad about him before made him a mega superstarin my opinion is a great film it was one of the best in 1997 and was still popular in the summer of 1998 when it was still being shown in the theaters that alone is a fantastic achievement so all you hypocrites can laugh all you want the fact is that this movie is still well liked by many and is still the biggest selling movie of all time in 2006 update very late i know avatar surpassed this movie in sales directed by who else james cameron again incredible,sad
warning this comment contains a spoiler at the end  ive seen the movie at the theaters and i have to admit on a big screen is has some impact on the viewer but that s only because of the special effects the story itself has no added value how is it possible that this movie was the big winner in 1998  if you compare with la confidential it is impossible to understand how did beat la c the characters in are no more than cart board figures the plot is nowhere surprising the acting of leonardo is really acting and that is not mend positive and now the spoiler it is impossible for a human person to stay alive for such a long time in ice water as leonardo did but it is also very hard to believe that kate survived in the arctic night with all the wet clothing the people that survived the disaster in reality where the passengers who succeeded in getting into the lifeboats without hitting the water first,sad
i suppose this film is ok for people who like a bit of romance and stuff but never has anything so overhyped and laden with awards been in my opinion so utterly lifeless and underinspiring ill be honest with you all in that i could not watch all of this film in 1 sitting so i actually watched in over 4 separate occasionsi also believe that remakes of existing films always tend to be a disappointment and a let down in this case lived up to my expectations totallygentlemen watch this if your partner insists but tell them you may not be able to endure the whole film in one sitting over the top romantics you will probably enjoy thisanyway i am not a heartless unromantic person i just could not face any more of this film,sad
i must be the only person i know that does not gush when the title is mentioned  i sat through the whole movie wondering if id have been better off staying home and doing laundry and ive come to the conclusion that yes i probably would have beenthis movie is recycled crp  they took the classic rich girl loves poor boy story tagged on one of the worlds largest tragic events stuck in a pretty face or two forget about acting ability  kate dear you were better in sense and sensibility ten bazillion dollars for a budget and bingo youve got yourself a blockbuster that attracts hoards of lip glossed hip huggered chunky heeled britney spears listening glitter wearing teenaged girls  all for the sake of a prepubescent leonardo dicaprio cmon he looks like hes twelve it saddens me that something as shallow as a teen heart throb can elevate a piece of junk like to what some call the best movie of all time arghthe only part of this movie that actually made me stop and look were the beautiful cgi effects however prettiness and expensive effects doth not a good movie make  other than that spitting off a ship and contrived chases with guns do not appeal to me much as good cinema  id recommend everyone to see it at least once but not for the sake of seeing a good movie but to remind society that were too used to being served 2 for 1 cans of tuna that were prepared for the cost of caviar its still just tuna,sad
hmmwell it wasnt a good movie at all could have been much more betterthats what a small budget and horrible actors will do to a movie and cameron should have been replaced with john woo now that would have been a movie i would like to have seenhe he he,sad
these were two of the worst movies ever made  how can gross almost 2 billion worldwide  if you are going to go see rent or buy either of these movies please give the money to charity and kick your self in the ass  it will save you a trip and you will have the combined 5 hours of your life to live as you wish,sad
id like to say that only got its attention because leonardo dicaprio was in it and it was the most expensive movie it was nothing like the real sinking of the and they made too many mistakes which you will notice if you watch carefully im a fan of camerons work but this was simply an attention seeker movie like godzilla it shouldnt have gotten all the oscars because there were better movies with much better standards the only oscars it deserved to win was best song and best music which was the only good thing about this movie if you wanna see a real masterpiece see good will hunting or sliding doors for those who havent seen it see it but dont expect the best expect an average disaster movie,sad
while the popular thing to do would be to simply say this movie sucks without any particular reasons why i wont the reason why it drew so much attention was mostly because rabid drooling females saw that leonardo dicaprio was in it  while he may not be a bad actor at all to rate a movie as very high simply because one of the actors is very hot is extremely stupid indeed  while the plot wasnt that bad the problem was that everyone knew the outcomethe ship was going to sink and a bunch of people were going to die  in cutting off this suspense from the viewers the effectiveness of the film was partially destroyedanother thing that bothered me was how the rich passengers exceptions being rose and molly brown were all portrayed as uncaring selfish materialistic beingsapparently only  because they were wealthy  this is an extremely biased and 2d cardboard point of view  in fact the whole movie seemed very 2 dimensional and an insult to the real tragedy that occured  it incured sympathy for them but characters were often displayed as only good or only bad  humans are made up of both sides and in this movie the characters were either entirely noble or entirely nasty  it was given an oscar for best picture in my opinion purely because it was one of the latest movies to come out and everyone was raving over it  fortunately however as only following were fickle teenagers my age group who jump onto every new movie that comes along with cheers proclaiming themselves ultimate fans will soon disappear into oblivion  star wars although not winning an oscar for best picture triumphs in the end for it has kept a large following for a good 25 years  seems to be fading away after 2,sad
i will admit it i got sucked up into the hype and went to see the movie with my girlfriend we were both disappointed yes the visual effects are good but the true story behind is the astonishment and shock of the worlds most luxurious ocean liner sinking on its maiden voyage the fact that it was labeled unsinkable yet sank all the unfortunate victims of its doomed first and final voyage not about two kids who boink in the back seat of some jalopy it needed to show more realism the truth and have a much better stronger story the movie was simply filled with too much cheesy acting and not enough facts im not saying this cause im a guy im saying this because it is what was evidently clear in my eyes when i saw this film and is congenial with the eyes of many others,sad
the same old love story with mediocre acting and a bad script not even the bit of special affects or the detail cameron gave can save it i think that there is about 10 minutes that are worth watching  save your time for a better film,sad
while some viewers were disappointed that this wasnt just another a night to remember i believe that the use of the fictional characters was an effective storytelling device we are brought into the story through jack and rose with the historical characters and events as a backdrop the same device is used in such great films as gone with the wind the charge of the light brigade and they died with their boots on history is thus brought to life without being ponderous,sad
spoiler at the end of this                                  first off let me say i am a big fan of james camerons movies so i was incredibly dissapointed by this movie  this movie looks like it was made for the lifetime network the special effects were wonderfulthat is the only nice thing i can say about it  it has a bad made for tv plot that is so thin collista flockhart would be jealous  the love story was completely unbelievable and dicaprio besides giving a horrible performance was just plain annoying the fact that it is the biggest grossing movie in history is a very telling commentary on our society and just plain sad how did this movie win any oscars let alone one for editing  i dont think anyone edited this pospiece of st at all this movie took longer to watch than the ship did to sink  that is not a lie  jim cameron owes me 3 hours of my life back          spoiler alert   now to the ending i rather enjoyed watching leo freeze to deathto me it was the high point in the film although i had to wait 3 bleeping hours to get to it then we go back to the old rose being wheeled around and it turns out she has had the massive blue diamond in her possession all along which she then throws into the oceanarrrg  why    i wish someone had thrown her in after it,sad
james cameron must be out of his confused mind to direct this c grade low class filmi dont know how this movie got best film at the oscars where the film itself is loaded with special effects and stupid romantic scenes thar make people laughits like a bollywood movie in hollywood styleabsolute crap,sad
less mystifying than the success of this film is the negative response it received from most critics it has been labelled a spectacle of death adolescent banal and most damning of all hollywood hollywoods become an adjective now apparently at least five of my friends would not see it because leonardo dicaprio is a teen idol and they feel above associating with that kind of thing the dialogue is pitched at a very general level  the last thing youd call it is poetic i think part of what rubbed so many critics the wrong way is that this is a completely new approach to the victorian romance i know 1912 isnt precisely victorian but its close and as the edwardian romance isnt really a genre thats what people will be comparing this with room with a view this aint it is however reminiscent in many respects with thomas hardys novels here are some of its featurestechnically is really cutting edge high quality special fx though a few problems rendering the cgi passengers its good enough to double as a documentary the characters are fictional but really is anyone dumb enough not to realise that theres real footage of the real at the bottom of the ocean really tricky stuff involving shooting underwater and a strong knowledge and portrayal of the mechanical workings of the ship it won the special fx oscar for good reasonits the first special fx romance sure there have been fx movies with romances in them but only as an accompaniment to the testosterone pumping hero makes the statement perhaps inadvertently that technology can be relevant to a womans story as well more recently weve seen charlies angels and i think well see more in the future  but was the first as well as the only one thats really a chickflick this doesnt necessarily make a good film but it is a point of interestits complex yet logically consistent when a plot works as smoothly as in its easy to overlook how clever it is there are a lot of characters but we never get confused every character is logically consistent every scene every visual every word moves the story forward this film not only uses the classic heros journey it uses it for four subjects simultaneously rose the heroine played by kate winslet the ship the archaeologist and the diamond each of these subjects has a story that stands alone rose and the ship are inextricably linked and their stories parallel almost exactly a lot of roses internal dialogue could be applied to the ship without changing a word and their social roles are very similar its a clever technique that makes us relate to the ships fate by identifying with rose and vice versa likewise the archaeologist allows us to bridge the gap from our 20th century cynicism into roses story the film doesnt expect us to care about this ship straight away it works to persuade us and the audiences journey is mirrored in that of the archaeologist by the way if you think this doesnt sound very hard go ahead and try it suckeri mentioned thomas hardy earlier james cameron has hardys eye for realworld detail and a way of realising its significance more particularly they both have a lot to say about women the industrial revolution british imperialism and class  and they seem to arrive at the same conclusions the dialogue concentrates on being truetolife rather than poetic  right down to accents turnofphrase and foreign words being subtitled where necessary which isnt often this is also true of gestures costumes technology music art and other cultural particularities a great deal of thought and research has been expended all this to give us a film that creates more than characters and a story its a film that recreates a worldawesome recognition of theme metaphor and myth personally this is the aspect of that really blows me away james cameron not only recognised a good story here but he figures out why its important and translates that onto the screen the first and most obvious point is that the ship becomes a microcosm of british society graphically and spatially people are divided according to telling social conventions  cf first and third class accomodation cf the position and costumes of women and men and because hes working from a true story cameron makes his point without being tokenistic it embodies a christian tripartite world with the hellish boiler chambers below and the almost heavenly freedom on the decks above the captain and crew sit on high and order how everything will be run the machinery representing the industrial revolution is awesome remarkable but ultimately fails when it becomes an end in and of itself it is a classic tragedy that tells of human ambition power and pride it is a romeo  juliet tale of the love that crosses all boundaries it incorporates icarus and metaphorical fairy godmothers its the ship of fools the journey from the old world to the new and man against nature and the gendered nature of the concept is explored but it does all this with a particularity of circumstance that takes these themesmythsideas and reinvents them then it turns up the pressure  first by bottling these people onto a large but still conspicuously finite ship then as the ship sinks taking that room and making it smaller and smaller people are forced to make choices push comes to shove and the good the bad and very ugly side of human nature is disturbingly brought to lifefinally has an emphasis on communication it takes a vast amount of complex information and communicates it clearly and succinctly it is the kind of layered film that anyone can watch and understand but the more you look into it the more you find its very visual  in such a way that you could turn the sound down and youd get all the important details it shows it doesnt tell despite the technical wizardry producing it required and the huge numbers of people to coordinate the film looks unified and never falters in its pacing themes or story it remains masterfully under the directors control and it lives and breathes his enthusiasm,sad
i know this is the best overrated movie of all so i watched this filmit earn its place as the best movie of all time the visual surprising still holds up for a movie that came out 2 decades ago the music score is the best thing i ever heard the cinematography is beautifully shot and the tone of the movie is very lovable and emotional watching this for first time is such a blast but sadly i wont have that same feeling again if i go watch it again this movie is very memorable for generations to come,sad
is really one of those movies that has something for everyone romance actiondisaster the historical aspect etc this movie offers a little something to everyone combining the immaculate attention to detail that went into making it historically accurate the incredible cinematography the majesty of the ship the costuming the emotion and one of the greatest love stories ever told produced one sensational classic movie that will stand the rest of time,sad
this hollywood tour de force is too mainstream for its own good great visuals expensive sets great hype but ultimately shallow it perhaps does not deserve all the hate if often gets but by all means it did not deserve the hype with which it was initially met so in reality a mixed bag hollywood has produced much worse and also had its honor pieces this moneymaker is neither of the extremes but it is certainly too soulless manipulative and shallow to be considered a master piece but when stripped off its dumbest pandering it has some decent side to it mainly of the technical nature,sad
i can still remember the first time i watched this and the music of the beginning of movie kept sticking on my head over and over again,sad
i hear a lot about this moviethe movie was good not so great or masterpiece it was between okay and a good moviethe best thing about the movie was the background scorei think bgm was really goodit is almost like a trance,sad
kate winslet is very pretty but thats the best thing about this film it is a bog standard formulaic love story about a poor boy  rich woman that drags on for way too long then the poor boy is inexplicably left to freeze to death when he could have just climbed on the raft  there was plenty of room a ridiculous movie that doesnt deserve the praise and hype,sad
its the same halfbaked romance as every other 90s romantic film see he said she said and only you except this time it takes advantage of a 2224casualty shipwreck apparently the ideal formula for a cash cow is just to do a secondrate unfinished and unpolished shakespearean tragedy and make it happen in the midst of one of the worst peacetime disasters in history side note its fairly impossible to spoil this film if you know the sank but ill mark it anyway,sad
3000 men worked for two years to build the most gigantic ship of all timethethe ship which couldnt sink 2208 bid farewell to southampton in april 1912little did they know that this unsinkable ship was going to sink on its maiden voyage itself tragedy struck1503 people died leaving the whole world shell shocked good story for a movieright so james cameron decided to do ityears of obsessionresearchplotting and 200 million usd went into making this film making it the costliest and the riskiest film of all time the result became the highest grossing movie ever and is still the 2nd highest grosssing film of all timeonly 2nd to james camerons own avatar what makes the film so special its the way it unfoldsthe way it is engineered by cameron the writingspecial effects are beyond brilliantthe fictional part of the film has become iconiceverything clicks when the movie startsduring 1st few secondsthe background music plays and right there you know that this film is going to be specialit goes on for more than 3 hours and in those 3 hourswe are told the great story of the we get to experience the splendour of the shipknow the perspective of all the characters and that in my opinion is where the film wins cameron lets us to see the things from every characters perspectivebe it jackfabrizioroseher motherher fiancher fiances right handthe captainthe passengerseveryone we see how they see things and it is amazing the tragedy is shown in perhaps the best possible waythe thrillthe tensionthe fascinationthe grandeurthe lovethe tragedyin these 200 minuteswe experience it all kudos to cameron for making this unforgettable and immortal piece of cinema which will be watched and loved by generations to come from a guy who has seen the whole film in excess of 130 times and is still in awe of this magical storyheres a piece of advise watch this film now if u havent it will stay with u for a veryvery long time u dont watchu experience the best of the best,sad
in all fairness this movie had no potential to be good from the beginning everyone knows the story of and nobody really cared that much guy meets girl guy falls in love ship crashes they die the end great i could have done a 30 second skit of this movie on facebook for christ sake why is this movie so popular please someone explain to me if you want to see true love destroyed right in front of your eyes i can help you find that just hit up a 4am bar and watch the sink right in front of your eyesi feel bad for leo as this flick really destroys his legacy he is a much better actor than he shows in this flick he has no one to blame but his agent why would his agent set him up to play in this trashcan of a movie leo you are better than this if i was your agent i would never have set this up for you i am sorry on behalf of your agenttimeout did these two just meet on the ship for the first time they fell in love on this ship after a short amount of time stop it i thought these two knew each other since they were like 3 or something i had this movie rated a 4 but once i confirmed this major detail it was very easy for me to bump down to a 2 again leo you are better than this dont waste your time on this one next,sad
i am loving it this is really a greatest movie this was the first hollywood movie i had seen i am really a big fan of this movie this is an excellent movie this is a fantastic movie everyone on this earth must watch this movie the story of the movie is marvelous i have watched this movie a number of times i cry every time when i watch this is a cool movie i want to watch this movie before i die i love this movie this movie is considered one of the toppest movie according to me this movie is honestly one of the superb movie everybody on this earth must watch this movie before they die it must be made the government rule,sad
i enjoyed this movie it was very well directed and the cast were fun to watchi enjoyed this movie it was very well directed and the cast were fun to watchi enjoyed this movie it was very well directed and the cast were fun to watchi enjoyed this movie it was very well directed and the cast were fun to watchi enjoyed this movie it was very well directed and the cast were fun to watchi enjoyed this movie it was very well directed and the cast were fun to watchi enjoyed this movie it was very well directed and the cast were fun to watchi enjoyed this movie it was very well directed and the cast were fun to watchi enjoyed this movie it was very well directed and the cast were fun to watchi enjoyed this movie it was very well directed and the cast were fun to watch,sad
first of all i need to say james cameron is a genius he done this masterpiece really precisely he done a tons of researches for getting the best result even the floor coatings colorshapetexturejames cameron in some interviews said still there is some errors in some parts but i need to say come on its perfect a little detail can not corrupt anythingif i wanna talk about there is hundred things that i can mention but heres some of themis my favorite and number one movie ever because its perfect in all the forms of film making for example visual effects are perfect score and soundtrack are one of the best in cinemas history cinematography is perfect casting and acting is great plot is great emotions throughout the film is superb directing is best production is extremely great entertaining level is more than any wants costume and production design is really precise and beautifullove story in pictured perfectly things such as emotions love looks heart beats remission sacrifices pleasureseven disaster of this ship and its passengers pictured and worked perfectlythere is a great thing about this you just wanna follow the whole things in the film til the end all the scenes are beautiful even disasters and discrimination between britishirish passengersthere is just two things that im not completely alright with it 1 length not so much just about half hour 2 originality made in the past dozens of timesmy final and precise rating for is 95i extremely recommend it to wise emotional and lovers of cinema i know some people who hate and all of them are extreme and irrational peoplei watched more than any movie out there cause i can feel it totallya big thanx for james cameron for doing this and you for reading thishave fun,sad
it gets me every time im an emotion wreck at the end is the only few films i have watched that is just as enjoyable as the first watcha 3 hour film normally requires dedication and sustain concentration with many films offend drag on but could be on for 6 hours and still be just as engagingkate and dicaprio are just so perfect for this role and are very believable in there performances theres not one second that you think that there are acting in a film which says it all many people would say watching is a guilty pleasure but not for me its just a pleasure,sad
i have unsuccessfully attempted to watch this film four times at three hours and fourteen minutes it feels like it is two movies in one on the one hand it is a history movie with great details about the ship its crew and its passengers on the other hand it is also a love story which feels like romeo and juliet on a boat but with social class struggles instead of family feuding as a history movie is a top20 film but as a love story it falls flat for me call me heartless but this movie did not affect me i enjoyed dicaprio and winslet in the film but i felt their roles werent fully developed because the film had two focuses if the film would have focused on the love story alone it could have been as powerful as the notebook,sad
all these years ive never wanted to sit down and watch this movie for various reasons yesterday i just decided to randomly sit down and watch this movie expecting nothing but a cheesy over the top romance movie i was pleasantly surprised and blown awayas a person whose only ever seen camerons big three t2 aliens and terminator i never thought that any movie could ever near those three films i have yet to see avatar which i will sometime but back to topic blew me away as i had such low expectationseveryone knows the story of where a young boy and girl meet and fall in love as time goes by crashes into an iceberg causing the ship to slowly start to sink as the romance between the two gets stronger everyone also knows that this movie is somewhat considered one of the best and has won 11 oscars the most that is only tied with return of the king and benhurthere is so much that i love about that i dont like in most romance movies the chemistry between the two is amazing the acting is great the story is beautiful and emotionally gripping the visuals are amazing the epic scope is breath taking and the last hour is breath taking intensity after intensity the characters are also amazing and the music is just beautiful camerons writing and directing is great despite some cheesy lines such as im flying my main concern with before watching it was that i believed that cameron wouldnt be up to the challenge as he is a director of action movies t2 aliens terminator the abyss true lies etc he proved me wrong and i only love cameron more for this he has mastered creating epic dramas and epic romances with this movie to conclude this review here is an awesome beautiful and emotionally gripping romance tale that is masterfully directed brilliantly acted with amazing visuals a huge scope amazing music and some great characters the movie itself doesnt deserve to be called one of the very best nor in my opinion does it deserve the 11 oscars it got but is stillan amazing movie that everyone needs to check out,sad
this movie was way too long and drawn outthe romance was sappy and creepy to me as leonard dicaprio looks like a young boy so i dont understand why women would go to see this for him whereas kate winslett whos acting i normally think is great looks much much olderadditionally i saw the poseidon adventure 1972 movie on similar topic of ship sinking and it was way better with way better actingthis movie was so predictable  i would have left the theatre if it wasnt for the person i was with that was loving the movie who dragged me therereally overhyped,sad
this film is one of only a select few that has had the privilege of winning 11 academy awards and with good reason it is clearly one of the best films of all time i got the privilege of seeing it earlier this year in 3d i had already seen it before but my parents said that it was quite the experience seeing it in theatres they could not be more correct on thatthe story is that rose an upperclass citizen is engaged to a wealthy man named cal however she feels trapped in her world and she is almost pushed over the ledge when she meets jack a lowerclass citizen despite their difference in social status they take a liking to each other despite cals and her mothers hatred of jack despite their social status and everybody against their pairing the two fall deeply in love when suddenly well if you know the story of the rms then you know the rest of this storyjames cameron you are a master filmmaker youve done it with the terminator movies aliens true lies the abyss and you have also done it with as well as avatar which is my favourite movie of all time what cameron is great at doing is creating a story in which the first part tells the story without all the crazy stuff happening so that when the second partfinal action scenes come we know who to cheer for when something good happens and who to cry for when something bad happens he did it with this movie he did it with avatar it is a great way of providing the audience with amazing special effects and action sequences without them being too distracting from the moviei must also applaud the acting gloria stuart is amazing in her supporting role and she shares much of her screen time with bill paxton who also does great despite the limitations he gets in this film frances fisher is great as the overbearing mother who seems to only care about money and not about her daughters wishes kathy bates lightens up the screen with her witty dialogue as molly brown while billy zane is great as the antagonist calhowever it is our two leads leo and kate who truly shine here they would later go on to act in revolutionary road and both films show their chemistry well if these two became a reallife couple i would not be surprised as they seem to have a whole lot of chemistry on screenoverall this movie is a triumph if you have not seen it stop reading this turn off your computer go to the nearest dvd store and buy it the dialogue might be a little cheesy for you to handle but the actors are great the story is great the direction is great etc overall a 1010 for me,sad
technically this can hardly be faulted as a spectacleits very good for a three hours plus movie it moves along ok there are however major problems with its not unsinkable  the two leads kate winslet and leonardo di caprio cant sustain a hot romance throughout the entire movieindeed the chemistry is never quite right between the twodi caprio in particular is out of his depth here both actors even apart from the relationship problem are not at their best perhaps the gigantic nature of the project got to themthe supporting cast play thislike they are on a ship that will hit a huge ice berg the dialogue is another problem it lacks any feeling or spontaneity and some of the language sounds too modern the hype surrounding this movie before release was incredible garaunteeing a successful picture if your happy with technology and amazing special effectsthis is your movie but dont look too closethere are cracks here,sad
i know that this movie is pretty much half loved and half hated by the world the first time i watched it i was 5 years old i didnt really understand any of it at that age except the fact that there was a boy a girl and a sinking ship i then again watched it when i was about 10 or 11 i really started to have an interest in the history of and of course leo dicaprio every time it was on tv i would watch the whole thingi fell in love with it by the time i was the age i am now 15i had known the movie by heart and understood every aspect of it this movie is very close to my heart in so many ways some people might say of course you love this movie your 15 and all you have on your mind is hot boys and love i love it for many other reasons though too many to listi have heard many opinions on most were negative the people who disliked it though hadnt seemed to understand it quite well maybe you have to see it a couple of times to really understand it so if you have never seen this movie go see it in 3d in april 2012 its definitely worth watching you might hate it but i really recommend it everyone says the whole 3d thing is over rated but i think it will make the already great special effects even better i have also never seen it on the big screen so i am extra excited over all i love this movie its unfortunate that it gets so much hatred,sad
some of you may know james cameron more for making his bad boy type films for example the terminator aliens rambo and true lies this film is so much different to those but in an extraordinary way this is how i like to see cameron making films at top notch so youve got your basic love couple one from a rich family and one living down in the dumps but the cheesy love story is so much more than that because it takes place on one of the grandest most commonly known ships to ever set sail aside from the cheesiness cameron gets you involved into the history of in the first 10 minutes of the film starting with old rose and her adventures aboard ship at the mere age of just seventeen and how she meets the young teen heart throb jack leonardo dicaprio there relationship gradually gets higher throughout the film until finally there hormone crazed minds decide to put it down to the core and fall in love not only is she finding it hard to live on the wealthy side of the land because her mother is loosing money and needs rose to get married to the evil fianc cal but as the truth comes out the story is forgotten as the starcrossed lovers suffer a more terrible threat an iceberg smashing into the ship dawning to its death this magical love story is put behind as rose and jack conjure the rising waters and cals crazed jealousy washed with a gorgeous tone melodrama and dazzling special effects as the once happy couple are taking a thrilling race for survival this is a definite must for all cameron lovers trust me in my opinion this is better than avatar and thats coming from a cameron crazed lover the effects are out of this world for the date it actually came out seriously if you have not yet seen it come out from under that rock and get down the store and buy a copy,sad
ive have seen many times and it is one of my favorite movies every time it is still so sad because of all the people who died there amazingly directed by james cameron who must be the greatest director out there next to peter jacksonnow it is 10th anniversary since it has been released in 1998 in february but it still looks like it has been made like yesterday to me because of the amazing directing and the picture i dont think anyone could make a great performance than leonardo and kate they were the best couple everthe real story didnt include rose and jack but it was great idea to make a great story before the sinking and it was the sadest love story also when rose just found the greatest love of her life she loosed him when the ship was sinking think about the great time they could have if both of them survived and it was weird when the old rose didnt tell anyone about jack after 80 years i wonder who she went to when the survivors came to land in new york we know she didnt went to her fianc cal did she really went to her weird mum did she go back to her dad thats a mysteryi would love anyway to go to a museum i find the sinking story very touching and sad if only all those people could have survived i wonder how it would be now,sad
when came out i was only 5 years old of course i didnt go to see it in theaters as i got older i was always hearing of and how it topped the box office and so on but yet never watched it about 5 months ago i was flipping through the channels and saw was on it was already in the last hour and a half where the ship was sinking so i didnt really pay attention when i watched it i was on the computer at the same time the next day i turned it on when it was being reran only to find it shortly in the same sinking sceneabout a month ago i was looking through the tv guide and saw that it was going to be on tv when it came on i sat and watched it the entire thing when it was on again the next day i watched again left awestruck how incredibly glad i am that i finally did watch it watching for me isnt just to see a ship sink its a way to escape reality and be taken back to 1912 leonardo dicaprio jack dawson and kate winslet rose dewitt bukater have chemistry unlike anyone ive ever seen no lie jack and rose may just be star crossed lovers to some i however see them as more watching leo and kate act makes me forget where i am what im doing and not notice anyone around me theyre the reason im drawn to the movie theyre the reason why is what it is today 10 years laterrose is a 1st class girl being taken over to america to marry cal hockley but she is also upset with her life and wants to break free of feeling like a slave and accomplish her own dreams 3rd class jack dawson sketches people and wanders around on the streets taking life as it comes at him after jack convinces rose not to jump off the back of they get closer and closer throughout the movie and fall in love as you watch the 2 fall in love it makes me want to jump in the screen and actually be on despite its fate it makes me want to experience the chaos of a sinking ship or the touch of the icy watermakes me reflect on how i want to live my life of how i want to travel try new things meet people like jack dawson and love someone how he and rose did even if it is for a brief period of time i have seen many great movies in my life but fits into its own category unlike the others jack and rose have earned a spot in my life and i honestly give so much emotion when i say titanin is a truly amazing adventure of tragedy and love but never worth missing,sad
i was forced to watch this by my wife she loves sad romantic movies but i prefer action and violence movies i know the plot and most of the characters are fake but i tell ya i cried my eyes out here i am a 200lb tough guy but this movie brought me to my knees i dont care what others say i say all the acting was perfect and the movie is the greatest i think i have ever seen i hate celene dion but her song in this movie was a perfect match and a masterpiece when this movie comes on tv like it did tonight even though i have the dvd i still watch it live on tv its one of those movies that if you see it on you gotta watch it again i used to be in the navy and believe me they are right about the water when its that cold and what it does to your body its a sad horrific way to die i feel for those people on the ship and wish it never happened human tragedy is an awful thing and cameron does a perfect job of bringing that home to all of us rest in peace to all that were on the rms,sad
is one of the greatest motion picture about love that ive seen through these years it gives the audience about a imaginary romance which wont be happened in the real world the love of a rich and a poor through life and death i believe this is the main reason for people to watch itthe reason that i give for 10 stars is because every part of this movie is excellent it dont rely much on props but attractive striking scenes for my favorite scene of it is of course when crashed on the iceberg and passengers started to try to escape from it is my most memorable moment i even cant get my eyes out of the screeni watched for 3 or 4 times in about 3 years although i watched several times i was still touched by the romantic story of jack and rose i really wish that it can happen in my life,sad
this was undoubtedly a huge box office success and being so hollywooddominated its just natural that people have such polarized opinions a few years after the movies release it became quite fashionable to skewer the as an example of the overhyped huge budget hollywood films with questionable acting and a cheesy story but now it seems to have come full circle a larger percentage of reviewers have come out to express their positive feelings perhaps after rewatching and reassessing the big picture of thingsof course the criticisms about the storyline are 100 true the plot is clich and predictable nonetheless james cameron takes it and executes it impeccably it matters not that a story has been retold for the hundredth time a good storyteller can still captivate his audience here i believe lies the magic is a film that takes these clichs and weaves a beautiful quilt out of themdoes not pretend to be innovative at least in terms of the storyline however considering its execution great at the time cgi and majestic rendering of that great vessel i believe this should be a consideration for the imdb top 250 for those who have a bit of time on hand why not take another look at this slightly dated blockbuster focus on the riveting atmosphere that the director projects upon the screen and refrain from digging in on its flaws and this should be an enjoying experience,sad
the critics had the knives out for james camerons masterpiece long before its release they were going to criticise its for being too long too boring badly acted badly directed etc but when cameron released this film about a subject that has been a lifelong fascination of mine and his the critics were silenced and the film did all the talkingand boy did it talk it become the first film in history to make 1 billion dollars and no other film has quite caught the publics imagination like it it tells a simple story set against the backdrop of the biggest maritime disaster yet rose dewitt bukater kate winslet is unhappily boarding the with her overtly snobby partner cal billy zane and her family and while attempting suicide meets jack dawson leonardo dicaprio and straightaway falls in love with him as though he is from a different class he shows her a different more enjoyable life than the one she is having with calshows you triumph over disaster in all its shapes and forms is also a story about the great class divide which used to exist some people say it still does and though you know the outcome watching this film for the 1st time or the hundredth time doesnt fail to intrigue although factually incorrect in parts especially in the case of officer william murdoch who despite his portrayal in the film as a bad guy who shot himself actually was a good guy who went down with the ship this is the most true adaptation of this story it won 11 oscars in 1998 equalling the haul of all about eve and ben hur including the biggie best picture and has won universal praise from cinemagoers but not so from some of those critics who have largely lambasted it showing once and for all that there is a world of difference between critic and cinema goer the acting particularly from dicaprio winslet and zane is exemplary and earns the film as much a place in history as the event itself a modern masterpiece,sad
i first saw this movie when i was nine years old i am now twelve i think that some parts of it were difficult for me to understand three years ago but now i can see this movie very clearly as a masterpieceit all starts in the middle of the ocean a team of men are working to try to hoist longlost treasures out of the a ship that contained many treasures belonging to wealthy passengers nothing is found  apart from a drawing of a young woman the men investigate the drawing closer and manage to find the woman in it who tells the story of her experiences onrose dewitt bukater is a young beautiful and wealthy woman travelling back to america with her mother and fianc cal hockley she detests everything about her life as all her mother and companions think about is money she sees no way out of this trap  until she meets jack dawson a poor and talented american artist who instantly falls in love with her at first rose is hesitant and slightly icy towards jack but then realises that she loves him too this causes immediate feuding between jack and cal which seems unstoppablejust as rose and jacks relationship starts to blossom a major disaster sticks upon the a disaster that cannot be helpedexcellent and memorable acting is given from all of the main characters  particularly kate winslet as rose and leonardo dicaprio as jack i have to admit i cant watch this movie a single time without crying it is very emotional with some very sad scenes very beautiful yet sad i would recommend this movie to everyone between the ages of 9 onwards noone should miss out of this topclass drama that holds many records ,sad
lot of men truly hate this movie i dont blame them an ultrasilly love story that is basically unrealistic as well as naive its a purest example of puppy lovehowever i really do think this is an excellent film you take away the love story and you will see a very accurate portrayal of an very tragic eventthere are some scenes that will break everyones heart one is the old couple waiting to die in their bed as their room is being consumed by water another is the string quartet playing music while death and destruction surround them the scene that really wrenches my gut is when the captain commits suicide i find these scenes very emotional mainly because they probably actually happenedis the love story really corny you bet but many films such as crouching tiger hidden dragon the english patient and even lord of the rings have lot of silly sentimental corny love story lines but they are much more acclaimed than i have a feeling the reason why this film got so much bad rap is that much of the audience are very young females and that their being headoverheels over dicaprio annoyed lot of men i think dicaprio did do a mediocre performance in this movie but the silly love story in my mind didnt affect the emotionally devastating impact i had watching the powerful sequences of death and dying saving private ryan is the only other film that affected me more than in showing the horror of human beings struggling to survive,sad
this movie is fantastic based on a true story the story of the unsinkable ship well that didnt work leonardo di caprio kate winslet and billy zane where absolutely fantastic and how the cameras were whipped around the set design the special effects and the actors were really done well all in all this film is in motion picture history books in my opinion but it does get a little scary at the end and the way that caprio died at the end it was a little too cold not just in general is the film to watch if you want a good cry and a slight scare romance and billy zane at his best will make you cry and leap for a cushion,sad
titanicwow this is my favourite movie ever whywell its simple it has everything i have ever looked for in a film great story inspired from a true storyeven better cool characters witty lines touching ending and  on top of everything  an extraordinary love story the story all in all is believable and only an insensitive person wouldnt empathize with the characters and feel their pain i am also very fond of the soundtrack of the film my heart will go on by celine dion i think that the song captures the essence of the film and is appropriate for the love story between the two characters jack and rose is an impressive movie which will never seize to amaze me moreover i think that the oscars all of them are more than welldeserved this film is a mustsee for all those who havent yet watched it i especially recommend it two romantic person who are into heartbreakingromances enjoy my vote 1010,sad
the movie is wonderful thats all i can say i recommend that you watch this it made me cry it made me laugh but it just  overall  was wonderful that is basically the only word to describe it a poor guy jack dawson falls in love with a rich woman rose dewitt bukater rose is forced to marry a rich man cal hockley by her mother rose of course doesnt love him back but more likely loves jack she doesnt realize this until the scene where they are at the front of the boat and she is flying throughout the movie rose and jacks love blossoms into a beautiful romance her mother is mad and her fiance is furious but jack and rose dont care but rather love each other more jack has nothing to offer rose and he knows it thats all i can say without getting too detailed basically every part of this film was wonderful it was delicate and it was sad i recommend that you watch this if you like sad and romance this is definitely a movie for you i usually dont like sad movies but this movie has turned me to it instead against it to tell the tale short its my favorite movie and im sure its many others too,sad
a movie called towering inferno took over america in the mid70s and embedded itself into the american culture for time immemorial towering inferno was lauded lauded lauded and ever laudedin 1980 a movie called being there showed up in the screens  in limited screenings  and was given very favorable reviews by the few that saw itnearly 3 decades later everyone and anyone places towering inferno into the category of the independence day and jurassic park films its great entertainmentat the same time its universally acknowledged by almost all that being there is a film that turned out prescient by its existence and still stands as a beautiful production of satire albeit one of beautiful forecasting satire3 decades later towering inferno is a film that is shown to the american public on the 3rd tier television stations in the media markets outside of both coastsnearly 3 decades later the little known being there is still one of the most sought after videos amongst the specialty video carriers and is still highly lauded by film critics and film viewers everywheretime has not been kind to towering infernotime has actually caught up with being thereim fairly certain that almost all of you out there isare aware of which of the two above categories will end up being placed in by history,sad
i dont know how this film possibly won best picture for 1997  this story was extremely historically inaccurate by the way the characters talked and acted toward each other and the computer animation was pretty fake at times james camerons other films such as terminator aliens and the abyss were much better  he should stick to scifi,sad
i hate this movie i hate its shallow sentimental love story i hate the way it caters to the teenybopper set i hate its poorly portrayed onedimensional characters i hate its length i hate its inane subplots the whole story around the jewel was useless and contrived i hate the way that it chose to focus on two teenagers in love while relegating the tragedy of the deaths of some many people to the background it spends three hours trying to build sympathy for the rose and jack characters while almost completely forgetting the real tragedy behind the story i hate its attention to detail while forgetting to pay attention to the plot there was a reason that the script and leo dicaprio werent nominated for an oscar they sucked this film won the best picture oscar by popular demand of teen girls not on its own merits it is the worst best picture winner ever and is good deal crappier than many films that werent even nominated put this dud in space and youve got armageddon feh,sad
i must be the only person on earth who hated this movie it was long and boring if you can stand sitting for 3 and a half hours just watching leonardo dicaprio complain because hes in love with a girl thats too classy for him then this is the movie for you the only reason this made so much money was because of that dicaprio guy and not the fact it was a good movie if you want to see a good movie that involves a ship sinking at the end watch jaws at least that had excitement i have to say this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen ,sad
i really cant understand what anyone saw in this movie everyone talked about how great it was but it was just three hours of my life i want back the love story was pointless and just plain annoying the only decent part is the actual scenes where the boat is sinking however i would much rather watch a documentary about the than to ever watch this movie again this is one of the last movies i would want to see as the number one money maker of all time my score 2 out 10,sad
blech this movie cheapens both hollywood and the audience in fact all it needed was the backstreet boys or one of their equally talentless clones to make it the perfect piece of preadolescent garbagequalities 1 the sets and costumes 2 kathy bates although she is wastedflaws 1 the single worst script ever written for a period film the dialogue seems akward for the 1990s let alone the 1910s 2 the paraacting i say paraacting because in some places i am fairly sure that in some seens somebody just picked up a cardboard cutout of leo and shook it around 3 special effects the boat was great but was not simulated watch it again and you will see how poorly the blue screening is done you can actually see that peoples faces have been pasted onto dummies in spots almost as poorly done as that awful micheal keaton snowman movie 4 story how cliched can a movie get charming poor boy rescues rich disillusioned young rich lady betrothed to obnoxious rich man gee how original i also found it amusing that the cpt chose to remain on in the movie when last i heard he got into a lifeboat in real life 5 that miserable old lady why does everyone applaud old ladies who show emotions in movies they cant help they are covered with wrinkles she couldnt act her way out of her own walker 6 the earringif you wish to direct a bitter response to me please stick it in your a anyone who disagrees with me is either still prepubescent or really needs to develop some emotional stability,sad
striking motion picture in every department from the stunning visual effects right down to gloria stuarts wonderful performance of an aged survivor of the 1912 disaster where over 1500 lives were lost winner 11 academy awards including the best picture of 1997 what else can be saidother than masterpiece,sad
this is one of the best movies i have ever seen i went into the theater thinking this is going to be just another disaster movie but was totally bowled over by what i witnessed as the huge liner was breaking apart it was as though i were sitting in a smaller vessel nearby observing the entire ordeal the camera work was as realistic as could be expected the acting was very good the script completely believable it was the epitome of savage action wondrous romance and heartbreaking loss this film will remain one of my all time favorites from now on,sad
what is so great about this movie that it made so much money we will never know but all the hype about the real during that time sure helped it but looking behind the hype and the historical reference what do we have really just another fictional love story between two characters that nobody could identify with cmon if it were a story of my real life i wouldnt want dicapprio to star in it he is a one dimensional actor with no real talent just a pretty face which only a teenage girl or a confused homo would fall in love with the other actors were too transparent and unreal james cameron was smart using such a clever background and special effects ive seen it only once in video to see what was all about and fell asleep thru the first 212 hours of it the only good scenes were the sinking of the ship why such a crappy movie made so much money i ill never know but it tells me a lot of the american way of life here an oscar for that where were la confidential good will hunting amistad british controlled oscar board of directorsbah,sad
not only was the plot dodgy at best but the actors was wooden the effects shoody to say they cost millions and the background looked like it was painted on how on earth would kate winslets character ever have fallen for that excuse for an actor dicaprio,sad
terrible  bad actors besides kathy bates  way too overrated  the worst plot  just urgh  no stars  0 out of 10  kathy bates saved the movie  i cant believe it won al those oscars no way  it won as much as ben hur and ben hur was way better,sad
this is not a film this is a life experience simply the best picture ever made nothing can top it my absolutely favorite movie by far,sad
there are only lifeboats for half the people yea the better halfthe segregation oppression and unenlightened separation of the privileged few from the unkempt unwashed masses is the dramatic thread that seems to be the soul of this bloated overwritten orally deficient melodrama it is completely counterpointed by the very last scene an antithesis of the socially conscious concern of the film makersit is morally reprehensible irresponsible incomprehensible and downright selfish one wonders how many underprivileged children with empty bellies and deplorable living conditions could have been saved by that megamillion dollar necklace all for a cheap sentimental tugsome interesting special effects attractive people and unintentional humor are not enough to redeem this unforgivable utter failure of a film that can only be subjugated to the lower decks of american cinema,sad
when was released for the first time back in 1997 it became a cultural phenomenon for 12 years it was the highest grossing film in history winner of 11 academy awards turned leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet into huge movie stars and made my heart will go on sung by celine dion a romantic anthemhowever with the passing of the years being a fan of became the equivalent of having bad taste and poor judgment in films i personally disagree with this highly subjective assessment since is the best example of how to make a sweeping epic like those that used to be made in hollywoods golden agethus james cameron uses the tragic sinking of the ship that not even god could sink to tell the already iconic love story between rose dewitt bukater the american girl betrothed to a steel tycoon whom does not love and jack dawson the aspiring artist who has traveled the world in search of his identity becomes a desperate struggle to survive once the ship hits an iceberg and is destined to sink this aspect of the movie has always been criticized as cameron chooses to tell a fictional story instead of focusing on one of the many true stories of the passengers this is a risky decision that pays off due to camerons ability to associate reality and fiction respecting the historical perspective the chemistry between dicaprio and winslet and the unexpected sensitivity with which cameron tells a love story something unusual for him given his previous experience in science fiction movies it could even be said that without jack and rose the film wouldnt have had the same impact and successthis does not diminish at all the impressive historical recreation not only of the for which an almost exact replica of the original boat had to build but the period in general and this is not limited to costumes and scenery but also in the notes on the differences between social classes existing in the early twentieth century and decadence disguised as opulence which unfortunately have not changed much todaythe sinking of the has been told numerous times in film and on tv but james camerons version has become the obligatory reference not only for the reasons already mentioned but also for the incredible realism and technical accuracy this is portrayed achieving really shocking moments and scenes of high emotional impact that are not quite successful on other versions and that make us partakers of such tragedy as if we were watching it live this is due to the use cameron makes of digital technology without being overwhelmed by it since he understands that digital effects must serve the story and not vice versaspecial mention to the brief but poignant appearance of gloria stuart as old rose who serves as the narrator of the story and gives consistency to the story as well gives it humanity and warmthhas not only withstood the test of time but also the unflattering trials of those who call themselves connoisseurs of good cinema and remains one of the greatest epic films ever made,sad
this is my absolute favorite movie of all time i loved how cameron put a fictional story to have a tiein with the reallife tragedy of the rms sinking the acting from all those in it is superb billy zane plays cal brilliantly leo di caprio is one of the greatest actors in the world and who better to play rose than kate winslet all in all this film is a must see again and again and again i watch at least once a week and twice on sunday never ceases to amaaaazeyou say there are other good movies out there i dont think so some people like lawrence of arabia but i think it is far too dry who wants to watch a movie set in a desert it would have been much better if they had attacked damascus from the sea pass the beeri liked the burning of atlanta in gone with the wind and the score was pretty good but there were no words what this film needs is a theme song and a hot love scene this is a romance margaretnow casablanca is a film with a good theme song but theres not much of a plot can anyone remember the point of this movie it just meanders along like no one knew what the ending was going to bewhats with that long bus ride in it happened one night and then all we get to see is clark gable taking off his shirt boringall the presidents men has some strong performances by robert redford and dustin hoffman but the guy who plays richard nixon doesnt look anything like him the president was kind the president was understanding and the president was smart too smart to get caught up bugging the democrat headquarters totally unbelievable storyline the wizard of oz has some nice singing by judy garland but the cgi is pretty weak those muchkins dont look realistic at all my fair lady has some good music but the sets and costumes are pretty pathetic didnt look like london at all looked more like disneylandrebecca has a pretty good plot and a nice fire but they seemed to have left out one little tiny detail what was the name of his second wife sloppy writing daphnenorth buy northwest has some amusing chase scenes and some clever dialog but it is soooo predictable totally lacking in suspenseok psycho has some suspense even if it is short on dialog but it is so flat now this is a film that needs to be redone in 3d das boot is long and boring sure it is realistic and life aboard a submarine is boring but it needs some excitement maybe they could steal an enigma machine back from the british or discover an underwater atlantis or hit an iceberg or something anything to relieve the monotony i know maybe they could dive through a wormhole and accidentally shoot a torpedo into the or better yet the californian so there you have it is without doubt the greatest masterpiece of cinema ever made period,sad

this film shares a lot of parallels with the legendary gone with the wind it is a romantic spectacle set against the backdrop of historical events and became both a huge oscarwinning success and the surprise box office behemoth of its era another similarity it shares with the former is that following the success it is now considered hip to be derogatory and dismiss it as a hollywood film it is a hollywood film but not in the insulting manner that detractors would indicate it is a sublime demonstration of what can happen when a visionary director puts his reputation on the line and uses the limits of what hollywood has to offer to bring it to the screenthe film opens in present day with a group of scientific treasure hunters exploring the remains of the sunken in an effort to locate a priceless necklace instead they find a preserved portrait of a young woman the elderly woman rose gloria stuart is located and brought to the site to relate her story of the last days of the and the film unfolds it is a familiar romantic tale with richinnameonly rose now played by kate winslet betrothed against her will to a boorish millionaire in a fit of pique she contemplates suicide and is talked out of it by charming penniless artist jack dawson leonardo dicaprio during the remainder of the illfated voyage they fall in love and incur the wrath of her fianc and her mother until the fateful iceberg and destiny in the icy waters of the north atlantic intervenethere are so many ways that the film could have gone wrong but director james cameron wisely sidesteps them much of the fuel used by the detractors of the film would have turned it into an infinitely weaker production evidence of camerons sure narrative hand can be found in numerous spots starting the film with the treasure hunters provides for a brilliant moment which allows them to recreate on a computer the death throes of the so that when the final 90 minutes begin the viewer is completely aware of why certain things are occurring as they do it also offers a wonderful opportunity for 1930s film star gloria stuart to show her acting chops as the latter day rosecameron also gives us a strong scope of the immensity of the great ship herself as well as the class differentiation in the status of the clientele traveling therein much has been made of centering the film on the two characters of jack and rose while having the remainder of the cast play support rather than spread the wealth around more one could and has done that it is called the poseidon adventure the reason why this film works on so many levels is because it is far more than the standard disaster epic the fact that the action is basically consolidated through the eyes of young lovers streamlines the film and keeps the action focused and cameron comes up with increasingly inventive ways to move them through different parts of the ship to cover as much action as possible the fact that they are young lovers experiencing their first romance provides a vitality and sense of urgency that may have been missing from older protagonists many have sneered over much the jack rose jack dialog interaction in the climactic moments as a lack of good writing but given that we are talking about teenage lovers in serious peril one wonders if people expected them to quote intellectual diatribes back and forth instead what comes from their mouths is far more likely and believable if repetitive further look at how often cameron takes the narrative high road when jack is invited by the rich people to join them for dinner for saving rose early in the film he could have punctured the egos of the rich and wowed rose with his coarseness instead he behaves in a totally mature fashion and ends up charming the majority of those at their table the film is brimming with memorable sequences including the highly sensual moment when rose invites jack to draw her portrait or the much parodied scene of the two lovers embracing at the front of the ship as it skims the water for detractors that claim that the special effects involving the sinking of the save the film it makes their argument untenable when so many audiences have already been won over long before the sinking begins the climactic moments are intense heartbreaking and unforgettablethe majority of the films success aside from cameron must be attributed to the leads i would never have previously cast them as a couple but dicaprio and winslet have chemistry not just any chemistry but the chemistry of which cinematic legends are made winslet provides a warm sympathetic and resonant presence throughout the film portraying a character that proves much stronger than even she initially believes she draws you into the action and her final moments rank as some of her best acting conversely although i admit dicaprio is a good actor i am not usually much of a fan here i cannot see anyone else in this role it is a distinct departure from anything else that he has attempted and he has no acting hook on which to hinge his work playing a largerthanlife character that clicks with the audience is one of the trickiest obstacles but when rose declares that he saved me in every way that a person can be saved dicaprio makes you believe it the fact that he makes it appear so effortless probably resulted in his oscar nomination snub but the truth is that he is definitely the worthy gable to winslets leigh,sad
i gave this film a bad review on imdb in 2002 i deleted my review today  mainly because i dont agree with it anymore in fact im not so sure i totally agreed with it when i wrote it i felt an obligation to hate this movie because people who like it are typically made fun of but i have to admit i do like it yes the romantic subplot is silly to the extent that jack would never find himself anywhere near rose to begin with but you know what the romance provides a nice outlet through which to frame the actions of the sinking a threehour movie about random people on a boat thats going to sink would be a true bore james cameron  despite his personal flaws  is a great storyteller and by focusing on characters before heading on to the carnage he builds a relationship with the viewer think of any good historical movie  apart from a few films such as the longest day most of the time theres a story taking place around the eventas for  some people will feel offended some people will hate the romantic subplot and find the entire thing unbearably hokey some people will make fun of leonardo dicaprio although thankfully that phase seems to have passed and he now demands more respect as an actor and some people will just fastforward to the end so they can see the sink and im really hoping that wasnt a spoiler for anyone  because if it was you need to go take a middle school history course againthe acting isnt bad leonardo dicaprio picked up a lot of misery for his acting here but hes gone on since to prove like johnny depp that hes more than just a pretty face his performances in films such as the aviator and catch me if you can echo his early work in whats eating gilbert grape  hes one of this generations finest actors its no wonder scorsese enjoys working with him so much it may almost seem absurd to even make this comparison but after some of his recent films dicaprio has struck me as another robert de niro he has the talent and the intelligence its a shame the success of pushed him back for a few yearskate winslet on the other hand is a nice contrast against dicaprio however i didnt totally buy their romance at all times and theyre not the best screen couple in cinema history by any means meanwhile in the villain department billy zane is for once not baldif you dont think youll like it you probably wont its one of those films that people either love or hate if you didnt like braveheart theres a good chance youll hate this as wellif you can watch it with an open mind however and accept its romantic angle you may enjoy it,sad
there is more wrong with this film than anyone could possibly say i honestly dont know where to begin romance is bad reasons1i am not the most knowledgeable person when it comes to romance but isnt there more to it than nude portraits and life saving also where is the attraction to a guy that looks like a woman yes leonardo dicrapio acts a little effeminately to be loved as jack dawson our socalled hero or at least i think that is what everyone thought he was he isnt at all and you know why it is simply because that if rose dawson played badly by kate winslet ill explain later hadnt known him she would have gone home happily without losing anyone close to her and she wouldnt have jumped no way would she and if she had at least the film would have been over quicker and also he is totally repulsive especially to the male half of the audience i mean really who is this film for2 attraction i dont know how each character was attracted to each other how can jack be attracted to rose when she is spitting over the side of the ship thats disgusting even for me never mind an effeminate person like him also if its true love why didnt rose make more room on the floating door which she couldve done easily he might have lived if she had heck even jim carrey spotted that in the film bruce almighty acting reasons why it is also crap1 winslet acts like a snob for the first part and then like a tramp would anybody demote themselves like this when the kid drowned in the corridor and when she fell off the side of the boat she hardly screamed why some say she was strong peh almost everyone would have screamed in those situations i have no idea what her face expression and posture was meant to say when leo was arrested for possessing the planted diamond i think she was upset maybe angry maybe about ready to laugh i do not know she had no expression2 leo was the same no expression cameron directed people to act like gormless puppets one face for every situation totally unrealistic 3 roses family of snobs were stereotypical i dont like the stereotype at all snobs are not just moneygrabbers i am not particularly rich but id like to be with the way that each stereotype acted it seemed that the poor wanted to stay poor and the rich wanted to be richer i dont think people really act like this the directing is bad reasons1 james cameron couldnt direct traffic his style is crap and revolves around two kind of people a people who have one prime desire and nothing else and this doesnt remotely resemble reality at all  b the other group are people who have one stereotyped personality these are mainly snobs the poor and the ship staff james cameron should have worked to establish more realism within his characters only kathy bates can be praised for achieving this2 the special effects are too lavish the boat is too glammed up and anyone who says the boat looks real is a total moron a film needs to be more than special effects he could have worked a little harder on the acting instead3 camerons camera shots were mediocre to say the least a few shots that were particularly bad include the one where he shows us the whole ship from far out i do not know what he was trying to achieve my guess is that he was trying to show us how isolated the ship was but this is pointless as we already knew it was isolated you cant get more isolated in the middle of the atlantic ocean another example of camera shots is to do with the exchange of angles he too often flickers back from person to person why cant he keep the camera in one place he may as well have pointed it at the moon thats more interesting than a random mess of pictures bad plot reasonsit is meant to be roses story and i think it should have only included her accounts but instead it had bits that made no sense such as1the two old people cuddling getting ready to die 2plates falling from shelves 3the captain drowning on the bridge 4the dome shatters and everyone inside drowns these events are shown yet in accordance to where rose is during the film it doesnt make sense that she should have known about these things why add bits my guess is to add to the sentimentality and drama but the overall realism and straightforwardness is lost thanks to this boy i hate this film oscars it shouldnt have won a single solitary thing never mind 11 there are flaws bigguns no denying it really it is totally true that almost every aspect could have been cleaned up considerablyi dont care what anyone says i find it unbearable to watch this garbage there is a lot more than this wrong with this diabolical film but i have a 1000 word limit so all i can really say to conclude is that this film for me if not for you  sank,sad
1997  leonardo di caprio kate winslet bill paxton gloria stuart kathy bates billy zane suzi amis frances fisher victor garber david warner the most expensive film ever made and worth every penny some 200 million that now ranks the international blockbuster box office champ in cinema history 600 million plus  filmmaker james camerons labor of love and exquisite depiction and detail obsession pays off in a monumental way in his fictional account of the infamoustragic maiden and doomed final voyage of the ss focusing on starcrossed lovers di caprio in his starconfirming turn as a steerage passenger and winslet as a very proper young lady engaged to wealthy cad zane all by the way perfect facing the ultimate tale of survival as the vast ship of luxury and riches slowly begins to sink thanks to its fated collision with an iceberg in the north seaseamlessly edited footage of actual size set of the vessel digital computer generated effects and visuals of the remains of the real at the bottom of the ocean eerily woven into a tapestry of visceral impact and execution the last third of the film of the sinking mostly in real time is unforgettable cameron pulls off the impossible with perfection despite the odds of being lambasted for the largesse of the films budget ironically like the own criticism for size over substance an instant classic that won oscars for best picture director editing sound sound effects editing art direction cinematography dramatic score visual effects costume design and for the ubiquitous yet stirring best song my heart will go on sung by celine dion a near sweep it lost screenplay actress and supporting actress but not bad 11 out of 14,sad
i hated this film it didnt have one single exciting part the thing that made this movie so lame is that weather you are 100 or 1 you knew exactly what was going to happen and those are the boring kind of movies,sad
after hearing all the praise got from loads of people i knew i was expecting a half decent film instead i got bad acting unbelievable characters and a story which made no sense i will come back to this i couldnt belive how fake kate and leo were they were rubbish i spent half the film laughing at the awful script im on top of the world was perhaps the funniest line the story itself was the strangest thing about the film we are apparently being told the film through roses eyes yep but half the time we are seeing things that rose didnt see herself my skin crawls every time some teenager states this as their all time favourite film,sad
the effects were good i can understand it winning those i could see it breaking 100million the budget was preposterous epsode 1 did more and it cost about half as muchthe acting sucked and the plot was little more than brainless teen i wanna see leo nekky fodder these teeny boppers who saw it seven or eight times in theaters i saw it in theaters once and felt ashamed that i helped it overthrow star wars from the top spot look at the math if every tb who saw it more than once saw it only once the movie would have lost roughly half its business putting it a mere 300 million and ranking about 5 instead of 1,sad
watching this movie disturbed me for a number of reasons i wasnt going in expecting terminator 3 but i was expecting an intelligent epic romance instead it seemed like i was sitting in a seat that was reserved for a 14 year old girl and i felt very out of my elementand sleepyvery sleepysecondly i was disturbed by the casting dicaprio  winslet seemed a very unlikely and awkward match dicaprio seemed much younger and muchsmaller than grownup sized winslet the romance was weak cheezy over dramatic and poorly justifiedbut like i mentioned there is a special effects pay off at the end for the guys,sad
this may contain spoilers although nothing i say could spoil any further this utterly shoddy and offensive piece of junk anymore than many of the comments already on this site this films stinks from bow to stern the banal and predictable dialogue and plot are only matched by its crass stupidity in the ludicrous national stereotyping jolly oirish down in steerage begorrah moustache twirling english villains and heroic yanks yawn so far so predictable and in itself would make for a comedically bad film however i found the persistent national stereotyping became more offensive as the film went on and came to head as the boatand the film finally sank im sure i wasnt the only one hoping an albatross would drop something unpleasant on kate winslet as she stood on the front of the ship in that buttock clenchingly corny scene the only thing i found moving was the bile in my stomach unfortunately some gullible people will take this as a historical document it is not go and see a night to remember instead,sad
first of all with a name like you would expect there to be a lot of titties but there were only about 3 or 4 and were talking about a 3 hour movie so 1 tittie per hour is not good i dont know what this movie was aboutmaybe a ship or something but if this movie was about a ship that sank why didnt they just call this movie the ship that sank and caused everybody to drown or get frozen this movie should have been called titlessanic if i wanted to see a religious film i would just go fall asleep at church like i usually do the only good part was that very feminine lady actress who played jack dawson,sad
because imdb has too many fanboys who think batman should be the top rated film of alltime movies like titantic will never succeed here great storytelling a historical background good acting excellent directing great special effects and a beautiful soundtrack titantic won all those oscars and is the highest grossing film of alltime i dont think anyone involved with it will lose any sleep on how its rated at this site i loved it when it came out and still watch it a lot its the type of film that makes being a movie fan a joy its film making at its best and no moron trying to put it down will ever change that,sad
mills  boon on a boat still love leonardo though,sad
like a great iron sphinx on the ocean floor the faces still toward the west interrupted forever on its only voyage we see it in the opening shots of encrusted with the silt of 85 years a remotecontrolled tv camera snakes its way inside down corridors and through doorways showing us staterooms built for millionaires and inherited by crustaceansmovies like this are not merely difficult to make at all but almost impossible to make well the technical difficulties are so daunting that its a wonder when the filmmakers are also able to bring the drama and history into proportion i found myself convinced by both the story and the saga the setup of the love story is fairly routine but the payoffhow everyone behaves as the ship is sinkingis wonderfully written as passengers are forced to make impossible choices even the villain played by zane reveals a human element at a crucial moment despite everything damn it all he does love the girlthe image from the that has haunted me ever since i first read the story of the great ship involves the moments right after it sank the night sea was quiet enough so that cries for help carried easily across the water to the lifeboats which drew prudently away still dressed up in the latest fashions hundreds froze and drowned what an extraordinary position to find yourself in after spending all that money for a ticket on an unsinkable shipwwwflickstreecom has provided us a platform for all the movie lovers to get them movie online for free,sad
this is just like every other romance movies boy and girl fall in love their family wont let them marry each other they eloped boy dies from a tragedy girl cries havent we already seen movies like this and the fact that this clich and mediocre film received a sload of oscar nomination proves how dumb oscar become the only reason this movie made a sload of money in box office is because of these girl teenagers seems to me hollywood is making rehash films just like this movie make up something original for f sake dont end up like bollywood that makes rehash films over and over again if you dont then i might lose faith in you just like with bollywood,sad
i gave it a 10 out of 10 because it deserves it this legendary title came out when i was 1 year old i didnt get to watch its premiere in the cinema sad case my parents have told me several times how good it was and my mom had watched it 3 timeswhen the 3d version came out my family and i watched it together and its really awesome i could hardly believe they could make such a good film in 1990s the special effects the technology are just unbelievably goodon the other hand the actors are real awesome leonardo dicaprio one of my favorite male actors he did a marvelous job in the movie he has such good acting at his age hes the best actor in the film imono matter how good the film is dont watch it twice in a week i went to watch it again with my friends and its just too boringseriously i could clearly remember the whole story and what would happen nextso overall its a mustwatch film i cant really understand why its not in the imdb top 250 its unacceptable seriously its a legend man i understand when there are lovers there will be hatersthis movie has a overall rating of 76 at this moment which is too low for a legendary film like this even some pure action film can get 8 ratings nowadayswatch it and youll know what a 1010 movie should be one of the legendary movies,sad
i cant understand why it isnt on imdbs top 250 list it was the best movie of the 90s without a doubt it was such a mesmerizing film that we are still talking about it after having been shot 16 years ago it was a very emotional movie and my eyes sometimes filled with tears i dont know how many times i have watched it but whenever i watch it i am impressed especially with the scene where jack dies and the scene where rose throws the necklace into the sea it merges both the mind and the heart also the music was so perfect that you may even burst into tears just by listening to the music itself what i loved most about it was the script method and the way of reminding us of the we saw old rose at first then she began to explain all she knew about the that was the time when we got a chance to compare the which sank to the which lives in roses mind on the screen fantastic to all those who criticize the movie for being nothing more than a love story i dont know if this love story is true but everybody knows that a lot of people on that ship who loved each other died didnt they so the good script and the good acting performances have made the movie reflect the tragedy so well it is absolutely commendable to be able to create such memorable characters congratulations to cameron for such a great performance as a writer and as a director,sad

i know in advance this review is not going to be popular but it is my honest opinion for what its worth this is not a review of the 3d versionthe final hour of this movie is incredibly captivating the effects are astonishing the human drama endlessly gripping and the horror of the terrible tragedy deeply moving and powerful direction by james cameron is impeccable he thoroughly deserved his oscar the film looks wonderful and the music score is marvellousbut is it really such a classic i think not personally a night to remember may have dated effectswise but it tells the story of the in a superior way to this movie the big problem for me is the script which for the most part i think is quite poor cameron lifts whole segments from a night to remember inserts dialogue from the testimonies given during the enquiry into the cause of the disaster and alters history in a way that must have been quite shocking to the descendants of those involved officer murdoch for instance he did not shoot two passengers nor is it very likely he committed suicide murdochs decision to reverse the engines when the iceberg was spotted probably caused the disaster  titantic would have missed it had the full ahead order been given even a noseon impact would not have sunk the ship but there is no evidence whatsoever murdoch who distinguished himself in the aftermath of the accident committed suicide just a few passenger rumours that one of the officers shot himselfkate and leo nice acting from kate dicaprio is simply too young for the man of the world artist he has matured into a very fine actor but the romance never convinces me for an instant far too much time is spent on it with the result that the story of the is sort of shoehorned into the movie in a series of brief sequences the whole question of the californian is omitted to give kate and leo more screen time and the carpathia barely appears lightollers remarkable escape is hardly referenced and here the brave but slightly misguided officer comes across as panicky and arrogant very unfair indeedthe result is rather fake emotionalism and moonshine rather like avatar in fact although admittedly is a better moviesome of the acting in this movie is also very poor billy zane is quite awful as cal he gives a performance that would do dick dastardly proud all he really needed was a few moustache twirls and evil titters onedimensional character one dimensional acting excellent actors like kathy bates bernard hill and david warner are wasted in this moviethe film has much to commend it but my honest assessment is that it also has a lot of flaws time for you to mark me down ,sad
this is without question one of the most overblown movies of the last twenty years this is a romantic retelling of the infamous sinking and who do we have as stars two pretty people leo and kate who will never be compared to clark and vivian but nobodys perfectthis is a real hit and miss film the cons are just huge the framing story is completely unnecessary the story is so stilted and the whole setup prior to the climax is just boring not really helping matters is that the love story seems recycled from a lifetime tv moviethe pros are minor but save it from complete disaster the ship sinking climax is very well done and loaded with tension some of the cast members do very well a good example being victor garber as the kindly thomas andrews but i think special mention should go to david warner as the cruel valet spicer lovejoy warner steals every scene hes in and his death scene at the ship splitting is simply pricelessalthough it doesnt hold up particularly well and is certainly no masterpiece its ok overall,sad
kate winslet eternal sunshine of the spotless mind stars as rose a young rich lady who travels on the the boat which is destined to change human kind for ever as it sets sail in 1912 the story is told from an older roses point of view as she experiences life on the unsinkable ship meeting jack dawson leo di caprio  gangs of new york this charming romantic tale brings out a heartwarming story of young love with an unmissable endingwinner of 11 oscars david camerons is a wonderful tale of two young people who meet and begin to learn about life in different ways from one another winslet and di caprio are perfect as the two characters from the wealthy and stubborn rose to the relaxed and positive jack audiences can appreciate each characters different backgrounds and engage more into their lives the characters are well developed in this film giving the film more depth di caprio and winslet have good on screen chemistry making the film engaging and light heartedmany critics have argued its predictability and its clichs but with a film like this you have to look past them to the depth and control of the power of the characters and the surroundings in which they find themselvesthe ending for me was really powerful and difficult to watch i was close to tears however it is a must watch as the film delivers twist after twist in a powerful climaxits a very good film and one of the best love stories of all time,sad
i bought a new laptop this week busy configuring all the software i pulled down a dvd from my collection to check out the movie player program the dvd that i happened to grab wasome three hours plus later instead of just testing the software id watched the whole movie again id cheered inwardly when rose spat in cals face and cried openly in all the same places as i had when id first seen it 10 years ago on the big screenits not perfect of course nothings perfect bill paxton is hopelessly wooden the odd line of dialogue grates terribly but as a classic piece of storytelling it succeeds magnificently,sad
mea culpa i had not watched the film till this week but i finally sat down and watched it over two nights i know that aficionados will be picking the movie apart for any mistakes and for me thats not important i dont care enough about the ship and its history to worry about such matters i just enjoyed the drama for what it was even if it was weaving quite a bit of the story out of thin airthe visual impact of the film is very powerful with the sets giving the viewer the believable impact of watching the real thing the original ship the special effects were as good as ive ever seen again the way the ship moved looked like flooded broke apart all those things looked very real to my eyesthe dramatic love affair is of course the hook that grabs you and it is hard not to be carried away into the sadness without your heart feeling like it has been hurt it is a very sad story even if it is made up i dont know and dont care if it is there is enough tragedy in the real story of so many people freezing to death in the frigid north atlantic or drowning for one to feel sad just as a drama i found it very entertaining and emotionally effective kate winslett is gorgeous sexy and wonderful to watch i have noticed in almost all the films ive seen with herthat she fills up the screen with a great deal of light not only is she beautiful she exudes youth and energy and in this film she is a delight to behold leonardo di caprio is wonderful and i have yet to see him in a film that i wasnt captivated he is like johnny depp a delight to watch this is a film with a large cast especially the many stunt actors who must have really suffered a lot of hours in cold water its a larger than life story and the film delivers well worth the 11 oscars excellent and im really glad to have finally seen it a keepsake this is what blockbusters are supposed to be like,sad
oh the best movie ever the best of the best acting wonderful costumes and sets the songs make part of the movie the best they fit in perfectly im a fan of this kind of movie everything was just simply beautiful i recommend this to everyone who ever lived it doesnt get corny like other love stories do the trauma and tragedy makes the movie have suspense will rose and jack live or die youll be asking yourself the whole time i just simply loved every bit of itgood job kate winslet and leonardo dicapromonica ,sad
contains spoilerseveryone predicted disaster for prior to its release however contrary to what people anticipated went on to capture the hearts and imagination of the world the immense success of resulted in many thinking is now overrated and some have gone as far to claim is the worst movie ever created this backlash against is primarily driven by one of two factors jealously and many becoming tired ofmania accompanied by a desire to be different from the norm obviously these reasons cloud the judgment of most of its critics and i plan to set the record straight when was released the world was in the first years of the internet craze everyone was becoming desensitized to human tragedy and was wasting their lives away online however when was released it struck a cord with the entire planet it reminded everyone that any day could be your last and that you must live each day to the fullest this is primarily what captivated the hearts and minds of the entire world was released at the very moment the world needed a realitycheck it showed us through this brilliantly crafted film that there is still a need for love and compassion and that our world is still filled with human tragedy not just computers for that alone this movie must go down in history as one of the greatest movies ever created another primary reason why is a phenomenal film is the wellacted love story between jack and rose the love story created an emotional doorway to the tragedy that occurred that night as a viewer you began to care for the characters through this you felt the feelings of those who lost their lives and loved ones on this fatal shipwreck having these lovers come from different social classes also allowed the viewers to see the mentality of 1912 through two different perspectives it gave the audience insight into how man thought they were above mother nature how women were expected to behave and how lower classes were treated inhumanly the love story was crucial to telling the full story of has several others qualities that set it apart from other films firstly the amazing music which set the tone for each scene perfectly secondly the outstanding cinematography that gave a variety of different angles shown in a unique fashion which thus allowed you to feel that you were actually aboard the ship thirdly the impeccable sets and costumes gave an extremely authentic feel to the movie fourthly included many interesting facts throughout the film such as not having enough lifeboats for all its passengers increasing more speed regardless of ice warnings telling us how many people were saved from the freezing waters and other numerous facts and figures finally the ending tied everything together perfectly with rose doing everything she promised jack and eventually dying warm in her bed while her soul returns to camerons film was flawless for it blended past and present perfectly while telling the story of in its entirety this film deserves the 11 oscars it received including best picture and achieving the worldwide position of the 3rd highest grossing film of all time inflation included those who tell you is undeserving are flat out wrong revived what was lacking in the new age of the internet and reminded us that we must make each and every day count,sad

i love the its simply the best movie ever im a total buff and i just love the way james cameron portrays the i always cry whenever i see it even though ive seen it probably hundreds of times before its a magnificent movie and it was 1 in the box office for 3 months straight if you havent seen it youre missing out on a lot a bit of trivia in the movie when jack draws rose the hands are those of james cameron the director and drawer of the picture when jack mentions ice fishing to rose it cant be possible the reason why is because he mentions a manmade lake in wisconsin that wasnt built until 1918 after the sank,sad
if any movie deserved to win an all time best movie ever in the history of the world it should be this one when i saw it the very first time i cried my eyes out even now when i watch it for the thousandth time i cry just as hard i couldnt even imagine how rose must have felt throughout the whole movie i know i certainly couldnt have handled even half the stuff she went through i wish everyone in the world could see this i think this movie really brings up a crucial point uphow far or to what extent would you go for someone you loved would you give up a seat on the last lifeboat just to be with someone you loved would u risk losing everything you had money family even a rich husband to be with someone u loved like rose didi recommend this movie for all married couples dating couples or even a girls sleepover,sad
when i first saw this film i absolutely loved it as i got carried away with the fantastic special effects good acting and great soundtrack however in order to realise what this film is truly about you have to watch it at least twice in order to understand that this film is a load of ignorant and political nonsense first of all the storyline was completely ridiculous and unreal the fact that a hoodlum vagrant like jack dawsonleonardo dicaprio could possibly seduce a highly sophisticated lady such as kate winsletrose de witt bukater is impossible having a fling with him is possible but to have left her successful rich fianc billy zane caledon hockley for jack dawson would never happen in real life second of all this film had untrue facts to what really happened at the tragedy and its main focus was to praise the irish and to racistly put down the british the fact that the british boat loader gunneddown the irish hoodlum never actually happened in history as that man was a hero not a murderer also the fact that the british racistly locked the irish in the third class section when the was sinking was untrue to the way it was portrayed yes the third class section was probably locked up in the basement when the was sinking however it was a class issue not a racist issue there were just as many european and british people in the third class section as there were irish and many irish people in the first and second class section as well so the fact that the third class people were locked up in the basement because they were irish was completely nonfactual besides which statistics show that more irish people survived the disaster than any other nationality on that boatlast of all for james cameron to write and direct a love story based on the tragedy is totally insensitive and disrespectful to the victims family and descendants of the tragedy theres nothing wrong with making a film based on the disaster but to make a fictional romantic love story on the disaster is completely wrong whats next  james cameron directing a romantic love story about a couple who fell in love in the new york twin towers911 disaster on the day it collapsed with people jumping out of windows with heartfelt music in the background and hitting the ground now that would be truly sick anyway if youve never seen this film and would like to see it i suggest you view it at least twice as thatll be the only way youll truly understand the real meaning of the film,sad
i went to see this movie after hearing only rave reviews and good things about it  i thought it must be an unbelievable movie  i was in for a surprisemany people still believe that is the best film ever made  its not a particularly bad filmthe acting is good and its arguably well directed the first half of the movie the set up of the love triangle is semiinteresting but then the second half is different  they try to make you really care about jack and rose and want them to live through the inevitable sinking of the ship  thats one thing that bothers me about true stories you already know whats going to happen  the acting was decent but the characters were not written deeply enough for me to really care whether or not they die  the second half of the movie is the ship sinking  amazing effects on this half  i guess it did a good job of showing how horrible it must have been to be there and it was meant to be suspenseful and maybe even scary but i actually got bored  the audience was already aware that a lot of people were going to die but the movie spends about an hour showing the many different ways the sinking of the could have killed someone  i remember watching the academy awards and thinking well is going to win and everyone else already knew this but almost everyone agrees with the academys choice  there were many great movies that year la confidential and good will hunting were both better movies than this was in my opinion  just didnt hold my interest the way many many other movies have  so if you are easily impressed and not a big movie watcher then youll probably enjoy this movie  but to me it was the most disappointing movie ever,sad
seriously this could not have made that much money it is one of the worst movies i have seen not the worst though it is very over rated though there isnt much to this movie and story line is sooooo corny rose dewitt bukater kate winslets character is to me a floozy the only good part was when they were all dying that was funny otherwise this isnt a romantic movie romeo and juliet even though they both die is romantic but this is not it is an exploitation of the disaster and that is it want to watch a real movie watch american beauty or pulp fiction or eyes wide shut or the good the bad and the ugly,sad
okay here it isthe boat sinks  yeah i know you all knew thatoops you didnt  where were you during history class all through your schooling  anyway i must admit that even though i never actually sat down and watched the thing from beginning to end but i work at a video store and i was forced to watch the second tape of the movie for well over 28 days in a row the 1st tape was not viewed so as not to offend any customers during the scene where we were all forced to see kate winslets endowments  needless to say when we finally were allowed to remove the now wasted tape from the vcr i took the tape outside and promptly ran over it with my car  it felt so good with that one action i hoped to rid myself of this terrible viral infection brought on by watching this movie too many times i hated the film although i had never really seen it  i had bought a copy of the film before the 28day onslaught but hadnt opened it yet so i decidedly took it back to work with me and traded it for a dvd copy of another movie  i felt no remorse i questioned not my actions  in fact i felt good to know that the movie was no longer in my house earlier in the year 1998 i had to listen to everyone tell me how great it was and how much they loved it and this was okay  i am one of those people that many times dont like a movie just because everyone loved it  my favorites are not the boxoffice hits they are the boxoffice flops movies overlooked because of their lack of appeal to more than one group of people  those are the films that speak the loudest  i had people tell me that they saw eight times  i pointed out that they had spent no less than 60 on admission not including the outrageous prices of popcorn soda and sour patch kids  all they could say was it was worth it man i view myself as a video nut and a video hound and i say no movie is worth paying well over 100 at a movie theatre to see the same movie over and over and over again you all may disagree with me and that is your personal right but you all need to know that there are many of us that dont see what you see in this movieand the only reason i gave it a rating of 2 was for the very welldone special effectsi have to give it at least that much moving along,sad
i cant begin to express how bored i was with this movie its not that it was a poorly made movie i understand the movies appeal to the romantics at heart but that still does not validate it as the best movie of all time it was boring far too long and completely uninteresting ive always thought the movie could have stood on its own as a much more fascinating film if the first half had never been made cameron did a tremendous job of showing the horror and hopelessness the members of the ship felt while the ship was sinking but it took so long to finally arrive at this point in the movie it was almost impossible to get back into it by that time  this movie was thoroughly uninteresting and the only redeeming factor that comforts me is that there will never be a sequel 110,sad
that is by you imdb voters you seem to be the only people in the world to think this movie isnt great this film is a masterpiece which belongs in your top 250 its the only 3 hour  movie that doesnt bore me in fact no one in the cinema seemed bored when i saw it if you think that this movie is silly because of the dialogue its obvious youre all forgetting that this movie was made to entertain its the same thing with star wars its sort of a fable and the dialogue is much cheesier than that of this film it has great music great special effects great sound and fantastic cinematography it was definitely the best picture of 1997 and kate should have won the best actress award,sad
warning may be some small spoilersi have always been a james cameron fan he is really one of the only directors i can say that has never made a bad film even his piranha 2 was humorous and a fine effort coming from such a young director with a small budget he has made from what i can recall two masterpieces aliens and terminator 2 a genre pioneer terminator and one of the best action movies to come out in the 90s  true lies  and an ambitious touching film  the abyss  but now he has outdone himself with i dont think there has ever been a film that has taken me through such a wide array of emotions as this one and that is all attributed to cameron he wrote produced and directed this film and it is one of the best films ever madewe all know the story of a great ship sets sail for the us from the uk and along the way it sinks and many people lost their lives in the atlantic somewhere near newfoundland so there is no need to retell those events documentary style a night to remember is there for that purpose so what camerons does is tells the tale of fictitious characters blended in with real ones amidst the real events of the sinking and it not only makes the film entertaining it shows the sheer horror of what happened that night and makes you more sympathetic to the characters because you spend three hours with them this is a brilliant brilliant filmto start with the actors are perfect not just dicaprio and winslet but everyone from zane and bates right down to paxton as the present day treasure hunter but it is kate winslet and leonardo dicaprio that are the true stars here as it the two of them that have to carry the load and make us care about them and we do we can feel them falling in love we can feel the helpless emotions that jack feels when he is trying to tell rose that he loves her the day of the sinking it is their relationship that is a great strength of the filmnext what has to be mentioned is the score by james horner very few times has a motion picture had a score that symbolized the sheer hopelessness and tragedy that is on screen but here horner has a perfect and somber piece of music that will bring tears to your eyes especially when lives and love are lostalso the whole scope of the film is one of tragedy it is a tragic love story a tragic story of refugees trying to make a better life for themselves and have it all end abruptly with a giant piece of ice it is a sad look at bureaucracy and wealth and how it can manipulate and control many thingsbut most importantly this is a love story and an inspirational tearjerker rose and jack fall fast and hard and it doesnt matter that they are from different worlds love sees no boundaries if it is there nothing can stop it not even deathis perfect in every sense and as a guy it is my duty not to cry in movies i know how ridiculously old fashioned that sounds but it is true we just arent supposed to but i left my testosterone at the door and when i finally let go i found myself brought to tears as the scenes of children clinging for life in the frigid waters would be enough to bring the strongest man to tears cameron has manipulated us to perfection here and even if you find the romance to be embellished which i dont to watch this film and know that this happened is a sad and disturbing reality few films have ever done this to me few have ever made me feel such a connection to the characters does and by the end of the film you feel like you know the people of like they were your long lost relatives and one final note i cant understand how anyone could not enjoy the film thats just me but i know that what moves some does nothing for others but the backlash towards this film is not necessary not every film has to be ramboesque not every film has to be filled with explosions i am not opposed to those films i actually love many of them but i am also prone to well written stories whether they are love stories or not those who criticize this film need to realize that there is a market for this the gross for this film and the demographics it appealed to confirm thatas for the comment made earlier about those of us that enjoyed it being teens and have never seen a film before 1990 well i am 27 my brother is 24 my mom is 50 something and my grandmother is in her 80s and we all loved it so keep that in mind and a film does not gross 2 billion dollars by having only teens see itthis is as good as a film getsone final note the se dvd finally came out and it was worth the wait the transfer is beautiful and if you are like me and love dvds so you can access the special features then this disc is for you the commentary alone by cameron makes the disc worth spending your money on cameron doesnt do a lot of commentaries but the ones he does are perhaps the most insightful commentaries out there he outdoes himself i really recommend everyone who loves this film to get the se dvd and just sti back for 3 hours and listen to what he has to say,sad
this movie might well be the most overrated film of all time  it had a few good points  foremost among which was the cinematography  but these were overshadowed by the shortcomings of the movie and the ludicrous hype that surrounded it  the film is full of stock characters with the stereotypical and cliched jack and rose being the most prominent examples  the entire movie was as predictable as the boat sinking at the end  the dialogue is subpar to say the least  the movie drags on and on forever  the scenes in the present for example were totally superfluous  i remember watching the boat leave dock and staring at my watch not believing that id only been there for half an hour  and then the movie like the boat just kept going  after the ship hits the iceberg the movie improves  it doesnt have time to waste so it cant waste it  even here though there were just a few too many lastminute rescues for my taste this movie tries to attain the epic quality of gone with the wind but it simply cant do it  it has very little substance and lacks the art of that film  an actual classic  if gone with the wind is a bit soapoperatic  a fair criticism i think  then sitting through is like sitting through all 20 years of as the world turns in one sitting  it is not an epic it is simply long  too long and pretentious  this is the ultimate hollywood movie in that it has so little too offer and yet somehow it cleaned up at the oscars wins all kinds of undue praise and heap money on it until it becomes the highestgrossing movie ever  i hope that boxoffice records aside this movie does not remain famous or keep this silly reputation of being a classic  it does not have the quality of any of the great films it is often compared to  it is bigbudget fluff one final point on the voting scale i gave this movie a 1  and i will be honest it is not quite that bad  it could be 2 or even 3 material but the way some people talk about this movie absolutely drives me crazy it is not a great love story it simply imitates a lot of other ones  it is a product  it is a huge studio production without very much heart or brains behind it  i find it very sad the way this movie and its male star who at this very moment is trying to trademark his name have been made into such golden calves  exemplifies the era of bigbudget fluff that presentday moviefans have to deal with  once people stop buying into movies like this actual quality may return to film  i only hope that that day comes soon,sad
very disappointed with this one the worst ever casting simply adds more stupidity to the already thoughtless plot i would expect more from the movie that cost more than 200000000 the special effects are very expensive but primitive and not really necessary for the moviedo not get me wrong the movie is not so bad it is just not worth artwise the money spent on it the movies qualities are of a middle level there are hundreds of movies like this one the only thing that is special here is the budgetbottom line i watched the movie once well almost once it is way too oversized i could not make it through the whole movie and this is enough for me,sad
ive seen quite a lot of movies in my life but stands alone  it is the most amazing beautiful heartbreaking movie ever made  the final scene broke my heart into a thousand pieces  i love this movie very much and always will,sad
i went into this movie knowing what to expect  a long movie with lots of special effects and lots of action and romance  but i never thought id see such terrible acting such terrible scriptwriting and such terribly developed characters in this highly praised winner of several academy awards  hollywood has turned to sensationalism which isnt in itself bad but it has turned its back on creativity  what really was great about this movie  did it need to exist  movies like citizen kane or ran or amadeus are movies that rejoice in the possibilities of human creativity  james cameron made a movie that was filmed superbly with excellent special effects but it is the product of money not spirit  and in our confused world of today the last thing we need is a fake messiah dressed in glittering gold,sad
was an excellent film but definitely not because of anything leo or kate did  they in my opinion were just crowd attraction techniques they could have used anyone for these roles and the movie would have been improvedworsened only slightly  the real reason this movie was excellent was because of jim camerons undying devotion to the projects perfection  he did countless retakes of key scenes got behind the camera himself many times and made sure every part of the movie matched the picture in his mind  he even drew the portraits himself  if all directors would put this much into their films there would be no shortage of quality films as there have been in past years,sad
yes i did see it in the theaters but i was forced that is exactly how this movie made its money crazed teenage girls dont even argue with anyone that says otherwise this is the reason this film was absolutely terrible sure its great for historical reference not try renting the original film it has a much more entertaining and informative story this film rediculous teen movie crap during the time period that this movie came out i must have asked all the girls i could find at one point or another what they would do after school simple answer go see these are people dishing out 8 dollars a day to see a filmnot to mention all the boyfriends that were dragged into theaters kicking and screaming by their girlfriends i know i was one of them the adults tricked into thinking this was an oscar worthy film which it wasnt and the terrible story line how and why did they spend so much money on this film how would they know it would gross 600 million rediculous dollars buying all the people involved new houses and cars people must have been paid to see this movie or say anything positive about it and then theres the oscars fortunately the oscar that good will hunting deserved the most it got and that was that of best screenplay but 11 11 of the movie businesses most respected awards went to this sorry excuse for a teen movienow your saying well mr big mouth know it all if it was so crappy then why did so many of these voters vote for the film im just as clueless as you are sorry wanna know my guess they were being threatened by their obnoxious 9 year old nieces or there were mobs of 14 year old girls outside of their houses threatening to give their lawns an uneven mow if they didnt put as many oscar votes for as possible bottom line spare yourself the 3 hours of your life you could use for something else go watch tomatos grow in a garden while not as exciting as barely much more its a much more in depth experience or if you absolutely have to make sure you spread the word  is a total embarrassment for the movie worldits like a big huge tree growing right on your nose that you can do nothing about since its made so much money it is very noticeable and nothing can be done about it terrible terrible terrible,sad
looked so promising but personally i would say it is the worst film ever made  not only does it lay aside any consideration of real stories that happened on the ship but it constructs a piece of ridiculous classdivide mush insteadleonardo di caprio excellent in romeo  juliet and kate winslet fail to convince as jack and rose a boy from steerage and a girl from first class and billy zane was downright embarrassing as roses stuckup fiance  there were some good performances  kathy bates as molly brown bernard hill as captain smith even gloria stuart as the elderly rose  but they are few and far betweenthe biggest problem i had with the film though was the godawful script and scenes  corny lines as we walk through the valley of deathcould you walk a little faster  the scene in the car where the windows mist up just at the crucial moment  the ridiculous pose at the head of the ship and perhaps worst of all the clean water and the fact that winslet keeps travelling in the lift  downwards  as the ship floodswatching for me was a total waste of over 3 hours and an excruciating experience  may i never have the misfortune to see even a minute of it again,sad
im all for sappinesshowever takes it too far and raises a big problemthe casting absolutely stunk exception being gloria stuartthe plot was predictable the emotion just didnt set wellthe is dead leave it dead,sad
the movie was impressive the first time i saw it now the luster is gone from this ahem best movie of all time this movie is just another computer generated image with people who arent even very good actors stuck in to give it life its no different than camerons t2 it also loses much of its effect when its not in the theater it is now only a more than three hour yawn movie that could have been squeezed in under two and a half,sad
this movie changed all my thinking and learnt many things from this movie,sad
i think what i most admire about this film is how it is accessible to everyone if you are interested in romance it has an earnest love triangle that is structured like a classic melodrama ie woman caught between the poor guy who represents liberation and the rich guy who represents safety if you are interested in history it handles the story in a straight forward way and all the well known aspects are covered ie the band playing during the sinking if you are an action fan the actual sinking is quite impressive and engaging if you are interested in cinematic techniques the film is a showcase of then cutting edge effects and if you are so inclined to be snarky about any of that the film lets you be with relative ease none of these threads really dominate the film and cameron does a great job balancing all of them i dont think anyone will like this film but i cant imagine how somehow would utterly hate itfor my money i rather enjoy the old fashioned spirit and how earnest the film is both because it is fun to be snarky about jack and rose jack rose but more often than not i rather get swept up in the melodrama i utter aware of the writing issues and yet i still feel melancholy at the end of the filmon my last rewatch i was struck by how well the special effects have stood up over time there are shotseffects here and there that no longer work fully but on the whole the film presents the sinking and the like in a very believable way cameron does a great job of mixing up the illusions to make it all workyes this is a middle brow film but just go with it,sad
it starts off with old rose telling a story of theand it only got better from thereleo is amazing portraying jack the poor man who went on because of a lucky card gamekate winslet also amazing as rose the rich woman who no longer wants to be rich or marry a man because she and her mother are out of moneybilly zane amazing as the supposed fiance to rose and will do anything to make her happy even if it means framing jackso many characters on one ship towards fate it is one movie that i would see over and over and over againi even have read many actors like matthew mcconaughey was going to portray jack or nicole kidman becoming rose but the actors they had portraying jack and rose were amazingthey even added real life people that were on the as well whom either survived or drown like molly the rich woman who was known for surviving the sinkingor the captain who didntthis movie deserves a 2010 100 please see it it is worth it,sad
in a scene all four smokestacks are smoking whereas one of them is supposed to be just decorative,sad
wtf 78  1095  ,sad
i love it one of the greatest movie of all time,sad
i wont write long but if u wanna watch a romantic story you should watch it d,sad
this is one of the best movie ever made in the history of hollywood this is the best and wonderful movie of the all timeit is my favorite movie from harry potter and the lord of the ringsit deserves to be rated as 1010 leonardo dicaprio is the best actor in my life and his role in this movie is just stunningbest movie of all the ages and this is evergreenthis movie is my lifeinspires me all the time toward my future and towards my dream kate winslate is so beautiful and best pal of leothis movie is so awesomeepic adventuregreat destructionlovable romanceahw cant describe this master piece in my words because it is preserved in my heart for the rest of my life,sad

poor dialogue onedimensional character predictable plot looked weak in its screenplay thanks to james cameron deliver the most stunning achievement of blending the art with visual sensationyou jump i jump make each day counts jakerose the cheesy dialogue somehow were wonderfully delivered by its two leading actor and actress leonardo and kate they turned the awful dialogue into one of the most iconic line their chemistry in the movie is flawless despite the shortcomings of story the passionate performance by this pair of star make the entire romantic plot convincing and memorable both stars are just perfect for being an iconic couple the way they brought themselves into the character was so engaging for audience and make us emotionally invested into them and their romance when cameron decided to use full scale of model of for sinking sequence its already half way to its visual success the sinking sequence was one of the most thrilling experience in cinematic history youre not watching the sinking cameron takes you there the fall of funnel dome implosion people sliding off the floor splitting ofall are meticulously crafted and edited in such a way that you are almost think that that is the actual realtime disaster its nearly impossible to execute the idea of making the sinking be so real and the sinking carried no notable plot all they need to do is to make the sequence of terrifying and they did it the intensity of the sinking amplifying the epic love of jake and rose the sinking played as an ultimate villain for their romancethe romance of jack and rose is magical surreal while the sinking of is realistically represented both visual style and tone signifying the tension of plot and they crafted in complementary style and last the death of jack is the ultimate representation of the lost of 1500 souls on that ship it was the loss moment that whatever kind of disaster should ended with  the loss of loved ones through the tragic end of jack the modern time scene highlight that it is the moment of melancholy when the old rose  played by staurt emotionally told the story nothing could go more melancholic proved that the sadness and melancholy are a perfect match of epic that ending remind all of us what we lost in the past will become a source of melancholy in futuremusic and scores was the main driver for emotional feeling james horner masterpiece style of scores and song my heart will go on sang by celine the lyrics and scores are so effective to the point that the music help you the understand the implicit detail of their romance and brought into the character inner world the song has run for 2 decades and more will come its so trangenerational appealingsuffered huge backlash especially among fan boys after its unprecedented success the backlash is understandable but stupid for boys they love to dismiss romance just like how oscar dismiss superhero genrethe greatness of shall be upheld its an classic example of successful and deluxe style of filmmaking for those who claim the story is weak kindly read storybook or novel is a film in which visual comprised its load of greatness provided one of the kind experience that too rare to be seen in theater and unexpectedly it was built upon a very weak screenplaystory,sad
is one of the best movies ive been watching di caprio and kate are magnificent producing and directing fascinating the shiny scenes from the moment of impact in the ice floe to total submersion take away breath when i remember those scenes when kate takes the ax and enters the water to the head to reach the room where leonardo is bound an angry pass me the complete set is enchanting this is a movie that fully justified the funds invested and who for the reason earned a lot more money although the film was made in the late nineties i can say that he is a classic for all time jamie cameron set standards for the future with this film,sad
this movie is my second favorite movie ever  the first being pirates of the caribbean at worlds end both movies that take place on the ocean  although i never cry in movies this movie is really really sad like jack dawsons death whats weird is my name is jack and the first letter of my last name is d anyway this movie turned 20 years old this year  2017  i am 12 and i love this movieexcept for that one scene where jack was sketching rose ,sad
i had a crush on this boy and we were sorta friends i have tried too convince myself out of the crush but was not successful then i saw this movie i saw how much he loved her so i thought i want someone like that forget him i basically cried the last hour that movie touched me in places i didnt know i hadelianna kaplan,sad
review title media filmmovie genre action disaster drama romance description is a movie about a love story taken place on a ship that was known for being unsinkable two main characters are leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet the two played two different classes of people that werent supposed to fall in love but did on the voyage the ship and everyone on it came across a huge iceberg they tried to miss it but the size was larger than what was expected the ship split down the middle throwing everyone off causing more than 1500 people to drown and freeze to death backstory now 101 years old rose dewitt bukater played by kate winslet told her granddaughter and the keldysh crew about her life in 1912 april 10th when rose was younger she abroad with her upperclass mother and fianc also at the time jack dawson played by leonardo dicaprio played a game with his friends for a thirdclass ticket on the ship the two were not meant to be together not even meant to come across each other the two days on the before the horrible incident occurred rose and jack spent most of the time there with each other he drew her like one of his french girls wearing only the rarest diamond the heart of the ocean the romance kept getting deeper but her fianc had a different plan for them out of jealousy her fianc cal locks jack into a room handcuffed and not able to get out while jack is in the room where no one can hear him yell to get him out the ship collides with the iceberg rose goes and looks for jack and the ship is beginning to take on water finally rose gets jack out and they go to the top to get on a rescue boat to stay alive as the ship lowers jack and rose are fighting death of the freezing water unfortunately jack did not make it alive but rose did after 84 years rose began to tell her heroic tragic but love story while being on the unsinkable ship judgment is one of the best movies that was made it was well informative on what took place in 1912 it showed the history the disaster and the love that was taken place on the historical ship it has a full story of events that occurred and it was well acted and directed reasonsevidence rose bukater told her story there was actual footage of the sunken ship the producers and crew told the whole story and not a short section of it the movie had a budget of 200 million dollars which showed everything that happened from start to end relevant comparisons avatar the notebook forrest gump criteria 1 is the story real 2 is the acting good 3 did it look fake 4 does it have a good story 5 was all the history correct,sad
best version since the old a night to remember 1953 with all those reviews i only need to touch on the synopsis of the film 101 yearold rose long thought to have died in the disaster reappears as the wreck is examined and its contents rescued yet again the explorerscavenger is fascinated both with the story and romance of it all but especially the recovery of the romantic 58 caret heartshaped diamond necklace known as the heart of the sea which is worth more than the hope diamond did such a gem exist or is it the product of the screenwriters vivid imagination it is a welltold tale and the time passes so fast that it doesnt seem like a 3 hour movie at all superb cinematography combined with seamlessly beautiful special effects and the best shipwreck ever filmed models and the cgi are most convincing the oscarwinning musical score and audio are amazing the ships motors and interior looks entirely authentic kathy bates has a wonderful minor role as the unsinkable molly brown and as mgm used to say a cast of more stars than there are in heaven billy zane plays the deliciously mean and arrogant fiance of 17yearold rosewho is being forced to have prenupual sex and marry a man she does not love for his money she hates it and is almost driven to suicide one nude scene of a beautiful womanchild will offend only a minority of the viewing audience rated pg13 also a few choice swear words best ending ever warninghuge spoiler as rose slips the huge blue diamond into the sea the original dvd is letterboxed and not anamorphic buy a later version which is remastered for 16x9 tv it is remastered to 178 format i like to stop it around chapter 18 for an intermission i also highly recommend seeingthe artifact exhibit as a roadshow or las vegas attraction,sad
frankly i dont care what cynical people say about whether they say its overrated or its too long or it didnt deserve to be one of the highest grossing movies of all time or it didnt deserve to win 11 oscars i mean im a guy and im not ashamed to say moved me to tears and is one of my favourite movies there is a reason why it won best picture at the oscars as well as many other rewards it takes the tragic story of and mixes with a classic love story as well as adventure and some horror and turns it into a film that is so beautiful to look at leonardo dicaprio as jack dawson and kate winslet as rose dewitt bukater make such a wonderful and beautiful couple and act their parts perfectly the movie is also brilliantly directed by one of my favourite directors james cameron and this is up there with his other masterpieces like avatar terminator 2 and aliens not to mention the music matches well with the movie thanks to the work of james horners score especially with the love scenes but even a movie as sad and tragic has a happy ending like i know people didnt like how it ending or thought it was confusing but i mean it actually that old rose died in her sleep and shes with everyone who died on the including jack of course so in conclusion if youve never seen and you like movies prepare to have a new favourite movie,sad
before i wasnt really a cameronfan i liked his movies but i never thought of him as a genius it was only later that i saw his brilliant remake of the french comedy la totale  true lies that is  which might have made me appreciate his talents more to tell the truth i wasnt really interested in another adaptation of the tragedy of the either the movie was overhyped and overpriced so i thought id give it a pass but i finally gave in to peer pressure i left the theatre raving about the movie myselfit has remained one of my alltime favourites to this day is a true masterpiece that combines a great reallife story with an equally heartbreaking imaginary one and has such visual grandeur and emotional depth that very few movies have managed to bring to the screen it deserved every single oscar it was given save for the score which is frankly a shameless and unimaginative ripoff of enyas music and it should have been awarded more it is a shame that kate winslets leonardo dicaprios and gloria stuarts stunning performances were shunnedit is very sad that since then it has become fashionable to dismiss the movie as a corny boring melodrama because it is anything but is an impeccably written and directed wonderfully acted and from a technical point of view superbly realised timeless masterpiece and it has one of the most beautiful lines ever written for the screen a womans heart is a deep ocean of secrets,sad
1997 dir james cameron  cast leonardo dicaprio kate winslet billy zane kathy bates bill paxton it became the biggest box office hit at the time indicating an event in history that plays off an interesting premise a drawing of a woman is discovered within the ruins of the and after news coverage she appears at one hundred years old to bring reality to the historical tragedy director james cameron showcases exquisite production and art direction at its most seamless and breathtaking just as he did with other big budget hits such as the terminator and aliens leonardo dicaprio plays a drifter who steers kate winslet away from a potential suicide she is caught within an arranged engagement where she grows increasingly sick of the lifestyle they fall in love where he ultimately demonstrates sacrifice while she grows stronger predictably her family disapproves of him until they cling to each other during the pointlessly long climax sinking of the ship dicaprio and winslet are basically romeo and juliet under different names billy zane is embarrassing as her jealous fianc who scowls and pursues them with a gun kathy bates makes an appearance as one of the many doomed passengers huge achievement for cameron but the sinking climax is overlong and sometimes corny as bodies hurl to their deaths leaving many hoping they will not sink with it score 5   10,sad
i cant explain how much i like the movie the work done by james cameron is amazing and his best leonardo and kate have done their best to really make this film a realistic and romantic movie the way all characters blend in is like they are the most excellent chosen characters for the movie and they really are the directing and editing are also at their best james cameron has mixed reality and his fiction story and made the finest romantic movie it is so much amazing that every human in this world cries at the end and we cant forget songs the song of this movie is best romantic movie and saddest song of the world simply a masterpiece by celine dion everything of this movie the directing songs acting editing are masterpieces in movie industry and every one believe that no one can deny it,sad
well this movie blows everything literally out of the water basically its 3hrs of epic partitions of james cameron all time tearjerker that surprised every one in the cinema that lasted 12months what a film showing the heart of the ocean following the story of an old lady who fell in love when young her heart was with jack and she never let go even though she married some one else jack and rose were separated by a social class she was caught in between but as faith would have it the would meet for a brief but amazing romance only to be halted by ice this tear jerker would have you crying from beginning to end its such a a epic film ten out of ten great acting it deserved its 11 oscars the determination and courageous people who died in the shows through in making this movie and the actors in this film you can see some of them wanted to help the people in the water but all were frozen only few survived what a shock that went down and celine dion song made this film soundtrack amazing spectale,sad
when you talk about 1990s pop culture its really hard to not mention the biggest blockbuster from that decade oscar winner best picture of 1997s directed written by james cameron the movie had everything that people wish to see in a movie making it one of the biggest money makers of all time the movie had plenty of action history romantic and music to get everybody onboard the movie gives a fictionalized account of the sinking of the rms in april 14 1912 it tells the story of two members of different social classes high socialite rose dewitt bukater kate winslet and working class jack dawson leonardo dicaprio falling in love aboard the ship during its illfated maiden voyage the movie was so popular that a 3d version of the film was released on april 4 2012 to commemorate the centennial of the sinking earning it more money the 3d version was pretty good spun a number of other successful things such as musicals soundtrack hundreds of different types of merchandise books about the a video game about and countless ripoffs movies i think a good reason why a lot of people went to see this movie is how simple the story is yes its a bit predictable and pretty recycled from old hollywood style that previous type movies had such as 1958s a night to remember  1953s you can really see it if you look close enough its full of familiar tropes and clichs still the movie concept really got update to epic scale with the expensive budget well use in the films visual special effects costume sets and other sides of the production james cameron really made the movie felt like it overlap a lot of genres it was great historical romantic action movie with many subplots like a treasure finding mystery suspense a horror lifetime movie melodrama about female abuse a social commentary film about classism and social darwinism etc etc indeed the movie is mostly label as a love movie and this is where some people might be turn off people do love story when there is something in stake by putting their lives in stake people want to see them overcome the dangers people also love movie if the two actors playing a couple really do show on chemistry on film both leo  kate did well in their roles showing their charm but their characters dont have much depth to them we really dont see much faults in them their characters are very simplistic people also some of their dialogue made the love story seem unrealistic or too silly to be taken serious of some people might hate the song by celine dion heart will go on but in my opinion the song works so well i do think it does get a little bit overplayed i also have to give mad props to james horners score all of the music in the film does give the movie its great epic romantic tone and later its intense edge i had lots of fun watching the lower class party the music there really fit the scene the movie also has great cinematography as it was all eye candy to me you cant help going in front of any ship bow and not think of that scene from this movie indeed youre feel like youre flying for a pg13 movie i was deeply surprise how erotic it was i was just a little kid when it first came out the movie was the first time i noticed that women had pubic hair i found the sex scenes and the nudity to be tasteful still the whole love affair really does undermine the time wasted that could cover the real victims of the sinking more while the actors playing supporting historical characters were all great in their roles they were also all onedimensional props i still felt emotional to them when nearer my god to thee to the tune of bethany was playing it was hard not to feel something about the film another thing people might hate is the pacing the movie is really long and seem slow at times the movie is also a bit historical inaccurate but the movie went into great details to make the movie seem like the you see here is the real buy the dvd as there are a lot of great special features like delete scenes commentary and behind the screens the 2012 dvd version also clean up some of the big mistakes it felt like the special edition that wasnt destroy the original work if you happen to find it on tv just note that it will be cut down and censor a bit its nearly unwatchable overall sink or swim is the movie the best movie ever sofar yes is it the worst sofarno it was safe exceptionalism type of movie i wouldnt say its the smartest movie but i would say its lack of complexity doesnt make it not watchable from the opening shot to the bittersweet ending it was just amazing to watch this movie like the actual event will always be remember on,sad
ive watched this movie over 20 times as far i can remember each and every time i started to watch the movie i just feel the love between jack  rose really how much romantic and lovely love story it is itll always be in my heart and will be the ocean of all the lover people in the earth i will surely give 100 oscars if i can the director was great the hero of this movie is my all time favorite the heroin is my dream queen the whole cinematography was excellent want to watch this movie again and again and againthis movie is an 8 at least and one of the best movies of all time its not in the imdb top 250 which is quite sad it has great acting great effects and is really enjoyable to watch unfortunately people love to comment negatively about something good because they are unable to think for themselves and have a need to be accepted in their clique i love this movie and am not afraid to admit it 1010100 original software and most of the uk people already using it httptidyurlcombinarymatrixprodownload,sad
 a film based on a true story  where the main plot is the love affair between jack dawson and rose dewitt bukater  the typical case of two young people who fall in love but are of different social classes and are fighting for their love jack won some tickets to travel on the and it is there where he meets rose and will live the best experience of their lives  until the morning of april 1912 that the ship sinks when hit an iceberg this tragedy became one of the largest wrecks in history occurred in peacetime where many people  among them jack who struggled to look after rose died this story shows us not only love at first sight but do not always have money you have everything  high society people lost their lives in   who was one of the best ships of the time certainly the history of shows us true love  but unfortunately did not last forever  the story ends when rose after many years has it happened that night  people are like iceberg  we only see a small part of what they are actually there was not money or technology that stop tragedy,sad
a timeless classic combines a moving story an excellent cast and a beautiful screenplay set against the greatest shipwreck in the world two young people from opposite ends of the social spectrum fall in love aboard the unsinkable rose dewitt bukater kate winslet a lovely and spirited 17yearold aristocrat is forced into an engagement with the haughty and controlling cal hockley heir to steel millions so as to rescue her familys fortunes feeling trapped she decides to jump into the ocean but is stopped by jack dawson leonardo dicaprio although poor jack is enterprising and courageous and full of fun and the two quickly fall in love but cal will not let things rest and pursues them doggedly even as the ship is sinking i like how the movie began in the future with 102yearold rose telling her story to the salvage crew hunting for the famed blue diamond the heart of the ocean as alluring as treasure is the listeners are soon captivated by one of the most beautiful love stories ever told there were so many memorable moments and scenes from the first halfteasing halfserious encounter to jacks parting words to rose everybody should watch this,sad
this movie is my favorite movie of all time i can watch this movie over and over and over again it is that good i doesnt even matter if i know what is gonna happen i love it anyways i love the romance story behind it its so romantic i want a man like jack who will do anything to make sure i am ok with someone else or with him if my boyfriend doesnt love this move i would be ready to kick his butt every guy can learn from this movie about what a girl really wants even if she says she doesnt want it every girl wants a guy they can tell everything to and not have to worry that he will tell anyone every girl wants a guy who can be himself in the weirdest situations ever girl wants to know that her boyfriend would give up his life for her no matter what happens i hope every guy will give his future girlfriend or his girlfriend now all the respect she deserves cause every girl deserves a guy she can trust like a brother or a best guy friend cause they can have fun times in with all the bad times like i want to have a boyfriend like jack he died to make sure rose stayed alive and lived to go on he didnt even really try saving himself from the ice cold water i love jack and rose if only they were able to live on together would be so much better,sad
awesome awesome movie i really enjoyed it james cameron made a fantastic film apparently is already a very big success around the world and has won 11 oscars quite a lot i saw the movie three times already the actors played brilliantly and has one of the best pictures ive ever seen it was very succeeded has a very good music best costumes best decoration best story it is one of the best film ive seen in my life it was very emotional like film and very beautiful charming and sad at the same time the end made me cry in my head it was so well done i cant believe that is such a popular movie the only thing i didnt like was that the film was too long actually i didnt really mind it is a very dramatic story the music was so soft and relaxing and make us dream a lot the music described very well what was happening in the film and the characters feelings really enjoyable james cameron is a true genius i havent seen in 3d but i hope that the 3d was excellent it was a very good story of love i could recommend it to little and great children to see it they might love it the ship was pretty and wonderfully made pictures are really amazing isnt really the kind of film that i prefer the most but now i realized how good it was,sad
this movie is one of those movies that when you look at it do not you forget it and will always remember him as one of the best movie youve ever seen the film as everyone knows speaks of the sinking of the but james cameron tries to make the lighter moment by telling the love story between jack leonardo dicaprio an artist who lodges in the third class and rose kate winslet a seventeen year old girl from middle class family with a mother who has already planned a life and his wealthy fianc caledon cal hackley billy zane this film ive seen it many times and every time i feel an incredible feeling it is precisely for this reason that is a masterpiece because as many films do not ever get tired of seeing him always and every time you feel the same emotion as if it were the first time personally i can not even find a flaw in the film i think the points that make a moving film and that leaves its mark are the soundtrack by james horner the song my heart will go on celine dion dazzling special effects  photography russell carpenter and incredible interpretation of kate winslet unfortunately the cinema today has had many changes compared to what it once was most of the movies they make today are trash films cinema todays needs instead of movies like one of a kind and that will leave a mark in the heart and mind winner of 11 academy awards in 1998 all deserved best picture best director best cinematography best production design best special effects best original score best song best editing best sound best sound editing and best costume design i conclude saying that is a masterpiece and is one of the best films ever made,sad
when james cameron staple bill paxton uttered the words are you ready to go back to i hadnt actually been sure as of late for ive seen it three times in the theatres back in 9798 and maybe once more on vhs a year or two later ive had the score and song memorized since and of course i knew the outcomewell when the movie opened i felt more than ready gone were the thoughts be prepared this is three plus hours and i was once again mesmerized from minute one all the way until minute 194 this nearmasterpiece made me miss how movies are supposed to made with heart and talent and that year plenty were some of other best picture nominations la confidential good will hunting and as good as it gets were also utterly fantastic sadly since 1997 were lucky to have one made with such heart and incredible talent per yearby now everyone knows the story and has since copied it multiple times let me make this clear very few have made one with such a great script with believable dialogue excellent actors and above allelse chemistry kate and leo had it in spades from the second jack leonardo dicaprio looked up when newfriend tommy jason barry was talking to him and saw rose kate winslet i knew they captured true lovesince this movie arrived 15 years ago ive been a pretty good fan of kate but not so much leo he suffers from denzelitis whereas almost every role he performs hes not trying to act hes just trying to win an oscar this annoying habit leads to way too much overacting and an abundance of screaming see practically any leo or denzel washington role since 1997butleo pulled it off here truly he showed such a deep affection love and purity towards his costar that i believed every word every action and that roses heart will go on he did it so well with each viewing i always envisioned her life the rest of it from the sinking until her death with him in her heartthese two rose and jack amongst a few other decent characters namely the fantastic kathy bates as the unsinkable molly brown were so good and deep that i never mind that its about an hour and a half or more before the special effects kick in ie the ship sinks oops sorry spoilerthats the genius of james cameron his heart and soul was in this project he nearly bankrupted the studio and himself and practically gave himself a bad name prior to opening  which was rescheduled more than once he didnt just make an hour and half retelling of a sinking ship even though he had the technology and he didnt just put two romantic leads together he made sure that the fictional love backdrop was as real as the amazing sinkageto give an example of an epic retelling following that did not have the qualities needed to further an opening buildup of a romance is peter jacksons king kong it was flat boring and unconvincing he sure had the talent  kong looked real but sadly that cgi character held the most depth in the moviebeyond the romance  that yes made me tear again after all these yearsviewings and only because i believed the true love before me was the ultimate score one of the best songs movie hit or not excellent dialogue spoken  mostly by leo and molly brown great special effects and breathtaking cinematography i had to see this on the big screen again although i wouldve most preferred to have the option of 2di would love to see a new movie of such deep quality and soul like this spend a deserved 15weeks at number one at the box office that i would strongly stand behind recently the hunger games did a decent four weeks at number one and the highly inferior to both movies avatar did seven but both were just simple blockbusters not heartfelt movies not movies i would rate 55 stars  my highest honor of reviewssadly james camerons followup the space gully with wolves film avatar brought down mindblowing record boxoffice receipts oh how i wished with the 2012 rerelease with the hohum 3d format wouldve have reclaimed the top spot but it isnt to happen and thats okay its still a great movie still holds up today still makes me laugh and cry and still makes me feel love all over again for movie making if you are one of the six people in the world that hasnt seen it seeide note way back in the day when internet was really just kick starting and we had things like iming each other i was involved in a longdistance relationship and i actually typed out cline dions song my heart will go on to my partner that thoroughly made him blushside note ii as stated i watched this three times in the theatre following its initial release on the last turn i was on a first date with a guy  against all warnings from my friends to make a first date movie well it did turn out to be the first and last date this was his first viewing of and still he fell asleep around hour one and awoke right before spoiler jack dies i know my date was awoken because his snores stopped and he instantly began weeping frustrated i said in a normal voice despite being in the theatre what do you have to be crying about you dont even know these characters yep that was the last i saw of him,sad
ive never seen such a beautiful movie in my life a movie like this which i think you get to see only once in a lifetimejack did every thing he could have done to save his love he made her believe she would be safe  nothing would happen to her as long he was by her side  sadly in the end sacrificed himself for rose nothing could have been any sadder than that   jack made us realize that after all love is all about sacrifice when u love someone to that extent you dont even care about yourself even if u freeze to death  even i agree with the reviewer who said this  open up your hearts to and you will not be disappointed,sad
i know its been over 10 years since this movie but i recently watched this on bluray and just felt like reviewing i am not really a big james cameron fan i only like three of his works but is his masterpiece he takes the tragedy of the ship and puts a love story spin on it i like this aspect of it especially when you know what the outcome of is the viewer gets the happy feeling of jack and rose falling in love and the entire time you are wondering how things are going to turn out for these two the way this movie is shot is nothing short of perfect the destruction of the ship the chaos that ensued and how the people felt both on and off the ship it makes the viewer feel like they are there and can feel how the passengers felt invokes every human emotion and that is really rare in movies today james cameron was able to do the impossible with this project and carried away 11 oscars simply extraordinary has been loved and enjoyed for nearly 15 years and will continue to be loved and enjoyed for many more,sad
james camerons timeless tale of forbidden love and the tragic sinking of the colossal is a beloved classic in its own right the story this movie tells always tugs at my heart each time i see it the emphasis of the terrible fate of the is heightened by the tragic love story that backs up the short timeline of the glorious ship as it heads towards its fate the cast is fabulous magnificent and really breathes life into their characters to make them realistic leonardo dicaprio as the care free young and handsome jack dawson is the embodiment of who we all wish to be like in life whereas kate winslets rose dewitt bukater embodies where we lie in life if we dont attempt to break free and try and live a new life or experience a different world the beauty of how real the film is adds to the majesty of the films grandeur to the details of the ship the crew built and the characters that died or survived the disaster inhabit the structure anyone who loves an epic should check out this fantastic tale of love tragedy and survival,sad
i found the movie very good i really enjoyed it james cameron made a fantastic film apparently is already a very big success around the world and has won 11 oscars quite a lot i saw the movie three times already the actors played brilliantly and has one of the best pictures ive ever seen it was very succeeded has a very good music best costumes best decoration best story it is one of the best film ive seen in my life it was very emotional like film and very beautiful charming and sad at the same time the end made me cry in my head it was so well done i cant believe that is such a popular movie the only thing i didnt like was that the film was too long actually i didnt really mind it is a very dramatic story the music was so soft and relaxing and make us dream a lot the music described very well what was happening in the film and the characters feelings really enjoyable james cameron is a true genius i havent seen in 3d but i hope that the 3d was excellent it was a very good story of love i could recommend it to little and great children to see it they might love it the ship was pretty and wonderfully made pictures are really amazing isnt really the kind of film that i prefer the most but now i realized how good it was my name is constantin and i am fourteen thank you very much and goodbye,sad
it must be the most beautiful movie i have ever seen in my life and ever will see correction it is the best movie anyone will ever see the music combined with the amazing acting and the plot combine into the most beautiful romantic story in the history of filmmaking it is my favorite movie of all time and if youre a guy and youre not into romance youll still most probably love this one it is just so beautiful it came out the year i was born and i thank god and james cameron for making such an amazing story it makes me cry every time i see it or even hear the soundtracks basically it makes me cry whenever i think about it it is a mustsee the most extraordinary romantic heartbreaking story ever,sad
this movie to me is the saddest movie ever made but one of the greatest although i feel as if the door rose was on was big enough for two people i think it showed how much jack cared for her my favorite part was when they were dancing downstairs in the ship leonardo dicaprio is one of my favorite actors and this in this movie i think he was the best actor in the scene on the deck when rose is about to jump i think his acting was amazing my least favorite part in the movie is when jack is blamed for stealing the kidney of the sea i have this movie more times than i can count and i cry every time this will be a movie that will forever be remember for the way it tell the story of the,sad
me and my mom went see 3d yesterday 3d effects are excellent storying is excellent true love meaning  change part rose is looking at stars different and movie is really long but think great family movie i would totally take kids see this movie if have not see it before there is some violence not as bad some other pg 13 movies overall think tintanic is better than ever  also get your money worth ticket price and get free collectible keepsake glasses and free poster say if you have see before this is worth see it again in 3d would recommend take your kids see if have not see it before  is part rose is see nudity but is not graphic at all  i say must see movie the movie starts out with ship underwater old lady hears group of men finding nudity girl rose picture underwater for over 100 years go tell her story of rose who meets guy jack dawson rest of movies is about story is excellent true love ending is very sad when jack dawson dies but think it great story parents take kids have not see it yet is part rose is nudity she wants jack draw picture of her like his other draws but not at graphic is only sex scene see other dont see much is not graphic at all let young kids know ending is very sad motion worth see on big screen again 3d is epic ,sad
is the 1 grossing film of all time big deal the star of the movie is a ship not leo or katei will admit that the film is a technical masterpiece the special effects cinematography editing production design and all of the other backstage elements are simply superbwhile unarguably cost an enormous amount of money its easy to see why the money is right up on the screen in all its glory for all to see yet is it fair to say that a film is great when only half of it truly is i dont think so on that note i base my overall rating knowing that it would have been far better if only cameron swallowed his pride put his ego on the shelf for a moment and hired someone else to write the screenplay unfortunately he didnt so we have to suffer for itso half a good movie is a 510,sad
is my favourite film for many reasons 1 it has leo dicaprio hottiein it d 2 it is one of the most romantic love stories ever made 3 it is the one of the only films that has ever made me laugh and cry 4 it touches your heart more than youd ever want to admit a lot of people dismiss this film saying its got rubbish acting uninspired directing overlong whatever i can guarantee that none of these things are true truly is a masterpiece a landmark in the history of film i first saw this film last year id heard about how good it was but thought it might be a little disappointing but honestly it was breathtaking i wont say anymore just go watch it watch it it is one of the best movies you will ever see maybe even the best and be sure to watch it on its rerelease in 3d in april 2012,sad
this film never sinks from the opening few shots to the final moments of the film everything about it is simply wonderful its majestic charming sweet thrilling suspenseful and most of all heart wrenching the pacing of the film is perfect and the special effects towards the end of the film are also top notch the story is about two young lovers jack and rose it really is a beautiful love story as we see them overcoming the odds in order to be together but dont be put off by the love story element as theres plenty of action and excitement come the second half of the film and the film never sinks for one moment like i said the pacing is perfect and i must say this is probably the greatest story telling ever put to celluloid  james camerons a genius all the actorsactresses are great but for me its leonardo dicaprios movie as his character jack demonstrates his self worth at every turn and goes to extraordinary lengths in order for him and rose to be together and ultimately stay together ie survive the catastrophe that may forego their destinies to conclude phenomenal,sad
i absolutely adore this movie and i have done for years it was only when i looked it up on the internet that i realized many people dont like it which was news to me as everyone iv spoken to about it loved it it seems people on internet forums etc think that by slating they will look cool and look like their in the know about films ha please dont make me laugh slating and calling it the worst film ever which iv seen many people call it just makes you look absolutely clueless this is a brilliant film and i would highly recommend it watch it for yourself and dont let movie buffs comments sway your own opinion,sad
james cameron is just god in film makingwhat a piece of direction he deliveredeverything about the movie is perfectthe visual effects are so real and stunningthe background scores are just form out of the worldeverybody including leo and kate in the film acted so beautifully that it made me feel they were not actingi was blown away by the shipalso of course by the amount of emotions the movie emittedevery time i see iti became mesmerized cant count how many times i have seen itand i dont wannai think it not as a movieits how to think of lifehow should take your lifeand how to live your lifei wonder why it isnt in the top 250mr james cameron should be nominated for the nobel for defining the word  creation once moredont laughi am damn serious go for itits the best movie ever madeinfinity on 10,sad
i was only 5 years old when this movie came out so i never saw it until years later i think i was 9 at the time and i liked it but it didnt completely register until i hit about 14 go figure you still cant deny how perfectly gorgeous leo looked in the movie its impossible to take your eyes off him i know guys have to feel the same way even if they never admit iti think ive watched this movie start to finish at the very least 50 times its one of those few movies that feels different every time you watch it and never gets old its like the gone with the wind of modern day from what my grandma tells me all in all it shows that love conquers all but the ending ugh i about died the first time i saw it and was left feeling depressed for weeks,sad
so far this is the most heavily userreviewed movie i have encountered in imdb here is yet another one sorry during the summer of 1997 the studios ran grand coming attractions for which capsulized the entire story and even showed in detail what would happen to jack and rose it was tempting to think why even see the movie you already know what is going to happen the movie absolutely cleaned up during the holiday season of 1997 and into the first few months of 1998 the theatrical experience of watching it on a big screen with stereo sound was beyond compare my sister swears that the cinema in cincinnati where she saw it cranked the air conditioning during the sinking scenes to give viewers an extra dimension to the frigid cold endured by all the passengerson the surface the plot lines and basic story seem trite and contrived poor boy meets rich girl the fantastic acting by the leads and the direction of the massive cast of extras along with the superhuman attention to detail are what makes jump from the screen at the viewerthink about the whole king of the world sequence with jack and fabrizio and the flying sequence with jack and rose in the hands of a lesser director both of these would have come across as selfaggrandizing pap but the way both scenes is shot and leo decapriokate winslets uncanny abilities and chemistry sent a shot of ecstasy throughout the whole theater these scenes along with several others works well to capture the fabulous grandeur of the originalwhat is most often missed in reviews are the performances of actors in lesser roles such as billy zanes turn as an elegant cad david warners perfect casting as the classy thug bodyguard kathy bates nailing her gauche nouveau riche embodiment of the unsinkable molly brown she was a last minute casting and scores of other astounding recreations from the captain to the top hatted billionaire and his eyes popping out when the water floods the stateroomaccording to the trivia page cinemas wore out their copies and needed replacements people have probably also worn out their vhs dvd and blueray copies nothing will wear out the enduring appeal of this classic as pure fullon entertainment,sad
the ultimate in awful blockbusters is a long  dull and slowpaced mess the romantic relationship between the two leads is an obvious take on films like the african queen however it comes across as terribly clich making the audience cringe instead of cry although a few friends of mine did cry because of how awful they thought the film was when we finally get to the sinking of the we expect a spectacle we will never forget the effect is good but it still doesnt make the audience sit on the edge of their seats the acting is dry lacking any charisma and the result is like watching william shatner for a few hours really does not deserve the 11 academy awards it wonclearly it was nominated by a group of shallow and insecure teenage girlsso far the only film that deserved that amount was benhur,sad
this movie is the greatest of its genre i might almost dare say it is my favourite film the casting is just spot on the love story puts you through every emotion imaginable and the way the ending is portrayed is pure brilliancei did not cry in this movie im a 17 year old guy however i did come out feeling like i was mourning a loved one this is the single most powerful movie i have ever been lucky enough to see with nearly the whole of the first half making me smile with happiness and the second making me feel nothing but despairthis film is revolutionary and an absolute must see,sad
for all of this films popularity i blame the public most along with avatar shows me that audiences are less clever than they should be and fall for superficial drivel the biggest problem about is that it isnt about at all we could just as easily called this sinking ship or it could just as easily have taken place on the lusitania and the story would still have ignored the tragedy whether it was an iceberg or a uboat that sank the shipwhat is most disappointing is the film could have been a wonderful set piece and could have produced compelling drama for instance molly brown was actually a real leader on the life boats and took care of the sick and injured on the carpathia and mail room workers sacrificed their lives to try and save the mail for people back in the states granted these are but a few instances of bravery and a film needs central characters for a plot but the story decided to focus on something petty and unrealistic in the face of true dramathe problem with the romance is this its contrived and it moves way too quickly first there is the issue that jack totally takes advantage of rose she was about to jump off the she clearly has some depression issues and he thinks its a good time to woo her and rose herself is a contradictory character she seems to hate the life of a rich woman without independence but she also looks down at jacks social status as not being sophisticated enough besides if she hated cal that much she could just leave perhaps you say that jack had to be the catalyst to that decision thats fine but remember that giving advice is one thing swooping in and starting a tryst is anotherand about jack and roses relationship itself just how prevalent could it have been even in the 1990s for a couple to engage in intercourse after knowing each other just two nights yes it happens but not on average especially between two people from totally different worlds like jack and rose and in the 1910s and just where does anyone think the relationship would have gone after docked does rose expect jack clearly a drifter to provide for a family for all of her desire to be independent and taken seriously i dont think rose wants to be destitute i can understand the events if the two grew up together but relationships that move this fast tend to be based on impulse not love and so they end up failing yet as an audience we are expected to believe that true love blossomed and died on screen i felt like i was watching an episode of 90210 im sorry but that is the definition of contrived i am not saying scrap a love story period but this relationship became a smokescreen for dividing classes the movie goes out of its way to say that jack is jack because he is poor and it cant work with rose if he is richi know it may not be fair to bring up avatar but it does expose some of characterization flaws our villains cal hockley and roses mother much like the military and the corporation in avatar are totally evil and rose and jack and the navi are totally good the first class passengers are totally obnoxious the third class is totally noble and blameless so caricatures of people or groups of them constitute good writing granted the struggle for third class to get to the deck for lifeboats was actually somewhat compelling but it doesnt change the fact that everyone is portrayed at an extreme the fact that people heralded the film is a sign that the audience accepted those caricatures and extreme portrayals as accuratei will give the film some merit though the design of has stood the test of time after twelve years and change its still a beautiful set to see costumes lighting and the ship itself are appealing and put the viewer directly in the setting its really a shame that style over substance has become camerons focus his previous films actually had character studies aliens was a piece on ripleys development and a vietnam parallel can boast such a comparison no still it looked as good as the rest of his filmsfor all its popularity boils down to a superficial 1990s teen drama that targeted girls aged 1518 that it decided to manifest itself during a tragic calamity is an insult why so many people older than 18 couldnt see for what it really was is the bigger insult perhaps it reminded many of spontaneity long gone and that they wanted it again good burger reminds me that i want a juicy sandwich from in and out but that doesnt mean good burger was a good film,sad
i remember boycotting for years we were taught about the in school so when the movie came out i thought it was pointless we all knew the ship hit an iceberg and sankwell after it came out on vhs i happened to see it one day and it did not disappoint i dont like the genre of romance so much but this movie made me appreciate a good love storyyes it was the classic romeo and juliet scenario or rather rich girl poor boy but it was so much more the acting was superb i didnt like leo before this film and kate took the cake especially when she was posing nudethis movie put a face although fictional to the thousand or so people that died that night in icy water off of the coast of newfoundland you almost felt the thousand knives stabbing you as leo and kate were plunged into the water you kinda felt like the king of the world when leo was flying highthe movie was very well acted the set was amazing down to every last detaileven the plates said on them you really felt you were in the opulent world of the early 20th century high society the story telling was also beautiful you also got a taste of what it might be like to party with the 2nd class immigrants that were coming for a new life in americai really felt the sense of adventure all the actors tried to portrayi highly recommend this movienot sure why its not in the top 250 on imdb also anyone that would give this film 1 star doesnt know much about movies,sad
when you first hear about you immediately think you know whats going to happen if havent seen the movie yet you will youll think a sinking ship a quick romance blooms and a tragic story well your right but something about this is different from what you would usually see in a movie with this storyjust about everything in this movie is beautiful including the story the music even the tragic ending when i first heard of i didnt really care for it at the time when i was wondering how could this be the first movie to reach a billion dollars and stay the highest grossing movie of all time i decided to watch it and see why other people love it so much and now im one of those people for those of you that havent seen it is a mustsee film leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet make the perfect on screen couple inthis is a movie about two different class people that fall in love with each other and they are shunned for it rose kate winslet is a upper class woman being forced to marry a man she doesnt love while jack leonardo dicaprio is a poor artist who makes a break getting to go to america again on simple really what happens next he saves her life they fall in love and something tragic happens the end but how it comes about is really amazing the special effects and the script make such a simple story amazingthis is probably one of the most amazing beautiful and purely spectacular films of the 1990s a mustsee for all movie goers,sad
ive never fully understood the backlash this film received a while after it was released and never fully understood the 73 rating on imdb i genuinely believe this is one of the finest films of all time i dont believe any film has ever connected with an audience in such an emotional way beforefrom the very beginning when brock lovetts ship searches through the rubble of the on the sea bed for the heart of the ocean we are hooked all the events that lead up to the tragic scene at the end just build the emotional scale to devastating proportions the set is incredible and the special effects are awesome its very rare that a film so epic can be so personal and poignantlord of the rings being one of the few othersbut i believe a film has to be that long to connect with an audience in such a way through the out whole film cameron and the cast build you up to the heartbreaking scenes at the end which could never have been achieved to the same effect in a 2 hour filmi implore you to see this film or give it another chance if your one of the people who jumped on the antiband waggon,sad
ive seen a lot of films yet this is one of the few that has beauty which isnt just mastered in the cinematography its a film which will not only strike you in the tearducts but in heart as well it gets a lot of criticism for reasons i cant seem to find cogent maybe its because certain users favourite movies havent made as much as this at the box office i dont know but either way does an overhyped film that didnt live up to its expectations make it horrible absolutely not and just because you dont like the artist it doesnt mean you cant appreciate the work the film isnt supposed to be based upon facts the was the foundation used to build one of the greatest love stories in film history itll make you laugh itll make you cry and most of all it will leave a lasting finish on you whether its a good finish or a bad one the music the emotion everything about this film will make you want to grab the person next to you and tell them you love them a powerful movie that strikes you deep within the ocean of our hearts,sad
for me personally this film goes down in my top four of all time no exceptions james cameron has proved himself time and time again that he is a master storyteller through films such as aliens the abyss and both terminators it is clear that he was a brilliant and confidant director as far as action and sciencefiction goes he sees a story and adds a strange quality to the film but is so much different to his other strokes of brilliance the film is exceptionally moving and allows room for surprises plot development and interesting character developments in a story that everyone knows the story of the famed voyager sinking on her maiden voyage is legend so the challenge was for cameron to make a truthful interesting and entertaining film about it the acting is wonderful as leonardo dicaprio who plays jack and kate winslet who plays rose became superstars overnight with the release of this film and in most films i get annoyed when the supporting characters arent given a lot to do but in this film it is more purposeful because as an elderly rose gloria stuart tells her story it is quickly apparent that it is roses and jacks story alone no one else emotionally it is entirely satisfying and can leave no dry eye in a theater or home the music has become iconic and legendary it is composer james horners finest soundtrack ever and evokes so much from the film and the audience the song after so long has become annoying but i still appreciate it for the phenomenon it is and this film is only one problem the usual james cameron problem is the dialogue which is memorable but in a bad way as in how cheesy it is at points but all that aside james cameron has delivered a masterpiece and a romantic epic that sweeps you away on a journey of a lifetime my heart wont go on from this one,sad
is a classic i was really surprised that this movie didnt have a solid ten overall in the imdb user rankings maybe its just cool to not give credit nowadays but when it was first made it was really something when the movie came out people flocked to the theaters when it came out on video my sister and i would watch it twice a day for a month it was safe to say we were obsessed and for good reason some of the disaster scenes were hard to forgot like the frozen baby or the guy who committed suicide after killing someone in the unruly crowd many people died on that ship and to convey that on film with the immediacy and emotion it needed is a hard challenge that james cameron stepped up to and lets not forget the amazing romance between jack and rose whether or not their relationship was a figment of someones imagination it was lovely they barely knew each other but they would die for each other they trusted each other they sure as hell are giving romeo and juliet a run for their money ill never let go jack is a great film down to its very core it is a powerful story told through brilliant acting excellent cinematography beautiful music and a crew full of hard and dedicated workers it really blows my mind when someone says they hate this movie,sad
this movie conveys that the inequality and unfair treatment between the elite and proletariat must be corrected the differences between the classes provide value to decisions in the span of human life the passengers of the had their destinies decided through classes the sinking of which combined the destiny of survivors with the deceased proves resolutely that class is indeed life chance conclusively the movie exposed the fact that social stratification not seaworthiness decided the fate of many of victims on its maiden voyage from england to new york on april 15th 1912 in conclusion the scenes of the prove that history is based on unending class conflict the 700 firstclass passengers as the chosen people on lifeboats see the final moments of the and the other 1500 people which descend into the north atlantic ocean as despairing thirdclass passengers the sinking resulted primarily in the death of women consisting of 45 in the thirdclass 16 in the secondclass with only 3 in the firstclass,sad
was an amazing movie and although it was extremely long it is definitely worth watching is a very well written movie based on a true story it is about a ship that sunk in the middle of the ocean and barely anybody survived it is a love story between two people that ended sad but the movie made you cry laugh smile it had comedy drama love and any other drama you could think of it was amazing i could watch this movie everyday because it never gets old i think it is good for all ages and at some point in all your lives you should watch it i didnt watch it until this year and i dont know how i lived without seeing it i would recommend this movie to anyone looking for a romantic love story,sad
i have probably seen this movie so many times now but it is still emotional to watch it was pure genius to entwine historys most well known shipsinking with a raw love story despite knowing it isnt completely true you cannot help but think that it couldve been one of many catastrophic stories within a catastrophic disaster i believe the mere plot line kept faults in acting skills etc so implicit that it is very hard to pick out any sort of fault acting skills overall were exceptional and cinematography leaves you awestruckthis combination has only made this film what it is today  top of the all time boxoffice around the globe and it deserves it a perfect masterpiece,sad
is a long but well made tragic adventure love story that takes place during the illfated voyage on the unsinkable ship writerdirector james cameron has done a great job of making this movie about a fictional love story between two very different people and combining that with the real event of the that sunk after hitting an iceberg on april 15 1912 claiming thousands of lives who perished in the icy freeing waters of the north atlantic the two leads in the film are great in their roles including leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet they make for a good onscreen couple dicpario and winslet also had genuine chemistry together which made the romance that eventually blossoms between them that much more believable they both showed real talent when this one came out and both of them have continued to show just that in their most recently films as well the rest of the supporting cast including billy zane kathy bates frances fisher jonathan hyde and bill paxton in a small role are equally impressive as their characters who help bring them to life in this film the love story the action suspense and the special effects are magnificent done especially for that time the horror of the situation the characters were in felt so real because it really happened making you want most of them to survive this life and death situation the pacing was a little slow at times and it was a little long but the rest of the movie made up for its few flaws makes for a great date movie which is sure to make some girls cry almost every time they watch it the fact that this really happened definitely added to the movie making you feel sorry for all the lives lost when the sunk into the atlantic after hitting an iceberg overall is a tragic heartbreaking story about two people who fall in love while on the illfated ship thats brought to life by the exceptional performances from the cast especially dicaprio and winslet who definitely make this movie worth the time to watch,sad
the great thing to remember is thistheyre many great epics out there that will hold up over the generations it will take the education and guidance of film scholars and revival cinemas to preserve the true masterpieces was meant to be and will always be remembered as 90s overhyped fluff for the teen masses and over 50 year old that wanted a slice of old school hollywood romance on the big screen it is what it is the film is already dated for true romantic epics check out el cid or dr zhivago in closing theres more to great epics than pretty faces and special effects one day the masses will wake up and know a truly great film after its initial release a great film will hold up for decades immediate big box office does not mean long term classic or masterpiece is far from either,sad
a disgrace of a movie that glosses and glamourises an awful disaster bad points cgi work in the first half of the movie is poor and looks like it was created on a basic pcthe acting was dreadfulnobody was good and i mean nobodythe story a love story and a fictitious one at that what next will they have a similar story set against the back drop of 911 in 6070 years time i hope not the fact that deck officer murdoch shot people is not only false and a slur on the name wasnt he a hero in all this mess was superfluous to the plot anyway and just when you think youre watching a tiresome hollywood epic cameron hits us in the guts with shots of an elderly couple embracing death a frozen mother and baby lying in the watergood pointsthe boat going downcameron is a borewhats he done since not a lot and he wont be this big againbest picture oscar 1997 should have been la confidential,sad
a shallow movie about shallow people in deep waterit is a shame that any comments require ten lines of text this movie doesnt deserve that many lines i will go ahead and type until i am able to submit my comments but i hope nobody is still reading this if you have bone beyond the first line you are wasting your time just like you would by actually watching this movie here is a synopsis the girl lives the guy dies and the ship sinks oh and there is a weak love story involved the only thing i can add is that the stupid old woman should have left the rock on the deck of the ship and thrown her own sorry a over the edge of the ship,sad
when this film first came out i was a buff and read as many books and saw as many documentaries on the actual ship as i could get my hands on as i result i realized the great lengths james cameron went to in order to make as historically accurate as possible in terms of the events of the ship itself the film is perfectly done in that way as it is the most realistic film about the ever made in my opinion nevertheless it is not nearly a perfect film and ill tell you why all the young girls in the world will kill me for this but i feel that the film is far too focused on the fictional romance between jack leonardo dicaprio and rose kate winslet this is not the first time a fictional story has found its way into a film take the 1953 version with clifton webb for example being such a buff on the real i did not like how so much of the film was focused on this story what i really wanted was true historical facts about the tragedy shown on film the story does not really need to be spiced up it is tragic and fascinating with tons of little interesting details all on its own it is truly a great story simply written by god himself if you enjoy the romance between jack and rose youre not alone that seems to be why most people love this film nevertheless i found all of the facts about the in this film to be completely accurate and wellportrayed it is a worthwhile film for just about anyone not worthy of all 11 oscars though good will hunting is what should have won that year of course this does have that great original song my heart goes on definitely worthy of its oscar out of ,sad
basically i liked this movie because i like those kinds of fairy talelike stories where two people from a completely different social class meet and fall in love aladdin and pretty woman for instance there is also the bit where each lovers friends try to persuade them to forget one another and this is the bit where i think came the major flaw of the movie the amount of bribery made it quite unreali mean imagine a powerful business tycoon like cal hockley bribes every single steward on the ship to keep jack and rose apart and then tries to kill them out of spite when he learns he wont win rose that was the one thing i absolutely hated and found very unreal about the movie until murdoch threw the bribe in cals face i loved that bit the rest of the characters were very well done as well and i am very surprised billy zane did not receive an oscar nomination for his performanceall in all this movie was and will always be one of the best but i dont think it really deserved the best picture oscar over as good as it gets and the full monty it most probably won all those oscars because of the special effects because kate winslets performance was certainly oscarworthy and she didnt win ironically it went to helen hunt for as good as it gets laughin the end everyone knew the story of the and how it sunk so to me the only special part was the side story jack rose and cal i expected nothing more in my opinion the full monty had a much better and realistic storyline to it but then again since when do comedies even black ones have a chance at the oscars astounding but not flawless 810 stars,sad
james camerons holds up very well indeed after more than ten years since initial release the minuses now are the same as then but they are minor in comparison to the plusses first of all the is one of the grandest tragedies of human history the highest and mightiest could tumble it was an analogy to the state of the world almost like a foreshadowing of the first world war when all that seemed eternal disintegrated with spectacular suddennesscameron approaches the task primarily as a hardware technician the ship looks the way it has to look  grandiose solid lavishly appointed the physical details are spot on down to the last piece of china this all helps the use of cgi during the prolonged sinking is largely state of the art even nowthe idea of putting a story of young lovers at the center of the film is a sound if trite way to give us the universal through the particular the film would have been just as gripping if cameron had chosen a more altmanesque approach whereby a whole group of characters would be given more or less equal weight as they made their way to journeys end here the focus is on the teenage couple unhappy rich girl kate winslet and workingclass bohemian artiste leonardo dicaprio the problem with these usually fine actors is that too often their youthful brio seems forced as if cameron as directorscreenwriter is straining to point out their youth their vitality their exuberance in contrast to winslets stuffy social set which disapproves of their alliance the best acting comes from billy zane as the arrogant sadistic petulant fianc of winslet who stops at nothing to separate her from unwashed upstart dicaprio zane gets it all right including the clipped prep school accent which barely conceals his primal frustrated rage at being trumped by someone from the lower classes dicaprio comes across as a modern suburban high school student playing a street urchin in a drama class presentation there is no real edge to him in fact if the casting had been reversed it would have made much more sense but dicaprios youth looks and agility carry him through the spectacle besides we dont go to spectacles for acting nuancecamerons script isnt as dreadful as some claim but it has significant shortcomings screenwriting was the only major category in which was not nominated for an oscar  and for good reason a bit of working over by a competent script doctor would have made it truer amazingly considering cameron himself has some background in visual arts the situations and dialogue touching on questions of painting are embarrassingly unimaginative and superficial and much of the banter between winslet and dicaprio sounds late 20th century not 1912 the conflict between the haughty firstclass passengers and those beneath them is perhaps overdone frances fisher is touching as winslets socially striving mother for whom we feel both pity and contempt as she pushes her daughter into marriage with a soulless brute gloria stuart as kate winslet grown old and victor garber as the ships designer who sees his master creation ripped asunder also stand out and some of the dinner table conversation in the firstclass dining room is elegant and wittyone implausibility the water temperature of the sea in which the sank was just above freezing no human save an olympic athlete or at least the young and vigorous could have survived more than a few minutes in waters of that temperature survivors relate that the screaming of the passengers who landed in the water when the ship sank subsided after only a few minutes none could survive the water yet kate winslet is seen wading neck deep in this ice bath for minutes on end as she struggles to rescue dicaprio who has been handcuffed to steam pipes in a lowerlevel cabin then the two proceed through endless corridors of freezing water to the deck where they continue on fighting their way through panicked crowds breaking down barriers leaping and scaling heights etc until they finally go down with the ship into the freezing sea where they survive for endless minutes more as they as they cling to debrisa cgi flaw just as false occasionally camerons keyboard tappers and mouse movers add little puffs of computergenerated condensed breath to accompany the exhalations of actors in close up problem is only intermittently does this condensation appear one moment you see it another moment its gonethe interminable loveydovey blatherings between winslet and dicaprio as they float in the ice water quickly wear thin perhaps preteen girls a major component of this films box office would be transfixed by this interlude but surely most adults would be yearning for dicaprios character to die and get it over withand even more dreadful than everything cited above is the treacly our love will go on a pop song belted by celine dion over the closing credits i am sick and tired of contemporary pop songs being tacked on to historical dramasfinally the ultimate film to see on this subject is the legend lives on 1994 a fascinating and moving 4hourplus arts  entertainment channel documentary about the from conception through construction through destruction aftermath and culturalhistorical legacy more emotionally involving and fascinating than camerons movie it will stay with you for a long time,sad
is an excellent film by director james cameron and is a timeless classic is very historicallyaccurate yet the movie itself is also amazing kate winslet stars as rose a spoiled rich 17yearold girl who rides on the with her first class mother rose fall in love with a boy named jack leonardo dicapprio to her mothers and her fiances great disapproval the end is tragic and heartbreaking yet beautiful winner of best picture at the academy awards in 1997 is a true masterpiece and will be enjoyed by anyone who watches itrating pg13 for disasterrelated peril and violence nudity sensuality and brief language 14a can,sad
this movie may be the cheesiest film on the planet but i loved it i dont know if i can express in words how great this movie is all i can really say is this is a film that you will want to share with your grandchildren i will admit there was a corny line or two especially on leo dicaprios character and in my opinion i honestly thought kate winslet out shined dicaprio even though dicaprio did have his share of great moments in the movie i really loved jack dawson but i just felt that his character was almost too one dimensional when i first saw the movie i thought it would be a load of crap boy was i wrong i was so entranced into the love story that i totally forgot that this was so when the iceberg showed up i found myself sort of praying against all logic that somehow would miss the iceberg i even remember leaning to one side of my seat thinking if i did this the ship would miss lol and of course when tragedy struck and the ship was sinking i was really caring for jackrose and all the other passengers and even then i kept thinking maybe it will stop sinking and these poor people wont have to die throughout the rest of the film i was in complete utter shock i dont even think i blinked even when jack died i was in disbelief and in my head i was screaming along with rose for jack to wake up the only time i cried in the film was at the very end of the movie when you see the morphing into a new and pristine state and you see all the passengers inside greeting rose as she comes in then jack extends his hand to her and they share a passionate kiss and everyones clapping i was uncontrollable and the tears just kept coming i thought it was perfect to end the film on such a bittersweet note and that music playing in the background just made my heart flutter this is a movie you must see before you die,sad
for weeks after seeing the film whenever i heard on the radio the flute introduction to my heart will go on celine dion i became tearyeyed so i guess i am a sentimentalist i think james cameron delivered a unique technicallybrilliant period piece that could touch the heart and inform audiences about some significant features of a longforgotten erafor one this time period was marked by severe class distinction i believe that in 1900 1 of the usa population controlled 99 of the wealth britain of course had always been a society where the privileged were noted by everything from their manner of dress hat style speech patterns and clubs where they drank the film shows the severe gap between the wealthy firstclass passengers and those in steerage where jack was lodged some have argued that poor jack would never have gotten near rose a second time but remember rose is a rebel theres the basis for the relationship and what better way to illustrate the snobbery of class distinction than by having jack sit down to dinner with the crusty industrialists also many on the were on their way to the new world for great opportunities they had a great struggle note the passengers who could neither read nor write english but they came anyway to escape the oppression of cruel power struggles in europethe sheer folly  and tragedy  of piling through iceberginfested waters in a large awkward vessel is explained and demonstrated very clearly in case anyone is still trying to figure it outthis film is on my imdb top20  httpwwwimdbcommymovieslistl8401903 yikesi realized i better get busy and finally write a review but i will admit that some shortfalls in screenplay prevent it from usurping citizen kane amadeus or sir david leans entries as a true cinematic masterpiece note that i said screenplay  not acting for actors can only deliver the lines on the page i have always loved part1 much more than part2 i think that has to do with the mix and editing particularly involving the final scene with jack and rose a few snips here and there would have reduced the melodramatic element overall a little less of the love story and more development of some other characters would have elevated the presentation my take is that the screenplay missed  but not by much the result was a brilliant piece of cinematography that could not field any major players as viable candidates for oscars in actinghaving said that there is so much to recommend this fine film i was very moved by the way cameron had his cast assemble for a sort of curtaincall within the movie  havent seen that before very unique and effective910  canuckteach ,sad
ok so yesterday was valentines day my friends and i were talking about the most romantic scenes in cinema historydeserved it yes am talking about the scene rosekate winslet walking down the stairway and is kissed on the hand by jackleonardo dicaprio yes that topped are list of the most romantic scene ever and another very beautiful scene is when they are standing on the railing right on the edge of thethe ship of dreams spread their hands whoa breath takinganyway coming to the movie its just amazing it was so touching awesome movie both about the fictional love story and the true story put together a great combination it adds an emotional side when the captain realizing that there is no way they can evacuate all these people locks himself up and the man who built the ship designed it also stays back emotions get very high and stress levels are increasing the crowd going wild the crew unable to control them and one of the crew members kills two people who were desperate to get on to life boat then the crew member salutes his fellow crew and kills himself this movie shows the discrimination between the rich and the poor during those times there is this one part where 3rd class people are trying to get out but are locked and this little girl asks her mom why they arent being allowed to go and the mother replies saying that the first class people go and then they will be allowed to go and the little girl smiles at her mom a very touching movie this is one of the best movies ever madei can watch it again and againthe only reason i dont give it a 10 is because i feel they dragged it a bit when the was going to sink otherwise its simply superb,sad

this movie is brilliant i only understood this movie when i was 9 but from then on it has remained one of my favouritesgreat acting threw the whole movie leornado and kate were brilliant as jack and rosethe love story of jack and rose is simply beautiful it was a dream love story that you could only wish for until the hit the ice berg and then while the chaos was going on there love for each other shined threw any guy who cares for a girl so much that he helps her to surive yet puts himself at risk of death is beautiful what made this movie special is the love story the love story made the movie not so predictable because you didnt expect there to be this different side of it we all know what happened to the ship but we didnt know about this romance whether it was non fictional or fictional by the end i was in tears because of how sad it was but also because of how beautiful it was from the plot to the acting to the writing the movie was just beautiful,sad
this movie is definitely one of my all time favorites i saw it in the theater when i was young and didnt really appreciate it then i do now its simply stunning some of the best costumes sets and special effects i have ever seen especially the final horrific demise of the luxury linerfrom the moment the passengers board the ship to the first moment when jack and rose meet as he tries to keep her from committing suicide i am entranced its stupid but every time i pray the ship dosent sink from then on its very emotional and i cry every time jack dies and of course the unforgettable moment when rose returns the heart of the ocean to the seaspectacular i highly recommend it,sad
the shipwreck of the is one of the greatest sequences ever directed the editing tense score and the performances of winslet and zane are all topnotch if the whole movie was from the beginning of the shipwreck to the final ending this would be one of the greatest films ever made but with everything that came before that its just a very good filmtheirs nothing really wrong with the beginning but the anticipation of the sinking makes me continuously look at the clock the script is kinda cheesy but it fits camerons glamorous direction perfectly some of the best production design ever winslets best and her only great performance dicaprio is weak but their chemistry together is great zane gloria stuart and kathy bates are all great supporters,sad
upon pure ocean waters a ship of dreams set sail unsinkable the soared gently across the sea unknown to all surroundings this pearl ship was frail a glistening beauty underneath heavens lusting sky while straying gently into the darkened night of destructionelaborate stars shined romantically over the vessel as night was brought upon and destiny awaited heavens gates slowly opened up as god stated follow the golden stairway and silently he waited while heavens angels where brought to him abovehitting a deathly iceberg slowly began to sink leaving many souls trapped upon the beautiful ship as silently with no one around this boat went down and with an oceans wave gods angels began to drown as they gave there hearts to the weeping oceanthe lost souls of now travel upon the ship still seeking misery for the death of there hearts floating within the waters accepting there fate while many still live on with there soul mate as they dance as souls across the ballroom floor,sad
ok so ive seen this movie like a million times but i still love it it is one of my favorite movies i love leonardo dicaprio i am obsessed well any way i really like this movie i like how everything is so real i find it amazing that they filmed this movie in a large pool and that some of the life boats and props were made by the manufactures that made the real ones for the actual if you havent seen this movie then you definitely should especially if you like leo like i do this movie won 11 oscars movie summary this is a fantastic movie about two lovers on the unsinkable ship the ss jack dawson and rose dewitt bukater are the main characters jack is a poor third class passenger and rose is a rich first class passenger rose is engaged to a mean rich man named cal rose and jack meet and fall in love in less than a day they spend time together and fall more in love rose tries to break away from this intense feeling but cannot because her feelings for jack are too strong everything is going almost perfect until the ship begins to sink the two lovers have an amazing and suspenseful adventure but to find out the end of this amazing tale watch trust me you will love it if you dont then dont take my advice ever again but u most likely will love it,sad
this film is about rose dewitt bukater a rich girl and jack dawson a poor boy who both fall in love on the ship in which it sank in 1912this is a very wonderful film with great romance and peril the special effects are terrific in the film its top notch with the action scenes and keeps the suspense going on the film well thats the second half of the filmthe first half is a great romance we see rose when she old obviously she survived and shes telling the tale to ones who want to seek treasure in the ship they dont believe her but as she tells the story they doi wasnt some of the millions who have seen this movie in the theater because i was practically five and there was no way that i would recognize this film now that ive finally seen the whole film ive always seen the ending but never the whole movie i loved it i thought the first hour was going to be a waste because i dont imagine a film going 3 hours long unless the sinking occurs in the end but it occurred in the second half of the filmthe acting by leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet are great they have great chemistry in the film and others like billy zane and kathy bates are good toothis is one of the best films ever it has great action scenes and is a great tale of romance and should be seen by people who likes watching movies,sad
james cameron crafted a masterpiece with his surely to become a classic in the same class as gone with the wind the has something for everyone the movie is filmed on a colossal scale and the special effects are stupendous and very believable this romantic documentary of the tragedy underscores humankinds vulnerability to nature even in the light of new technology the and its sister ships were the latest technology of the times but were no match for the unforgiving forces of the sea and the subtle shortcomings of men the touching intertwined story of rose and jack further add to the meaningfulness of the overall movie the performances of kate leonardo and billy are top notch be prepared to want to see this one over and over again youll notice new details each time congratulations to the cast and crew of,sad
why isnt on the top 250 i just dont know it is by far the most successful film of all time and deservedly so nobody could have captured with such emotion and scope the depiction of what happened in the atlantic 95 years ago except james cameron terminator 3 and this had the same budget  terminator 3 was good but this film blew me away it truly raises the bar for filmmaking and success in the film industry it has been a couple of years since i last saw this film and my memory starts to fail me but you just cant forget some of the special effects on this film and how they changed the world of films monumental images that stick in your mind forever are created with grand scale to breathtaking effect and the film stays emotional throughout its three hours  so you always care this film was made to win oscars and win oscars it did though lord of the rings return of the king managed to win all of its nominations did have 14 nominations and won 11 box office grosses and general audience feelings will always precede as the better film truly a achievement 1010,sad
i only saw this film recently for the first time  and it is awesome leonardo dicaprio is fantastic and totally believable and some of the dialogue between rose and jack particularly where they first meet is hilarious but so natural cal is deliciously evil and the references to somebody picasso and freud made me laugh the one thing i disliked about it was the ending where rose and jack are reunited it would have been so much more powerful if it had been the same scene but in an empty room  the clapping of the rest of the cast doesnt seem to fit apart from that this is an amazing film beautifully filmed and much as i dislike celine dion the music is powerfully emotive,sad
i was looking for the movie on my local library site and at two of the three locations it had been taken out on video and dvdthis goes to prove people still love it i have the dvd 3 disc i didnt even know there was a four disc one but was looking for books on the site this amazes me because that is proof that it is one of the best movies they have made i dont think i saw it until last summer  my friends house then we both went to visit someone who said we were gonna watch it every dayat first i was like oh i dont want to but after we watched it there it was like i needed to watch it during xmas break i watched it 11 times out of 14 days now i watch it every sunday because it sank on a sundayit is one of the best movies you will ever see kate and leo were great the music was spectacular james cameron captured the true reality of the sinkingand the visual effects were also greati love you have to watch it,sad
please could u help me with a music i looked all over for it and i cant find it  in the movie when the ship is sinking  theres this bunch of musicians playing  but then they bid each other farewell and one remains then that one starts to play a very sad violin music  it is abeautiful music but i can find neither its names nor the musicpleeaaaase helpdesperately in need of it  if you know anything about it just send an email to my address  ussrabetter at hotmailcom  or post an answer here ill check it  or post a link where i can find anyway just so i can get the music im an addicted lol help please ,sad
a historical and tragic love story is a movie in its own league everything about itacting visuals scenery music detailis stunning the acting is brilliant and the director james cameron obviously had a clear vision of how he wanted this movie to be made and what he wanted to get across when rose dewitt bukater a wealthy seventeen year old who is engaged to a man against her will and jack dawson an orphaned freespirit meet on the they help each other to grow in life and love their love and fate leave the viewers with both sadness and joy for their love is too strong to have an end kate winslet and leonardo dicaprio give the performances of the century and make you feel for and know rose and jack the music also definitely helps to make the movie you can feel the strings of the violins acting as your heartstrings the flutes bring tears to your eyes and the lighter music free your soul as you smile is a timeless movie and a masterpiece although the separation of jack and rose is disheartening your heavy heart is lifted as you realize that they are eventually reunited and that their fate is to be really and truly together forever,sad
james cameron the director who brought us horror classics such as the terminator and aliens suddenly swings around and gives us what is definitely his greatest achievement yet in a movie that is still quite violent yet about the exact opposite of his previous films a love story about two young people from essentially opposite sides of life meeting on board the illfated ship rmsour cast includes leonardo dicaprio who launched his career with this film academy award nominee kate winslet along with frances fisher bernard hill david warner billy zane and numerous others star in this expansive film that covers nearly every historical detail that is not part of the fictional love story dicaprio did very fine in his role along with winslet gloria stuart was also very good in her role though it was a small onelike all love stories the film includes romantic scenes which are in my opinion some of the best produced in film history we become emotionally attached to the two main characters as they struggle to hold onto each other through the huge disaster the makes its destructive collision against the icebergmade several achievements when it was released it grossed over a billion dollars and is the highest grossing motion picture worldwide of all time it also won eleven academy awards one of only three films to do so it launched the career of leonard dicaprio and kate winslet and it is a very good love story unfortunately it is also a movie that a large portion of the crowd hates its 70 rating on imdb is unfair true its a threehour wait to the credits but i never looked at my watch,sad
i thought this movie was tremendously overrated considering the talent involved it should have been a lot better first of all the movie went on way too long and although both great actors dicaprio and winslett didnt match well together in the kissing scenes i felt like i was watching a boy make out with his mother i read somewhere that the kate winslett role was originally offered to renee zellweger but that wouldnt have mattered because the entire movie was one big yawn there were a few good scenes but this movie should have only been an hour and a half to an hour and three quarters not nearly three hours long i also thought the lighting was really bad and the ship looked really fake in the water scenes i am sure i am in the minority on this but i would rather watch paint dry and listen to music than sit thought this entire movie again,sad
this film is underrated and yet so beautiful in 1997 the world was introduced to a heartbreaking uplifting film which provides you 3 hours and 20 minutes or so with romance adventure danger the spirit of kindness offering the person you love your own life just like jack dawson did for rose i ask you  what more can a movie give you tell me that even the scenes like when rose takes off her clothes and jack draws her naked and the moderatestrong bad language which comes in frequently doesnt put me off i think the certificate shouldve been 15 i personally do not think the mature sequences in this movie are suitable for a big kid aged 12 kate winslet and leonardo dicaprio are the our stars in this outstanding epic their characters are far from similar because rose is rich and she mixes with snobby people and yet she doesnt like them at all and shes also feisty jack is poor and likes to hang out with his mates and despite his rough edges he has a heart of gold he is such a loving selfless young man who even took his own life anyway when rose cant put up with being somebody she doesnt want she bolts out of main restaurant and attempts to commit suicide by jumping off the ship jack sees what shes doing and insists that she doesnt drop off the railing at first she tells him to goaway but he holds out his hand and she gives him her hand she slips and nearly falls into the sea he uses all his strength to lift her back onto the boat from then they gradually fall in love with each other this featurefilm makes me cry big tears every time i see it i sob in the same way a person would do if they were mourning the death of a loved one i feel as if i may not stop crying for at least an hour after the film finishes even some of the scenes that arent sad make me cry like when jack feels upset when rose tries to avoid him because shes engaged to cal hockley a heartless and violent man just to please him but the evening of the day when she tells him not to keep seeing her she has a sudden change of mind and comes to see him at the front of he reaches for her hand and tells her to step up onto the railing let her arms spread out while he supports her and then she believes shes flying and at that point they kiss its shot beautifully against evening pink skies  its just so tearful knowing this couple are sharing their final evening together and sniffles rose says to jack jack when the ship docks im getting off with you sadly what i say is you mean if the ship docks and from there all the tragedy of collision into the iceberg will come in in only a short matter of time when it happens jack is held prisoner right at the bottom of the ship and they leave him there even when the ship is sinking luckily rose comes to his rescue and releases him then as rose is rich and jack is poor rose is forced to board a boat and as it lowers he hand which is holding jacks is pulled away cal hockley menacingly says to jack as she leaves i always win jack  uh not this time buster but she leaps off the lifeboat and runs to his arms he runs to her too and thats also too emotional to be true but theres more tragedy to come when the entire ship sinks to the bottom after the ships arse snaps as that man said at the beginning jack and rose spot a board afloat but its too small for them both so very selflessly jack lifts her onto the board and he stays in the freezing water you have got to promise me that youll survive that youll make babies and watch them grow promise me rose that youll die a little old lady warm in her bed but not here not this night that divorce was the best thing that ever happened to me it brought me to you please make me that promise he kisses her hand for the last time rose later tells jack theres a boat to save them  but he doesnt answer or even move he has frozen to death rose cannot believe it but bravely lets him sink now i know ill cry what a sad movie but despite its trauma is irresistible over 15s wont be able to help but succumb to its beauty far better than the offensive gone with the wind rose may be feisty but shes certainly not a selfobsessed harpy like scarlett ohara and jack dawson is anything but that arrogant cad rhett butler the womanising scumbag is very underrated and gone with the wind is very overrated  absurd but cest la viegloria stuart was 86 when she starred as old rose and with this film she is most associated her final film was lands of plenty in 2004 the following year she contracted cancer but had always appeared well to the public eye she also looked frail in her old age james cameron attended her 100th birthday for a moment i thought shed live forever i am deeply saddened to report that gloria stuart died of cancer last sunday she was 100 years old god love her i showed my mother a beautiful tribute to her on youtube and she revealed that she could feel glorias energy around me she felt her there apparently she put her arm round me then blew me a kiss goodbyea divine and inspirational womangloria stuart4th july 191026th september 2010,sad
first time i watched this film i fell asleep half way throughbecause the first half is complete rubbish dont know how i managed to sit through it all again must have been the triple espresso cups i had lined up the end of this film is the only thing worth watching and the only part i would watch if i ever got round to this film again 3 for the beginning and 8 for the end would be my votes if i could split this film would fall into the same category for me as pearl harbor which has some of the best special effects i have seen during the attack scene but again the film is less than a masterpiece when all elements are combined,sad
1997 people would talk about i would say ive never seen it they would say why wont you see it id say i dont really have anything against seeing it i just dont think ill like it that much i figured it would probably be a 5 or a 6 why spend 3 hours watching a 5 or a 6 when i can pick out any random short movie in the video store and it will probably be a 5 or a 6 well i finally saw it and you know what it was good i had heard a lot of st talked about this movie but on the other hand it won all those oscars i didnt really know what to expect but i gotta say it was pretty good nice acting good plot pretty good character development really a pretty enjoyable watch im not beating myself up for taking so long to watch it or anything but im also glad to finally have it watched710 14 out of 55 movies for 1997 129th of 1990s 367th all time,sad
when i say that i am not kidding anyone had i knew it earlier i will have posted my review here beforehand i had watched it once when it was at the cinemas here and someone i know actually watched more than once watched twice or something when it was on the television here the last time was like few years back on the televisionit goes to show how much i so love the movie despite some may think now its cheesy to bring it up hey this was a box office winner and its still at the top here in terms of ticket earnings for an opening release of a movie from what i know and whenever i heard celine dions my heart will go on i will almost become a drama mama literallyinterstingly i first remembered back then some years back in my school days i was doing a comprehension passage about the cruise liner prior to the movies release and the thing at that time i had never thought much about the comprehension passage i did after that i had never thought that it will become a big blockbuster of the time few years later it came out till i even begged my family that i wanted to go watch it at the cinema which it happened i know its all fiction in the movie about the love story of rose kate winslet and jack leonardo dicapirio before watching itthe entire movie setting is almost perfect and it will almost bring you back of the era when the actual cruise liner had its maiden voyage from southampton to new york even as i was watching each time i had often wished i am boarding a luxury cruise liner still waiting for that day anyone can dreami have to kind of admit interestingly i never cried but just felt deeply moved then towards the end of the movie when i first saw it but subsequently when it was on the television here tears almost started to come out of my eyesalmost a real perfect masterpiece just dont care what others will say,sad
i think this is a very good movie and i got it for my 8th birthday i really enjoy it and hoped they would make a sequel to it i think a sequel would be very enjoyable  my favorite part is when jack and rose are running from the old man that part is always funalso when jack takes rose down to the bottom to the party where they have lots of fun after the stuffy dinner with roses icky fianc i also think it is so sad when the old rose throws her diamond into the sea with jack i always cry when rose lets go of jack im the ocean after he dies  i enjoy this movie very much and recommend it to those of you who havent seen it yet so go and rentbuy it today,sad
has been known as one of the biggest movies of all time and is definitely a classic from the time when you see the famous shipwreck to the very end you will just stare at the screen in awe this is my opinion of the movie and i know that probably many people would disagree with me what more could you ask for in a movie suspense romance some comedy between the conversations of jack and rose drama almost every genre fits it when you first see the drawing of young rose that is found in the safe of the wreck you are confused as to what it might be but find it beautiful just the same hearing that old rose is almost 101 you might find it hard to be realistic but by the end of the movie when jack is making rose promise to go on with her life without him you believe anything this movie has to throw at you when rose calvert begins her story you are shown a young woman who is sick of her first class life and wants to break free from her chains a man named jack dawson is also shown playing a poker game and attempting to win the third class tickets that were bet on the ship of dreams of course rose and jack meet and there is an instant connection and half way through the movie you want nothing more than both of them falling in love after taking rose flying out of her caged life rose and jack do fall in love even thought theyve known each other for only a matter of days while all of this is happening you forget all about the dreadful iceberg that will eventually separate jack and rose physically for good just when you get attached to their story the ship soon begins to sink after watching both characters almost lose their lives in more than one way you eventually witness jack giving up the one space on the floating board so that rose can live in place of him a tearjerker every single time you watch the music alone will just make you start to tear up though the tragedy was unbelievably depressing and leaves you with a heavy heart for days afterward this wonderful recordbreaking oscar winning movie will have your heart now almost 9 years since the movie came out i still love it and i know that it is a movie that i and many others will never tire of for is one of the best films of all time,sad
okay who doesnt know what happened to the raise your hand anyone do we know exactly what happened that night for absolute fact well beyond the fact that the boat hit an iceberg sank and a lot of innocent people died  nowe have pictures and some dishes and some misc items that have survived or been brought up from the sight of the sinking but beyond that we have nothing save our imaginationsthat is what this movie is all about using your imagination taking what we do know about this tragedy and weaving it around a romantic okay and maybe sometimes a bit classically corny romance but what is wrong with a little romance what is wrong with a story about a young rose who discovers the possibilities of her whole life through the chance encounter with a ragamuffin named jack through the sadness of the obvious end of the ship we can see that rose has discovered that life will go on okay borrowed that from the theme song and it can be whatever she wants it to be so she makes the most of itpersonally i love the film whenever i feel like being awed by the beauty of a ship long ago lost amused by the fashions and mannerisms of the characters and romanced by a bittersweet story i sit down and kick back,sad
the movie was a history in itself almost as big as the history of the ship in spite of certain faults no one can deny the magic  aura of the film in spite of being completely mainstream  commercial the movie is in no way inferior to any critical or artistic movie made till date the technicalities are simply perfect special effects will develop with time but that wouldnt make loose its appeal james cameroon has ensured that and then comes the musical score which makes you fly into the world of without actually realizing itmaking a movie better than shall be very difficult the impact of the great tragedy that suffered is magnified and compressed into the span of the movie it hits like a dagger of tragedy still certain factors were missing from the movie and some characters seemed inappropriately described where did spicer lovejoy go in the end why did the captain appear so idiotic during the sinking why didnt jack get a lifebelt,sad
is my all time favourite film i love the film and i love learning the history about it although i am only 14 years old i know more than most 30 year olds about seeing this film has changed my life and i love it to bits thank you james cameron and everyone that went into making such a great film the actors used for this film was terrific option and using this has drawn great attention towards the public for them i now cant stop wanting to see films with kate winslet in them has such a dramatic ended and consistency of greatness throughout it thats why i love so much also because of leonardo dicaprio he is absolutely gorgeous and i love it when he has his top off i strongly suggest that you buy as well the limited editions on dvd of this fantastic film as it tells you a lot about how they made the film and it is truly an honour to watch it,sad
still remain the best movie i have ever seen everything was so great about the movie thank you james for making this brilliant movie this movie is not only foe gals and gay people but straight guys would love it as well it mixed suspense and romance so well whoever who wrote the story should also get the credit the screenplay was awesome kate did a great acting the scene where she was stuck in the water in the end was great so did billy what impressed me most was leos acting he proved that he was not just a pretty boy in the movie other things such as make up and costume was also very impressive it deserve all the oscar it won raj thelousyllamayahoocom,sad
has to be one of the best movies i have ever seen i didnt watch it for a while  i honestly didnt see what the fuss was about however my brother bought it and persuaded me to watch it and i must have seen it at least 100 times sincei love the main storyline between jack and rose although some write this love story off as sappy typical predictable hollywood it pulls my heartstrings every time i watch it the beauty of two people so in love they will do anything to save each other especially when rose jumps out of the lifeboat to go to jack she knows she may die and would have been safe on the lifeboat but she doesnt care this scene always brings a tear to my eyes and on jacks death i am always bawling my eyes out every single time i also love how well the is recreated from the interior and design to the dramatic sinking you feel you are there and feel the fear of the thirdclass people locked up the terror of rose and jacks dramatic escape and most importantly the love between the two principal characters i didnt know much about the ship before but now am inspired to find out as much as possible a truly classic film with beautiful story lines amazing history and gorgeous music that fits the scene perfectly fave scenes jack and rose flying her jumping out of the boat the two running through the ship and the very end where she is reunited with her love no criticisms best film ive seen and im not too scared to admit it watch it  you wont regret it,sad
an astoundingly brilliant film that must be seen by all movie fans raised the bar significantly with a perfect combination of special effects and emotion thanks to great acting by leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet its easy to see that the 2 of them had a great on and off screen chemistry the success of the film however is down to james camerons meticulous direction and dedication undoubtedly his best film at a cost of 200m it was the most expensive film ever made when released in 1997 when watching the film i forget that the ship is mainly computer generated and the waves arnt real i was swept along by the sheer spectacle of the film three hours of film that never leads the audience astray and has a final one and a half hours that is the most gripping of any epic i have ever seen the most successful film of all time doing 18 billion at the box office world wide and winning 11 oscars it deserves all the success it has had and is a true masterpiece if you havent seen it see it ps get the special edition dvdpreferably 5 disc,sad
colossalexitingfantastic i saw it yesterday on tv for the ten time i thinkand i like it more and morejames cameron with a very simple plot has made a masterpiecealso leornardo dicaprio and kate winslet have made a great workalso katie bates and billy zane of course the special effects are fantasticlike all the details i recommend this for anyone who liking endless love storieswith a historical sceneryif this is one of your favorite filmsyou should search for the special edition on dvd if you like thisyou surely like moulin rougelove storycasablancamy english is not so goodim italian,sad
an amazing film jc did a terrific job leonardo was great kate was great billy kathy victor all of the actors in this film did a perfect job james also did a fantastic job with all of the emotion the romance the fear the conflict it was perfect has got to be my favorite picture i own it and have seen it at least 30 times and every time i cry so much its one of those films where even though you know what happens youre sitting there going turn turn turnits not going to hit this time you just hope that maybe this time the film will change and you wont need a whole box of kleenex perfect film,sad
is not without serious flaws such as bad dialouge and stuff i see many people just love to bash the movie well they seem to forget that for six months this movie was all anyone could talk about it was a phenomenon that took the world by storm i remember i saw it with my parents and there was not a dry eye in the theater not one by the end of the movie the first hour and half is slow but works it is a good love story which is obviously half the reason why the film succeeded because women loved it i mean it is a very tragic story by the second half however we see some of the best scenes in movie history the audience literally feels what it was like to be on that ship while it was sinking it is a terrifying hour as we watch people drown die we see kids being separated from their fathers we see the sheer ruthless ness of the officers as they try to keep order on the ship we see the third class get locked down below the ship like animanls not even given a chance to survive the effects were excellent the scenes that were effect shots were so perfect that you could not tell they were effect shotsto bash this film and say it is horrible is flat wrong the movie works and i will be the first to say gender does not matter because i am a guy and i think the movie was pretty good,sad
when i first heard about this film i was sceptical to say the least especially with leonardo di caprio as the lead this was back in the day when i was young and stupid and thought you only went to a di caprio film because your girl friend wanted to see it but when i actually did go and see the film with my then girl friend incidentally i was amazed i thought it was a fantastic filmi know the films critics claim that it centres too much on the relationship between rose and jack but thats what makes it so effective at the end you know the two characters and share their grief as the ship is sinking it really showed you what it was like for the people on board something that just showing you the facts of the sinking would not have done in this particular sense i would compare to blackadder goes forth an english tv sitcom set in wwi in as much as it may not be historically perfect although from what i gather is not by any means historically flawed but it gives you a better idea of what the victims of and of the 1st world war actually went through than any text book ever willthe characters may not be as in depth as some people would like but this is what ties them to the audience they are normal people and on the most part realistic of what people of that period would have been likei recommend this film to anybody i think most people would agree it is not in the greatest film in history but it would certainly figure in my top 5,sad
has been one of my most enjoyable movies i have ever watched i remember the day it came out in theaters in 1997 i went and watched it 10 times at the theater when the movie came out on vhs i had all ready ordered it because i was in love with kate winslet and i thought she was the most beautiful actress now i have 3 sets of the movie 1 i have the vhs 2 i have the regular dvd and 3 i have the collectors edition dvd i have always wanted to meet kate winslet and james cameron because james cameron is one of the most inspiring directors to me and since i want to become a director of films that really means a lot people really dont see the as i do you see i respect the meaning of the actual ship and of course the movie i will one day go and see the face to face in the future but until then i give all my greatness to the cast and crew of the movie,sad
ive been a fan of for 8 years now and i just cant get enough of it i am currently working on a scifi film for the boys and girls club of america about themy recommendation is anyone who likes history thrown together with a love story than this is definitely the film for youor you can admire the over detailed sets they built for the filmi was amazed when i learned that they built an almost full sized replica of the ship its just a pity they had to tear it downanyhow back to my film projecti would say anyone who loves be it real or film see this movie,sad
leo is a good actor he has a good character the ship is good because the beginning was a real ship footage is the ship of dreams especially the beginningthe iceberg has nice work of special effectsthis film i enjoyed because of the story so long something you never expect it to happen the ship sinksjack dies of cold and rose says she will never let go deep sea explorer dr brock lovett bill paxton leads a team to search for a fabled diamond rumoured to have been lost when the sank using both a submarine and remotecontrolled robot submersibles they explore the ghostly wreck concentrating on the guestrooms of the first class passengers retrieving a safe believed to contain the jewel they are disappointed to find only papers and a drawing however the picture depicts a nude young woman wearing the jewel when he discovers that the woman is still alive  lovett brings her to the exploration ship hoping that her recollections may help him find his treasure her memories transport her back to the final days of the first and last voyage,sad
is probably one of the best movies ive seen or maybe it could be the best one everplot  rosekate winslet goes aboard the to go to united states of america for her wedding with calbilly zane aboard the enormous she meets a young man named jackleonardo dicaprio who changes her whole way of life and they end up falling for each other but unfortunately their time didnt last long roses parents tried to separate the two lovebirds and along with that the hits the iceberg and the ship sinks what happened was that roses parents thought of separating them by setting jack up they made rose think that jack stole the heart of the ocean jewel necklace that cal gave to rose soon rose realizes that jack didnt steal the necklace and hurried up to rescue him from his prison afterwards they were running swimming and dashing for their lives as the decks and rooms fill up with cold icy waters of the atlantic ocean in the end of the movie jack dies and rose lives rose did everything that jack told her to do in her life then one night rose was reunited with her true lovethis plot is truly amazing not only it shows how the people aboard the had panicked died and fled it also shows a heartwarming story of lovemusic  the music of is truly amazing the music was perfect for each setting of the movie celine dions my heart will go on is perfectly amazing i still listen to it characters  well all i could say is that the characters of the movieor if you would prefer the actors and actresses were very good leonardo acts very well for jack and as do kate winslet for her characterthis movie is truly amazing thats all i could say this is james cameron at his very best yet the and all the effects looks really realistic everything is amazing this is a mustsee movie ,sad
i have waited several years to attempt to review this film for several reasons i wanted to have my thoughts completely in order i didnt want to join either side of the debate here one side feels as though this film is the greatest of all time the other comes with a force of backlash the size of the tidal wave in the abyss well now nearly a decade later i write my thoughts i like many males my age am a huge james cameron fan i absolutely love aliens the abyss and the terminator films i feel as though he has an amazing eye for how the action in the scene needs to be conveyed on the screen he has a very unique and complete imagination and an unbelievable work ethic to boot nothing in regards to these points changes in he is on his game and he deserved everything he got back this film is truly one of the greatest risks in all of film just take the postman for example the postman was released this same year and went down in history as one of the biggest box office flops of all time and is regarded by a harsh majority as one of the worst movies of all time as well yet kevin costner worked hard and a lot of money was spent in order to create the film so why did camerons film fare so much betterjames cameron involved more viewers with this source material than his other projects had he still integrated amazing visuals and top notch effects into his film to please the male 18 to 30 crowd yet the inclusion of a grand and harrowing love story caught the interest of female and older viewers as well this is not a sell out if you listen to james cameron speak about this film his interest was completely emotional from the beginning i cant imagine how he mustve felt observing the remains of the great ship laying silently at the bottom of the sea knowing how many died and how many lives were changed when it sank i feel as though he achieved his ultimate goal when he made the action scenes here were a necessary tool in order to tell his human story to maximum effect not the human story being necessary in order to tell his action story as is usually the case with his films i feel as though he did a very good job with this changeas for any clichs honestly i dont see any there of course is the usual story devices used to get characters into conflict but lets be honest people this film has no more a hollywood clich as say a movie likegood will hunting so lets put that backlash theory to rest also ive heard quite a bit of talk about historical inaccuracies in this film im sure that there are quite a few so i wont even attempt to argue i will however point out that other historic epics have made great films with this same problem and havent seen nearly half the backlash that did take gladiator braveheart or even a more intimate movie like cinderella man all great all historical all inaccurate so who really cares is it a well made movie thats all that really matters is a well made movieis by no means perfect it is not the greatest film of all time in my opinion but no one can argue that this film will go down in history as a great achievement a very rare diamond in the rough that achieves box office glory critic applause and a large trophy cabinet for new viewers of this film watch only on the merits that are presented to you on the screen forget what the pro and con people have to say forget how much it made how many awards it won and how historically accurate it is just let it in my guess is that you will enjoy yourself afterall this is nearly required viewing anyway ps after almost ten years i still feel as though the music in this movie is as good as it can get james horner does an amazing job creating a timeless back drop of music that will help carry this film through the ages910,sad
i think this movie is the best especially with leonardo dicaprio hes an great actor very very very very very very very good good good good movie the besti like it a lot and everybody did an good part and it was also sad how it all happen i thought about if it really happen as a love story like that i was crying in that movie when all that happen especially when lenardo dicaprio diei like it and hes so cute toohe the best actor and the movie is one of a kind the best part is the love the saddest is when the boat sink and every thing that happens all the death and everything that happens is sad and so true like that alllives,sad
this movie was one of the best movies i have ever seen its a tale of love and tragedy this movie is amazing i love the story line jack and rose belong together i love the ending with the part about the heart of the ocean and people who have seen this know what im talking about jack has such a good outlook on life its great the was a awful mistake many people died and seeing what happened on the ship was amazing i definitely recommend the movie it has a great story line and lots of action this movie game a whole new perspective look on life this movie is the best movie i have seen in a long long time is a wonderful movie that makes you fall in love with the characters,sad
i first went to see this movie when i was eight years old because i was young i did not get the concept of the movie therefore i did not fall in love with the characters as i did when i got older the characters are jack dawsonleonardo dicaprio a poor man who won two tickets on by having a luckily hand in poker his friend fabrizio an italian man accompanies him during the trip jack saves a woman named rosekate winslet who was attempting suicide as a reward roses fianc cal invites jack to dinner along with them and the first class during the next day rose gets to know this man who saved her and she finds to love him and not her fianc towards the ending when the ship is sinking rose must choose between her rich fianc cal or the man she loves jack although this may seem as a sappy love story it is still really about the unsinkable ship tianic the ship and its passengers has been one of the most intriguing things that ive ever studied as the ship is sinking they only let women and children on to the lifeboats first but then they do not let out the people 3rd class and you see a woman telling her children a bedtime story because she knows that there is just no hope of surviving this movie will make your eyes water if the least its a long but very good movie i have seen it about 6 or 7 times and i still cry every time james cameron has done a great job on this movie without the music and the actors this movie wouldnt of been the same,sad
unfourntunatly with how good this movie is it really never reached the mainstream attention that a movie with a budget like this deserves or expects when i mention people say oh you mean the one with josh hartnet and usually i say well no you must be thinking of tora tora tora this little known example of leondaro dicaprios debut into film showcases what range he has as an actor as is the case with many he had to start small using this small independenttype film as a jumping board to get into the mainstream attention best of luck to leo before i saw this movie i never had seen any scenes involving jack and rose every moment from the start was new to me and made me realize exactly how much i didnt know until about the movie until i saw it on the screen its very sad and a few people i know actually admitted to crying  when it was over i know but the emotion doesnt take away from the neat little motion picture the most remarkable thing about this film was its charm and slow yet deliberate pacing the subtle climax blew me off my feet and not spoil anything spoiler alert when the gasp boat sank i did not see that cominganyway in all if you want to take the time to travel a little off the beaten path take a look at and amaze your movie buff friends when they say heard of james camerons first picture youll say hell yes,sad
this is one hell of a movie the acting was bloody brilliant and the storyline was good it also had some sad parts such as when rose tries to get jack to wake up because the boat has arrived and discovers that he has died and when she lets go of him she stares at his face as he sinks down to the bottom i actually cried after watching this it was actually pretty cool when the guy on the new boat asks what roses name is she says rose rose dawson that proved how much she loved him basically this is a great movie to watch and you can see what kind of thing happened when the real was sinking i give this movie 1010 all the way,sad
although this is a fictional account of the event i feel it is perhaps the best portrayal of life and times of the era it is a strong warning against overconfidence in our technical abilities and human pride to solve every problem and prevent disaster ignoring iceberg warnings and failure to take precautions even in matters of the ships design and number of lifeboats depict human error as the frequent cause of failure it is mans greatness pales in the face of nature and natures godone cannot relate to history without putting a face on it kate winslets beautiful face and the others do the job superbly everything about this film is wonderful including the writing photography and acting instead of dry textbooks school children should view this with some precautions against nudity and unnecessarily strong language i find the story very satisfying cleverly executed and highly informative no doubt this will be a perpetual monument to that unsinkable ship and all those who died,sad
the sheer scale of is enough to make your jaw drop from the time it starts its maiden voyage to its devastating final hoursthe acting is good and i think that overall the cast have done an admirable job of showing the attitudes of the different classes and have brought sensitivity to their roles at appropriate times kate winslet rose particularly excels  her accent never seems to falter and she makes herself believable to the audience as a sort of rebellious first class passenger gloria stewart as the older rose is also excellentanother thing that i liked about was the music james horners score is both beautiful and dramatic and really wraps up the film and yes my heart will go on is pretty good tooalthough some more historic detail might have made the film that little bit better or perhaps even a note at the end giving a little more information about the actual catastrophe i think james cameron has done a commendable job of bringing the tragic disaster to the screen in addition to this its a fine love story with likable and abhorrent characters great cinematography and a bit of tension and suspense too plus leonardo dicaprio an impressive film to watch,sad
this movie touched my heart the way james cameron put the movie together so beautifully was very unimaginable kate winslet lit up the screen when she played rose dewitt bukater a young rich girl with a very strong passion and leanardo dicaprio although not a very big fan of him showed magnifinacly in the movie playing jack a poor young boy with a great artistic talent he seeked adventure and challenges and one of those challenges was to have rose for him the movie showed surprises one after another keeping the three and a half hours entertaining the most memorable scenes were when dicaprio and winslet were standing at the edge of the ship as if to fly away together whenb the sank it gave me shrivels up my spine never before had i ever seen anything so dramatic and horrific but of course it would not be without the sinking the special effects were unbelievable the movie let you see out of the peoples eyes as the ship sank you can almost hear the hearts pounding of the crew when the hit the ice berg the love story makes this movie what it is the music gave the movie extra sadness as celine dion sings my heart will go on rose and jack stick together as the ship sinks never letting goone last words  it is the ship of dreams,sad
is a romantic tearjerker set in 1912 based on of course the ill fated voyage leo dicaprio and katen winslet play two young loversleo a little too young lookingaboard the unsinkable shipthe relationship between leo and kate felt a little rushed at times but i suppose they had to skip to the most predictable part of the movie when the ship sankjames cameron spent 200mil making this flick so yes the visuals of the sinking ship are spectacular you go back and forth between the suspencefull scenes seeing leo and kate trying to escape the ship from the insidecameron at his best and the eye candy moments of seeing helpless passengers falling off the ship thats suspended in mid airsure the end of the movie is sad but it wouldnt have been at all without the brilliant music by james horner camerons script is quite empty and flat actually the movie soundtrack is more worth your money than the movie is i give it a 69 out of 10,sad
as a lifelong holder of minority opinions much of my time is spent baffled in wonderment as to how a seemly intelligent person couldve paid good money to go see the english patient twice during its original run or says love story is the greatest romantic movie ever made or who prefers the original oceans eleven to the remake and one of the biggest thorns in my side about movies is this piece of garbage which trivializes the catastrophe that was the sinking of the by making it a turbulent backdrop for a badlyderived romeo and juliet ripoff pretty boy pauper sees rich kid rosie or whatever her name was and goes dude i have got to tap dat with a little help from kathy bates he convinces her to slum it with him in the steam room in perhaps the most gratuitous sex scene that made lonely women go ohhhh in years then the boat sinks several thousand people die but the real victim says cameron is the girl because she must live on with the memory of that blond piece of ass she shagged on the boat i think what pisses me off most about this movie besides the fact that if the girl had scooted over on that bit of wood a little bit she couldve shared it with the man she supposedly loved or they couldve taken turns in the water but god forbid she get her dress wet is the fact that the story really had nothing to do with the boat they couldve made up a fictional boat crash and it not only wouldve been more appropriate but it wouldve made more sense and that celine dion song maybe the worst ive heard since art garfunkels bright eyes if i was being forced to patronize a stuck up right chick when all i wanted was to get under her corset and listen to that damn song all the time id be happy when the boat sank,sad
i must be so far out of touch with the rest of the world as i cannot understand at all why this piece of garbage was so popular when i first saw it in its first week of release at manns chinese theater in la i was about to walk out but my wife stopped me i was virtually shouting at the screen by the last 30 mins which was the most excruciating film watching experience of my life when kate winslet utters the words i saw the iceberg and now i see it in your eyes i was screaming in pain this film is an utter load of bilge at the time i was really angry that i had wasted my time and money on this unmitigated  unrelenting dung james cameron is just a competent technician nothing more there is no art in this stuff aliens was a ripoff of a really good movie alien same basic story but without the suspense and existential exploration and a bunch of spielbergesque kiddie crap  a bigger budget blown on americanmilitaryindustrial advertising see the alien dvd and listen to ridley scotts commentary and understand the difference between scott an artist and cameron an engineerhas no redeeming features whatsoever it has had no lasting impact on our culture and has done nothing to help us understand the tragedy of the sinking or anything dont encourage this garbage by renting the dvd or vhs or even looking at the poster hell why are you even reading this review on imdb,sad
well im a teenage boy who should be enjoying films like xxx and tomb radier whilst romantic films should not even figure on my list of films to watch but i cannot deny is one of the best films ever made and if ever a film was beautiful this one is it firstly kate winslet and leonardo di caprio played their roles phenomonly i truly believed they were a real couple in love this makes the rest of the film fantastic since now we believe in and care about the characters the rest of the film flows as beautifully as the model 34 size reconstructions of the itself sailed the script is witty interesting and engaging you truly feel for the characters and are entrapped into their situation whilst the film enables you to symathise with the real survivors by shifting from modern day to 1912 the sinking scenes oops have i given anything away p  are truly astounding and beautifully directed if cameron could get any better after t2 he did a good job of attempting it here in short this is not your typical romantic drama it is a proper masterpiece both in directing script writing characters and acting and deserved every single one of its oscars and should remain in the film history books this is one film that didnt sink at the cinema a success jas,sad
i used to be one of those who absolutely were not interested in seeing the movie but as it was on telly i decided to watch anywayand look how wrong i am i even gave it 4 stars now the story itself is one without surprises as after all its about a boat that hit an iceberg and i knew before that its the kind of movie at where housewives are searching for handkerchiefs but the truth is that james cameron the terminatorman has used all hollywoodcliches in the best way that can be used the special effects are enormous and the interaction between leonardo and kate is one of a rare breed and no i am not a leonardofan at all perhaps the whole thing was a bit too commercialised but so was gone with the wind and its not the best movie ever and even 11 oscars was a bit too much but absolutely worth 4 hours of your life,sad
james camerons struck a chord with movie goers of all ages for one simple reason  it moved as corny and implausible as the screenplay is cameron nevertheless seamlessly weaved historical fact with soap opera fiction to create a movie that hearkened back to hollywoods golden age is the equal of gone with the wind not by several knots but it is a monumental production by any standards and in 1997 was the most sensational thing to come down the pike since the glory days of david o selznick  and david lean is a grand immensely entertaining extravaganza,sad
its been almost six years since the release of and there are still two views on it love it hate it inevitable i suppose with a movie like this a lot of the complaints go to the script the romance leo dicaprio everyone is entitled to their opinion of course and those who hate it will probably never love it i do however think that the success of the movie is justified bashed before it was even released it didnt sink like many predicted it would the main reason for this may be the fact that this movie brought to life the actual tragedy of what happened to the ship in 1912 it isnt so much about how shallow the script was  the ship and its passengers were brought to life the passengers were shown as real human beings like you and me who had hopes and aspirations tragedies usually get typecast for the number of victims and we tend to forget that each of those numbers was a person with a story the movie placed the viewers on that ship and made us feel with the people aboard the fictional story of jack and rose  which imho is a moving love story  gave us an emotional focal point and made the tragedy much more personal you may hate the film and its actors although they are all perfectly cast and superb actors not just in but the tragedy of what happened and the idea that life is there to be lived no matter what fate may have in store for you is what makes this movie special and appealing1010 overall,sad
james cameron did make a few really good movies but hes certainly not a halloffamer so is not this movie its pathetic hugely overrated and most of all  average like one of the reviewers said it shouldve been a stylish english drama but it became an american kitsch pulp barbieoffilm please mr cameron leave historic drama to bbc or at least to spielberg and start making sciencefiction again compared to gladiator this flic looks like dallas vs i claudius,sad
love story with a famous historical backdrop remarkably wellgroomed steerage class passenger catches the eye of beautiful haughty first class passenger aboard a doomed ocean liner technically excellent film sunk by soap opera script inane plot and televisionquality acting rating b,sad
as the movie prepared to open to audiences i only had one objective i wanted to see how james cameron recreated the disastrous sinking like never before there had been movies before which were very good but this was the first time technology would make the sinking look real and as accurate as possible cameron had tons of research and actual scientific knowledge available to him to tell the story and how it happened we know now for example that the broke in twoa fact that was not yet known in the 1950s when two movies were released my feeling on camerons movie was i just want to see how he recreated the disasterwhat i found was a pleasant surprise more than a special effects success i was drawn in by the fictitious story of jack and rose iconoclast viewers brushed off the romantic story like a flake on a blue suit but it struck me differently i thought about the totality of the 1500 lives that jack and rose represented i thought about how many couples that really loved each other like jack and rose did that perished in freezing waters i thought about the terror that must have possessed so many as they waited to die in the freezing darknessthe movie was powerfully realized and although there were no oliviers or brandos in the cast the acting was realistic and solid enough to invoke empathy for all of the characters it may not be the guy thing to say but i have to admit to choking a bit when angled ready to sink to its destiny and watching the hundreds of passengers desperately cling to their last moments as best as possible never have i seen a movie create despair so tangibly ive always been a buff i dont know why but i know that for me story always held a certain mystique and sense of awe  and this was years and years before camerons movie hit the big time for me the movie remains a moving triumphant experience i cant help but feel cameron captured my perception of the mystique and put it on film for all to see let the magic sweep you away to a time and ship long gone,sad
being the most expensive most publicized and highest grossing film of all time at least as of 2003 who knows what the future holds is one of those films that can either be loved by softhearted individuals who love a good story or a wellmade piece of cinema or hated by movie buffs who consider it overrated personally i think its a little of bothessentially the real winner of the film is obviously the cinematography and the visual effects the sinking of the ship is truly a masterpiece of realism and is a shocking perspective on what the sinking of the actual ship might have been likebut aside from the technical side the film is nothing more than a simple love story and it is actually quite badly portrayed the terribly over played comments on class structure and the neverending possibilities of love clash extremely sharply with the very under played relationship between jack and rose there is never a spark between them and it seems such a short period of time between jack talking rose out of killing herself and the two suddenly copulating in the back of somebody elses car in the hold of the ship its almost as if james cameron couldnt decide which elements of the film to overdwell on and which to just touch upon because the development of the relationship is one that he could easily have stressed more definitelythe performances as well leave something to be desired while i have been a longserving advocate against the talents of leonardo dicaprio this movie is in my opinion easily his worst he lacks all the elements that make up a classic film character charisma empathy and credibility as so often ruins a good performance throughout the entire movie he is making such an obvious effort to act and it is so apparent visually that the character is lost and apart from that it is not a difficult role to play on the other hand kate winslet is better although not brilliant she does have charisma and empathy and we can enjoy the character of rose a lot better the minor characters are another good element of the film they dont sparkle but they fill in the story nicely as minor characters are supposed to do jonathan hyde is excellent as the ships designer i felt truly sorry for him when the news is finally broken to him that the is not as previously thought unsinkableoverall is a behemoth of filmmaking but that is not quite enough to make it a true classic it seems too cute too much like a daytime soap opera to make it a milestone of cinema is impressive nothing more and while i quite enjoyed watching it it can never be more than a three star film for me,sad
my best comment for this was that offered by my then 13 year old granddaughter when one of her friends gushed over it her only reply was let me guess theres either a rich boy and poor girl or a rich girl and poor boy the ship sinks one of them dies right there are so many great real stories to be told of the why do almost all film makers feel compelled to invent a contrived maudlin story lineof course unlike her friend my granddaughter already knew the stories of the strausses wallace hartley john astor benjamin guggenheim molly brown and so many othersif james cameron had simply chosen to use all his skill and special effects budget to tell the sort of honest story told in a night to remember it wouldve been an alltime great as it was it alternated between brilliant and annoying,sad
rent it if you have a dollar or two and 3 hours to give upive seen this movie roughly 4 times and thats all the chances im giving it  to me this movie is pure eyecandy  its beautiful simply amazing to look at and if youre deafit might be a good film  everyone in the cast is a fantastic actoractress  but leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet turn in the worst performances of their careers  i watched them in embarassment a bad car accident on film actually a boat disasterthats not to say the film lacks any emotion  i felt for everyone on the ship except jack and rose  what really makes my stomach turn is the entire cast and crew not minding that this is a fictional story set in historic facts  its rearranging history and i do hope future generations dont see it this way  if you liked disneys pocahontas or any other film playing off historic events then you might enjoy this  im not saying this couldnt have happened but i would have preferred that they would have said up front on the cover or box or poster that this movie is 95 fiction yes there was a boat named and it did in fact sinki wonder if the survivors thought the movie was good or accurate or if any of  them saw it at all  were their feelings hurt that such a horrific event was made into a blockbuster lovestory film and capitalized on relentlessly  i honestly cringe thinking about the future reallife disaster filmswill 911 be turned into a love story  maybeonly when were dead or too old to even see ithollywood start writing original material  no remakes no copying no historical what if scenarios and no predictable endings  be creative be bold be fresh,sad
john h freemanthe only reason i am writing a commentary on this film is to provide a note at the top of the heap that this film is with all due respect to its box office record and glorious showing at the oscars a ripoff of one of the earliest and indeed one of the finest of all disaster films i am not referring to the 1953 film of the same title but to a night to remember camrons is and most likely will remain a film steeped in critical controversy it certainly will survive in spite of itself this is primarily due to having some particularly good characteristics of successful filmmaking the right formula for the right audience delivered at the right time however if you truly want to see a stunning film on the tragedy and are not hung up about the special effects needed to make a successful movie as are many movie goers these days see a night to remember it is in every aspect a superior film totally unpretentious and never over the top if you have seen you will gasp at every ripped off scene and wonder how the producers of ever got away with not giving credit where credit is due,sad
i have always been fascinated by the story of the and i had high hopes for this film  unfortunately what i got was a cold mindless hollywood romance flick that merely used the as a springboard to emptier thingsi found it less than moving  the romantic storyline was nothing new at all and the acting and dialogue was generally laughable  what did work  it has lots of pretty faces elaborate setdesign and special effects plus looks and feels epic with no substance to back it upjust a big empty romancedisaster movie here  if your interested in the story of the read about it in books there is little here we dont already know and the focus is mainly on the characters who are no more than onedimensional stereotypes,sad
its almost too easy to bash this film so ill just paraphrase what james cameron himself said on tv one night about the pitch meeting for the filmi got an idea for a film about a boat its about 3 hours long and nothing much is gonna happen for about 2 12 hours then everbody dies and theres no chance for a sequel and by the wayits gonna cost you about 200 million to make it whaddya think guystruth be toldthe first half hour or so the bill pullman stuff with actual footage aint bad but nothing i havent already seen on the discovery channel ill still take camerons the abyss every day and twice on sunday the guy directs a pretty neat little action film its just that i like my disposable love stories served with a side order of humorand maybe some actual acting you know the stuff that actors do in movies in the abyss ed harris and the gang got into their characters enough to give the movie a nice kick leo and co are reduced to playing second fiddle to blue screen effectsand heres another shining moment for the oscars ranks right up there with the milli vanilli grammy award in the what the hell were they thinking anyway category,sad
though didnt deserve to win best picture it is still a very well done movie that will entertain anyone who watches it the visual effects in this film are astounding and absolutely beleivable alot of people say this film is overrated but i dissagree like i said not the best film ever but entertaining anyways james cameron is a masterful director and i hope he announces his next movie soon terminator 2 still ranks as his best film though,sad
ok i do have something other to say too first i want to say i really liked this movie great special effects beautiful succesful young hollywood stars a romantic love story and a catastrophe 80 years ago what else do you need from a movie but then i started thinking more first thing that started annoying me was well the entire idea who gives james cameron the right to romanticize a terrible accident that took the life of a thousand people sure the movie shows us how cruel the reality is but the movie seems to tell us that and its sinking are nothing compared to the sad and onceinalifetimelovestory then the second thing that annoyed me was the main plot a rich girl and a poor boy and rich girls parents try to keep them apart cmon like we havent seen that before the whole lovestory was just a big cliche with of course required tears in the end the best thing was fantastic special effects the sinking looks so real that it almost feels you were there yourself but not even the greatest cover hide the empty inside oh about the oscars didnt deserve half of its oscars best songceline dions horrible sounding my heart will go onwho can stand it best movie if this was the best movie of the year im glad i didnt see the worst anyway is ok it is entertainingim sure it wasnt meant to be anything else,sad
i couldnt believe how hilarious this film was  cant speak for my husband as he fell asleep in the cinemathis film was so comical that it actually made me laugh outloud in the cinema something that doesnt happen that often  when i wasnt laughing i was sat with my mouth open incredulous  how on earth did james cameron come up with such funny dialogue  maybe hes been watching too much monty python  on second thoughts the monty python team could have probably done this film much more justice although how the love scenes could be made more farcical i cant imaginewhenever im feeling down im going to put this film and im sure itll do a great job of lifting my spiritsive just had another thought  did any of the actors realise this was a comedy because their flair for humour and satire was so natural it amazed meplease please can we have a sequel preferably with leslie nielson or someone serious like him starring,sad
i dont think so ok so it managed to collect nine oscars i think but look at the categories it failed to scoop best actor not even nominated best actress best supporting actor best supporting actress and probably the most damning best writing  screenplay written directly for the screenthe special effects are spectacular and the cinematography and direction overall are very good but theres not enough in this film to hold your attention the first hour and a half are just not interesting i watched this movie when it was released i assumed that all the hype surrounding it had raised my level of expectation too high i watched it again last night and ended up going to bed after about an hourthe other nominations for best picture in 1998 were as good as it gets good will hunting the full monty and la confidential if you want to see a good film watch any of these you wont be disappointed,sad
i resisted all the hype at the time this film came out and managed to wait until it appeared on tv before seeing it for the first time it was a profoundly impressive film but only in certain respects the plot was thin and predictable well i suppose in a film named the plot pretty well has to be predictable and the acting was fairly mediocre i guess what i found so impressive was just the overwhelmingly good job that was done on making you feel like you were right there everything from the simulated aerial shots of the ship at the beginning of the film right through to the close ups of events during the disaster itself is done so well that you can immerse yourself if youll pardon the joke in the experienceit is just a pity that the acting from most of the performers didnt rise to the occasion it is easy to see why none of the films 11 oscars was for acting i suppose im a bit biased because i personally cannot stand dicaprio who cant act to save his soul but i found the other performances to be less than the film really neededoverall though the impressive technical achievement in bringing to the screen outweighs the human shortcomings giving the film a rating of 710,sad
boy do i hate this movie  im so happy this isnt in the imdbs top 250 im a little angry it isnt in the bottom 250 it should be this movie is more predictable than the alphabet  for those people who havent seen it god bless you  please dont see it  if you see it it will be a greater tragedy than the sinking of the  let me give you an example of how long and boring it is  if you stare at a clock tick down for 24 hours it will fell shorter than watching this movie  the lines are such a joke let me express myself on a couple  im flying  kate winslet  if i was beside her at that moment i would pick her up and throw her overboard and my line would be no your not  than the movie would end and it would save everybody sitting in the audience a lot of time  another garbage line was you jump i jump  kate winslet  i could have done alot with that moment more than james cameron thats for sure  i would have made them both jump off the boat and get eaten by jaws wow what an ending  that would also save some time  the soundtrack was one of the worst i ever had  it is a shame the great james horner didnt win an oscar for braveheart but won one for this movie  celine dion still has the most annoying song i will ever hear the rest of my life  every time i saw her video i wanted to drop kick my television set in hopes i might actually hit her and shut her up  i am very happy this film won no acting awards that is the only justice the academy awards handed out that year  i was so happy when the stupid row boat sank  i cracked open a bottle of wine in celebration  ps write me if you want any recommendations for great movies they dont call me the tree of knowledge for nothing,sad
james camerons was one of the most eyepleasing films i have ever seen the effects were wonderful and the actors were pleasing to the eye the main problem was the script which i found to be trite some of the writing was so horrible that it ruined the movie this movie could have been silent and have been four times as good,sad
although visually stunning the screenplay might have been written by a four year old camerons vision of mankinds most famous disaster is simply to much its not enough to take it to perfection from the visual point of view you also have to frame it into a good story line witch unfortunately it is not so good its childish often embarrassing and usually boring,sad
decent film overall  i was impressed with the special effects but i felt that the acting left much to be desired  kate winslett gave a throroughly unconvincing performance while dicaprio did an adequate job of jack  the fault lies i think mainly with the screenwriters who wrote some of the most inane trite and just generally bad dialogue ive ever had the misfortune to hear  leonardo dicaprio is an excellent actor especially in quirkier roles and kate winslett is an excellent actress however this was not a vehicle for them to shine in  jennifer love hewitt and freddie prinze jr could have done this movie instead of tarnishing actors reputations i mean hewitt and prinze they cant get any worse,sad
has made a lot of friends since it first appeared in theaters and i cant say that it doesnt deserve them  certainly parts of the film are superb moving and really unparalleled among other films  then there are those other parts that arent  what really bothers me about is that the weakest elements of the film seem to be those that have garnered the most praise among fans  allow me to elaboratefor instance there are the main characters provided by leonardo di caprio and kate winslet  besides setting off considerable sparks and possessing a great amount of natural chemistry they accomplish very little  actually thats not completely true for winslet who may very well set the record for showing the most cleavage ever in a pg13 film  but as far as characters they are cardboard cutouts who while they look very good on screen are doing little more than taking up spaceof course this isnt completely their fault  both of these young actors can indeed act believe me ive witnessed it for both of them  the fact is they didnt have much to work with and here i am of course referring to james camerons script  now just to set the record straight cameron is a very talented fellow  he knows how to make a completely convincing fake ship sink how to stage action scenes and how to tell a story  quite simply hes a good director  no no hes a great director  but hes a horrible writer  his dialogue positively reeks of clichs and vainlyattempted humor  and perhaps that explains why james horners fantastic score has so much of the limelight  perhaps cameron realized that his pathetic script wasnt enough to build drama and suspense so he relied on the music to do thatnow on another level the film is a technical masterpiece  the special effects cinematography editing production design and all of the other backstage elements are simply superb  while unarguably cost an enormous amount of money its easy to see why  the money is right up on the screen in all its glory for all to see  yet is it fair to say that a film is great when only half of it truly is  i dont think so  on that note i base my overall rating knowing that it would have been far better if only cameron swallowed his pride put his ego on the shelf for a moment and hired someone else to write the screenplay  unfortunately he didnt so we have to suffer for it out of ,sad
now this movie made over 1 billion dollars and im happy to say that not a single one of those dollars were mine i have seen it but i saw it at a company preview and i work at a video store so free videos now dont get me wrong i enjoyed the movie but the hype that went on over it and the out pour of praise for leonardo dicaprio from fans that came out of the wood work who really didnt appreciate leos previous and better work such as this boys life and the basketball diaries now they were good movieseveryone was urged to see this movie it was almost uncool not to have seen if someone had asked you if you had seen it and you answered no they thought you were crazy well i decided to make a stand against it this movie was pure hollywood no real story it was pretty obvious what was going to happen with the love story and i cant believe it made so much money i mean everyone knew the endingit sankif you are to watch it make sure you watch an original copy with surround sound or better yet see it on dvd now i dont mean to sound harsh but come on it wasnt that good to warrant a billion dollars,sad
the movie is not bad but it is worse than many othersthe story is very silly and theycameron and dicaprio forced peoples feelingsgood will hunting is much better thanand matt damon is better than leonardo dicaprioby the way leonardo is one of the worst actors ive ever seen,sad
yes  it grossed billions and billions  but that doesnt mean everyone enjoyed it  and certainly doesnt make it the best  it stars leo dicaprio and kate winslet  who basically fall in love while on the run from winslets rich fiancee  you can probaly guess the rest  not only is there no surprise to the ending but the acting is lowgrade as welldicaprio and it is clicheridden primarily billy zanes character  the evil millionair husbandtobe who  when you erase all the flashy makeup and dispense with the expensive attire is basically the umpteenth presentation of the bad old boyfriend we see endlessly in bad teenager flicks im not going to summarize all the bad points  wasnt without its positives  it was exciting towards the end  the last scenes of people drowning provoked genuine feeling  and of course  the effects were incredible  but special fx dont propel the film  cameron is a great filmmaker  creater of such action classics like terminator 12  aliens and true lies  and displays a genuine gift in moviemaking  but it seems the love story was just a rehash he conjured up  in order to stall for time until the ship crashes  then hes back to his old roots  producing incredible action sequences with goundbreaking digital effects   as for the oscars  it deserved effects awards  but best picture this is definately an epic film but is clearly being judged on its hype and budget  not on plot and acting if a film was to be judged souley on those considerations  as good as it gets or la confidential would have been the winners  is a good film just not great like everyone seems to think it is  it deserves three for the last half of the film  because its fastpaced  exciting  forget the subplot rating  out of ,sad
is an overlong occasionally entertaining yarn which doesnt stand up to close scrutiny excellent special effects alone dont make a classic you need good scripting and acting too this is one of those films where you wish the dollars  pounds had not all been thrown at computer animation it could have been so much better,sad
story 1  we know the story it was goodcharacters 0  i never really gave a damn about any of these characters because the writer wasnt sure if he should make jack be the main character or rose  and its not like either of them were interesting  he was a poor artist and she was a rich girlacting 0  dicaprio is the worst actor on the silver screen and since most of the time he acts like a homo i cant picture him as a leading man blanchett is 2d as alwaysbeginning 1  started off as a promising big budget romantic storyend 0  your typical romantic love story  naturally somebody has to die and somebody has to live to give it that extra sad effect  and since we knew from the beginning that the boat was gonna sink its not like there was any suspencescore 1  the musical score was great and added some drama to the movieattention holding 0  not really  the first hour and a half is the love stuff and the second is the action  very predictablememorable 0  just another love storycould watch again 1  if i had a different girlfriend and i needed a movie to hold her for 3 hours i would definetly choose this movie  4  the best movie of all time  hell no  the highest grossing movie of all time  americans can watch some stupid stuff sometimes,sad
i cannot believe this movie won the best picture oscar i couldve written a better script the romance between rose and jack was totally unbelievable we were supposed to believe that she was going to give up her spot in the lifeboat for this guy she met the day before please the only redeeming value was the actual footage of the underwater when the movie was over i couldnt have cared less about one person on that flippin boat billy zanes character was so overdone i kept expecting him to twirl a mustache and laugh maniacally i saw an afternoon tv movie on lifetime about that was better than this,sad
everyone seems to give either high praise or damnation to this film well i enjoyed it thoroughly and have now seen it six times over the last fifteen months basically the good thing about it that it faithfully recreates the and if youve been obsessed sorry fascinated by the for a long time youll be in a nostalgic heaven the problems with it originate purely from the fiction part of it my mother watched it recently for the first time and thought what i thought the script is diabolically lame she just about threw up at the scene cal holding up expensive diamond ive got my security lovejoy showing gun in bravado way so do iit represents a big missed opportunity on james camerons part a movie made on this scale could surely be vying to compete with gone with the wind and citizen kane in terms of artistic quality but it seems that all that matters is size instead the plot only competes with with your average cheap romance novel and a typical hollywood churned out actionadventure movieif youre disappointed with the history you should see the jc explorer cdrom as it fills in many gaps and contains many scenes cut from the movie which will make the directors cut very worthwhile they could remake it perhaps if they havnt dismantled the sets and make the necessary improvementsbut all round its great watching it,sad
without doubt the worst movie ever to win the oscar for best picture  a ghastly script which feebleminded and clicheridden as it is proved far beyond the infantile acting ability of the stars left one rooting for the one real herothat vast block of ice that sank the ship and took us all out of our misery  the music is bad the plot is absurd the much vaunted realism in recreating the boat was done just as well forty years ago in a night to remember this is just further proof that the ability of audiences to see movies has deteriorated due perhaps to a combination of food additives and computer graphics  its not even bad enough to be funny its just flat out bad,sad
my initial thoughts when first sitting down to watch at the cinema wereso we already know the ending so how good can it bewell after the first ten minutes of crap the true story unfolds and the story of rosekate winslet and jackleonardo di caprio is toldhas an all star cast including the afore mentioned doomed lovers billy zane kathy batesmisery bill paxtona simple plan and jonathon hydeanaconda each of the cast puts in a near perfect performance and the story is surprisingly good both winslet and di caprio deserved more recognition for their stunning performances as did james cameron for his brilliant directionon a whole the film was an excellent version of the tragedy it was later proven that leos character jack dawson was actually on the rating45,sad
i was never expecting too much of this movie and i wasnt surprised it was preposterous that this movie won any award aside from best effects the lame love story almost put me to sleep until i had to go to the bathroom cmon the movies 3 hours long and i cant see how it made so much money dont waste your money on this bs,sad
this was clearly a carefully done movie when we only talk about the ship almost all technical details of the were perfectly done including the way she possibly sunk i just wish cameron wouldnt have given in to the studio and have a soaplike story wrapped around the ship and even worse have the two main characters in it played by two shallow actors who were clearly beyond their skills or to say it differently bad main actors in bad roles gave the movie a perfect teenie audience but had the actual main factor of the movie lost the ship,sad
i will be the first to admit that i was one of those people who jumped on the hate bandwagon without first seeing the movie mainly because i was sick and tired of hearing leothis leothat  when a relative got the video for free i decided to borrow it just to see if i had been correct all alongwell i can honestly say that the movie was not that bad but i by no means consider it to be a masterpiece  surprisingly leo did not annoy me as much as i thought he probably would and i felt that there were some other actors in the film who were far more deserving of oscar nominations than kate winslet especially kathy bates and frances fisher  finally and perhaps most importantly this film has been classified by most as a love story however i did not find the romance between the two leads to be very convincingi felt like they were nothing more than just very good friends had the point been that they were supposed to be nothing but good friends i probably would have been much more emotionally affected by the movieat any rate is not awful but it is also not the crown jewel of modern cinemabut thats just my opinion,sad
beyond watching the ship sink there is nothing to this movie at all  what is most aggravating is that the produces scriptwriters and even cameron himself did not even bother to try and make this garbage work beyond the special effects  i thought camerons terminator2 was an extremely moody atmospheric piece of work with consistently interesting camera work and plot looks like the abc movie of the weekwith worse dialogueand what exactly was kathy bates doing in this film besides flying across the screen once in a while speaking nonsense  apparently many preteens and earlyteens flocked to this film five and six times each  i have to believe this was for the most part the intended audience  mabye that is why they didnt bother to try still worth while for the special effects however the viewer really feels aboard the overall a good film  a classic  no wayin fact its already forgotten,sad
the story of the love between two people from entirely different worlds why is this movie called this is a love story and the plot has just about nothing to do with the ship itself is just the set the plot is not that bad but theres nothing special about it the same story has been seen a million times some of the actoractress performances are very good and director james cameron does an exceptional job but good acting and direction do not make a great movie without a great script why this movie was such a grand hit i cant tell maybe its the effects maybe the acting maybe even the music who knows is a pretty good movie and watching it is not a waste of time but the fact remains that the movie is a thirteenadozentype of love story,sad
pity theres no oscar for corniest dialogue  think of im da kinga da world jack im flying and this is where we first metthe movie was carefully pitched banal romance and leo for 13year old girls  the usual nods to the powerful irishamerican lobby with british characters portrayed as unfeeling brutes  the cruel misrepresentation of first officer murdoch caused special anger here in scotland  the impression was that the british had deliberately rammed the iceberg in order to drown the irish steerage passengers  the irish themselves were shown as lovable but emptyheaded bumpkins jigging the night away in an irish theme pub below decks  when disaster struck they were completely helpless unless a plucky resourceful american was available to save themto appeal to those middleamerican teens and twentysomethings who feel uncomfortable if a movie isnt set in high school usa rose and jack characters from saved by the bell in period disguise consummate their passion in the back of the only car for thousands of miles  so much for imagination they had a whole ship to choose from after allafter i saw the film the foyer was packed with weeping teens  i knew how they felt  why has dicaprio chosen to name himself after a ninja turtle  couldnt he pick something more uptodate  like a teletubby  how about dipsy dicapriowith the ship and the male lead both at the bottom of the atlantic how can james cameron wangle a sequel  wait in lusitania rose kate winslet returns to england  during the journey her rubber ring bursts and she is left floundering in the swimming pool  luckily she is rescued by the cabin boy  at first she thinks she has been rescued by jack  in fact by an amazing coincidence its jacks longlost twin brother jim dipsy dicaprio  they fall in love  the ship is torpedoed and sinks  cue special effectsof course the lusitania was sunk by a german submarine but im sure cameron could find a way to make the british the villains the irish the helpless victims and the wisecracking americans the heroes,sad
why the heke did this do so well at the box office its just another hollywood blockbuster the love story is so thin and weak i was offended the dialogue was just plain trite and banal that wasnt romantic when they made love in that car that was just a cheap tawdry 90s onenight stand if dicaprio lived as soon as they made it to the dock he would have dumped her he already got what he wanted if you want true love see city lights,sad
was probably the worst movie i have ever seen not only that the movie was poorly made but what really gets to me is the fact that it pretends to be a magnificent piece of film making i just dont understand why people constructed such a big event around the movie actually i understand that it constituted a wonderful opportunity to attract a huge contingent of people dying to see how the boat sinksis nothing more than a cute love story that happens to take place inside a ship please do not make the mistake of thinking that you have indeed seen a good movie because is very much the manual of how not to make a good film,sad
probably the worst movie ive ever seen after death stalker and beyond the door2 and all the world goes bonkers about it spielbergs is a very good movie for it has both the remarkable plot and superb actors performance due to limited space i wont go into comparison of these two movies further although id love to i cant say the same about camerons socalled masterpiece firstly its foundation the raising of the safe and restoration of the drawing is pretty shaky for pronounced absence of credibility any expert would confirm that a piece of paper not even a photograph exposed to sea water for 84  years can not remain undamaged after the seaweeds were cleaned off its surfacesecondly it is my understanding that each shot has to make sense here the camera fixes on captains cup with a lemon slice in it and nothing happens let alone floating plates when the water floods the kitchen everyone knows that porcelain sinks it appears that after spending 300 mln to build the truesize model of cameron didnt have any money left to buy expensive crockery thats why stacks of cheap thick plates fall from shelves and breakbesides above technical blunders which went unnoticed by rapturous audience the plot leaves much to be desired let alone striking age and weight difference between winslet and dicaprio apparently cameron lacked dramatic material his characters talk and behave as if they lived nowadays i really doubt that at the beginning of the century anyone expressed his agitation and excitement the way dicaprios character jack did aboard its also unclear from where dicaprios character got a tuxedo i didnt see him borrowing it from the laundrynaturally neither dicaprio no winslet received oscar for their apology for actors art its beyond my understanding how with all this received more oscars than gone with the wind as if unmatched performance of leegable duet can be bracketed with winsletdicaprios feeble attempts to act faces of actors playing lovers are lit up their voices and gestures express their feelings here we see spiritless and nonexpressive mugs so where is romeo and juliet aboard what should apprise the audience of their love that they copulate on the back seat of the car its worthy of note that they do it quickly and without long verbal preludes just like in modern america this must be the explanation why became boxoffice hit of all times the characters dont perform any epics of heroism or demonstrate superhuman physical or moral traits girls come to the movies with their boyfriends watch winslet and dicaprio and think just like you and me im talking about the back seat of the car phenomenal success of might be of interest for psychiatrists as another mass hysteria or indication of love is that the characters spit overboard incidentally this episode is the only one where winslet and dicaprio succeeded for it didnt require any actors artit should be also mentioned that in the scenes shot at the main hall with a staircase while the main characters rush about in panic extras in lifevests playing passengers just stand and chat peacefully this is a crying nonsense under given circumstances roses action when all of a sudden she runs out like mad and jumps overboard looks absolutely unmotivated im also curious as to how jack and rose can run up to neck in freezing water and even dive although its known that a human cant last in a 2o c water longer than 10 minutes much later as if he just remembered that hes an ordinary mortal jack suddenly froze and drowned yet he had time for a sentimental goodbye to squeeze tears out of the sensitive audiencewhen a real natural calamity takes place people dont have time for melodramatic speeches and oaths once they lost each other in panicstricken crowd they only find dead bodies of their beloved ones at the end only cancerous have enough time to bid farewell to their relativesi must be a bad spectator for despite hundreds of millions of dollars invested in not a single teardrop welled up in my eyes feelings emotions and sympathy can not be purchased you cant force yourself to worry when the plot is transparent actors art is none the dialogues are banal and not a single phrase is remarkable by no means im insensible i worried about thelma and louise and cried at the end when their car flies off the precipice even terminator lowering himself in melted metal or rambo sobbing on colonels shoulder provoke more sympathy than all the characters inobviously this years academy awards ceremonys motto was to catch up with and pass bengur in its aspiration to give all the possible awards to the academy came to an amusing incident extracted from naphthalene gloria stuart who only takes 10 minutes of screen time was nominated for oscar and what is the most ludicrous seriously hoped to receive the cherished statuetteas was to be expected received all the awards except for the main parts it is incomprehensible how can be a best movie of the year if none of the actors received oscar actors art is the very component that makes a movie then whats so good about the question hangs in midair the academy judges all together singing a laudatory ode to and extolling the director james cameron didnt give attention to other not less worthy of note movies remarkably melodious song how do i live without you from con air was undeservedly offended at least this award the academy could have given to someone else especially as this soundtrack was way better than doleful howls of scottish dawdling coupled with celine dionthe only oscar deserved by is the one for special effects being of no value in terms of artistry this movie can be a visual aid for studying filming techniques i find it hard to believe that such distinguished director as james cameron who did terminator and true lies really thought that deserved all the awards it received at least absurdly sounds his boastful allegation borrowed from dicaprios character im a king of the world the phrase from wellknown tale is on tip of my tongue the king is naked,sad
i was so enchanted by this movie back in 1997 that i saw it at the theatre nine times  pretty sick  i now own it on dvd and video just in case something happens to one of themyou have probably already figured out that i am a woman so naturally i was absorbed with the love story of jack and rose even though they are fictional characters  but isnt that what we go to the movies for  fiction and fantasyi loved this movie and i seriously doubt that anything will ever top it in my book,sad
is one of the most expensive movies ever made cost of 200 million and is the highest grossing movie of all time in addition it won many oscars so if that doesnt make you take notice i dont know what willthe film is really a drama with a strong romantic thread the acting was above average directing was amazing and the cinematography showed you how it actually felt when the disaster took place i rank this movie highly and would recommend it for everyone that likes a good romantic drama almost everyone universally praises except for a few i suspect that these few dont like romantic movies,sad
has got to be the best film off all time everything about the film is amazing james cameron did a wonderful job as usual at directing and leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet are truly wonderful the music is beautiful too brilliant soundtrack like i have already said is amazing and it will always stay that way 2010,sad
tatanic was as good as its name sounds strong epic and adventurousi know this movie word for word from start to finish,sad
there is no doubt that it remains the best movie of all time a masterpiece avengers is left behind compared to this work made by the hand of the cinematographic genius of james cameron even after such a long time of having premiered i still love how james worked on each shot of the movie and how he handled the crucial sinking scenes of the famous ship simply put the best of the best you can see and enjoy,sad
great filmplot acting  visuals look great even though it was released in 90saudience would feel the scenes in the moviethumps up,sad
well i ignored this magnificent movie for a long time because i thought its just a famous story of two characters in love on a huge ship that sank but it has much more to it like how people handle a situation when they have a little time until the ship struck an iceberg and how they behave with each other in a critical momentof course i knew that its gonna be a long touching film but i was very saddened by the ending when we see the old rose throwing the special necklace with the blue stone into the big blue ocean in that ocean she lost her real love but if she wouldnt be in that ship she would never meet himthe only problem i had with the movie is the first long part that its sort of a documentary of the remains its very confusing when you are watching a sort of a fictional movie although it also gives a frame to the film,sad
neither as good or as bad as the hype might have led me to believethe love story is good and the special effects are good but considering the material cameron was working with he didnt really produce anything that another director might have with a similarly astronomical budget or possibly a whole lot lessthis is definitely a film for the big screen or at least the biggest screen you have,sad
i remember the first time i ever heard about the i was 11 or 12 and my paternal grand mother told me after watching this version with leonardo and kate i wasnt disappointed they were fantastic in the romeojuliet starcrossed lovers type theres been several comments regarding the scene towards the end where kate rose is seen on a wardrobe with room for leonardo jack to be saved with her i guess the script didnt call for pt 2 because had it no doubt jack too wouldve survived billy zane didnt disappoint as the villain i didnt cry but i was moved by the reality of the sinking it mustve been truly horrific knowing there was so many who perished in this sinking i have since found whenever i see a photo of the i can actually hear the screams of despair i saw raise the no way is it comparable to this movie raise the had many people believe she sunk intact when in fact she was literally torn apart and crumbled as she sank would have to be the most truetolife scary not horror but scary movie ever made,sad
in retrospect its easy to be cynical and stuffy about james camerons 1997 it surpassed previous champs star wars and et the extraterrestrial as the top moneymaking film of all time itself eventually surpassed by camerons avatar a personal affront to countless moviegoers over a certain age with its recordtying 14 nominations and recordtying 11 wins it turned members of the academy of motion picture arts and sciences into a bunch of teenage fangirls it wasnt until six years later with the lord of the rings the return of the king that ampas members turned into a bunch of teenage fanboys it allowed cameron a genius as a filmmaker but an sob as a human being his egos at least twice the size of the big boat itself to become the selfproclaimed king of the world and it led to a lengthy period when it seemed as if celine dions ubiquitous my heart will go on was the only song ever recorded in american music historybut now its time to go back to which has been rereleased to theaters not only in celebration of its 15th anniversary but more soberly only a few days removed from the precise 100th anniversary april 15 1912 of the disaster that snuffed out 1500 lives cameron spared no expense for this relaunch spending millions to convert the film into 3d admittedly most pictures that werent originally filmed in that process but were only converted later as an excuse to boost ticket prices have failed to provide much extra oomph to the 2d imagery eg clash of the titans alice in wonderland but if theres one thing to be said about cameron the man knows how to derive the most technological bang for his buck in 3d looks fantastic employing the format in a way that makes viewers feel as if theyre the ones rounding a corridor corner or fighting to stay afloat in that icy atlantic waterfifteen years later the highs and the lows still remain luckily whats good about the movie continues to easily outweigh its flaws the fictional storyline is hoary in the extreme relying on a wrong side of the tracks romance shortly after boarding the ship as it prepares to embark on its maiden voyage povertystricken artist jack dawson spots socialite rose dewitt bukater and instantly falls for her in these careerpropelling roles leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet are excellent delivering warm winsome performances that provide their romance with an epic grandeur it certainly wouldnt have attained in less capable hands the trouble for both the young lovers and the audience members is the presence of roses fianc cal hockley billy zane a supercilious millionaire who would just as soon push the lower classes off the face of the earth as give them the time of day as i watched cal constantly berate the poor expose his ignorance in winceworthy dialogue criticizing a painting by picasso he opines that the artist will never amount to anything smack rose around and try to kill jack by taking shots at him i kept wondering why cameron had elected to leave off a mustache that zane could twirl at regular intervals  the character is even more cartoonish than actual cartoon character snidely whiplash,sad
though i dont really like romantic movies but this one was a good romantic movie even for me it had a lot of good senses and of course the ending made everybody to fill the pain,sad
badiya sab movie theek haii think this movie is good i do not think it is real good,sad
titanicleo and kate or winslet are wearing each other in their friendship it is two decades but still romantic the movie with leo prior to winning his oscar for best actor is the unlike event of it happening to us we are not sailors but we need them and they need us to be presentsailing on a boat or a ship like in life in the mississipi is a waste of valued coal but the steam engine that crossed those days disappeared as well,sad
this movie may or may not stand the test of time its theory of why the ship went down has since been replaced by a discussion of the fire down below its most indulgent moments have become the stuff of parody but if were going to judge this film lets judge it by its impact on release i saw it seven times before it left the theater i was entranced by it the performances were stunning as was the cinematography and direction its a great story about the folly of human beings and the absolute imperative of living your life while youve got breath in your lungs i loved the chemistry between dicaprio and winslet but there were great performances as well from billy zane bill paxton kathy bates frances fisher and gloria stuart i loved the use of music i loved the whole thing after you watch a film 900 times you lose sight of what was great about it and all that remains is its imperfections this was still a great ride,sad
is one of my favourite definitely not because of jack and roses boring romance and blah blah blahbut due to the emotional and disastrous effect it made it could be even better if the romance sequences were cut shortnevertheless its one of those classic movies not to be missed,sad
what a pity such huge production served by a sometimes almost ridiculous scenario and dialogues,sad
is world famous the film that broke every box office record on release and wore the box office champion crown for many yearsuntil it was overtaken by jim camerons avatar is special because not only does it showcase the disaster in all its glory the film is a technical achievement of the highest order the sinking sequence is astonishing and it feels like you are watching the actual ship sink the characters and actors are amazing and even with a large running length you never dare look at the watch james cameron is a master director and is his stamp of authority,sad
fantastic romantic movie well directed movie very heart touchingemotional movie i loved this movie very much leonado dicaprio  kate winslet acted great and realistic the choreography and cinematography are excellent,sad
everything is unique and full or creativity  wish to be a part of movie or act in a role of jackas role of this person makes everyone proud and famous,sad
the powerful emotional and tragic story of the titainc told through the eyes of two characters played perfectly by such talented actors leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet were brilliant and take you through the emotional journey in an intimate and personal way this movie gives you a shadow of an idea of what it was like for individuals the horror the fear and the grief can be felt thanks to the attention to detail in every aspect of this movie prepare for the emotional ride every time you watch it a timeless classic that stands out amongst all other films from the 20th century iconic music scenes lines and words will stay with you long after watching a must see and one that will never get tired,sad
very famous love legendbut i dont like jacki think this is a film about disaster,sad
i watched the movie many many years ago when i was a teen but i now say to myself wow see how a movie could be so that powerful that i could remember the movie all by my mind maybe because human being is learned that love is the best and true love is in stories and rare and what is rare so is much more interesting for people to me it was beautiful to see a person could decide for herself she could be different than all her families could enjoy simple thingsthe whole story is memorable lovely and classic,sad
yeah i hate rose thats it i mean god damm it lady you are about to die save the romance for lateral once you both are completely safe jesus thanks a lot rose,sad
is one of the highest grossing movies ever made and the film won 11 oscars many considered it one of the best films in history i have no idea why is in no way a bad movie the scale of destruction of the title ship is gorgeous and the cinematographer is fantastic yet nothing else about the movie is all the great in my opinion the acting is not bad they just dont stand out the dialogue was most cheesy and not all that powerful none of the performances keep me that invested which is bad considered the two and half hours that milks its romance the film feels like its five hours long and i constantly looked at the time to see when it was over personally i dont think romances are the type of movies that need to be three hours long but thats just my opinion overall the last 30 minutes or so of are fantastic but it takes a while to get there with nothing really keeping you invested if you like romance movies you will most likely love this movie but as for me it felt a drag of a romance that didnt need to be that long,sad
when i say that is overrated i do not mean that it is bad did it deserve to win best picture not in my eyes particularly when good will hunting was competing with it but it was not a waste of a budget which is more than you can say for most movies with massive budgets i have a number of problems with the story but it was decent and it seems like james cameron and company wanted to do a good job on it really the idea behind this movie is rather praiseworthy with the sinking of the being such a famous disaster event having the story revolve around the exact happenings of that night would not really be that dramatic on its own the sinking is not that dramatic because we know its going to happen but now that we are invested in jack and roses relationship it has higher stakes and the question now becomes will they be able to both survive this tragedyill start with the things that i liked about the movie some of the early conversations with jack and rose were really good and created a tangible chemistry between the two of them whether you liked them as people or not it is hard to refute that they care about each other sincerely jack sees the good in rose rather than what she can do for him and she is grateful to him for that this is aided in no small part because the movie has an hour more than the average runtime to develop their relationship but at least the extra time was put to good use secondly i liked that attention was given to the ships crew and officers the officers and other employees were having to react to a totally unexpected crisis and have to make sacrifices and difficult decisions in particular i sympathized with the guilt of the officer who comes back and saves rose lastly the movie was very visually nice the computer graphics and such were good but not so good that they made things look unrealisticon the downside there were a few shots that seemed like an egregious waste of money the huge sweeping pans of the ship and the shots of all the propellers and cogs moving were really not necessary and just seemed to be taking unnecessary advantage of the allotted budget the grand scale of the sinking was okay because it was called for but there was really no reason for such spectacle beforehand the main issue i had was rose now if you love skip the rest of this paragraph because i might make you not like it if you keep reading rose is effectively an american princess which is not inherently a problem but i found nothing to like about her when jack died i didnt really care how it made her feel because she just didnt feel like a real person also her conflict is not one that i think most people would identify with shes trapped in her upperclass life which makes perfect sense for someone living at that time but i fail to see how that has relevance to anyone watching the movie in the 90s and beyondif youre older than about 12 or 13 youve most likely already seen if not its worth a try you might be disappointed by it because your parents andor friends have made it out to be this huge deal it is long and although it tries to keep a good pace you may get bored at times i found that things dragged near the end but i would guess that most people will get bored in the first half of the movie one final thing to be aware of the characters are relatively two dimensional nearly all of them are flawed but they are more caricatures than real people overall rating 7210,sad
i do not like too much ambition too many applauds but it has the rare gift to use romanticism to remind a story who becomes  grace of cameron mythical it has in same measure the virtue to use gloria stuart in a beautiful touching role and to impose to public kate winslet and leonardo dicaprio both great actors story of an impossible love story  in fact it is only the story of force of memories and the confrontation with the pasts ghosts it is story of a gem and story of a slice of happiness and it is not fair to ignore the great care for details the hard work of entire team the craziness of cameron to recreate a lost picture but the ambition has always unfinished products is a beautiful film but not more a blockbuster useful for tears and for a high position in statistics but  maybe it is enough because i admit i am deep subjective has not the sparkle who transforms beautiful films in great films,sad
the film is produced by james cameron it is starred by leonardo dicaprio kate winslet and billy zane the story is about a love story which takes place on the this boat goes to america the film begins with rose and jack who fall in love although there are from very different social classes rose is with her fianc and her family who are very rich and jack is very poor what is surprised me its the end because its a very beautiful and sad story at the same time i like this film because of the story and the main characters this film is very interesting there is a love story and moreover there is the story of the which is a tragedy moreover the bo is very well,sad
i never get sick of this movie i could watch it 2000 times to experience every single emotion it communicates the story is pretty simple an old lady decides to tell the scientists who are working on the wreck about her trip on this ship she was a girl coming from a 1st class family she is moving to the us to marry cal wealthy business man everything changes when she casually meets jack a broke artist who won his ticket on the magnificent with a lucky card game i liked everything from the characters to the location from the direction to the music if you didnt yet please watch it youll not repent,sad
the story of is so good that if written as mere fiction it would be dismissed as preposterousin april of 1912 set out on its maiden voyage to the city of new york the ship of dreams as it was called was a floating palace for the wealthy elite reportedly unsinkable by incorporating the latest in shipbuilding technology after winning a pair of thirdclass tickets for himself and a friend in a poker game jack dawson leonardo dicaprio looks forward to returning to his native america but finds himself drawn to a firstclass passenger named rose kate winslet she is the 16yearold fiance of cal hockley billy zane  a highsociety gentleman that doesnt like to lose  returning from her wedding in europe a match of convenience pushed by her mother to bolster the familys faded coffers after jacks chance meeting on the ships fantail with rose threatening to hurl herself into the ocean an unlikely romance begins no sooner do they profess their love to each other than an iceberg in the north atlantic tests the character of everyone on board from the ships captain to the poorest of the poor as it slowly iceberg rips the safe stable deck out from beneath the charactersis an extraordinary motion picture  a jawdropping feat of outstanding art direction costume design and cinematography the film captures the essence and decadence of the era as well as the spirit and raw allure of the ship herself coupled with nearly seamless visual effects james camerons feels like a wholly real creation instead of treating the as a microcosm of society cameron makes the ship a vividly realized fluid symbol of human destiny mapping the different levels of the ship as levels of character from the social graces of the salon to the sexual heat of the engine room created through a complex blend of partial sets models and digital effects camerons is breathtaking in its wholeness heartbreaking in its destruction the films final hour portrays the sinking not merely as spectacle but as a series of harsh moral choices that must be made by all the characters as they decide who will live and who will die but perhaps the neatest thing about his filmmaking is the engaging way sucks us into what seems on the surface to be a magnetic romance while underneath there are dangerous currents of class consciousness and shoals of hubris yes he does paint his story in broad strokes and some of the dialogue is risible but leo and kate sell the hell out of it with their undeniable chemistryisnt just a great film its a magnificent historical record of one of the most unfortunate disasters in the annals of human history that is both poignant and personal,sad
james camerons is obviously the work of someone obsessed with his subject and it shows everything from the wallpaper in the 1st class suites to the bunks in 3rd class from the bow where jack and rose have their first meeting to the wireless room where harold bride and jack phillips desperately sent their ultimately futile sos signals for emergency assistance is as it were as it was cameron even ensures that the audience is never in doubt as to the horrific fate of the 1500 people left aboard when the lifeboats left there was no absence of life jackets and most of the people left behind froze to death in the icy waters off the grand banks of newfoundland for most americans born after the discovery of the wreck by robert ballard in 1986 this film was their introduction to the fascinating tragic story of the unsinkable ship of dreams all of this of course would mean nothing if the film was a dud and truthfully the script aint shakespeare kate winslets rose is made to remark that  it appears there are not enough life boats for everyone aboard while on a tour of the ship early in the film hint hint poor billy zane isnt given much to work with in cal roses one note fiance her choice between egomaniacal capitalist and sensitive artistic proletarian isnt much of a choice at all and good old leo looks more than 15 years on like hes strutting onto the ship from 90s middle america not 1912 but im quibbling no jack and rose would never have been able to meet in real life no jack would never in a million years have been allowed to attend a dinner in 1st class no no 1st class girls got to attend quaint irish dance parties in 3rd class was this in keeping with the riverdance phenomenon of the time james and the heartrending last moments between our star crossed lovers on the floating door would have been quite impossible hypothermia would have set in within five minutes and their bodies would have been twitching like crazy from the shock of the belowfreezing water thus preventing any kind of coherent conversation at all but in the end none of that matters much at its heart is a piece of classic american folk art its not meant for the highbrow crowd there arent long lingering shots open to multiple interpretations jacks observation that monets use of color is great is to be sure wince inducing but at its heart works because it reflects our own deepest personal wishes our most cherished and deeply held dreams the dream to break out of our personal circumstances and live our lives as we wish to live them to quote jack early in the film and of course to love and be loved so deeply that even if we only know the person for seventy two hours and are separated from them for 84 years we remember them and our time with them as if it were yesterdayto know what it is to finally meet the one person who you would happily even gratefully give up your own life to save this is the kind of love all humans dream of but seldom find the best art reflects and interprets dreams common to humankind by telling this story in this particular way james cameron has succeeded spectacularly in creating a visual tone poem to human yearning even if the first half of the film seems like a trite soap opera the emotional impact of the final moments alone puts everything youve seen in the first three hours into sharp perspective one wonders how many people in that freezing water more than a hundred years ago now felt as jack did in those final moments well never know but cameron has given them a fine memorial in this imperfect masterpiece of populist cinema,sad

starring leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet and superbly directed by james cameron is truly a beautiful story the film tells the story of the from a different perspective leonardo plays jack as poor young man who just managed to get onto the and kate winslet plays rose a rich young lady whom with jack does she fall in love dicaprios acting is fantastic same goes for winslet a lot of people complain about their acting saying its cheesy and cheap well i have one thing to say to those people and that is that the acting is supposed to be cheesy its a melodrama and its not trying to win oscars for actingbetween the spectacular special effects and the tearjerking score will surely leave no dry eye in the house a classic will live on,sad

titanic1997 is my favourite moviei had watched this move 10 years agoand i had also watched the movie 3d 2012on 2013 enriches us with a romantic story of young love passion and feelings full of utopias and dreams mother and child fighting for power and greed idealistic and selfidentified clashes within a consenting human ambitions society and victims of their own vanity and pomposity this is one of the films that most shocked the general public in the last twenty years the huge collections that are logical because they got obvious that has one of those stories full of strength and feeling with great dramatic content if we add the stunning beauty of the image thanks to advances in digital technology success is understandable very successful movie which tells the story of the sinking of the ship but in the background shows a passionate love story it achieves a harmonious balance in that in the mix of history and feelings and makes it almost perfect,sad
what a wonderful movie ive been talked for years and years that i had to see that movie that it was great one of the best movies ever etc but without really knowing why it didnt inspired me at first luckily a friend of mine forced me to watch it with her and im so grateful for that i enjoyed every single moment of the film and i cant wait to see it again its wellplayed the main character is handsome the storyline is brilliant and moreover i found the actors cues really funny the only little thing i regret would be the fact that its really long but actually i was so catched by the story that it didnt seem that long a would certainly recommend it you absolutely cant miss it,sad
i really love this movie leo and kate is great in this movie ive watched this movie with commentaries and i like the way james cameron tells about what really happened in 1912 and what life was like at that time i love all the rooms in the boat that they have made exactly as in the real i love the scenes when all the rooms come underwater and the deleted scene when leo and lovejoy fight in the dining room its the longest scene ever taken out of a movie i also like the simulation of the boat when its underwaterits my favorite movie with leonardo dicapro and kate winslet,sad
the sinking of the rms is still known to be one of the most resounding events to take place in generations past the film is a romanticized version of the heartbreaking story of that unsinkable ship in this film we follow jack dawson leonardo dicaprio and rose dewitt bukater kate winslet as they fall in love with the ship and each other their love is a romeo and juliet kind of story with jack being of the lower class and rose being of high class from a wealthy family rose must make a choice to either listen to her mother and marry the man her mother chose for her or to follow her heart and be with jack this movie keeps you intrigued and focused all the way till the endhow jack and rose met was an odd story jack ended up winning tickets for both him and his friend fabrizio danny nucci for the in a lucky hand of poker they both were of the lower class and were staying in the lowest floors when they were out walking around on the deck jack looked up and saw rose and it was love at first sight he knew she had to be rich because she was on the higher deck he knew he would have to find a way to talk to her one night jack heard a scream and ran to see who it was and it was rose she was hanging of the front of the ship he ran to help her and the guards saw this was the start of the love story of throughout the movie we see jack and rose grow closer and closer eventually rose chooses jack and lets her fianc caledon cal hockley billy zane know about their blooming love they begin to get into a lot of trouble throughout the ship and out of nowhere the ship hits an iceberg they then must decide what they are going to do to survive we follow their decisions in the last moments of the ship and possibly their liveswon numerous awards including an oscar for best cinematography has some of the most eyecatching and well done camera work of any movie i have seen the scene with jack and fabrizio on the front of the ship looking out is such a stunning image the sun is just beginning to set this scene even makes us feel like we are the king of the world we can really see how high up they are and that they are in the middle of the ocean the camera then pans down to the ocean and we can see dolphins swimming next to the ship also won an oscar for best picture and rightfully so the story is so original and unique even though it is something so familiar to all of us how the film makers mesh together all the scenes to make us feel like it is really happening right before our eyes is just spectacular the colors are so vibrant and give you a feeling of warmth and closeness the literary aspects of the movie have become the reason why so many of us watch and rewatch this film time and time again the story line just keeps you wanting more rose and jacks love story is something we all want to feel some time or another in our lives but maybe not the whole sinking ship and cheating on your fianc thing kate winslet and leonardo dicaprio did an amazing job portraying their love for one another you really are able to see it in their eyes overall is one of the most classic and fascinating films you are going to see to this day i still want more,sad
is an emotional heart wrenching roller coaster type of film one minute you will be laughing at how cute leonardo dicaprio is and the next minute you will be crying as you watch the ship sink into the deep ocean the films sole purpose was to one show the history of the unsinkable ship but on the other hand it takes a closer look at the passengers on the ship there were two different types of people on the the upper class which was filled with the wealthy and well off people and then there was the lower class full of poor and not so well off people as the movie progresses you see who belongs to where and how the classes get along with each other as it introduces the characters we the audience all fall in love with jack leonardo dicaprio so does rose kate winslet rose is a young gorgeous wealthy girl traveling back to america to marry her horrible fianc cal billy zane and jack is a cute intelligent but poor boy who snuck onto the ship in this interesting romance between rose and jack theres also a panic rising deep within cal as he begins to realize there just might be something going on between jack and rose rose and cal are part of the upper class and their costumes and dialogue really show their class well by this i mean that rose and cal wear nice and neat clothes and expensive jewelry and they speak all proper and tight and clean on the other hand you have jack hes part of the lower class and dresses kind of sloppy and in rags it looks like and his slang is in no comparison to the proper way of speech the class above him uses still though jack and rose can see past each others flaws and riches and manage to fall in love almost instantly but putting the romance and drama aside theres something even more interesting about to happen a mysterious iceberg as we all know the ship is indeed sinkable as the ship is sinking thats when things become real and suspenseful and emotional and scary youre on the edge of your seating biting your nails literally praying for the inevitable on another note james cameron did an amazing job recreating a completely believable i honestly thought it was real i had no idea he recreated it on a computer the sinking scenes were just as horrific on screen as they were the night it was a reality to so many people i was so transfixed onto the screen i couldnt believe it the cinematic for this movie were incredibly believable and just utterly beautiful i do not think anyone else could have done a better job at recreating such a horrific night but still make it into a love story at the same time the music was yet another memorable aspect of this film it was warming and heart touching during the love scene it then turned into a calm serene as the violinists play while the ship is sinking when jack and rose are flying at the bow of the ship the music that is playing was used for the mood and for the effect of the emotions being displayed on roses face as jack touches her to help her fly the music is used to perceive the mood and emotions being displayed during a particular scene whether it was calm to frantic or warm love back to sad with sorrow the music was used in a most incredible way and it really made the scenes pop and stand out to me lastly in my opinion you dont just watch this type of movie you really feel everything the characters are feeling when they were crying or screaming then you were too when jack and rose are falling madly in love i was too james cameron set this amazing atmosphere for his audience that just reels us in and we cant be pulled out over all i can say that i love this movie the historical details were on point the storyline was just utterly beautiful but heart wrenching as well the cinematography was used amazingly and the music and characters were portrayed nicely this film as both thumbs up from me,sad
the heart in a seain the epic adventure that the movie takes you on the characters jack and rose develop not only as people separately but also as a couple the historic event of the sinking of the is depicted beautifully in the cinematography of the animated versions of the great expansive ship and actual scenes of underwater footage and also the cgi computer generated imagery as the story unravels more and more of the characters are revealed the great expansion of the voyage was built to be one of great proportion being the fastest and strongest ship of its time leaving dock on a wednesday afternoon the tenth of april 1912 at promptly noon a couple thousand passengers boarded the expecting to be a part of history only to meet their demise in an untimely collusion with an iceberg that could have been avoided believably the stands on its own in the heart catching drama that twists and turns in ways that have you on your seat until the very end jack leonardo dicaprio is the heart throb that have girls and women alike swooning at the blink of his eye having being able to board the ship he greets rose kate winslett and develops an infatuation with the first class beauty that he sees to have no chance with developing a story line in the first few minutes the great expanse of the ship is a mighty sight to behold from the hull of the ship to the back rudders under the water winning the oscar for best cinematography was a just winning from the scenes of the ship sailing to the final sinking of the ship the sets that had to be created demonstrated the craftsmanship and theatrics in the beginning i viewed the movie as just another love story that could easily be dismissed after watching closely and scrutinizing the details and multiple works that went into the movie i was astonished not only did james cameron do amazingly with the actors he chose but also every other aspect of developing the historic details of the event the event itself was traumatic while adding some of the personal stories to back it up gave the realism to how it affected the people that were aboard the ship obviously some of the stories were make believe but it pulled at the heart strings just enough to keep the audience from turning away from the underlying message personally the scene that i was most impressed with would be the scene of the ship breaking completely in half and the events that followed backing up the scene where the ship collides with the iceberg a fact the hit took approximately 37 seconds the scene in the film was about that long as well filming this scene took editing genius and complete madness in commitment to the actors roles,sad

1997 released in 1997 is a timeless film starring leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet the film is set in the ocean traveling from europe to america on a grand unsinkable cruise ship in the beginning of this movie the quote was said not even god himself could sink this ship which is foreshadowing the events we know not just in the movie but also in real life this quote was said to have been spoken in real life 1912 when the ship actually sank it was a fantastic move on the directors part not only to foreshadow the ship sinking in the movie but to retain the historical accuracy of the story at least as it is believed the directors and producers of this movie started off showing real footage of the sunken ship mixed with some cgi footage however you cant tell the difference upon coming across a safe hidden inside the ship they removed it and brought it to the surface hoping to find money or treasure however the only thing they find undamaged is a painting of whom they dont know soon they do find the woman in the painting her name is rose gloria stuart rose comes to the researchers and they show her computer footage of how the ship sank scientifically rose then tells them thats quite interesting however the experience was quite different she then goes into detail of the story of the bringing it back to life and telling her experiences on board by her younger self kate winslet and the love of her life she meets a little later jack dawson leonardo dicaprio throughout the movie the directors switch between the story of young rose and jack on the ship to old rose telling the storyduring the story that old rose is telling you see it played out on the screen mostly in cgi the difference between what is real and cgi is almost undetectable the entire ship itself along with the 300 people on the deck are all cgi i think the directors and crew working with the cgi did such a wonderful job and i personally didnt know the difference between what was cgi and real film until watching a short documentary on the subject the script writing for this film was amazing the movie draws you in and shows you what it would have been like aboard the in both first and third class when rose meets jack you can feel the connection they have together and its heartbreaking when her mother says she doesnt want them to be together the film uses a lot of emotional appeals to make you feel for the characters especially when the ship sinks you fall so in love with these characters that i find it almost impossible not to cry overall was an amazing movie and i recommend everyone watch it at some point,sad
undoubtedly one of the greatest adventures of all time an already great movie now even more spectacular in 3d this whopper of a movie spans three hours of beautiful sets incredible visuals and a stunning cast who deliver performances so strong that you immediately connect with their characters im not one for love stories or romantic dramas but is simply a mustsee as its blend of love adventure and loss is incredible and james cameron is a master in suspense building a few friends of mine say that they skip the first hour and a bit and just go straight to the sinking part i told them thats ridiculous and the reason being is that you wont care about who dies or the outcome at the end you have to watch the whole movie its a breathless adventure that will live on and be remembered as a classic everybody knows the story but now its been remastered in 3d and its even more alive the moment you see the the crowds look even bigger as they sprawl alongside the docks cranes lift boxes which appear to lift off the screen and the sweeping shots that pan over the ship are just incredible the depth throughout the movie is vast and jaw dropping to look at all dialogue scenes boast incredible spacing between every little object from cups to candles and i love the scene where jack holds rose over the edge of the and holds her arms out you can almost touch them this is the best 3d conversion to ever grace bluray he nailed avatar in 3d sanctum was a stunner in 3d and now james cameron has done it again then theres the climax probably the most memorable and stunning climax in cinema history the sinking of the the scale here is mind blowing as thousands of sailors and passengers flee in terror desperately trying to get on board the life boats fighting for a space i like how human nature and morals have been shown in this climax how the crew leave the lower class people behind the shutters to drown which is saddening and the greed and desperation of the upper class people fighting to get off the ship the 3d here only heightens the terror when passengers look over the sides the depth effects enable the viewer to tell just how far down the fall really is the corridor scene where rose and jack try to flee is a marvel in 3d dont get me wrong the 2d counterpart is spectacular still but the way the water seems to leak our your tv screen is frightening this whole finale will have you on edge once the ship itself tips and sinks the depth just goes into overdrive look at the distance from where rose hangs dangerously to beneath her i will highly recommend this movie in 3d if you are lucky enough to get your hands on the bluray like me then you are in for one hell of an experience i dont really cry at movies it takes an awful to get me weeping even in real life situations but is a master tearjerker for the last hour i honestly balled my eyes out the soundtrack and score is wonderful as that peaceful vocal echoes in nearly every key scene the four violin players stay to play their final performance as the ship goes down the captain goes back to wheel to go down with his ship an elderly couple lye in bed as the water floods in a single mother reads a bedtime story to her kids as their side of the ship goes down once the ship goes down more sad sets in the sound of rose frantically trying to shout for help and when she lets go of jack the tears start flooding in this climax is hard hitting lumpinthroat inducing and one heck of an emotional payoff it gets sweeter when old rose drops her necklace into the ocean and when young rose names herself rose dawson this is as best as i can describe the beauty of the end this classic story has never felt more alive a fantastic conversion and still one of the epic movies of our time,sad
this is going to be a short review forplot the plot of the film is really amazing if you want a threehour long love story this is the movie for you another movie worth watching is a walk to remember starring mandy moore and it is a movie that i have seen and it is spectacular the entire 196minute picture centers around two lovers one rich girl named rose dewitt bukater and poor artist jack dawson portrayed nicely by kate winslet and leonardo dicaprio as members of different social classes who fall in love aboard the ship during its illfated maiden voyagecharacters and story james cameron wrote a story that shines out but the dialogue is very clichd and cheesy in a few areas the characters are all well portrayed and i give to the two main actors also credit to billy zane who plays cal he is the character you want to hate kathy bates bernard hill frances fisher johnathan hyde danny nucci david warner bill paxton and the late gloria stuart who plays older rose in this film and she should have deserved an oscarvisuals this is where the movie shines james cameron wanted to make a movie about the and it shows with its 200 million dollar budget and he made this movie historically accurate as possible the ships sinking scene is one of the coolest thing they could do with cgi and practical effects and it is awesomesound  music the music is awesome and fantastic james horner composed a musical score and he is fantastic the films theme song my heart will go on performed by celine dion and i love it and a lot of people has did covers of this song and i listen to this version and it was fantasticenjoyment is a good classic epic romantic disaster film that i have no problem watching once in a while the film won 11 oscars including best director best picture and best original song it made 2 billion dollars worldwide and it is just fantastic 1010,sad
i can congratulate to james cameron for the directing the movie of i saw the scene was the iceberg hit the ship on the starboard side i could ask jim for some surprise for the book on the ship for the pictures was in it so i have a book called lusitania an illustrated biography by j kent layton with artwork by tom lear i can ask him for some scriptwriting with it i could it the name for the movie with hamlet on the ship so that is how it happened and now i have work to do for my animation i guess ill be working harder as i thought dont worry i will be reading for some books for some biography to do for it thank you so much,sad
what can you say about not yet said by another person or named in another review is without a doubt a strong film a compelling story a attracting one i myself have a big lovehate relationship with this movie in 1997 when it was released and cynical 90s where at its highest i knew this movie was not going to be for me i knew which was going to be my reaction to this film we all knew james cameron he made the terminator in 1984 aliens in 1986 and terminator 2 in 1991 all of them decent not great action flicks with one common denominator lots of money and that is james cameron about he spends and earns tons of money because regardless of your love or your hate for him he makes the right choices avatar sucked just putting it out there but what was that worked so much about we might say that leo dicaprio or kate winslet or the huge budget of which we where all informed of i want to think that it was the leomania of women that time after romeojuliet and whos eating gilbert grape or the fact that it got unbelievable amount of money for it advertising or the good visual effects or the oscar swept or the lazy easy to entertain story or the bland characters which everybody could be identified with cause its easy to identify with so general personalities i wanna believe that but it is not true in a whole well its true in part but the greatest factor of the success of this film was truly it s quality not its story nor its characters those where clichd and bland but entertaining it was an entertaining story told a million times not like avatar a lousy story told a million times the fact that rose and jack know each other for about two days and decide to risk their lives for each other is pretty distracting but what the hell disney did that to us in all of its movies so why 7 stars if i think all this crap about this movie because this movie is great really great i dont want it to be but just look at it its so big its so fancy the costume the production the visual effects the amazing cinematography the pacing everything was correct and makes you feel this three hours film like a two hours film you want more and not because it let you expecting more just because it was amazing and you want to see that again so to sum up i dont see this as a great story and i dont believe characters where great but technically it was one of the most complete movies ever released look at the oscars it won best picture best directorbest editing best cinematography best sound best sound effects best costume design best art direction best visual effects best song and best score and i agree with all of them i think it is amazing visually and has a great score even if i hate my heart will go on maybe it was celines dion fault and acting wasnt awful neither regardless of the blandness of the characters kate winslet was very good billy zane was a nice over the top villain and leo dicaprio was okey just okay so i really like this movie i can watch it over and over even do its not at all perfect or it has way more cons than pros its hypnotizing its easy to watch it was made with a lot of effort and it shows its full atmosphere full visual and a relaxing story and characters ps the greatest part of the movie was without a doubt the sinking specially on cinema,sad
back at the 90s when i was a little child i loved all of the films that came out at the time but i never heard of james cameron before until at 2009 when that guy made his scifi epic avatar i saw it and loved it as much as anyone else despite its flawed story loved the concept by the way and considered one of the best movies james cameron has ever made since the first two terminator movies ive watched them and i thought they were completely epic and aliens so i decided to watch this on a vhs copy that i used to have until it vanished and i was officially moved by itbefore i could get to the positive aspects ive heard some criticisms from other people who said that this is an extremely overlong and overrated film well i will admit that this film does have some flaws theyre outweighed by its redeeming qualities the three hour length is longer but i was impressed at how the it moves very quickly and the script while staying true to the tragedy of the ship has its cheesy moments the film looks very pretty and the look of the ship is beautiful it also has some gorgeous costumes and very solid special effects the music from james horner is lovely and is one of his best scores in a feature film so far especially the heartrendering song my heart will go on by celine dion and is one of the best music songs in cinema historythe direction from james cameron is amazing and helps the story with complete focus while giving a intriguing atmosphere to it the story is very rich in detail gives the characters a lot of development perfectly and the love story while obvious is really moving the strongest aspects however goes to the climax of the movie for has drama heart and comedy perfectly mixed together and a flawless cast to make the characters more interesting emotive and likable leonardo di caprio gives out one of his best performances as jack dawson kate winslet is lovely as rose and billy zane is a great villain due to his deliciously cartoony and overthetop performance other actors like kathy bates jonathan hyde victor garber bernard hill and more did well with their roles and the character development along with their interactions with the main characters were amazingoverall isnt nearly as excellent as james camerons previous films but this is a beautifully moving and a 15year old epic film that will always be recommended to others as one of the best movies ever made in cinema with all my heart this deserves a thumbs up from me,sad
the 3d rerelease of james camerons 1997 big screen epic based on the rms 1912 sinking starring a young leonardo dicaprio and kate winslettodate has received the most acclaim of any of the other nearly 30 film documentary and madefortelevision productions his initial 2d version of the modern classic saga snagged a record 11 of its 14 academy award nominations including best picture and best director for cameron whose cinematic achievement ignited renewed interest in the most infamous maritime disaster in history for another generation of ardent viewers the very fact that the strategic timing of the digitally enhanced movie coincided with the 15th anniversary of the original picture and the 100th year commemoration of the incident that occurred at approximately 220 am on april 15 1912 set the stage for local and international observances reports cited 25 million people visited centennial exhibits worldwide although the exact numbers are slightly skewed over 1500 of the more than 2200 passengers and crew on board were tragically lost at sea after the luxury ocean liner struck an iceberg in the icy waters of the north atlantic billed at the time as unsinkable the ship built at a cost of 7500 000 was bound for new york harbor when it sank on its maiden voyage from england four days into the estimated 137hour trip the sinking garnered huge headlines around the world largely due to widely publicized advance launch announcements by the white star linenumerous depictions of the colossal tragedy quickly followed with two produced the same year the first completed just 29 days later saved from the was written by a survivor who also starred in the silent film destroyed in a studio fire similar titled features included a 1943 that emphasized the president of white star urging the ships captain to make the fastest possible crossing to ny a second in 1953 and a night to remember in 1958 which depicted the facts from the standpoint of the most senior officer to survive the illfated shipwreck the addition of special effects to the hearttugging romantic blockbuster delivered even more impact to put you right there amid the action and drama while it may not have been as effective in early scenes it improved the quality of the sequences leading up to the fateful night given the new discoveries as well as discrepancies uncovered in the final word with james cameron during the 30 plus dives hes made to the wreckage since serving as screenwriter producer and editor of this upgrade didnt lengthen the minute runtimemuch,sad
this story was just your oldfashioned love storynothing special  the special effects were what made the movie  thats where all the awards should have been won  it got so graphic at times that i wished i was watching the 50s version with clifton webb  we got to use our imagination back then,sad
this film is a firstrate film the actors and actresses were fantastic and the whole thing was very moving the special effects were amazing and you came out of the cinema in complete stupor an excellent film for the big screen but the small screen may not be as good,sad
ok to start of with i thought the movie was one of the best movies ever made  i think james cameron went a little overboard with the some of the scenes in it but it was a magnificent job of the sinking of leonardo dicaprio did a great job and kate winslet was superb  there was a downfall in the movie but it wasnt a bad scene in the mind of a man  when rose asks jack to draw a picture of herself naked was a little uncalled for but like i said it wasnt bad for the men  once the ship started sinking was the climax of what started a great ending to a wellmade movie creating all the effects like cameron did was outstanding and making jack die at the end was smart  i truly think this movie was one of the best movies ever made,sad
id just like to say that im fed up with everyones assumptions that if youre female and you like its only because of dicaprio  contrary to what a lot of people may believe there are a lot of young females out there who actually do watch a movie for its historical andor cinematic merit  this is one of them  besides am i the only one who isnt completely blind  theres hundreds of men in this movie and not an ugly one in the bunch  dicaprio is very talented and yes goodlooking  but hes not the only thing us girls go to the theater to see,sad
i was one of the hold outs that only saw this on video  decided to buy the widescreen even though it wasnt a directors cut  i loved it  the first time i saw it i was stunned by the portrayal of all those people dying  the love story left me a little cold  the second time i started getting over leo looking 16 forget leo  what about jonathan phillips  2nd officer lightoller and kate looking 22 and started watching the love story  it is a beautiful love storytriangle  i was touched by the scene where rose could have opened her heart but chose the path to stay closed  a portrayal of a critical juncture in many relationshipsafter i read a lot on the i realized that many of the situations and lines probably that others say are cheesy are exact quotes or similar situations that happened on the real  albeit to other people  such as a steward telling someone who broke a door that he would have to pay for that and many many others  i was also impressed on how accurate cameron portrayed what we know about the shipwreck  although i  am disappointed on a few glaring errors  ie murdock closing the watertight doors after the ship struck instead of before andrews being aware of the ship hitting something  or dont agree with a few of the portrayals  bruce ismay was too evil and there is a lot of dispute on which if any officer shot himselfoverall this film has been one of the best i have seen  a joy to watch and one i will probably watch over and over  i hope a directors cut is released with more of a night to remember details  cameron is one of my favorite directors  aliens the abyss terminator and he didnt let me down herealthough i tried to talk my father into seeing it and he said why would i want to see a bunch of people drown  i should have said they dont drown mostly they freeze to death  but that probably wouldnt have swayed him,sad
i only recently saw on video about a week ago and i wanted to because it was so popular and i wanted to see for myself how good it is heres the bottom line the love story and acting were pretty good the special effects were stunning but the films main problem is that it was at least 30 minutes too long the first part of the movie was straightforward and the acting was decent and yes im not afraid to admit it but leonardo dicaprio did a good job however im a big fan of actionthriller movies and the second half of could have been much better for one there were too many scenes of unimportant people falling this way and that and dying if they focused more on the main characters that would cut off some extra running time also im not too sure that a disaster thriller and a romance story can mix into an overall product you know the boat is gonna sink so why throw in a whole different second storyline this at times makes a movie look overstuffed overall this movie has its ups and downs i dont highly reccomend it but all i can say is that itll amaze some people and stupify other people not bad for a movie with 315 running time my rating  12,sad
im a guy and i loved  well there it is i said it and i feel much better now  what drew me to see was not leo or kate but rather james cameron director who is a fanatic for details so i knew going in that the special effects would be spectacular what i didnt expect was that the story of two classcrossed lovers would actually take equal billing for me along with the special effects as many of you know the movie is basically divided into two parts  the first half of the movie sets the stage for character development while the second half focuses of course on the disaster itself  but what makes the movie work as a whole is that by time we get to the action part of the movie we really do feel for the characters and we understand perfectly the unfortunate consequences of societys class rankings at that timemost of my guy friends still say they wont see the movie because they think its a chick flick they really dont know what theyre missing  not only will they get their special effects quota remember this is the director that gave us terminator and aliens but probably more importantly they may actually enjoy the love story and if they are watching it with their significant other they may find themselves hugging her just a little bit tighter when the movie ends,sad
i believe that right now this has got to be the best movie i have seen to date  many discuss the movies virtues  this is one of the few movies that i have ever come away from feeling that i was part of the movie  of course this movie was predictable if it wasnt misses the iceberg  it would  have been the posiden adventure97  if anyone really wants to see the power of this movie i suggest you rent or try to see a night to remember which was made in the 50s  you will be amazed that the story line is almost the same with somewhat more of a docudrama feel to it without the soundtrack less focus on particular characters and good special effects for the time  again they are pretty impressive for the 50  it doesnt have the power of,sad
i have heard the most lame excuse in my life come from many people on why they dont want to see i already know what happens the ship sinks hearing that makes me very mad if you have not seen this movie then you have missed something that will stick with you for the rest of your life something you will never forget ill never let go before i saw this movie was something you learned about in school something you had to take tests over something boring that you didnt really care about now i want to know absolutely everything about the unsinkable ship  before i went to this movie i knew two things that happened in the movie the ship sinks and leonardo dicaprios character dies a friend told me and i was pretty mad that will not spoil the movie for you you almost know that he dies at the beginning of the movie i thought that would spoil it for me but it didnt i thought this movie was another overhyped movie that i wouldnt like as much as i thought i would it wasnt it left me feeling weird inside i had to see it again and again and again i have it on video now it is just perfect i didnt cry but only because some boys from school were sitting beside me and it was very difficult to hold in my tears leo is great kate lost weight for the role and is bold and beautiful and the supporting characters were superb if you havent seen shame on you my rating a 10,sad
first of all im a girl and of course everyone is going to think right off that i wanted to see the movie because of leonardo dicaprio jack dawson wrong i just love a good movie i think james cameron did a great job and i praise him on his work as for the actors  actresses they were all wonderful they could not have picked a better actress then kate winslet rose she did a wonderful job there was one character i did not like and that was cal roses fiance but billy zane played the character well and he fit the image that i would have of that kind of man i liked how the movie showed the wreck of the after all those years and then rose came into the part and started telling the story if it would have went straight into the story i dont think that it would have been as good it sort of gave the movie a little twist the detail was good there was a few places were you could tell that the ship was computer animated and the part with the dolphins you could tell it was not real overall the movie was great and i would recommend it to anyone and everyone,sad
this picture had been seen by a great number of people who hoped to see something they had never seen they did but not everything is so impressive in this picturea lot of money were spent on a great view of the ship and its catastrophe so we could see the best special effects ever made in cinematography the great direction of james cameron made us see how it all really happened horners music was wonderful it couldnt be better the press of the picture was great but real cinema lovers did not see the attributes that characterise the real moviesthe story is not too special and original lots of romantic love stories were made before some were more impressive and special than this i know that we cant require the originallity from the story like this based on a real facts but i think the acting of kate winslet and especially di caprio and billy zane was very weak the dialogues were very poor too it were one of the worst dialogues i have ever heardthere is no best movie of all time but cant even pretend on it youll see it will be forgotten soon and di caprio and winslet will be a casual actors but not an idolsrating 610,sad
i didnt see until may 98 and really didnt expect to like it much but i was swept away by it the only word i could use to describe it when people asked if i liked it was incredible ive now seen it 3 times and thats not the easiest thing to do when youve got a newborn baby 3 hour movies kind of cut it fine between feeds but i managed because is a sublime film experience and ive never felt so touched by a movie in fact 3 and a bit hours wasnt long enough and i hope there will be a directors cut because there is a fair bit of important historical facts and features omitted but i read they were left on the cuttingroom floor im no leo fan and at first it seemed inappropriate casting him with kate winslet who was wonderful as usual but 2 viewings later it seemed right and i was into the love story side of it winslet and dicaprio work well together and are believable if you can get past the notion that he looks 15 and she seems so mature when in fact i think they are about the same age the special effects direction editing and especially the costumes and sets were truly aweinspiring i could go on and on about the good features of the film such as how close some actors looked to the characters they played eg capt smith j bruce ismay thomas andrews margaret brown ida and isidor straus and more the only downside to was some sections of the script that were corny and hamfisted but no film is entirely faultless and i think deserved all the oscars it received and contrary to popular belief it is not only leomaniacs who give this movie its boxoffice success and seeing it doesnt turn you into one either there are many scenes from that will probably stay with me forever this film grabs you and wont let you go the class stereotypes were unfortunate and we dont get an accurate picture of the way many people behaved during the sinking cameron seemed to ignore the fact that many firstclass men willingly gave their lives and the way first officer murdoch was portrayed was disgusting but apart from those few things it is a triumph for james cameron and everyone involved in creating,sad
the movie had very neat and incredible special effects it even had a bit for everyone romance suspense action and comedy the movie was very touching and you could sympathize with all the characters,sad
its sad to hear people whine about this movie saying that if it doesnt have good effects its a bad movie then they say it has weak acting and a predictible storyline first of all predictible story hellopeople did we all suddenly forget this was a real event i actually had people get mad at me when i told them the ship sank then theres criticism of the bad effects i personally have never been more convinced in seeing the ship break apart you really feel like you are on the boat itself the visual effects are truly stunning and for those that are so concentrated on effects alone id like to see them do better this is a wonderful yet tragic love story with sub plots of societal segregation and female opression those that think on a higher plane and truly understand love sacrifice and loss will like this movie those that criticize it forget that 1500 people lost their lives in this tragedy and i dont think the dead would give a darn about the effects or the acting,sad
yes is almost a perfect movie  it has made a big impact in my life at a particularly difficult time  i want to thank jim leo kate and the entire cast and crew for bringing me the hours of enjoyment this film has brought me,sad
i saw this movie for free and i still think it was a waste of money  i should have been paid to sit through those three hours of complete boredom it wasnt a historical masterpiece other than the costumes it wasnt historical at all  it was a 200000000 chick flick  the acting and casting were horrible the story was incredibly boring and it was barely about the at all  who ever heard of a rich wellbroughtup girl in 1912 disobeying her mother and running off with a guy who she just met 2 days before  this story would have worked better on a modernday oil tanker or an airplane for that matter  dont see it its not worth it,sad
ok yes im a guy and yes good guys cry   well actually i didnt because the movie was so hyped up about the emotions and everything i went into it with no emotions   but believe me the two friends i went with were bawling their eyes off  i have to admit i had to swallow my throat a number of times  this movie is moving and it takes you there  literally exactly what movies are supposed to do create an escape from reality cameron has done an excellent job and the acting was imho great too i dont know anyone personally that has not enjoyed watching this movie  if you havent yet rent it   its worth every penny  id buy it but im waiting for the dvd,sad
for those who have seen this movie i do not have to go into detail to describe its magnificence  for those who have not seen it grab some popcorn put the kids to bed and turn on your answering machine  yeah the movie is three hours long but the story line is so captive you dont even feel like you want to take a break or that the plot drags on  the theme maintains throughout the movie and all the actors and actresses put in as much effort as leo dicaprio kate winslet and billy zane  it was a collective effort to make the movie what is was thumbs up to james cameron,sad
was a very good movie i never beleave the hype about big movies and i thought this would be another highly overrated movie i was unusually wrong it was almost never dull very entertaining i give it  out of ,sad
the night i saw this movie i thought you know this was a pretty good movie  then all the mass hysteria leonardo worshipping scariness began i thought that there must have been something incredible that i had missed how could everyone else love it this much   then i realized that for the most part people are sheep and will like whatever they are told to like yes it was an enjoyable movie  the effects were good not star wars good but good and i like kate winslet as long as she remains fully clothed but the story was sorely lacking  my thirteenyear old sister could have come up with that plot  in addition it was approximately 17 hours long  i think that if we all step back and view this phenomenon reasonably we will see this phenomenon for what it really isa movie that was entertaining once but nothing big in the grand scheme of moviedom or life for that matter,sad
the disaster has been a subject of several movies and books but yet jim camerons epic masterpiece exceeds the greatest expectations it is the most powerful human drama ever since gone with the wind and it has became the most celebrated movie in the history the cast the sets the wardrobe and finally the events that lead to tragedy have captured the hearts of millions around the worldthe sets and scenes are made with as much accuracy to detail as possible no liberties to sets and scenes are made all the possible details have been included both constructional and historical details the filming crew took as few liberties with the accepted history as possiblethe 775feet set they built for the movie was described by ken marschall one of the leading historians of present day later described it i still cant think of it as a movie set today i still call it the breaking new groundjames camerons is without a doubt the most accurate version of the ship the people and the events that took place on the north atlantic in a cold april night in 1912,sad
was a good movie indeed but it was leo that gave the film a wrong impression got 11 oscars but didnt really deserve most of them so i have included the oscars got and who it should have gone to artset direction should have gone to tianic costume design should have gone to cinematography should have gone to the wings of the dove director should have gone to james cameron original score should have gone to phillip glass for kundun original song should have gone to visual effects should have gone to starship troopers sound should have gone to sound effects editing should have gone to best picture should have gone to good will huntingif you dont agree with me thats fine i will let you have your own opinions but i still think the public has been very unfair to other films,sad
was the best three and a bit hours i ever spent at a cinema my emotions were run ragged as i watched this movie i laughed i cried and i felt i was on the boatthe script to be honest had its problems one scene in particular stood out as exceptionally bad dialogue but overall  mr cameron had enough plot to make a half decent storyline but really he should stick to directionspecial effects were never used better than this movie with some luscious camera views making the viewer feel like heshe is on the boat the music also added to this feel of being on the boat after john williams james horner is my favourite movie composer and he didnt let the movie down i must admit that at the oscars james cameron went down a lot in my estimation what an arrogant man but he sure can direct he has always proven to be a good action director but here he also flexes his dramatic direction ability and he comes out topsthe acting was spot on with kate winslet again standing out in the cast she is the most impressive of a hot line of english actresses at the moment leonardo dicaprio still looks like a boy but ever since he acted retarded in gilbert  grape i have admired him gloria stuart and kathy bates stood out in the supporting cast billy zane was too much of a one dimensional bad guy he however was the only fault in a great castwould be up there with my favourite movies of all time a thoroughly pleasing experience out of five,sad
well the fans have spoken but are the fans really of the movie i have to admit that the effects choreography art direction and overall feel of the film are excellent but is the movie all that its made out to be of course not none of the actors deserved nominations the screenplay was predictable and at times even cheesy and it is overall just a movie to watch once twice at most the fans of the movie in my opinion watched it for the sake of dicaprio for all those who have seen it listen to how i think it racked in the most money the people seeing it opening weekend were pure dicaprio fans they then told their friends that it was actually rather good so more and more people start seeing it and are brainwashed by the money its making and confuse the money with the film then there are the antistar wars fans going to see just to beat star wars money wise even if they hate it and it is no where near the best film of all time thats just my opinion dont get me wrong i liked it i liked it enough to place it this year only behind good will hunting la confidential and as good as it gets but not enough to remember next year and i sincerely think it doesnt deserve the money it made,sad
sure the script was undistinguished if it were not this would be one of the true great movies of all time as it is the visual beauty of the movie the wonderful score the fine acting and the very nature of the tragedy made this an unforgettable movie for me movies rarely can rise above a less than great script the genius of cameron is that in this case he was able to do it i am amazed that anyone could be so unemotional as to not cry as the end of this movie while on my first viewing i was indeed a little dismayed that this was not another night to remeber all this was forgotten on my second viewing as i got swept away by it all  and i cant imagine what other movie from the best picture nominees should have won over titianic certinaly not the very overrated and dull la confidential or the annoying and maudlin good will hunting or the charming but lightweight full monty  got every award it deserved and did not get the ones it didnt 9 out of 10,sad
this is the second time i am writing about this movie so obviously i liked it very much despite its many flaws why else would i waste my time writing about it my earlier entry pointed out what i thought was great about as well as what was wrong with it i have given it more thought and will now suggest ways i believe it could have been the perfect movie instead of just a very good one 1 keep the love triangle in but reduce the three leads screen time they were not that interesting instead develop some of the other characters especially molly brown kathy bates thomas andrews victor garber and perhaps bruce ismay and tommy ryan jacks irish friend who gets shot as well movie would wind up with several interesting intertwined stories including a couple of historic ones and more on those characters who really were interesting 2 the subplot involving the diamond was silly and unecessaryyou could get the old rose in without that unbelievable and contrived situation she could just be there because shes the oldest surviving passenger for instance it would still work the movie would even work without the bookends at all and be a lot shorter although i understand its a convenient way to get the footage of the real wreck in the movie which is extremely interesting and well done 3 the jack and rose characters should be played by different actors winslet though a good actress is just a little unrefined and unbelievable as a firstclass passenger claire danes or gwyneth paltrow would have been better though i understand danes was actually considered but declined the role dicaprio is too young and frail looking since the role is not a difficult one any decent actor could have played jack but he should at least have a little meat on his bones 4 make the jack character a bit more interesting ao complicated he was too perfect and therefore not very compelling give him a fault or two rose had plenty to spare 5 put some of the important events leading to the sinking back into the script ie the californian ignoring pleas for help the wireless operators role in the tragedy even if the movie were a little longer it would have made a big difference without being too long i understand that the latter was actually included in the original script but was left on the cutting room floorwhy 6 give the wonderful victor garber thomas andrews a lot more to do he was by far the most interesting character in the movie seemed very deep and complex and left me begging for more of all the actors i think he was the best in the movie 7 dont portray all the firstclass passengers as thirdclass people this is just not the way it really happened first of all on the real ship the thirdclass passengers were not locked behindit simply took them longer to get to where the lifeboats were also many firstclass passengers performed heroic deeds ie isador straus and his wife seen briefly during the band sequence as they lay on their firstclass bed waiting to drown refused to be saved giving up their lifejackets and insisting on drowning together people are people and in such a tragic situation you would see the entire range of heroism vs cowardice in all the passengers whether first second or third class 8 on james camerons the second class has mysteriously disappeared where were they what were their circumstances like i presume they would be the middle class as most of us are all in all a very good movie and perhaps i am nitpicking but i liked it so much and have seen it so many times i just cannot resist putting in my 2 cents,sad
there have been so many comments already made about this film that mine seem somewhat academic  here i go anywayfirstly this film had one of the most dreadfully cliched scripts ever  it really was depressingly poor at times and inexplicably corny  everything else about the film is good thoughleo and kate do an excellent job considering the script and considering the fact that cameron cant direct actors he usually works with arnie after all  i take my hat off to them both  its not close to either actors best work though because they were given only cliches to work with  i think it was almost heroric the way they delivered some of those lines with straight facesvisually the film was superb  nice cinematography on the internal scenes and spectacular shots when the ship was sinkingthe film was too long though considering its slight story and the bit with the old lady in the present wasnt necessarycameron is a science fiction director and one of the best visual guys out there  but if hes going to attempt another film like this he should seriously consider letting someone else write  hes just not up to it610,sad
pluses kathy bates the wonderful victor garber the ship sinking minuses a moviestars as opposed to actors performance by dicaprio  far below his capabilities that baloney story line  this incident had plenty of real stories to be told without hauling this one out of the cedar chest any scene set in the present day  what did they pay those screenwriters    and a big ol giggle anyone know what happens when a person puts freezing cold steel say i dunno a whistle perhaps to a persons lips  yowch  and i wish id been there to slap him when cameron wrote or approved the beautiful woman hocks loogey scene  what were these people thinking,sad
1997 has the best special effects of any movie ive seen i did get tired of the supersweet story line after the first couple of hours and guessed what was going to happen with old rose about halfway through the film i was glad i saw the movie just for the effects as for the storylineno big deal i dont understand why some people have seen it up to 100 time i think they would have better use of their money i did rent the movie at five days for 199,sad
ok ok ok there is nothing wrong with leo di caprio except that us guys wish we had his looks his acting in was subpar but ive seen him do very excellent jobs in this boys life and romeo and juliet so i cant knock him for one average job ive also seen winslet do a better job despite her oscar nomination james cameron is a great special effects director and i think some day people will look at him as one of the great influences of 1980s and 90s popular film i enjoyed the film although i did not love it but thats ok the music was appropriate if a little overdone but the romance was great no i am not a fan of romance but obviously for millions of girls out there it was very effective bravo to cameron and if it made more money than some of us think it deserved well thats showbusiness,sad
ok firstly i loved this movie i saw it and came out with the feeling that i too had been aboard when she sailed and when she sank the thing i cant understand is how people can go see a movie and do nothing more than look for mistakes or pick it apart these people mustnt have very interesting lives or else they would enjoy things of quality such as this film i have read through some of the comments on this page and feel compelled to answer some of the more lame statements firstly cal tried to shoot both rose and jack because as he stated to jackwhen rose got into the lifeboat i always win jack no matter what the first class attitude of the day was that cal was just showing his first class snobbery secondly of course rose should jump out of the lifeboat her love for jack was the catalyst for this now i own 2 other movies one made in 1953 the other in 1958 and in both of these movies they show at least three women jumping back onto from the lifeboats some of the women on board truly didnt want to leave their husbands behind i only hope that if i had to make a decision like that then i would choose to stay with my husband as well thirdly i am so sick of seeing people complain about this and any other film unless you are an out of work producer director or actor and as such you cant be too good at your craft if you arethen you truly should try to remember that these people put their lives on hold for nine months so that we could have a movie that we can be proud of the most accurate portrayal of life at that time of our history and the most accurate portrayal of the sinking of a truly great shipps kate winslet and leonardo dicaprio are fine artists and should be respected as such,sad
is one of the years best films the story is based on actual events of the tragic voyage since everyone knows what happens to the james cameron adds a interesting twist to the story a ship in the present sends a probe into the to locate a diamond but instead finds a picture of a naked lady the lady who is in the drawing calls the man who found the picture she tells her story about her time spent on thethere is a lot interesting scenes in the movie in addition to being powerful and dramatic it is a very long movie but the time passes so well that you dont even notice that much the shots of the in some scenes were quite good this movie is definitely a must see especially on the big screen rated pa,sad
was great  i originally saw the previews and thought ok this movie looks cool when the ship is sinking and the guy is shooting at kate and leo  aside from that it looks like another soppy love story  ill watch it anyways  so i sat in the theater and my view changed  sure it had a love story but the effects where great  for the entire movie you get wonderful shots of the the real one and the movie set one you get to see kate topless and half the movie is the ship sinking  some of the shots are slightly like previous cameron films  for example shots of the slowly changing from how it looked like then to how it looks like now  sort of like the scene in t2 where the playground in the present time slowly changes into the burning play ground of the future  anyways back to  the sinking of the ship is done very well  you get to see people bouncing of the bars and other parts of the ship and jumping for their life as the ship goes down  anyways if you want to give this movie a chance on september 1st 1998 give 3 hours of your life to watching a film and rent try to get in letterbox format,sad
when i first saw this film i left the theatre with a sense of awe overwhelming sadness and a deeper appreciation for the delicate position of human nature  like many people though i was too quick to judge the greatness of this movie without weighing it objectively is the work of a brilliant gifted director who belongs in the halls of greatness with those of welles hitchcock spielberg scorcese and coppola  you could feel the sweat and blood that james cameron devoted to this spectacular picture  if deserved any oscars it was for best direction i think that any award bestowed after that is riding the popularity wave i think it deserved a nomination for best picture and it probably was the best of those nominated but the category itself was weak  what happened to amistad or contact  those movies both impressed more than  i laughed when kate winslet was nominated  for what talent  im glad the academy didnt get too carried away and nominate the entirely overrated leonardo dicaprio  gloria stuart was a nice surprise and she lost unfairly to kim basinger  but so did everyone else in that category true it suffered from bad writing but theres only so much you can write with the sinking of a ship looming over everyone many consider this the best ever  those who do are either teenage girls and boys whose appreciation for fine cinema doesnt extend beyond grease or past generation hermits who leave the house just for groceries and evening cribbage  anyone else who does need only sit and think about the greatness of for awhile but still a movie worth treasuring and preserving forever,sad
i think james cameron has done a great job of however if one was to look in depth of why the was such a success then you will probably see that the film is divided into 2 parts the first of course being a love story we have seen many love stories and most of them are the same  different plot  then the 2nd part a historical disaster making a film on just a disaster is not classified as a film at all but a documentary now mix the 2 parts together and you have the perfect ingredients for a top film but it is my personal opinion that the music had made this film a hugh hit the music made you feel everything that the people felt on that ship like some one said music is 50 of the film it was because of the music that we wanted to cry at the end  not leo drowning and i think the best actor in the film was billy zane and now for the cherry on the cake i heard they were going to make the sequel to this film storyline  well who knows     ,sad
is absolutely one of the best movies ever madeits welldone and actors are fantastic especially kate winslet its both sad and funny as well as romantic a story about the love we all search for but seldom find,sad
wow  what a film  now  like most males  i hate di caprio  but i must admit after watching this  i was very impressed  but as for the film  simply amazing  i salute james cameron  pure genius  i just cant believe i was so stupid to ignore this film  i presumed it was going to be some boring love story with special effects at the end  but it had much more than that  it was just amazing  the scene where the ship sinks must be hailed as one of the best pieces of cinema history of all time  bravo ,sad
the highbudget muchhyped romancedisaster epic is a great movie despite its dragging threehour length it didnt deserve all the oscars it won as nearly everyone agrees and i take pity on the poor soles who think that this is the greatest movie of all time people its a good movie but not the best of alltime and it was the unfortunate iceberg in the way of the best film of 1997 la confidential a,sad
i thought braveheart was the best movies of the 90s then comes along with an old story told in such a unique and great way there was chemistry and magic on the screen from the time the two lovers met i dont think it won enough academy awards,sad
titanic1997 is by popular consensus an impressive film though in many different ways to different people  the budget effects script and emotional content have all been praised and attacked adnauseum but i believe that the film has very strong merits and is at least as good as any other movie which is so hyped  on first viewing when prepared for a spectacle delivers and how and when youre watching in a sympathetic mood the tradgedy can truly strike home  if you watch it in a mood to be stimulted you will likely be disappointed as it doe not have the crisp dialogue of as good as it gets or the integrity of dances with wolves  is a brilliant film when watched in its element but does not operate on multiple levels either you admire the technicalhistorical creation or the increasingly with repeat viewing shallow love affair i am a fan but having seen it now some 10 times some parts are less than entertaining and altough it remains a strong favourite i must recognise the flaws and shallow nature of the script enjoy the movie invite your firnds to a night dont invite any cynics,sad
i went to see 3 times at the cinema and each time i was completely bowled over by the sheer scale of this movie there isnt much i can say about it that hasnt been said already apart from i certainly dont think cameron was wasting his time when he made this movie from the bit when the hits the iceburg i think it is a completely valid historical document which preserves the night when the sank foreverhowever after singing its praises all year round i finally got it on video a few days ago and how disappointed am i the small screen does absolutely no justice unless that is you happen to have a miniature cinema in your front room  you begin to notice the flaws which maybe you missed in the cinema in the midst of the surround sound and large screen i am no barry norman but the script even makes me cringe now i am king of the worrrrrld  come on if jim is gonna spend an amount of money that could feed a third world country for a few years then at least he could have hired some decent scriptwriters  the acting leaves a lot to be desired too ok winslet bates and maybe even zane an exception dicaprio is nice to look at and it was clever casting him as he is definitetly responsible for pulling most of the crowds but his acting and also one last little nit pick did anyone notice  how all of the bad guys were british and all of the nice jolly people were irishamericanthat bloke with the funny accent mexican was it anyway despite the bad things i said is still one of my favourite films and even thought the impact on smallscreen is a tad disappointing it still makes me shed a tear everytime for the people who died that night on the,sad
universal acclaim top grossing film of all time winner of 11 academy awards including best picture what can i say about this monster of a movie that has not already been said how about it didnt float my boat after months of procrastinating i finally went for broke and sat down to view james camerons i knew what to expect after all this is the only movie ive been hearing people talk about for the past six months here is my impression of this film its a mixture of a jane austen novel a disney animated feature and the poseidon adventure rolled up into one nice 200 million package what do i mean by a disney movie well as i was sitting there watching leo dicaprio savor kate winslets delicate touch i thought to myself where have i seen this before the answer the plot is almost identical to that in disneys aladdin you know the one a beautiful rich girl is bored with her aristocratic lifestyle and longs to have some fun she is supposed to marry a wealthy fellow which her parents are pushing her to do then she meets a poor fellow and grows to love him the poor lad shows her a good time like her rich lifestyle never could but what about her rich fiancee whats a girl to do sounds like aladdin doesnt it and george of the jungle and countless sitcom episodes even waynes world made fun of it and that is one of the twelve or so original movie plots which have been used over and over through the years and once again james cameron recycles it but this time he puts the story on a really big boat and gives it a tragic ending to try to squeeze every last tear out of the audience ive never really been impressed with camerons writing and after seeing im still not i cant say much for the acting either billy zane is just too arent i evil to be taken seriously however the good thing about this film is the technical expertise of james cameron the shipsinking portion of the film is fabulous from a technical perspective give jim cameron a camera and a few hundred million dollars and he can cook up a really great looking product just be sure to get someone else to write the script i still insist that contact boogie nights and the apostle are the best films of 1997 does not even come close i give it a 5 out of 10,sad
what negative things can be said about  none as far as im concerned  it was a beautiful love story set inside a very real tragedy this movie achieves the same thing the movie old yeller did  a person wants to see it time and time again in hopes that old yeller jack dawson in this case will make it this time  it was a perfect movie in that the story line the acting and the directing are all executed flawlessly,sad
the special effects were worth the money james cameron spent on them i also am happy he won best picture as hes one of my favorite directors im also happy james horner won for the score however the plot was pretty mundane and the acting was merely ok all in all not something id pay money to see again by the way did anyone else notice the tattoo of a cross on kate winslets arm a little out of the ordinary for a woman of 1912 wouldnt you think,sad
is the most emotionally powerful and visually beautiful film created in a long time at last we have a film that gives us raw emotions and romance and lets us dream of true love passions beauty and tragedy without any of the usual sarcasm and ugly bitterness and disillusions of modern films where love and tenderness are ugly wordslets us escape and experience something greater andmore important than the usual selfpreoccupied and selfanalyzing plots of the modern film it is a complete return to the biggerthanlife characters and drama of the old classics and its huge success proves that people are desperately searching for a sense of tenderness warmth and true love that this film succeeds so beautifully to conveythe emotional impact of leonardo dicaprios and kate winslets performances is almost unique in its strength and through their extraordinarily beautiful and expressive faces we suddenly stop being ourselves and become one with them and their love and passion devotion and sacrificevisually this is one of the most stunningly breathtakingly beautiful films ever made the colours are brilliant and luminous and there is an unusual shimmer and depth to the light which adds to the beautyjames horners music is truly haunting and profoundly romantic it masterfully blends with the visual drama and enhances the emotional experience in a unique waythe performances of every actor and actress are excellent and there is no weakness anywhere which is unusual and which typifies an outstanding film in my view leonardo dicaprios performance is grossly and unfairly underrated as his acting is intimately connected with kate winslets to the point where they are artistically inseparable he should clearly have been nominated for an oscar alongside kate winslet and their contributions to cinema history should have afforded them both with oscar statuettes which went as so often before to inferior but politically more correct performershowever the ultimate reward is of course the fact that will always remain one of the greatest and best loved films in historycaroline fridswedencarolinefridmalmomailteliacom,sad
i went to see on the first day it opened i heard the hype from america most expensive movie ever made etc i thought at least the sinking should be good with all that money spent then when old rose begins her story and the camera glides past her zooming up into the monitor behind her i thought wouldnt it be great if there was a cut to the exact same movement instead i got a match dissolve so perfect that i knew wouldnt disappoint did i enjoy i loved it to those of you who dont okay but dont nitpick an ibm is a computer so you dont like the keyboard or the monitor or whatever take it away and its not a computer anymore it doesnt operate without it is a film its the acting its the script its the visuals take it as a wholeby the way stories work best with stereotypes as audiences we must know who to believe in hate etc in normal films one hour and a half same as before the sinking oh and by the way as the ship neared the iceberg the whole cinema audience were holding their breaths hoping it wouldnt hit so if a film can make you suspend disbelief that much and hope for history to change it cant be all that bad,sad
i thought that it would be a struggle to watch a film of this length i never noticed the time at all and i went and watched it a second time within a week the seats and cinemas in provincial uk are not noted for their comfortwaiting impatiently for the video,sad
every man and his dogs had his say on so ill keep this short and sweetwhats great 1 the ultrarealistic sets 2 combination of action and romance into one 3 all the different forms of special effects 4 the underrated score which is so hauntingly appropriatewhats good 1 leo was surprisingly creditable 2 billy zane made us all hate his guts so well 3 kathy bates was a bastion of pragmatism 4 kate winslet acted well but i wish she would smile morewhats bad 1 the iceberg looked like styrofoam 2 the script was way too simplistic 3 gloria stuart did not look 100 4 how can a 100 woman climb up on railings 5 the length  cut out the 1990s treasurehunter bitnonetheless reminded us all of what an experience going to the movies used to be but so rarely is these days 85 out of 10,sad
the most romantic film i have ever seen  it is not strange to cry while you are watching the film  the worst of all is that a lot of people die because of the vanity  the most romantic moment when rose throws the diamond to the sea  two great actors who had the luck of work together  i will never forget all what this film wants to show us,sad
was a life changing experience for me even as cliche as it may sound  i went to see the film just by chance  i had not heard much about it at the time and just went to see it because it was a new film that had just opened  it forever changed my life  ive now seen it 14 times in all 12 a the theatre  each time i see the film it is as if i am really aboard the great ship and i feel what the characters feel  james cameron has done a magnificent job of expressing the emotions and feeling of each character and it never ceases to touch my soul,sad
starring the obese kate winslet is easily the worst film ever madestarring a fat and spoiled rich girl who should have jumped and that would have ended three hours of pure boring 90210 nonsensetheres nothing even remotely interesting here fat girl likes slim guy and falls for himi dont even see why two guys would fight over such a chubby and unattractive girl in the first placethis film quite frankly bored me to tears and the lines were completely fake and laughableis quite simply the worst film ever made,sad
opened on the day of birth and my birthdays have progressively gotten worse since that day to me presents a myriad of raw anger and spite i could bash this movie for years and my insults would never cease from the improbable story line to the putrid acting performance by leo has made this movie a bane of existenceone would say im nothing but a bitter person but such insinuations could be further from the truth if i had enough guts i would burn every last print in existence no one is going to remember this film except for the fact they spent 20 bucks to buy a crummy movie which has spurned equally dull films of the same formula the green mile pearl harbor and many more to comei just have one big question for all of the idiots who voted for the academy awards for the year 1997 what were you thinking how could you not choose la confidential or good will hunting another reason why the oscars will always disappoint me i will say this the lord of the rings opened on my birthday as well hopefully the curse is broken,sad
a sappy movie about a petty criminal who falls in love with a murderous thieving rich girl on a poorly designed ship the story is predictable and boring the soundtrack is equivalent to a million fingernails on a million chalkboards the only redeeming thing about this film is the amazing performance by the master billy zane once again mr zane shows off his prodigious acting abilities and turns a rather bland movie into a master piece leonardo dicaprio should have paid closer attention to him and maybe he would have learned something this movie is only worth watching if you fast forward to billy zanes parts and the part where the guy who use to play guitar at the bar by my old house tries to give the captain a life jacket more zane and less leo please,sad
you know i love disaster movies and you dont get much bigger a disaster flick than james camerons magnum opus a massivelybudgeted and massively awardwinning 1997 film that swept the board at the oscars and has gone down in history as one of the most popular films ever made yet i only enjoyed half of it and thats due to a problematic structure that sacrifices disaster in favour of a cheesy sappy romance storycameron has always been king when it comes to technology and people interacting with it from his early scifi movies to the abyss and avatar hes great at depicting a world where people interact with technology and use it to their advantage when he focuses on the disaster and sinking of the ship this is an excellent film with some very impressive special effects that really get across the scale of the disasterwhen it comes to human characters cameron is a much less assured writer the romance that plays out here is more unrealistic than in a cheap paperback novel and just as twee the characters are onedimensional from dicaprios irritating commoner to winslets utterly unbelievable aristocrat who falls in love with him their romantic scenes are cringeworthy and as with the other characters they act in very modern days that would have been alien to the era the less said about the likes of billy zanes cardboard cutout villain the betterin the end we get a film which spends the entire first hour and a half just plodding around with dumb characters before the disaster strikes and then things pick up although there are still lots of cheesy moments and poor dialogue its 23 romance and 13 disaster and while the disaster stuff is great the romance is execrable a night to remember remains the best retelling of the tragedy out there because it focused on the events of the tragedy i feel camerons does a disservice to those who lost their lives that night,sad
i am not particularly in love with this movie but i am not stupid enough to be unable to recognize its awesomenessits great the beginning middle the end is all great great everything74what nonsense thanks haters i thought theres no way gets a score lower than 85wow was i surprisedhow can you be so wrong dont you understand the great disservice you do by giving a bad review without knowing what youre talking about go write it on a wallisnt even in the top250how is that possibleoh i get itis the highest grossing movie of alltime so thats why you hate it haters hate its what they do we understand we know whats really going on with all you hatersshouldnt you have to answer a few questions before you are able to submit a review so to prove that you have some remnant of a functioning brain you disgrace the filmmakers so badit really isnt that hard to make a consensus list of the best movies well it is when a monkey is allowed to write a reviewheres what im saying if you call anything other than an absolute masterpiece you are just wrong a monkey could see thathonestly this might be the greatest romantic film ever and it cant even slip into the top250complete utter and absolute nonsense,sad
without spoiling too much its about this old woman who has a dream about this ship that is going to sinkshe has to stop it before its too late and has this piece of jewellery that will somehow prevent it from hitting an iceberg and sinkingunfortunately the ship is full of guests and theyre having a party on it so in order to get on board she has to pretend she is a young scallywag played by none other than leonardo di caprio and infiltrate the shipunfortunately she gets tangled up in a bitter sweet lesbian affair with a woman who shares her name all the while pretending hes a man and trying to stop the ship from sinkingand fails to notice the giant iceberg which hits the ship the party is ruined and theres not enough boatsim not going to spoil the end but ill leave you with a questionwill the sink will the old lady leonardo di caprio save the day or will the posh young lady ruin everything oh and look out for celine dions band who are playing on the illfated ship,sad
okay once and for all this is the ultimate truth of first of all the same people who watch arty quirky b budget films that are often viewed once a year in french in some obscure small cinema who are always complaining about under appreciation and narrow mindedness also need to be aware of the fact that often they are the ones being prejudice towards the hollywood films this movie is not insanely clever it is not particularly intellectual it certainly is not modest and yes it is embarrassingly commercial and almost prides itself for being hollywood junk now it is extremely difficult for me not to judge this movie on those terms but on the other hand there are elements of it that are wonderful and sensitive 1 it is emotionally evocative and truly emphatic 2 the acting is incredible on leonardo dicaprios side she was horribly miscast and winslet is one of my favourite actresses but this part is not meant for her everyone with exception of her does a superb job though except for that horrific actor who plays her fianc who i have yet to see again so obviously im not the only one who thinks so3 the special effects are terrific 4 the script is wonderful and brilliantly delivered 5 at the end of the day a wonderful love story and truly heartbreaking 6 it manages to grab the audience and show them exactly what it would have been like to have been apart of this complete tragedy for these reasons i truly believe is a good movie if you have any brains of course you will not try and convince yourself that it is not a movie that didnt set out for the blockbuster cash because yes it is a sell out but who says that a sell out cant be terrificit is not a perfect movie but i am giving it 1010 because i honestly believe that the love story is beautifully portrayed the direction is amazing and i loathe james cameron and the cinematography and score are incredible come on people give it a chance,sad
terminator and aliens are different from in so many ways first of all terminator is well in simple terms bad not that the movie was bad it was just bad was a remarkable love story which you people obviously dont understand second terminator and aliens are scifi and is well no if you want humor just watch the whole film in rewindthis movie really made me cry i love it so much and am looking for a desktopif you people who are romancehaters scifi lovers and just plain stinkers im not having this conversation anymorewas a great movie,sad
i watched when they had a screening of it at our school it was the worst experience of my life not just the worst movie experience and i live in a country with a war on and economic strife and double digit inflation i have sat through tough examinations have undergone painful surgery and been robbed at gunpoint but this is still my worst experience everok the gunpoint thing is a bit exaggerated i was held at gunpoint not robbed i personally think that kate winslet and leonardo dicaprio are two of the most talented actors of their generation and i wish them all the very best of luck for the rest of their acting careers they dont need it they are good the plot of this particular movie does not amount to more than pulp fiction not the 1994 movie the genre of fiction it could have been written by a starry eyed teenaged girl with no real measure of what love really means i have nothing against teenagers i have against this story any more comments would just make me a bit more tired,sad
pleaseit is a three hour sinking boatyeah we feel bad for the people who lost their livesthat is why were making millions of dollars to exploit their deathgreat job cameronwhy not do a 911 film now or the 1906 earthquake the funny thing is that i have to come up with ten lines about how a boat sankwasnt that the dilemma that james cameron had trying to fill 180 minutes for a boat that sank just as fast and make it a little more interesting than the horror that it was how can we sucker punch people to go to a movie that is simply tragic so that we can remind them to avoid pleasure cruise boats from the early 1900s especially around icebergstrudging slowly around an obvious and uncreative storylineblah blah blahi wasted 6 hours of my life with and pearl harbormonumental days in american history destroyed in 6 slow torturing hourswhy not rip my fingernails out,sad
i still love this movie to this day  no matter how many bad reviews it might get from critics today this movie is still one of my favorites  i havent seen this movie on dvd yet im still holding out for the special edition dvd supposedly coming out soon but im sure it has even better sound quality crispness in screen clarity and even louder special effects  i just think the dvd out now sucks  how can you have such a lousy dvd for such  a huge film the name of the movie was called for goodness sakes  hahahthats like having the movie the hulk come out with a lousy dvd  oh welli can dream cant ieither way this movie still holds a special place in my heart,sad
the target of complaints against this magnificent film is centered between the beautiful relationship of jack and rose two starryeyed lovers who find the other and their inner selves when they meet in a straineous situation its almost hard to believe the critism thrown at this wonderful movie jack and roses love is one of a kind pure dangerous thrilling and innocent  they are the tool cameron uses to bring us to the past  to this love leaves you aching with longing for something at least half as beautiful  the barriers between them cal ruth society reputations moneythey are all huge stamped reminders of a world once lived  the feeling in your heart that you get when rose finally comes to the openarmed jack and they unchain their desires and meet lips at last is indescribable so in conclusion i guess i am saying that the love itself is half of what makes this awesome movie amazing and i beg you to watch it without prejudice to hear the ghostly music and feel an overflowing joy and sadness,sad
as i first saw i was indeed pleased with the result of the film nevertheless i always thought about it as a typical love story as we have seen it a hundred times with the difference of thepecial effects were good the sinking was very well done even the more than three hours didnt bother me a lot a few months later i watched it again this time on video since im not a di caprio fan i concentrated on the plot of on him it was bad this second time the movie bored the hell out of me it is one of those movies you can get a complete awersion to the plot is bad dialogues are even worse and visual efects didnt look all too impresive either just compare it with other cheaper moviesall in all after seeing the movie the first time i would have given it a rating of 9 now it gets a 1 only because i cant rate below zero,sad
by far is the best movie ever made  james cameron is one of the best directors  i am very glad that they casted kate winslet instead of claire danes  leonardo dicaprios acting was by far his best performance of his career  i cant wait until it comes out on video,sad
when i finally saw i was beyond disappointed in fact ive been forced to see this movie many times in recent years and every single time i feel nothing but disappointment a big complain about has to do with the history in the movie since everyone knows that the ship goes down oh sorry spoiler alerts for those who dont know this historical fact cameron wrote in one of the most forced love stories ive ever seen on film yes the ship hits an iceberg but the crew actually saw the iceberg minutes before the went down however for some reason the ship didnt change course and therefore the most devastating part of the film wasnt even accurate up time that point cameron spent over 2 hours and did i mention this film is 195 minutes long setting up a sappy love story then in the end jack didnt even have to die because there was plenty of room for him to lie next to rose on that board is basically about forbidden love and one weve seen that done better about a hundreds times before i mean really you have a movie about one of those most tragic and horrifying ship wrecks in modern history and we have to spend most of the run time with two teenagers from different worlds who are trapped in a forbidden love story come on cameron you gave us aliens and terminator 2 judgement day rememberin the end is not only the most overrated movie ever made its also a terrible movie,sad
is absolutely not a worthwatching movie in the film rose caledon and roses mother went on board a socalled unsinkable ship called accidentally jack dawson and his friend won two tickets of in a poker game rose and jack loves each other at one sight however after an accident jack died leaving rose alonein this expensive film the only wonderful thing is the sound effect that is quite exciting or breathtaking when ship is going to sink the sound can successfully build the suitable atmospherehowever there are quite a lot of unfavorable things that make this movie into a crap firstly the time needed to watch this film is three hours which is a long time most of the time are talking about two teenagers dating thats boring watching this the only worthwatching part is the sinking part therefore this is absolutely a waste of time and we can do a lot more meaningful things secondly some parts in the film are not sensible for example when the ship is sinking there is a band playing music are they celebrating the sink of the ship which symbolizes the end of the movie also caledon hockley is a nice man before boarding the ship however when he saw rose and jack kissing he immediately became an evil thats impossible lastly the story is quite strange this story is going to tell us that love is everlasting which can be realized from the song called my heart will go on however caledon in the movie loves rose very much and died for it in contrast jack a suddenly appear person becomes a heroin conclusion i think that the film is dreadful in many ways including the arrangement of the story line the length and the meaning if you think that you have nothing else meaningful to do i recommend you to sleep instead of wasting time and money on watching this meaningless movie,sad
okay everyone knows what happens in so ill discuss a few other points while the movie was in the theaters one of my friends went to see it 13 times just so that he could find goofs the one that he picked up on was when someone opens a door turns his head and you see that its the wrong color when i took a sailing class in summer 2005 the teacher explained why specifically the sank it was traveling way too fast for something that size so they couldnt turn in time and the metal on the ships sides was rather shoddy that is to say they endangered everyones lives so as to save money for themselves well thats one of many times when those at the top have put profits ahead of safety and i have a question considering how many people died on the was it appropriate to use this event to further leonardo dicaprios career as for that story that i wrote it portrayed kevin kline and tom selleck from in  out believing themselves to resemble leo and kate al pacino from donnie brasco realizing that he was going to sleep with the fishes jim carrey from liar liar admitting i cant lie i wasnt watching for icebergs while i was steering kim basinger from la confidential wondering whether or not she would look like veronica lake at the bottom of the ocean and jack nicholson from as good as it gets still inside his cabin and saying dont knock on my door even if the ship is sinking dont knock on my dooroh i forgot to say my opinion of the movie when everyone at school asked me what i thought i always said well i thats what im going to say here i consider right down the middle i think that in  out was the best movie of 1997 end of story,sad
is proboly the best movie i have ever seen it seems so real and is very very movingthe first time i saw it i cried which i hardly ever do in a moviejack and rose are perfect together and it is very sad at the end when jack dies the whole movie taught me a lot i was very glad i watched it for my first time when i was 11 years old now i am 13 and have watched it 6 times since then and i never seem to get bored of it it is a one of a kind movie and i can see why it won so many oscars i really like the scene were rose and jack are at the front of the boat and jack says do u trust me then he lifts her up so shes flyingthe whole movie i rate 1010 for obvious reasons,sad
i love the way people write may contain spoilers are there folks out there who have never seen the movie in theater on tv on dvd or vhs  are there folks that dont know the story makes me chuckle but i digress this movie is one of the best ever made and i was thrilled to see it again on the big screen i do not believe the 3d adds anything to the film as much of it is still in 2d with the 3d element in either the foreground or back round i am not that observant to notice that the brightness of the film is 20 diminished due to wearing the glasses as others have mentioned i am spell bound by the story telling documentarylove storyaction disaster movie i have see this movie more times than i can count  including no fewer than 8 times in the theater when it first came out i still cry every time starting when jack takes rose flying off the bow of the ship heightening when the string quartet starts playing nearermy god to thee and i dont stop until after the credits roll every element of this film holds your interest characters are spot on once the sink sequence starts it is edge of your seat heart pounding as you see special effects that you cant believe before your eyes and for me personally shout out to the costumewardrobe outfitters because i love the clothes in this movie camerons attention to detail is unmatched bravo to his work ethic i guess thats why it takes him 10 years to make his blockbusters but hey when the films make over 100mil you dont really need more than 2,sad
the abyss should have served as an ominous warning as enjoyable as that film is when it came to the relationship between ed harris and mary elizabeth mastrantonio it contained some of the most risible dialogue committed to film thankfully though it was only a small part of the story however with the romance is front and centre its what everything hangs uponanyone familiar with james cameron should know that hes terrible at writing anything that can be vaguely construed as romantic as well as the abyss you have sarah connor and kyle reeses courtship in the terminator full of hackneyed dialogue puppy dog looks and embarrassing sex its the only weak link in an otherwise excellent film but with you have to swallow scene after scene of it until you end up puking all over yourself like a tramp on a park benchone of the most laughable scenes is when jack leonardo dicaprio shows rose kate winslet his artwork his portfolio is full of nudie drawings and theres one girl that he seems particularly fond of but when rose suggests that maybe he and this woman had a thing going on he laughs it off saying that she was a onelegged prostitute why should this stop him it didnt stop paul mccartneybut earlier in the scene jack says that this woman had beautiful hands hes about as convincing as an artist as denise richards is as nuclear physicist and later on when he draws rose in the buff hes supposedly so professional that he doesnt try anything on  there are no sleazy attempts to give her one what kind of artist is he but you can hardly blame jack he looks about twelve  hes probably terrified that rose is going to crush him to death with her bountiful bosom indeed when he draws her he seems to be doing his best to ignore her womanly curves  all the hair flicking and concentrated glances are a blatant attempt to either ignore the rod that is pitched in his trousers or to keep him from crying in fearhowever as hard as jack tries to avoid sleeping with rose she eventually traps him in some ye olde car she even asks him to take her to the stars quality dialogue jim and there she has her wicked way with the timorous youth poor guy he even looks close to tears as he lies trembling on top of her i dont know why he reacts in such a way if hes a virgin as his actions and general attitude suggest he should be doing penile handstands for scoring such a fine piece of assbut as risible as the romance is the thing that irritated me the most was one of jacks friends  some irish guy called tommy who he meets on the ship hes meant to be a lovable salt of the earth type guy but i just wanted him dead indeed the bit where he gets shot by one of the white star line officers genuinely had me cheering and he gets shot after calling the white star line guy a limey bastard england 1 ireland 0 but this tommy character is meant to be someone we can root for but instead hes a selfish mealymouthed drunken idiot to hell with himand the whole idealising of the irish is a major problem i have with the film theyre all wonderful people the english though by and large are scum theyre either cowardly psychotic or brandy drinking fools the only englishman who comes out half okay is the captain and even he crashes into an iceberg and carks it in the endbut back to the idealising of the irish  the music is insufferable its that whole enyastyle pseudogaelic crap i wanted to stab myself in the ears with a pencil and then of course theres celine dion what a rancid song that is at the end its like being sodomised by a rhinothe only character i sort of halfliked was billy zanes lackey but thats because hes a total bastard he falsely plants evidence on jack punches him in the gut and acts like a jerk at every opportunity what a guy and i guess billy zane aka kelly brooks penis is okay as well although i do have to say that his face freaks me out somewhat its got a plasticy michael jacksonstyle look about it plus he seems to be wearing lots of eyeliner but i do enjoy his general wretchedness especially the way he survives the sinking he kidnaps a child and hops onto a lifeboat declaring that hes all the kid has in the world to hell with your selfrighteous irishmen and fophaired artists this is what we need  hammy rubberfaced industrialists who are only interested in saving their own skinsbut unfortunately kelly brooks penis cant save the film its a tedious terribly written mess that has one of the most risible wraparound stories seen in cinema i really have no idea how that old lady got an oscar nomination i think the academy were just impressed that she hadnt snuffed it yet but at least the very end gives us hope that the rose character dies she lies there on her bed surrounded by her pictures and then returns to the and all the people who died that night is she now stuck on that ship locked in sweaty teary union with her wretched boytoy for the rest of eternity one can only hope,sad
this film had good effects for a movie created in 1997 this is the only reason why it is worth watching once again hollywood does its best at taking a terrible tragedy and turning it around to be a love story you either liked this movie for its effects and love story or you hated because of its depiction fist then pearl harbor next it will be on 911 i would like to see how america responds to a 911 love story trust me they will do it within a few years if you are deep into the events of it would probably be a good movie to watch other than that keep walking down the movie shelveslater,sad
the first time i commented on this movie i gave it a really harsh review since then nothing has changed but im going easier this timetwo titles come to mind when reviewing it natural born killers nbk and gone with the wind gwtw till the worst and the second worst movies ive ever seen nbk is by far the worst it has an excellent director a good writer good to very good actors and even so it managed to be completely empty with some spectacular sequences gone completely to waste in meaningless situations like the wonderful grayscale prison sequence gwtw is another meaningless work but it never had any chance with terrible speeches a director that didnt know what he was doing and a story that would have thrown it into oblivion if it was not settle in the american civil war it has some historical value or so i was toldback to the first obvious problem is the plot at one side there is this young lady about to get married to a rich man an educated pig but still a pig on the other side there is that young man handsome goodhearted and a gifted artist the only problem is that the young artist is poor but mind you the lady is rich already it was absolutely impossible for her to not fall in love with the artist the only conflict possible is the jealousy of the rich man against the poor artist predictable to say the least then when everybody have fallen for the new happy couple the ship sinks im absolutely sure that people wouldnt have cried so much if everybody had died the whole story is extremely predictable worse it is made predictablehow did take the second place from gwtw well it took a lot of cash to do that cameron wanted a real sized ship to be able to effectively send it to the bottom fine its not my money then we see the result on the big screen and now it is our money since indiana jones 3 i hadnt seen such a lousy chromakey when you see the passengers falling into the sea it looks like they were filmed against a projection like in the original king solomons mines movie that alone i wouldnt have minded so much then you watch cameron commenting on the boxoffice success of and his claim that it was due to his attention to details even if that statement was true there is one more problem the big things are all wrong why care about the detailsit was not easy to put the about four hours gone with the wind on third place but cameron made it possible in about three hours he has a talent for blockbusters its too bad he cannot also make them good movies,sad
i have waited three years to see this movie and finally obtained a video for 2  im glad i didnt invest more  the acting from the leading pair is as awful as it can get  the script is absolutely horrific  effects and music earn accolades as do some of the supporting cast  the mystery is why was this film so big a blockbuster  maybe with proper actors,sad
yeah you heard me the worst star trek movie ever made is more fun to watch than this over rated piece of garbage it is a disaster flick nothing more acting is horrible with exception of billy zane who is able to do a decent job the special effects are the only thing going for this film i normally enjoy movies from james cameron aliens terminator but i found this to be horrible and by the way dicaprio cant act and thats why he didnt get an oscar for this slop avoid this movie at all costs and go see with entertainment value,sad
the most impressive thing about is the awards audiences and money that can be raked in by such a crummy movie  of course does have truly incredible special effects and good cinematography but it seems as if mr cameron said to himself i have a trillion dollars worth of sinking ship special effects now what can i do to pad it out to 195 minutes  so he sat down for about 20 minutes and wrote the story and the screenplay  unfortunately the story takes much longer to tell than it apparently did to writethe story is about first class passenger little girl rose  trapped in a young womans body and engaged to a wealthy ogre  and third class passenger little boy jack trapped in a young mans body traveling the world to draw pictures of nude bar prostitutes  who incredulously meet on board the fall almost immediately in lust little boy jack draws a nude picture of little girl rose  the two have a romp in the back seat of a car the ship sinksas pathetic as the story is most of the other components of the film are just as bad  the dialogue is so contrived and sappy it seems like something one would expect from a 50 cent paperback romance  the music is just as sappy mostly orchestrated snippets of that wretched song by screamin celine  the acting  it seems the actors realized the stupidity of the dialog they were reciting and just wanted to get the heck out of therefinally over an hour and a half into the movie the ship hits the iceberg in the next hour we have the only 30 minutes of the film worth seeing  the special effects are tremendous  its as if i was  actually aboard the  unfortunately by the time the film got to this point i was so bored out of my skull it was difficult to see this as anything but a bunch of special effects  until then there had been no emotional hook in the film so by the time it got to all the drama of the ship sinking and desperate people panicking and trying to cling to their lives there was nothing to feelthe two really good things about are after what seemed like seven months in the theater it finally ended and once it comes out on video insomnia will be a thing of the past,sad
yeah you heard right for all its special effects obscenely high budget and no less criminal amount of critic acclaim is nothing more than a big pile of rubbish the ship sank and sucked millions of dollars down with itfirst of all take away the special effects what your left with is a third rate script it attempts to mix a period piece with trendy all too modern dialogue i have doubts that the finger and the term bum a smoke existed in 1912 you also get the most contrived love story in the history of motion pictures there is no way jack would have even been allowed near where rose was also i doubt that a girl like rose raised in a life of luxury and set to marry a billionaire would be interested in a bum like jack the customs at the time would not have permitted it what i also have a problem with is the cliches that this script banks on it is always the rich people who are the villains and the poor little popper is the hero who saves the day the screenwriter must have no mind of hisher ownsecond the acting is horrible sorry ladies its no mystery why leo wasnt nominated for an oscar but leo can act he has proven that in the past but period pieces are not his strength do i even need to mention the man in the iron mask kate winslet is the typical strong willed female character made to appeal to the feminists watching this movie they might have had their feathers ruffled by the lines the real purpose of college is to meet a good man though she is good but one good performance in a sea of bad onesjames cameron is not high on my list of favorite directors and stands as the biggest stroke of his ego needless to say i was disgusted by the moment of silence he made at the oscars the only redeeming quality of is watching the ship sink which fills the second half of this movies grossly overlong running time but it is hardly worth it and the best picture oscar god there is only one way i can say this la confidential got screwed as did good will huntingto sum up i found my 3 hours in the dentist chair last month more enjoyable than this piece of trash theres a special place in hollywood hell for,sad
this movie is awful its only good because leo dies and the special effects are decent but just because it did really well at the box office because 100 teenage girls saw it 10000 times so i have to say it was horrible the story was awful and i just wanted to see the effects they didnt need to waste the first video on their love over the course of a month what garbage,sad
thank you james cameron your ego has truly created a film of such mindnumbing tedium that cant even be taken seriouslythis might have been a nicely entertaining film if it wasnt so selfaware in its epic scope it has far too many villains all of whom get there hollywood styled comeuppance in the final act this makes the film muddled and instead of showing the tragedy of the incident it just shows a complete disregard for human life that is sickeningalso i was offended by the way the romance completely overshadowed the loss of command and anarchy thats what this film should have been let it not be said that there isnt an intriguing subplot hidden away in here which is unfortunately just made ridiculous here by the fact that everyone seems to be out to keep de caprio in a very mundane performance and winslet apartcameron has the biggest ego in hollywood and he has proven that with this film ironically this is also the largest grossing film of all time basically this means that camerons ego is now so big that any script that comes near him will be devoured all that i ask of him is that he doesnt go near alien 5this is proof that hollywood cant produce anything of worthwhile substance the fact that the general public as i call them lapped this up like hoards of mindless puppies almost destroys my faith in the world and hence the potential audiences of true genius filmmakersshame really,sad
if you are thinking of watching this film i have a suggestiontake a spoon and gauge out your eyes then get a fork and stab into your brain one of the worst films ever madeonly hobgoblinstroll and death wish 4 are worseutter st,sad
2018 and i still watch it and still love it this is a brilliant movie ever leo should get an oscar tbh hehe,sad
is something truly amazingi think this is the greatest movie of all time,sad
this movie is a romance and a tragedy the main actors are kate winslet she plays rose and leonardo dicaprio he plays jackrose is a rich lady she has a lot of money jack the second character is a poor person he doesnt have money the story starts when they go on a big boat going to america called the on the boat they meet and fall in love and have a romance their love transforms in passion but the as strong as we think i love because this movie is a true love story who doesnt agree with the social walls i like it too because leonardo is very nice and beautiful like kate winslet im a fan of these actors their actor play is perfect,sad
at the time was the most expensive and highestgrossing movie of all time it was also the first movie since benhur in 1959 to win 11 oscars which is the most since then has become one of the most polaropposing movies as well as the second biggest as of now avatar in 2009 is to thank the lovers of this movie clearly outnumber the haters because this movie has high ratings on every site even so i still think that it deserves to be ranked higher in every site higher than pulp fiction or vertigo maybe not but you get my point there are flaws in this movie that keep it from being perfect number one is the whole subplot with the diamond necklace old rose who tells the story still has the diamond and throws it in the ocean at the end because she feels thats where it belongs why not give it to a museum or feed a country then there is jack and roses names being mentioned countless times some more dialogue is pretty dumb and there are no instances of any powerful dialogue but considering how many upsides this movie has these flaws do almost nothing to effect the quality of the film because all the positives erase the negativesthe story of is pretty much romeo and juliet on a ship jack is a poor charming artist rose is rich and mistreated who gets saved by jack in every way romeo and juliet is a story that many people find stupid because two young teenagers fall in love then kill themselves after two days of knowing each other yes jack and rose fall in love quickly but there are no dumb suicides so jack and rose are smarter there people also criticize roses character as being a rich spoiled girl who gets anything she wants i for one can relate to roses character she struggles to be perfect and is forced into and world where wealth is number one and is being forced to marry an abusive man who only want to marry her to inherit money nobody understands her she feels trapped i can relate to roses feelings by her becoming what she does not want then jack comes along who finally understands her he gives her the courage to be what she wants jack is sensitive patient and fun sounds gay leo dicaprio is such a good actor that he makes jack seem real and cool this is one of leos biggest powerhouse performances that still shines maybe jack and rose fell in love quickly but if the ship did not sink would they have gotten married right away no just date for a few months then break up if jack would have lived would they have gotten married maybe jack risked his life for rose and they did all they could to survive since they were part of such a huge impact on each others lives maybe they would marry maybe not not just jack and rose but everybody is developed so well you feel like you grew up with them very few movies feature character development this deep then the ship hits the iceberg movies have been made that have all turned out well but none have been spectacular in the sinking portion the danger is high sets are great sympathy is drawn etc then there is the score which is so beautiful and so sad it adds so much to the littlest thingspeople mainly men that dont like this think that theyre too cool for it anybody that doesnt like this just fails at trying to be cool too closeminded to see into and beyond a lovestory and too closeminded to see how good the song and score were maybe this is a fake story dont try to get all smart and say how the ship really did sink the acting is extremely strong characters are developed so well the disaster scenes are played out excellently the music is so haunting haters should continue watching nascar and delta force 2 1010,sad
this movie doesnt put a foot wrong over a decade after i first watched itthis film still tears my heart out and throws it in my facesuperb performances by the cast a golden globe nod for dicaprio an oscar nomination worthy performance decide for yourself oscar nomination for kate winslet and one for gloria stuart as well who puts on an amazingly heartfelt retrospective performance the film is worth a watch to see these alonethe visuals in this film are also stunning even sixteen years later they still dont look outdated so if that is your thing its well worth seeinga beautiful screenplay well worth the three hour watching time to watch it unfold youll laugh and cry with realistic characters dialogue and be awestruck how the tragic scenario scenario provides a frame for the eventsfinally for the soundtrack buffs in my opinion perhaps the best soundtrack ever written james horner take a bow well deserving of the oscar win some tragically beautiful pieces even if you dont watch the film check out rose unable to stay unwilling to leave hymn to the sea and death of all masterpieces in their own rightthis film is a well deserved 1010 rating if you havent seen it then you should definitely in my top ten films to see before you die a complete masterpiece,sad
i have watched so many good movies some of the best of all time but when i finished watching this movie i just wanted to watch it all over again i have seriously never seen such an entertaining and good quality movie i had watched parts of this movie a few years ago today i watched the whole thing for the first time in my life im 15 and i cannot believe that someone could of produced a movie this good the acting was so good i almost forgot that i was watching a movie i cannot believe that someone had actually tried to make a second one because there is no way in hell it could beat thislets also face it leonardo was extremely enjoyable to look at i highly recommend this movie to anyone it doesnt matter what type of movies you like im pretty sure covers all types of movies and you simply cant beat it this is definitely my favourite movie now and i cant wait for tomorrow to start so i can watch it all over again after school tomorrow,sad
once in every decade since the inception of the motion picture camera comes a film that seems to transcend criticism and stands the test of time as one of the all time greats such is the case with james camerons magnum opus this epic recreation of the ocean liners illfated maiden voyage offers everything one can ask for and more there is spectacle and dramatic images that sticks with viewers for a very long timethe film begins as a frame story with a 101 year old survivor rose played by gloria stuart telling a team of treasure hunters and scientists her experience on the as a younger woman now played by kate winslet rose traveled in first class on the with her materialistic mother and her haughty fiance cal played by billy zane rose feels completely suffocated by the stiff and mind numbing activities and chatter that comes with being rich and wants to break out and just do something exciting her life changes when she meets thirdclass artist jack dawson played by leonardo dicaprio as the two talk and hang out more and more they begin to fall for one another of course her mother and fiance disapprove mainly because he is poor everything comes to head when the ship hits an iceberg and begins to sink to her inevitable doom some people have made the joke to death that this film is essentially romeo and juliet on the i see this as only somewhat true as there are indeed similar elements but the real story would detract from a bythenumbers correlation between the stories here the love story really works on many levels rose and jack do not fall in love at first sight when they start talking with one another they see that they do have much in common it takes a few days but they decide that they are best for each other and fall completely in lovecameron has done something very special with all the characters characters in this film he has always been noted for putting characters and interactions above the story and so he does here too jack rose cal ruth and lovejoy are all fictional characters of course but they all interact very convincingly with the reallife characters in this way when the ship sinks the audience has built up and emotional connection to both fictional and real characters allowing for more heartbreaking truth when most of the characters die or are in peril when the ship is sinkingthe casting of this movie is phenomenal i have to credit casting director mali finn and cameron for really finding great actors and some of the best character actors in the business leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet forever made a splash no pun intended as two of hollywoods best leading actors and have so far proved that they are two of the bestwhen production began on this film cameron knew partial sets and models simply wouldnt do so he and his crew went out and actually built a huge version of the ship carpets and all he is a perfectionist therefore everything on the ship had to be artistically and physically correct to lend a greater sense of verisimilitude when the audience viewed it in 1997 it looks simply breathtaking and we feel like we have been transported to the actual ship itself as far as we know cameron probably knows the than anyone so when its shown here in its glory we believe it of course is about the sinking of the unsinkable ship the final hour of the film is indeed the most gripping as we see the ship start slipping beneath the waves cameron uses his extensive knowledge of special effects to very convincingly present the sinking in all of its gruesome truth its very well paced finely edited and of course spectacular and what makes it even more moving is we have gotten to know the characters and therefore its very heartbreaking when most of them die the aftermath is of course very tragic and cruel because we all know what happened but when it came on screen we were still broken by it when those who couldnt get into the lifeboat drown we wish in our hearts that they could have there is more her that will shock viewers but i wouldnt dream in a million years of revealing the ending of jack and roses story arcjust as i claimed for steven spielberg directing schindlers list here it initially seems like james cameron is the wrong man for the job at first glance he is known for action films no romances or dramas yet somehow this is the greatest film he has ever done he directs with a keen vision and is quite unrelenting in getting his vision across hence why many people despise working with him but his passion and dedication to the project shines through all the way through its three hour running time such dedication won the film multiple oscars 11 to be precise cameron himself took home 4 in one night cementing his status as one of the most successful filmmakers of our generationthis is one of the best films to grace the cinema the sheer might and size of the picture doesnt dwarf the actors who are given the chance to breath and connect us to one of the most infamous tragedies in history a sharp criticism of mans hubris and a stirring tribute to those who lost their lives that night such is how i can describe,sad
i couldnt take my eyes off this movie once i started to watch it was the most well thought outoriginal one of a kind masterpiece i have ever laid eyes on just thinking about it could make me cry even if you havent seen the movie in full almost no one hasnt heard one reference in a show movie etc etc there is just no way to avoid it  this was the most expensive film made at the time and it was money well spentnow it is on the top 5 grossing movie of all time list director james cameron is as good as they come and will be remembered 100 years from now as the director of kate winslet is the perfect actress for this role and has the old rich charm that upper class people had back then leonardo dicaprio became my crush of the century  he is so caring and sweet and beautiful go watch this movienote to people who say its cheesy your missing out,sad
couldnt help but notice the number of posters that feel criticizing the moviein any waylumps you into a group of social misfits described as haters i thought the movie was fairly entertaining with outstanding special effects but had a large problem with the lack of realism especially ironic as cameron got most of the details correctlythe love story was patently ludicrous but probably the thing that drove the numbers at the box office the treatment of historical figures like molly brownfor examplewas appalling dripping with misogynywith a little more even handed treatment the movie could have been outstanding and compelling to the degree that it actually deserved the oscars it won that year and still included a plausible romantic plot,sad
the movie written directed and produced by james cameron centers on the sinking of the rms while also focusing on a fictitious love story between two forbidden loves rose dewitt bukater kate winslet is a 17 yearold first class passenger who is engaged to be married to pittsburgh steel magnate cal hockley billy zane although she says she loves cal rose feels pressured by her mother frances fisher into marrying him roses mother acknowledges the fact that the marriage is a way to solve the familys secret financial problems jack dawson leonardo dicaprio is a poor artist who wins a ticket aboard the in a poker match rose first meets jack when he saves her from throwing herself overboard in an act of suicide this rapidly starts a love affair between the two a common theme in this movie is the contrasting differences between the first and third class passengers the first class passengers are made to appear ignorant arrogant and selfcentered while the third class passengers are kind charitable and altruistic while this may have been true of some first class passengers others were very generous giving up their seat on the lifeboat for those who needed it i feel that the story played too much into the greed of the upperclassthis movie is a good movie in many ways the direction music production camerawork and set creation are especially good as is the acting by kate winslet however i was not very pleased with the work of the other actorsactresses especially that of gloria stuart who received an academy award nomination for her role as an elderly rose her acting was cheesy and mediocre yet she earned a nomination due to the hype surrounding the film at the time of its release the screenplay was also lacking although the dialogue is pretty good the lines are unbelievably predictable and corny i expected better from a james cameron filmoverall i guess i had extremely high expectations going into this movie wouldnt anyone and my hopes were dashed by bad acting and writing,sad
i was looking through these reviews last week contemplating whether or not i should see this movie again upon its 100 year anniversary 3d release i was looking to see if anyone had reviewed yet more on the films re release in its 3d glory  sadly they hadnt so i though if i want to know if its worth the price tag i will have to go considering myself to be interested in the  not enough to call myself a titanorack mind  i have learnt a lot about that ship whether it be on the tv or in books curiosity got the better of me and i decided to don on the 3d glasses required and watch the movie james cameron is the king of 3d 3d to me being pretty much a gimmick which i think only works with made for 3d films on the big screen only avatar is the perfect example of this although i didnt care for the film much the 3d is sensational made for 3d movies such as avatar and piranha etc i have enjoyed and found them effective you can see a lot of effort has gone into the 3d for some of the scenes are magnificent the lifeboats rowing away being the best 3d scene for me in the film was that worth the price of the ticket i am very undecided i love this film and have seen it numerous times and i am not sure 3d added anything extra to the film because it wasnt made for 3d it didnt have the same effect for me i think for me it was a chance again to see the film of the big screen which i enjoyed again very much one thing i did think about on seeing it in 3d yesterday was why on earth was billy zane in this film he is more hammy than william shatner in star trek and not in a good way but where this film is concerned my heart will always go on so if you want to know if its worth going to see in 3d i would say if you are a massive fan or never seen it before yes otherwise not,sad
15 years after this classic first hit its back and now it looks and sounds better than ever and some recent releases look so muddy and artificial in comparison here cameron uses his expertise to improve on the technical aspects of without sacrificing what already worked nothing gratuitously calls attention to the new 3d transfer instead it enhances the gorgeous and meticulously produced movie the spectacle glows with renewed strength and each performance each costume each set now looks remarkable all contributing what a true cinematic experience should beas everyone knows our stars are not reciting shakespeare the focus is on the relationship and how two young people connect with each other surrounding them is cast of real and fictional character that gives us a little insight into what it was like being in the doomed ship people look and act the part each class defined by the parameters of their own creation cameron understands the passengers on this ride zane bates de caprio and winslet all do remarkable work and its still a question why de caprio wasnt recognized by his peers when the film first came out he is central to the success of this confectionin the end the film like the title will go on having us choke on the emotional highs the times when we understand what gives us humanity and hope and when we see that humans share so much and are so far from perfect but we just keep on going and we will have dreams even after the worst of nightmaresit deserves repeated viewings and much praise thank you mr cameron,sad
was the cinematic phenomenon of the 90s and the worldwide highest grossing film of all time before being dethroned by avatar from james cameron the only director who could ever beat james cameron in the boxoffice now has become the quintessential cooltohate film hence one of the most controversial best picture winners which is surprising because if anything the movie screams best picture theres something quite unique in the way the huge success of became a defining key of detestation challenging any attempt for a rational appreciation well were in 2011 now  the hype has passed cgi became a tiresome trend providing a series of unoriginal specialeffectsdriven films kate won an oscar and scorsese injected some cinematic botox on leos exprettyboy face in these circumstances i believe we have enough distance to judge again regardless of all the peripheral elements that contributed to its success back then in 1997 when was released i was the kind of teenager who avoided any mainstream phenomenon needless to say that i categorically refused to be brainwashed by the wave the film was the absolute mustsee and the girls were all drooling over di caprio and you couldnt listen to the radio or watch tv musical programs without having the annoying flute of celine dions my heart will go on i was far from imagining that this music would define my personal nostalgia of the late 90s then the movie grabbed 11 oscars it was the most watched and rewatched film ever and i even had to make an essay about at school where i eagerly expressed that the iceberg story left me coldbut suddenly something strange happened the bubble of popularity popped some little fellows displayed a childish pride of having disliked the film and i cant count how many girls were so pleased to say that leo was too girlish when one year before he had an angel face then i reversed my position and from the enthusiasm of having avoided the film i wanted to understand why people were being so hypocritical with their own appreciation and feel guilty as if they admired a naked emperor with all flash and no substance this is how gradually became the cooltohate film because its always cool to hate popular stuff but its so uncool to try to be cool so this was my personal encouragement to give it a chance in 1999 and to know where i stood for i came i saw and i liked itim not even afraid to admit that i loved it it had everything i was expecting it was spectacular thrilling romantic and didnt rely too much on special effects except for the terrific sinking part yes the film flirts with cinematic clichs sometimes the whole follow your heart message is almost disneylike but this is the point of the film its the romance with the as a setting not the story featuring a romance when we think of we have less the image of the ship breaking in half in our minds than kate and leo flying over the sunset this is the defining image of the film and one of the most iconic of american cinema and this is the strength of the filma few recent movies have managed to achieve a classic status so quickly and so impacting the way did and this is certainly due to the constant symbiosis between the story and the special effects that provided the classic vibe and whether it was intentional or not it sure succeeded has the thrills the romance and an inspirational message simple enough to appeal to all the sensitive hearts all over the world and seriously lets not get too cynical about the marketing campaign and deny the artistic value of some of the most financially successful films theres a time for independent films and another one for spectacular blockbusters  as long as there is a good story justifying the use of special effects and the exhilarating sinking sequencehad the intelligence to have a sort of classic story that could appeal on a universal level a love story undermined by a tragedy its sad and inspiring a love story between a rich aristocratic woman and a thirdclass youthful and optimistic boy its universal the whole tragedy of the has been touched by a cinematic grace that made it one of the greatest american classics and i mean great in the classic meaning of the world and i better take an innocent story even naive rather than a spectacular but dull one like independence day one year before or a thoughtprovoking but manipulative one like saving private ryan the year after so i loved i felt for the characters the part where one mother reads a story for her children while the ship sinks will haunt me forever the music beautifully conveys the innate sadness of a rather passionate romance the film revives the greatest tradition of the disaster genre with a perfectionism that finally paidoff and i applaud james cameron for that and now i wonder what the haters hate in the film what makes lord of the rings so deeper than love story good vs evil dont they miss the young leo who could smile and shout even the cringeworthy king of the world line regarding the actual cinematic trends is a classic among the classics and the deserving best picture of 1997so i dont find any particular reason to hate this film and if i ever found one lets say  uh the part with the necklace which i didnt really care for well for one reason to dislike the film i can find ten to love it disliking just because it was once so popular is simply a mistake,sad
since release in 1997 people have begun to criticize the film rather than congratulate cameron on the difficulty of his creation i am an 18yearold male who usually despises romantic love stories regardless of this in my eyes the chemistry between rose and jack respectable acting and a surprisingly convincing and moving storyline is unprecedented in film history i critique movies all the time although sometimes the public and critics must look past technological superiority and complex story lines to enjoy the simplicity emotionally affecting and timeless storyline of a film like so please dont notice the glitches and problems with camerons filmmaking that people so often point out because it was over 10 years ago a fantastic watch and the highest grossing film for a reason,sad
as with all movies to date there are a plethora of people that simply adore there are a multitude of people that utterly despise and there are many more in between those that are infatuated with this movie comment on its brilliant acting cunning storyline and sad yet epic finale those believing this movie is garbage comment on its lack of an original plot boring script and historical inaccuracy and yet again there are many more explanations in between the two extremespersonally i believe there is something within this movie that transcends all of the above arguments its a very basic theme losing the one you love the actors in this case are just devices clichd personalities to which many people can relate although dicaprios and winslets acting was in my opinion brilliant that is irrelevant all they had to do was become relatable which they did perfectlythe reason this theme is so powerful however is because it is inevitable in life thats not being pessimistic that is just fact all humans die eventually and all humans love at one time or another except for the psychopaths the depressing truth is that one day your loved one and yourself will be separated either through death hatred or some other factor basically love is not eternal in this physical realm that is what makes this movie so powerful people begin to see themselves in the main characters and with roses loss comes the viewers loss with jacks death comes the viewers pain i can still remember those three fateful words at the closure of the movie dont let go that truly captures the movie as a whole and offers a reconciliation for this depressing theme all in all regardless of the acting the setting the historical accuracy the plot the storyline or any other facet of the movie this theme is ageless and allows this movie to be a brilliant masterpiece1010 easily one of if not my favorite,sad
okay so the story is poor guy meets rich engaged girlguess where this is going shes rich her every need is met  her fianc although a brute is handsomeshe feels the need to cheat because evidently fancy partiestraveling  so forth bores her she cheats of course who didnt see that one coming a huge drama is played out blah blah is she retarded dumping a tall handsome rich man for this scrouny little nerd whoses more feminine than she isfast forward to when the ship sinks thats the best part very nice special effects good music score for the most part ship hits ice berg ship sinks  a good time is had by all except for the people that actually died for a half hour or so the movie is very good the rest of it is romantic mush the irish dancing scene is embarrassing didnt they have anything better to do in those days than dance like video games or something amusing fast forward to the last 45 minutes  enjoy the icing on the cake is the scrouny nerd gets it ha,sad
that film appears to be not so much about the but a made up story set on the i find these scenes of rose jack and roses posh family a bit disturbing in places the best thing about this id say is that rose decided at the end to start a new life away from her posh parents and this villain she was engaged to i understand though there are other films that show less of whats happening with individual passengers and more about how the ship hit the iceberg and the damage that occurredi wouldnt say that film is as bad as the more recent film the same two actors starred in revolutionary road i found quite painful and thought it was much worse than,sad
technological progress is like an axe in the hands of a pathological criminal  albert einstein most damn the romantic subplot at the heart of and overlook the larger romance that extends throughout director james camerons filmography this is not just a film about the budding love between two characters on a ship but about mans love affair with technologycameron presents as a modern marvel a beautiful ocean liner with sleek lines sensual curves and chrome plumbing his camera caresses the ship bathing it in sunsets starlight and pinkish hues its not only a stage for romance but the embodiment of romance a kind of fetishized symbol for mans and camerons love for technology his godlike desire to lord over his landscape with machines the name is itself suggestive of an almost divine or olympian creationof course the ship then hits a chunk of ice and promptly sinks camerons camera then surveys the carnage watching with delight as the machine goes down taking a couple hundred passengers with it this is not just a maritime disaster this is judgement day the machines rebelling against their creatorsone character an artist called jack goes down with the ship but not before saving the life of a plump girl called rose mans creative spirit may sink into the void but it is promptly revitalised by the blossoming of rose a previously reticent young woman who regains her spark through contact with jackthis tension takes place throughout camerons filmography his films are all about beautiful machines violently rebelling against their makers this pushpull tension itself infects camerons work methods for he is a director obsessed with machines but who spends his career warning us of the very robots he creates promotes proliferates and relies onwhats strange though is that camerons latest film not only repeats this message but then goes further into a kind of hippie utopianism avatar a zillion dollar action fantasy shot in 3d features a world in which aliens use their brain stems to literally plug into trees animals and nature for cameron technology is not only evil it now prevents us from connecting to nature nature is whats real cameron says populating his film with aliens who hook up to a kind of biological network cameron takes the cables modems routers telephones and computers of the modern world and turns them into their biological equivalents trees roots and bodies linked by organic conduits avatars aliens even store their entire history on a harddrive in the form of a giant tree in other words the internet should be out there all should be dependent on physical connections to nature not virtual connections mediated via machinesbut there is always a danger of naturalising nature the natural world is not some kind of utopia to which we can return in balanced harmony man has always been at war with nature and nature itself is not a balanced system it is a mass of conflicting bodies constantly adapting jostling vying for position always changing this kind of fetishizing of nature the need to turn it into some kind of mystical utopia is the same kind of confused thinking that led to designerbuddhism becoming popular in the 60s indeed avatar only works because cameron romanticises the noble savages in his film portraying them as kind hearted mystical creatures who are one with the land compare this to someone like herzog or terrence malick who constantly crash the romantic ideal of nature with postenlightenment thinkingthen theres the ironic fact that though camerons films have all been cautionary tales about technology he is the biggest technowhore in all of hollywood for a zillion dollar film to be so prochlorophyll reeks of hypocrisy reconnect to nature via cgi jungles its like bill gates telling us to get back in touch with treesbut buy windows vista because thats where the real vistas areso with its computer generated jungles and cgi ships these two films are really showcases for technology they dont ask us to consider our relationship with tech but push us further into hyperreality further into the simulacrum selling us the notion that technology can offer us more nature than nature can high definition tv 3d film wide screen youtube videos surround sound etctechnology is nature without the hassle technology is itself nature part of our extended phenotype it is nature purified by machines this all has the opposite effect of camerons message people retreating further inwards into their utopian homes rather than plugging into the outside and why not to homosapien 21c nature isnt real enough anymore it lacks the definition of the simulacrumimagine a director like cronenberg handling a film like or avatar mybe hed focus on avatars more disturbing unconscious elements that this is a film about a guy who is essentially watching a film that the hero needs to be comatose and asleep in a machine to experience a better life that his virtual experiences are more real than his limited body that the cast themselves require avatars suits that their performances are all virtual that the 3d nature of the picture requires one to wear glasses to view it the distance from subject to fantasy constantly metamorphing and so revisiting all of camerons films its clear that aliens and the terminator represent him at his peak each successive film has been increasingly childish his exponentially inflated megabudgets dictating that his films cast a net across as wide a demographic as possible the superviolent rrated worlds of the terminator and aliens are now too niche market the director succumbing to the machine that is the almighty dollar and the further cameron gets from the bmovie masculinity of his early career the more simple minded and proselytising his films get810  oscilates from jawdroppingly spectacular to cringeworthy,sad
this is the best movie ever the only movie that equals it is back to the future all others fall flat compared to this flat it should at least be somewhere on the top 250 but its not whats wrong with you people the only low part of the movie is the im flying scene i mean that scene was utterly pointless every thing else was great the best scene was the dock scene at south hampton that just shows that james cameron is great at over the top set designs the whole pretty much proves that but that scene emphasizes it another great part of it is the uniqueness of it compared to other cameron films his other movies are just runofthemill action movies okay t2 and aliens were much better then his others but his other movies are cursed by this lets just hope avatar can match up to this masterpiece,sad
i loved this movie it has everything  romance tragedy comedy suspense action adventure acute social commentary  and is extremely well craftedmany movies try to do everything and fail this movie tries to do everything and succeeds beautifully better than that it is greater than the sum of its remarkable parts and it is hard to get better than thatthose who are  with i admit a lot of justification  cynical about big hollywood productions might not ever accept what i am saying but being closedminded is not the same as being clever not every lowbudget art or independent film is great neither is every bigbudget production from hollywood bad not only isnt bad i am confident that it will go down in history as one of the greatest movies ever madelets begin with leonardo dicaprio he is in a class by himself as an extraordinarily good looking young man who is not just a pretty boy but who can really act he was riveting in the basketball diaries he is no less outstanding in i have never seen an actor showing such range  from drug addicted athlete to romantic lead  in such a short period of time clearly the only thing that can hold dicaprio back is a bad script this leads me to my next key point is very well written there is not a single false note in the writing and the plotting is very tight with no holes that i can see it all fits neatly and plausibly together  which is rare both in novels and in moviesi could go on praising the other actors the direction the special effects etc but i think ive made my overall point this is not just some overblown pseudoromance featuring depthless and soulless beautiful people it makes me proud that americans can still create great art  even in hollywood,sad
caspita not even know how to attack this masterpiece of film a paltry 71 to a masterpiece of its kind is a real offense to cinema this film deserves a full 10 for you more a film is dated the most affected which is why i do not take into account the music and film reviews that are available on the web now it also attacks the romantic film who has never had a woman it is clear that attacks this film it definitely one of the most beautiful films ever shot a dream from start to finish i see leonardo di caprio a great actor very expressive and convincing this film has moved many people and distance of many years if the rived still leaves me upset and sad it definitely a masterpiece of cinema theres nothing to do the reconstruction of the is perfect the characters are in full captains and real characters that were real usually sentimental films have a great success ghost topgun gone with the wind are all films with great success useless this wonderful film will remain so forever,sad
having been just five when was first released i never got to see it in the cinema i wish i had because i know the magic tension and pure brilliance that oozes from this movie would only be strengthened in the cinema having seen the movie so many times i know the plot very very well despite this i watch it every time it is on simply because i know the experience i will get from it is brillianttension grips this movie as the movie grips and pulls you in relentlessly holding on until the heart wrenching climax even then it stays with you i never got bored during the movie never once though when will this be over the experience is a fountain of enjoyment the actors set this off and they work well with the special effects which add a true sense of realism as though the audience is on the boat with them you sit frozen and are put in the position of kate winslet shaking furiously at the locked gate wading through the water feeling the cold creep up as you search for jack played amazingly by leonardo dicaprio the sense of urgency and knuckle whitening tension is relentless and this is what makes this movie so deserved of its awards and its place in my memoryi know i am not alone when i say that this is an all time classic such action can never be created again despite its inevitable ending you hope and pray for some sort of let up allowing these characters to surviveone of my favourite movies ever this movie simply never tires,sad
i love this moviebecause every time i see this movie i enjoyed it another reasoni love this directori think hes the best director in the worldi have all of his filmsand i waiting for his new filmavator the music of this movie is great byjames horneri listen to this music everyday performance byceline dion the actors act very beauty everything in this is great so they made the biggest movie ive seen the first time who i saw this film i criedthis movie is very romantic i lie romantic movie likedrzhivagoautumn in new yorkthe english patienti love the scene who jackleo de caprio sayim the king of the worldi dont have any saysthis movie won 11 oscar including best picture and this is a good reason for my commenti think this way,sad
is my best film of all timethe story is very very good effect is very very good tooi love kate and leo they act very well and the story made me and my family included my friends cried i proudly present this movie too anyone who havent seen before  so why someone hateyou see  80 percent of imdb users love this film  but why a little group of someone hate this filmi think is very good  how could it disappointed  how  i dont metion it but i really love  i cant explain anymorei give 1010 love but hate my heart will go on song ,sad
i dont think i have ever come across someone that hasnt seen this movie whether you loved it or hated it you at least saw it the amount of money this movie made speaks for just how good it was people say this movie is overrated but i dont think so i think this movie is the perfect example of everything a movie should have romance drama history tragedy and amazing effectsthe directing was great i really began to feel like i was a part of this movie the acting was great i really bought kates performance in being a poor little rich girl and leonardos performance in being the poor free spirit everyone did a good job i love movies about things that have happened in the past and out of all the movies ive seen i believe this movie was the most accurate account of what occurred on the except with the whole love thingthe plot line is great it was a great idea to put the romance in because that drew in women the history drew in older people and the effects drew in the guys to me i think everything was great this movie had so much feeling and if you didnt cry at least a little at the end you must have no heart and if you havent seen this movie you are defiantly missing out,sad
my take an indisputably sweeping epic a future classic it should bethis is an extension of the review i wrote in february 2007every so often a magnificent epic would just take you away from all that and just sweep you by your feet james camerons unbeatable 200 million is exactly that film so it just upsets me why some people still dont get iti was just wondering it compelled me more than any other film ive seen for quite awhile not to mention it won 11 awards in the oscars and scored high in the boxoffice but why some people try to act cynical and bash this wonderful motion picture this film is rated 710 here on imdb come on is really that rare kind of masterpiece we dont usually find in todays film era it wasnt just a bigbudgeted film it was a truly dramatic and touching tale with an oldfashioned romance that movies like casablanca revolutionized if movies like that are classics in a way wanted to revisit then may i ask whats wrong the cast headed by leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet are superb the direction and writing job by james cameron is terrific so is he just getting a hang of the love story thing i think not but one of the real highlights is the superb score by james horner and the magnificent theme song it has become one of my favorite alltime songs the film too has become one of my alltime favorites not only that the film is also accurate on some of the facts james cameron really made sure to make it as realistic as possible like the sinking of the cameron really made that realistic about the ship splitting in half before sinking anyway combining such elements make it such a winner that wont insult youim sure the movie is not without its imperfections but when a movies too good to be true such elements dont come to you it never did throughout the immense but utterly sweeping 194 minutes its entertainment at its bestrating  out of 5,sad
i love that movie i own the 3disc special collectors edition and the original 1 disc it is the best movie ever i also have become interested in and do research on the ship and anything i can find about i buy i would like it if they made a sequel of the movie or make another one in the year 2008 or 2012 so it will be exactly 100yrs since sank i would really like it if they used more exact details or try to find all the information and go from that or just rebuild all over again that would be very awesome to be able to see her again and try riding on her this is why i like this movie and what else could be done in the future,sad
if you dont like this movie so what because it will always be the mosttouching and popular movie of all time seven stars seven stars this movie was absolutely fantastic that it deserves so much more im extremely and always will be surprised with how it has seven out of ten c how people 10 of people gave this one star saying it is awful but this movie is still tied with the most oscars academy awards etc if you didnt like this movie and didnt give it 9 or 10 stars you should seriously take the time to ask the lord for a brain if you disliked it you probably only saw one part it is impossible to forget and some of its viewers like me will always be touched by it it was absolutely fascinating as a love story that even took the time to be a tribute to the fateful 1912 sinking ship,sad
is the best movie ever made the whole fact that its not madeup and this really happened years ago brings a exciting feeling of mystery kate winslet and leonardo dicaprios chemistry brings this w hole movie together the film would have never been the same without them i was totally blown away by this movie the first time i was it the scenes were spectacular and awesome especially when the ship is sinking and the big scenes come into gear and the ship eventually snaps in half what makes this movie even better there also involves a great deal of love with jack and rose near the end when rose had to let jack go because he was dead i was in tears this film is filled with such great emotion and class remains for me the greatest film ever made in the world,sad
of the top 10 grossing films of all time is 1 and mel gibsons passion is 10 the remaining 8 are either scifi action hero or fantasy flicks i find it ironic that the the only nonmake believe movies on this list are about two of the greatest historical tragedies to befall mankind the real triumph in camerons rendering of the sinking is that he put a human face on itas did gibson re the crucifixon this is a timeless movie that i can watch again and again my only complaint was the casting of dicapriosomebody like matt damon would have made a much better jack dawson the rest of the casting was impeccable especially capt smith mr andrews and ismay molly hockley and his manservant roses mother etc not to mention ms winslet who in my opinion is in the same category as meryl streep in terms of range and fearlessness as an actor not to mention her luminous beauty,sad
i thought that this was one of his best because he plays it very well he plays a really good poor man in the movie and even know i have seen the movie like a billion times that one seen at the end were you see jack and he falls into the water and its like what was the point of falling in love because you are never going to be together even though they didnt know what was going to happen but why did rose pick jack  that is a question that i have asked a lot of people and nobody can tell me what i am looking for so could someone tell me  but i think that this is leos best movie ever and i love the movie but the vote thing one of ten which is excellent well this movie does not come anywhere close to excellent it deserves the best movie of the year award,sad
is the best movie in the whole world i love it so much because i love the real so much i have watch it about 30 times it is the best love story ever and it shows all the thinks about the in it as well so that is great leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet are awesome in this movie i think it is there best movie everall the other actors rock in the as well if you want to watch a movie that is romantic thrilling and sad that will make you cry this is the best one and the is my favorite movie ever by farit is just so breath taking to watch it sink and everything else that happens i love the so much,sad
since i watched this film on a tv i fall in love with this stories the true love rose and jack gave a spirit of life this couple is like a twin that cannot be separated their love is like an ocean so wide great like a wave everlasting although one of them has gotten died but it will never make the love die the romance is like a fairy tales but trueso great and wonderful this film is excellent united from sound choreography and artistic lay out my comment is  wonderful wonderful and wonderful i saw for more than four times first i saw in a movie this film is likely able to snatch my attention im as life in this decade and be one of person who is in the shipi imagine that i was rose and i feel what rose feel this story was also has made any inspiration for me to write any romance stories im a writer and love romance stories so much,sad
excellent movie and this is coming from someone who intentionally dismissed the movie as overhype and avoided it for years ill certainly eat crow on this one everything was well done and the actors were sincere and believable the special effects rocked loved the rising sense of urgencyone negative comment though friend once taught me that there is a sliding scale in her universe at the top is bacon because its so good at the bottom is bill pullman because hes so awful how on earth bill paxton gets any work is beyond me but cheerio his role was minor enough not to ruin the movie,sad
first of all how could you people give this movie such a low score i have seen a lot of sad movies and this is the first to almost make me cry im shocked that you gave this masterpiece a 710 and think just because this is a chick flick about a forbidden romance on a big ship that sinks is that its going to bomb i think that some people who havent even seen this movie have voted for it and i strongly suggest you dont do that to be accepted by others the acting in this movie was excellent kate winslet and leos chemistry was obviously visible the writing for this film was extraordinary the effects for the sinking of this ship was just incredible and this movie let you bond with everyone even people you didnt know when the ship sinks and everyone dies you feel sorry for them my opinion watch this movie it is very enjoyable and i liked it,sad
how people can criticise this masterpiece is beyond me it won 11 academy awards and has been described as the greatest film ever how can people say that something like this is rubbish this is my favourite film for me when i watch this i feel like im going on a journey on the ship seeing what our two main characters are going through how people dont cry at the end of this when their journey ends in tragedy is beyond me the atmosphere the acting is so emotional come back jack come back those famous lines mixed with tears and violins starting to play for me is the saddest moment ive ever witnessed on a television screen other emotional moments such as children being read a bedtime story an old couple hugging together as the water fills up around them a woman clutching her child trying to survive play on the heart strings of the viewer what kind of heartless person can show no emotion to this one of the most famous moments in film is the im flying scene this has been done again and again and we know it from this film is one of the most successful films of all time so i really dont know how people can criticise one bit of it the acting directing writing  music is perfect this film is absolutely amazing,sad
i absolutely love this film to bits i think it is the most real and touching movie of all time no wonder it won 11 academy awards great story line and great choose of actors for this movie i could watch this film over and over again because i know i would never ever be bored of this film and if some of you who think this film is boring then youre mad and need to actually watch the film properly  if you watch the film properly then you will see how touching and emotional but real this film can be as it was based on a true storyso if any of you out there who dont find this film fascinating then i would consider you as disrespectful to all those people who lost their lives that morning on the real rms,sad
i never thought i would ever see such a masterpiece that is if james cameron never makes another film he can always be proud of this movie some people say its just about a boat sinking how naive they are leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet are amazing as jack dawson and rose dewitt bukator i saw this movie three times at the theaters and would go again today if it were rereleased i still get goosebumps watching the flying scene and the heaven scene no other movie can compete with this one how dare the oscars not nominate leo for his performance kate winslet was robbed in my opinion for best actress helen hunt as good as it gets over kate please gloria stuart the invisible man billy zane dead calm frances fisher unforgiven kathy bates misery bill paxton twister victor garber tvs alias and eric braedon tvs the young and the restless costar this is a mustsee masterpiece,sad
i think is a great movie it has a mixture of adventure suspense and best of all romance i still cannot believe that it isnt on this websites top 250 movies of all time i was really surprised it is definitely my favourite movie and nothing will ever change that  please if you read this go and vote for maybe soon it will be on the list for the top 250 movies yay i love so much and i would watch it over and over again if i could it is a great family movie and its good if you have been having relationship problems or if you just love watching love stories i think it is probably the best love story ever madeand its about a true story so it makes it even more interesting i love this movie,sad
for me time is valuable and to take time to watch a movie is a big thing yet with i would watch it everyday if i could and i would not get tired of it people protest at its twoday love story and say that captain smith was a man who realizing his mistake of ignoring the iceberg warningpersonally took on the responsibility of checking the damages himself that is true and though i love the movie i do wish that they had shown thatleonardo dicaprio the aviator whatever happened to gilbert grapedeserved a oscar nomination for his endearing portrayal of the liveforthemoment young man named jack dawsonkate winslet eternal sunshine of the spotless mindfinding neverlandwas the up and coming actress who was chosen for the part of rose dewitt bukater her brilliant performance earned a best actress nomination though it deserved the actual oscarthe second part of the moviespoiler warning in of which rms sinksis touching well done mainly accurate and very sad not only do you cry when the now beloved jack dies but also when rosegloria stuart 84 years later dies after telling her story for the first time victor garberfrances fisherkathy bates and billy zane add notable performances in this epic love story and tragedy,sad
someone recently posted that some people seem to hate popular movies simply because theyre popular rather than looking at what makes them popular they begin to look at ways to bring down the movie in areas that to most moviewatchers do not matterwhen i watch a movie i generally watch it to be entertained i understand creative license so i thus do not generally care if the historical details are all correct in a movie built around a historical moment such as is i dont think about whether or not the dialogue is wooden or if the plot is thick enough if i am entertained i give the movie a thumbsupi was entertained immensely by had all the ingredients of a great film action adventure suspense comedy romance intriguemost people love a love story and this was one it was not really about the ship at all but about the love of jack and rose as a love story it was wonderfuli cried several times and left the theater thinking id seen a great movie my feelings were justified by the 11 oscars and all the money it made its popularityimdb should get on boardand who the hell gave it a 1 watch the movie before you spread hate please if you want a documentary youll be disappointed if you want to be entertained youll very likely not be disappointedthis movie is rated 7 by nearly everyone but there are a few apparently disgruntled viewers who either did not get the point of the movie more about the forbidden romance between jack and rose  and the tension it creates among jack rose cal roses mom  than it is about the actual sinking or are hating just to go against the status quo,sad
most disaster movies have a love story that plods along amidst the action but isnt one of them the love story between rose and jack is very deep and involving and is simply great to watch at times it even distracts from the story of yes its that compellingthe good news for people who dont want the love story is this the sinking of the is one of the best movies sequences in history it truly does involve you in the horror of the disaster and makes you realise how awful it must have been to have lived through it or worse to have failed to live through itmany scenes in the film are deeply touching but one that is imprinted on my mind is where a mother is reading a bedtime story to her children in 3rd class while the is sinking the only way she can help them is to let them die peacefully in their sleepthe other wonderful thing about this movie is the real life shots of at the bottom of the ocean the cinematographic is superb and it helps make it all more realworthy of its awards 910,sad
two reasons to like this film1 the special effects are pleasing on the eye2 the arrogance and selfishness of the rich bloke and his servant come across strongly these are the two best characters in the filmtwo reasons to pour scorn on this film1 the two main characters are so boring that i didnt care whether they lived or died i had the same feeling watching an affair to remember i dont know whether it was poor acting or poor characterisation but if you are going to base an entire film on the relationship between two people at least give them a little charisma and personality2 pretty much every character conforms to an exaggerated stereotype from the rich arrogant english to the poor carefree happygolucky americans and the downtoearth funloving irish they always know how to have a good time dont they the stereotyping of every character was painful right down to the brash straighttalking american woman who sides with di caprio and is considered crass by the stuffy brits it is awful and unimaginative characterisation and story tellingall in all is watchable but wouldnt get in my top 200 films,sad
for the people on here who commented that was the worst movie theyve ever seen apparently they havent seen showgirls or anything with anna nicole smith give me a break guys james cameron did a phenomenal job with this movie it truly brought the disaster back to life mr cameron did hundreds of hours if not thousands of research on the including getting the poignant footage under water of the ship a lot of facts and history with the disaster was incorporated into this movie giving us all the more reason to love it though it was over 3 hours long i was not bored for one minute and thats very unusual for me to be able to sit through a movie this long i was captivated by the love story and suspense mr cameron created the theme song  my heart will go on was perfect for the movie but it was terribly over played on the radio stations during this time the ending was magnificent and i think everyone in the theatre cried knowing that almost 2000 people perished in the end yes there were a couple of corny lines in the movie but no movie is perfect i think the special effects used while the ship was sinking and the passengers were loading up in the boats was extremely realistic and just moving the replica ship used was also incredible i think both kate winslet and leonardo decaprio were fantastic in the lead though i think ms winslet was a little miscast since she looks a lot older than leo i have seen this movie several times and still watch it when its on television i do not think any other movie is superior to this one  12 stars out of 5,sad
this film has three things to recommend it1 the sinking ship2 nothing else3 wonderful acting  no not really but theres a minimum line count for reviews so i had to write something,sad
previously i wrote that i loved cried at its ending many times over and im a guy in his 60s  i also wondered about why this great movie which won so many awards and was applauded by so many critics was given only a 70 rating by imdbcom userswell i looked at the breakdown of the user ratings  while 290 of all votes gave it a 10 rating 107 gave it a 1 rating  these 107 of these irrational imdb users in effect pulled the overall rating down to 70  in my previous comments i blamed this very unusual voting pattern a sudden surge in 1 ratings with a high 10 rating dropping only gradually and then suddenly reversing course and jumping at the 1 rating level on only one thing hatred for leonardo dicaprio  believe me ive tuned into enough chat rooms to see the banter by young people young men mostly who defame him left and right  they absolutely hate the man and they will have no part in giving him any credit in  to answer one other user  i am not talking about someone who just really doesnt like the movie that much and gave it a 5 or a 6 etc  everyone has and is entitled to hisher own taste  but no one can convince me that the imdb rating of only 70 overall for pulled to that level by an inordinate number of ridiculous 1 ratings is a fair reflection of the overall motion picturelet me demonstrate my point by comparing the imdb user voting pattern of to 5 randomly chosen box office and critical bombs there are many more but these 5 will prove my point  heavens gate 1980 was pulled from the theaters quickly after a very poor box office showing and imdb voters ratings were 232 10 ratings and 92 1 ratings overall rating of 61  big top peewee 1988 got 43 10 ratings and 99 1 ratings overall rating of 45  cat people 1982 got 61 10 ratings and 26 1 ratings overall rating of 58   blind date 1987 got 30 10 ratings and 28 1 ratings overall rating of 53  jumpin jack flash 1986 got 44 10 ratings and 37 1 ratings overall rating of 52  what do all of these films have in common with  all of the percentages of their 1 ratings are lower  than and none of these stinkers ever was nominated for a single award  again got 107 1 ratings  compare that to the other 5 movies i just mentionedcan there be any explanation other than the hatred of leo factor,sad
is a fantastic movie to watch although it only got 2 stars when it was on normal tv for the uk i give this movie 10 out of 10 on april 15th 1912 at 220am was sunk the movie was made in 1997 i think when in 2012 when its the 100th anniversary i think they should put back in the cinemas to mark the 100th anniversary of the that sunk,sad
titanicugh  the hypocrites that infest our world  people that shelled out money to see multiple times in the theaters now say they hate it to death thats just sad  sad and pathetic  it just annoys me to death when people say oh what a waste of oscars  whatever  you know you rooted for  its just that now it is uncool to like  so people deny they like it and go with what everyone else says  so typical i love  the first time i saw it i was taken away  after is was over all my friends who now claim it stunk praised it  what a shamethe performances were okay  i thought leonardo was wonderful in all his other films  same with kate winslet  leonardo is another thing that is now uncool to like  well i like leo  hes a good actor and hes due for a comeback scorsese and spielberg the names speak for themselves so unlike everyone else who posts on here claiming they have always hated and deep down they all know they love it i will admit that i love it  810,sad
at first glance is an epic film the scenery and cinematogrpahy are spectacular and it is just a beautifully photographed movie however when you look past the superficial beauty of the film much like armageddon its numerous shortcomings become clear first of all suffered badly from the transition from the big screen to video this took away a lot of the hugeness of the film and this inadvertently places more attention on the story and the acting both of which were the biggest problems with the film i went to see this movie to see the sinking of the not to see some elaborately fabricated love story is a landmark film as a result of the sinking of the ship and the fact that it inexplicably turned out to be such a huge moneymaker there is absolutely nothing great about the acting the story is nothing that hasnt been seen dozens of times before and the directing is awkward probably due to the fact that james cameron who is an excellent director is so used to directing the frankensteinlike schwarzenegger as the terminator this is not to say that the directing was bad it wasnt at all but there is nothing special to be said about the directing because james cameron is not really a director of this type of filmkate winslet was beautiful in she delivered a wonderful performance in the film and was very convincing as was kathy bates as always and even billy zane i normally dont like him but he was playing a dislikeable character which is probably why i enjoyed his performance so much leonardo dicaprio however delivered the worst performance of his career if you want to see him really act watch the basketball diaries or even better the beach is a beautifully made film it suffered in the story and the acting departments but it is an entertaining and easy to watch movie it was not however the best picture of 1997 not even close there were probably 20 movies that were released in 1997 that were better than but the oscars wouldnt have gained as much public support had they not given the oscar to it was a quality film but dont be fooled by all of the hype,sad
after reading the other comments i was glad there is such a common consent and unanimity on the fact that the part about the ship was good while the plot particularly the love story was naive and boring   even the dialogue is interesting and relatively witty in the parts about the ship and the characters other than jack and rose while all conversation between the two lovers is boring and naive  i am surprised there wasnt much effort in creating a more mature and deeper love story especially with the effort put in the movie as a whole  james cameron  did a very good job directing the ship and her sinking characters like moly brown were amusing but there was nothing special about the main characters  i wonder what was behind the choice of leonardo dicaprio for that role given his young look one expected a more mature looking man i would advise people to watch it and appreciate the technical effects but with low expectations of the plot,sad
the special effects were excellentand that is where the praises for this overrated donetoomanytimes dump of a film end  how many times is hollywood going to make us watch that ship sink weve seen it enough all four movies that competed with for best picture at the oscars were superior espescially as good as it gets and the full monty  only the cries of prepubecent girls for the small amount of man that is leonardo dicaprio shot this movie to the number one money making spot of all time i get so sick of hearing about how it is the greatest movie ever as it boasts an unoriginal plot weak charactor development and a title track that could drive one to suicide  for those of you who think its the greatest ever i have a few alternates and more reasonable choicescasablanca the godfather braveheart apocalypse now schindlers list the shawshank redemption star wars gone with the wind saving private ryan etc  i could make a list from california to new york of films that are more original and superior in everyway to the overrated and james cameron was the first to give an oscar speech that made me vomitim the king of the world,sad
over a billion dollars in box office 11 oscars countless words or praise  and so many people want to rip this movie up well i would be happy never to meet you if you dislike this movie that much cause theres something wrong with you  if you cannot appreciate the beauty and craftmanship that went into this not only are you nuts but you are pretty ungrateful too  this movie stands above all the rest,sad
what a lousy moviezero content a whole load of glitz and glamour sickening performances sappy romance big budget spending i was going to say glorified snowballs but this sounds bettermust go down as one of the most boring movies of alltime cant believe so many people fell for it i guess it appealed to all the 14 year olds out there cant believe james cameron did thissolid proof that the academy doesnt know what its doing  the only oscar this movie deserves is for the best waste of money categoryand oh yess if i hear that stinking song one more time  im gonna garb that axe  im sure the judge will find that reasonable assuming he doesnt have the id or eq of a 14yoa generous 2,sad
has a large number of fans that will cheerfully proclaim that it is the best movie ever made and a large number of detractors who will cheerfully proclaim that is nothing but overrated garbage i just feel it is a great film definitely deserved the best picture oscar in 1997 and to describe as overrated garbage and the worst movie ever made says something about that person that they are ignorant about films or just ignorant and only hate it because its the highest grossing movie of all time i admit that when it was becoming that i hated it before even seeing it because i didnt want it to be now i have seen it three times not once in theaters since it was released and it still manages to keep me glued to the screen for all three hoursjames camerons recreation of the 1912 sinking of the unsinkable liner is one of the most magnificent pieces of serious popular entertainment ever to emanate from hollywood the gargantuan production costestimated at about 200 millionhas been spent on sumptuous stunningly believable sets and visual effects giving the viewer the feeling of being a passenger on the illfated voyage but the threehoursplus ultimately succeeds so powerfully in retelling this familiar story because it is an intimate epic with a moving and resonant love story at its core the performances by all the cast are outstanding even the hundreds possibly thousands of extras once again kate winslet proves that she is one of the most talented actress of her generation her small steps from repressed snobbish rich girl to passionate joyful and full of life are very subtle yet we always know that she is changing  we can feel what she feels any actor or actress who can do that is very special indeed she also manages to pull off a mostly convincing american accent leonardo dicaprio is very good as well as jack the steerage passengerartist who wins tickets for at a poker game his character is always alive and is the catalyst for roses transformation the chemistry between the two of them is great their scenes together are special to watch this all coming from someone who really cant stand leonardo dicapriothe film does a remarkable job of contrasting the stiff haughtiness of the upper class with the joyful energy of the steerage class one scene in particular stands out as cameron cuts between 1stclass men talking politics in the dining room and 3rdclass passengers having the time of their lives below decks dancing up a storm the films technical aspects are amazing the sets and costumes look so much like the real thing that the viewer gets a sense of dejavu at least those who study the the special effects are totally believable the effects are so good that people might think they are seeing reality and not effects theyre that goodthe music by james horner is perfect in all the right places the script by cameron is very good haunting and quite witty there are dozens of details written into the script either about the characters or about the ship all of them point to something down the line camerons script is filled with the most subtle foreshadowing the only thing that i caught which struck a false note was the fact that jack always seemed to be on the 1stclass deck when in fact steerage was not allowed to mingle with the 1stclass however that is a minor complaint for the rest of the film is very accurate even though the film is three hours long it seems much shorter i didnt look at the clock even once during all three viewings the last hour is a dazzler both visually and emotionally i felt myself clinging to the seat hoping the ship would miss that iceberg and choking up about once or twice during the film and finally what surprises me about the user ratings is that compared to any other film in the imdb top 250 this film compares in the number of twos through tens it just has so many unfair ones almost as many as the number of nines that it is kept from being in the imdb top 250 and really makes you wonderrating 1010,sad
i kept putting off seeing this movie with my wife because i labeled it a chick moviei was so very wrong has well written characters and a story even though we knew the ending keeps you on the edge of your seat through the entire three hours there really was a rose on the the critics of this movie only have to look at the fact that is made almost 2 billion dollars world wide when no movie have ever made more than 900 millionthis amount of cannot be just from teenage girls is as close to a perfect movie as has ever been made i give it a 10 and put it in my top 20 with the likes of the godfather and jaws,sad
story tells about everlasting love so its just another american soapopera movie with incredibly cliches nothing really amazing at that side 1 point but the special effects and virtual restoring wow that i would like to call movie if something,sad
this movie makes us all realize that things arent what they may seemthe wasnt suppose to sink but it didand it changed historyit also shows us that your choices affect other people maybe not this drastically but they do affect peoplethe captain said full speed ahead when he knew there were ice burgs and jack fighting for rosethis movie can show us that if u love somebody to keep fighting for them and dont let someone else take them away there may be many obstacles but u can get around them jack told us to take life a deal at a timeand we all should take what life throws at youthis movie changes lives in more then one way love living and choices,sad
ok the last hour was great technically speakingthe people running up and down the ship the lifeboats the ship cracking up and when one of the huge smokestacks falls onto the passengers in the water the visual and sound effects were incrediblethat is the best scene in the film and one of the best scenes in movie historybut the miscasting of leonardo was a huge mistakeleonardo looks like a schoolboy and a funnylooking one at that with his beady little eyesthere is nothing remotely manly or heroic about this little twerp everyone else in the film was fine especially all the british actorsuntil the iceberg actually hits you will be bored out of your mind despite the impressive recreation of the boats interior and clothes of the castplease watch a night to remember1958 instead,sad
waited as long as possible before watching this thing to let the public fanfare fade away then one night fell exhausted on ye olde couch with naught else to view  phewit was far worse even than expected where to start acting where corny hey iowa aint got this much in a year shallow a nickel couldnt have sunk in this thing one word summation embarrassing ironic that heavens gate was same kind of film but beautifully made  was an alltime disaster whereas this pig was a big hit ah well god bless the new economy  remember pt barnum,sad
one of only 2 movies ive ever walked out of have attempted to watch on 3 separate occassions and can only find 3 redeeming qualities 1  kathy bates portrayal of molly brown 2  incredible soundtrack and 3  quite good cinematography in every other respect this film is an absolute dog,sad
ive given the movie a few chances as a movie i should watch as a lot of people keep telling me that its a good movie but no matter how many times i always manage to leave the couch and find something else to do or fall asleep or this one time i forced myself to keep watching i had this inexplicable feeling of nausea as i watched it has failed to keep my eyes glued to the screen as a movie lovergood acting imho i like the attention on scenic details nice effects its got a lot of aspects thats supposed to make a movie successful and i suppose these aspects had served their purpose but the story and characterization are just corny and i get the feeling its already been done for years and years to be honest its like a romantic corny sexual fantasy of a curious teenage virgin from some decade ago with a grandeur setting not that i have anything against that turned into a movie but why bother the theme wasnt to me the theme was jack n roses tragic love on whatsitbigcruiseshipthatsankboring i can fantasize something better but at least somebody managed to make a movie out of it and made money while ive never made any movie so what do i know huh well at least all i know is that this movie just didnt impress me and to top it off what the heck is celine dion doing singing that corny sappy hopeless romantic emphasize on hopeless theme songthey really tried hard to be i suppose that in my eyes they end up the same as crack bye bye,sad
this film is a masterpiece every aspect of its production weaves together in a beautiful tale of tragedy peril and romance the tremendous amount of effort that james cameron and the entire cast put into this production is the essential reason that should never be forgotten and should always be considered one of the greatest movies of all time this movie is a true work of art  and the acting the production value directing visualsand music score all contribute i doubt very much that there will ever be a film that portrays the fate of with such elegance as this one although this film runs well over three hours there is not one wasted scene this deserved every oscar it received and i consider its rating of a 7710 to be a borderline travesty it should easily be in the top 250 if not an 8510 or greater i love this movie,sad
won a bazillion oscars and is considered a classic by many and it now counting this one has 2400 reviews so what more can i say about this film that hasnt already been said well very littlethat is why this review is rather shorti give the film a 9 because it isnt perfect some of the characters to me seemed a bit simplistic but no matter if you like them or not theres no denying the awesomeness of the film after all it looks like you are on a huge cruise ship and the special effects of the wreck this isnt exactly a spoiler are amazing so like the story or not the film is staggering to watchparticularly on a big screen and now that i think about this this is exactly how i viewed director camerons other huge success avatar well worth seeing once,sad
14 years ago i took my then 12 yearold daughter to see a three hour plus film expecting her to get fidgety she did not neither did i and now having seen the movie a number of additional times on a smaller screen i revisit it on a big screen after a 3d revampmy first viewing of this movie carried preconceptions with it i was expecting it to retell the disaster and i was expecting spectacular eye candy i got both and i appreciated that cameron had chosen a fictitious love story as a vehicle for audience identification to bring home the tragedy on a personal levelon rewatching it 14 years later i realise that what im watching is a romance played out against the background of the disaster i also realise a number of other things for instance the groundbreaking computerised extras are no longer as convincing as they were james horners music is great camerons direction is excellent and his writing despite the occasional clunky bit of dialogue is very skillful oh and while the performances of the principals are very good there is some very dodgy work from some of the bit part playersoverall the verdict is that this film deserved its oscars and the 3d conversion has been very successfully carried out and confirms that cameron is one of a very small number of directors who truly understands 3d,sad
now how does one rate a classic like i was 11 years old when the movie first released and i still remember the first time i went to watch it i barely had any knowledge about movies back then but the sheer grandeur and brilliance of this movie made me watch it a billion times over and over twice in the last five days in 3dafter working on action classics like the terminator rambo aliens and true lies james cameron comes up with one of the best romantic epic movies of all times the way he adds fiction to the true story is absolutely brilliant the script is too long dialogues a little cheesy screenplay a tad slow but the whole package together is so beautiful that you end up falling in love with the movie bottom line im no one to talk about this mantwentytwo year old kate winslet looks gorgeous as rose dewitt bukate and plays her role to perfection her performance in the climax is so bloody haunting that i have goosebumps even now thinking about it leonardo dicaprios portrayal as jack dawson is one of his best works to date the chemistry between them is probably the finest you will ever see onscreen the rest of the cast billy zane bill paxton kathy bates victor garber and every other actor is excellent its a shame that it didnt win any oscars for actingcinematography by russell carpenter is absolutely splendid the way he captured the romantic moments between rose and jack in the first half and the disastrous sinking in the later half is terrific it is one of the best work on cinematography ive seen to date editing by james cameron conrad buff iv and richard a harris is perfect music by james horner is absolutely brilliant be it the foot tapping irish music for the real party underdecks the musicians playing till the lastminute before the sink or the ever loved my heart will go on master piecesjames cameron spent over a year with 300 people to digitally remaster the 1997 version into 3d and the effort pays off for it was fantastic to watch this masterpiece on big screen again the 3d effect wasnt so great but seriously who cares its 3d or not go relive this magnum opus all over againfor more reviews please visit sasikanthme ,sad
i saw on the big screen 15 years ago and fell in love with it since then i have seen it a few times on tv as well as watched it in vhs or dvd and have continued to enjoy it very much the 3d effects were okay didnt matter to me it was great to watch this beautiful film again on the big screen it still moves me to tears everything about the movie including the breathtaking scenes the touching love story the gorgeous musical score the amazing effects that are still impressive 15 years later one of my favourite movies of all time no doubt dont go to this movie looking for flaws go see this movie with an open heart and let it sweep you away james cameron is a movie making genius,sad
i am i think one of the few people in the world who has never seen this film in the full before todaymy sister and i went to go and see the film in 3d today i have to admit i was looking forward as well as a bit nervous about this film there has been so much hype the most expensive film ever at the time the 11 oscars the song etc i just hoped to god that i wouldnt be disappointedto those of you who havent seen it you must go and see it from start to finish the film is amazing at the beginning when you see the now famous footage of the in its watery grave to the very end when rose dies  ever single moment of the film is timeless classic and truly amazingim sure the film looked absolutely amazing when it first came out but james camerons painstaking remastering into hd and then the 3d added just make everything look amazing from the start where you see the in all its spender as the hopeful passengers wave their loved ones goodbye to the splendid 1st class suites and til the very bitter end where you see the crash under the waves to her watery depths every single scene and every single image was so crystal clear it felt like you were there even after 15 years the directing of james cameron is just superb yes some scenes are amazingly cheesy but you soon forget these moments and replace them with the true emotion of the final half hour the old couple who hug each other tightly as the water slowly rises toward them the mother tucking their children into bed and giving them their last bedtime story and of the course the moment rose lets jack go whispering ill never let you gothroughout the whole first half of the film you are swept up with the happiness and pure delight on rose and jacks faces you watch them from good friends to falling in love a warm feeling surges through your body however you always have that small tiny niggle in your head knowing that it wont last the moment we see jack eyes closed and at peace slips down into the darkness of the ocean is constantly in your headthis story isnt just about love found and love lost its about relationships throughout the film you see different relationships fianc best friends motherdaughter fatherson parentchildren rich toffservant each one unique in its own way each one is precious to the two people involved this film tugs at the heart strings because of the transformation of the happy times all the way to the saddest and most terrible times imaginable combine that with james camerons amazing directing and the timeless score that creates goosebumps and sticks in the mind for hours after and you have a truly remarkable film,sad
is without doubt one of the greatest masterpieces ever made to date it is a timeless story of love drama and excitement all tied together with one of the biggest historical events everbasically put it tells the story of rose dewitt bukater a 17year old girl who feels trapped and isolated in a world of wealth snobbery and a forced engagement to a man she doesnt love while travelling on the rms she meets jack dawson a freespirited thirdclass passenger over the short time they are together rose and jack develop a strong bond and jack helps rose to escape her troubles and to to stand on her own two feet when the ship hits an iceberg rose and jack must rely on each other in the race to survive the sinking of thetoday i saw in 3d and i can honestly say it blew my mind how well the effects appeared in the new third dimension i felt like i was on the ship fleeing the tide of water through the passageways seeing the ship rise out of the water and dancing in thirdclass with jack and rose will always be in my favorite films list and i hope it continues to be in the heart of moviegoers for all time to comemy rating 1010,sad
i just recently watched this movie in 3d on the big screen and i have no words to describe this film other than amazing and best movie ever made this movie was utterly incredible and i loved it so much everything about this movie was worthwhile seeing and honestly the 3h 14min movie didnt even feel that long because it was so enjoyable it could have went on and on and i wouldnt even have felt the time difference overall this was an amazing movie leornado dicaprio and kate winslet are both incredible stars and their performance in this movie was beyond any other performances by any other actors without such wonderful actors this movie would not have been what it turned out to bethe movie carries such inspiring meaning and i will never forget jacks last lines in this film i believe that everyone should forever hold true to those words overall this movie is truly a passionate piece of art work a huge congratulations to james cameron and to all the people who worked towards producing such a gorgeous film truly worth anyones time and money to watch 10 out of 10 best movie ever,sad
in 1996 i saw for the first time i immediately knew this movie would make history i heard and read all the criticism especially by men but lets be honest this movie is the best lovedramaaction movie of our era it shows a lovestory in the middle of a historic disaster i think we all search for such a love but seldom find it di caprio does a great job so does everybody else but the heart of the movie is kate winslet she should have won an oscar for this role now in 2012 i saw 3d amazing this film wasnt recorded in 3d but you cant tell and the film still has that magic if i ever get to be 90 i will still be watching it once every year and it will still have its magic well done james cameron,sad
what a sad movie there is a guy who hooks up with this chick then he dies awe forget all the families who have loved each other for years parents who watched there children die no the saddest thing is that these too wont get to be together if the ship hadnt sank she would have dumped him the second they docked or vice versa sickening that this is the 1 box office draw off all time does no one else feel ripped off by not having a more important relationship explored or maybe it could have followed a few different relationships really 3 hours of crap for 1 cool shot of the guy bouncing off the rail when the boat goes down production value obviously there but still a boring movie,sad
ive never understood why this film garnered such critical and financial success ive heard it said that it made so much money because teen girls kept going to see it over and over again due to leo dicaprio but i dont think thats the case i think some people just really liked this filmwhich of course mystifies me the plot is the stockiest of stock plots highsociety girl falls in love with lowerclass but funloving rogue cue sappy music but oh conflict shes already engaged to someone else but hes kind of a jerk and she doesnt really love him i know it surprised me too at the end the boat sinks of course and leo dicaprio dies apparently having realized that the movie hes in is no gooddo you see the problem here every aspect of this film is utterly predictable every single character is a character weve seen countless time in other better films and yet the stupid thing is almost threeandahalf hours long it spends so much time developing these characters and situations that weve all seen before one has to wonder if writerdirector cameron actually thinks hes done anything original here indeed i found myself predicting scenes before they happened and i was almost always right on the money  with the exception of the fact that the dialogue i had in my head was less cheesy and hackneyed than what was displayed on screen the only mildly interesting part of the entire affair is the sinking of the ship and even then i want everyone to hurry up and die so the movie can just end alreadyunfortunately the actors arent even at their best here dicaprio is downright dreadful which wouldnt be so unfortunate if he hadnt displayed far greater acting talent than he did here in just about every other movie hes ever been in winslet doesnt fare much better but she does what she can with whats given her whats worse great actors and actresses are severely underused as in the case of kathy bates who is given a criminally small amount of screen timein short  uninteresting characters a predictable plot cringeinducing writing and decenttodreadful acting make viewing this film a rather unpleasant business the ending is good but thats only by virtue of the phenomenal special effects  and special effects do not a good movie make see the star wars prequelsso with all that in mind again i ask  why is this considered good,sad
there were so many utterly uncanny true stories that occurred during the few days of the only voyage that absolutely stagger the imagination the fates revolved around this incident like a greek tragedy how can you ruin a tale like this well james cameron has done it he decides that truth is not stranger than fiction and rights a trite and superficial story of two starcrossed lovers and wastes our time with their wishywashy story he could have written the tale of the two lovers cut down or cut outon the nonsense with billy zane and his evil butler gamely played by talented david warner and spent some time including some of the real stories that captivated viewers of the numerous documentaries over many yearsthe cast is rife with talent but in this film cameron has directed the actors a la george lucas who also has a gift for making talented actors look stiffthis movie doesnt hold a candle to any of the previous films especially the 1953 clifton webbbarbara stanwick version now that was high melodrama done so well to be honest the effects are even comparable the film is still quite moving today this is one more film like independence day pearl harbor and the three recent star wars films that would have been total flops without the special effects and many of the effects were not that good there are too many scenes where the warm waters of the mexican waters are clearly evidentwhat a waste and a sad testament to the true and awesome tragedy,sad
one of the worst movies i have ever seen i put 4 only because it is one of the blockbusters and it has some effects also some not so bad acting first thing i hate about this movie it is too long second thing is its not romantic it is over any limits and really not touching at all another thing is the music i hate awful really i believe canadians have many better things we watched it with a friend and the only moment we liked was really when leonardo dived never to appear again if you watch only this movie you will hate him but i give him the credit for other movies as one here said i love to hate it yes and most of the people i know hate it this is a really awful production  an example of what you can make with lots of money and no feelings and brains at all,sad
i went to see for leonardo decaprio  so what heck id already seen kate winslet naked in jude what  so guys dont go to the movies to see a certain pretty woman but it was inappropriate that people brought kids what with kids talking and asking questions through the whole movie and the parents commenting back this is a big hollywood extravaganza but it doesnt mean that kids should be there as if it were men in blackits selling out every showing in my neighborhood so its the most expensive movie ever made its what hollywood is good at regardless of where it was filmed and what other things could be achieved in this world with all that money originally written 141998,sad

poor people are genuine rich people are evil selfish and despicableand they dont know how to party like folks in third class  especially annoying was the exaggerated cartoon character villain played by billy zane  bates character she always is a decent actress and this is no exceptionhers was a better performance than dicaprios at least is also used to get in a cheap shot at making a social statement  maybe i am completely out in the weeds and rich people during this period in time were really that grotesque  i dont believe that thoughon the flip side are good production and historical cinematography  there was obviously lots of attention spent on detail and money spent on special effectsall commendable but not enough to counter the annoying political subtext,sad
my rating out of is such a sensational looking film that it could be called the most expensive piece of eye candy like all films by james cameron is visually stunning from the sets to the special effects yet while camerons films are great to look at they usually have more going for them than this one was unworthy of many of its oscars and is one of the most overrated films of all timethe first problem with this film is its script james cameron is not a professional at writing love stories and this clearly illustrates that point the dialogue is corny and stupid it makes me wonder why he didnt have aliens invade yes the idea sounds horrible but i will take get away from her you bitch over your gonna live on and your gonna have lots of babies i mean how corny and dumb is thatstrong acting is a requirement for a film to succeed over a flat scrip however this is where fails again i had no clue what dicaprio was trying to do with this character i am glad spielberg taught him how to act in catch me if you can kate winslett is also horrible but her character is treated badly by the script however billy zane is actually quite good kathy bates also holds her own though her screentime is limited gloria stewart is horribly irritating as the older kate winslett characterjames cameron is a filmmaker who has great skills yet those skills are not on display here his direction comes across as inept and uninspired his skills here are better than his skills as a screenwriter for the film but thats not saying muchlike i said succeeds as eye candy but not much else the sets are glorious looking the cinematography is beautiful the costumes are breathtaking to behold the sound is top notch the visual effects rank as some of the most impressive to come out of the 90s is nice looking in pretty much everyway if only everything else came into play would have been a good film the visuals of the film were something not wasted in the making of this filmsuffers from two other flaws unconvincing chemistry and an overlong running time the chemistry between leo and kate was hailed as some of the best of the 90s but i found it flatter than a pancake is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyy tooo long it has a very uninteresting and sluggish two hours the only excitement i got was seeing kate winsletts boobs which are more impressive than the film during its final hour the pace does pick up the sinking is a glorious sight yet leo and kates characters are still there the last shot of the film is stupid that has deleted scene written all over itjames cameron has a solid resume of films he created terminator i and ii aliens and true lies all these films showed the work of a skilled director even though the terminator gets the lowest rating it was a good film and showed a director with skill shows a cocky asshole who should give his oscar to curtis hansondirector of the superior la confidential this is easily the worst i have seen from cameron,sad
was the most deserving of every other film out there of its best picture win  came out in 1997 amid big buzz about whether it would be good or not  and every early review was immensly positive  was made to be large entertainment and a piece of historical evidence on which you could learn from  and it was all that and much more james cameron created the best film ever made by the hand of man in all history  he took some very good actors mainly dicaprio winslet bates and hill to make this film which he wanted to appeal to everyone and it did  this film won 11 oscars for its amazing achievment in the technical areas and in the acting and production of this monumental achievment in film with starmaking turns from its two leads dicaprio and winslet  its best picture win was well deserved if you ask me la confidential is a little overrated and overhyped about its direction from cameron is timeless and it is better than the godfather  so if your asked at a party which film is the best film ever simply reply tatathereturnofthekings score10 starsthereturnoftheking,sad
in general i am not keen on large budget spectacular productions such as whilst the large budget goes in creating expensive but not always useful and even sometimes counterproductive special effects it also creates a situation where enormous public interest becomes necessary if the investors are to recover their money so that  the film concerned has to be continually promoted with a great deal of hype seldom does the excessive expenditure lead to a better script better acting better direction or better photography and these are what govern the quality of the final product won an incredible number of oscars which are supposed to be completely independent awards 11 in all i believe at the time i cynically took the view that the need for these oscars as a bait for attracting large audiences had led to extensive funding of media promotions designed to ensure that this particular film was in the mind of all the judges when the selections were actually being made i also remember feeling very upset that several superb performances in lesser low budget films made during the same year appeared to be being squeezed out by all this hoopla nevertheless once all these awards had been made i had sufficient faith in the academy award system to assume that there must indeed be something totally exceptional about this movie and i made a mental note that i should see it at some future time it was a long time after this when i did so and found to my amazement the film was only a somewhat indifferent fictional drama in the tearjerker category with its appeal stiffened by some very spectacular special effects it was also far far too lengthy to sustain the viewers interest in its rather simple dramatic story my faith in the academy award system was bruised but not totally broken as i told myself that i must be missing something if i could not fully endorse the apparent judgement of the vast mass of the public and almost all the critics this feeling continued until only a few days ago when i chanced to browse through the user comments on this film in your data base and at last realized that my views were quite widely supported and i need not be ashamed of them the fact that i initially felt ashamed of my rather critical views is probably a good indication of the degree of hype which developed around this filmi am not attempting to deny that is certainly a better than average film and i do not want my comments to appear totally destructive the recreation of the ship and of its death throes is superbly done but if one is viewing the most expensive movie ever filmed one is entitled to expect very dramatic special effects  the real question is what do they really contribute to the story and in this case the answer is very little overall the film is extremely well made but its script is very poor the characterisation is stereotyped and much of the acting is no more than acceptable i can see nothing other than some effective but unimportant special effects to justify the status it has been accorded it fails right from the start as it does not appear to know whether it is intended as a documentary record of a dreadful tragedy or a bittersweet but highly improbable romance the disparate pull of these two themes continues throughout the film but ultimately leaves the documentary recreation of the liner and its one tragic voyage as certainly its best featurewhy did the scriptwriter and director james cameron feel that it was necessary to incorporate a fictional romance into this film over fifteen hundred real people actually died wives and children were torn from fathers they hardly knew there was real drama in why the carpathia did not steam to the rescue of the survivors more promptly and this has remained of ongoing interest ever since the design of the ship the materials used in its construction the route followed by the voyage and the part played by the socalled blue riband for the fastest atlantic crossing have all been featured in dramas relating to this voyage and some of them were also mentioned in passing in this film surely there was enough dramatic interest in the actual story to avoid any need for the fictional additions in practice this decision has detracted so much from the tale which was crying out to be told that for me at least the film was spoiledthe rating you give it will depend primarily upon whether you regard the fictional romance or the factual documentary of the only voyage as of greater importance my rating for the romance between rose and jack would be no higher than 310 because most of the characters concerned are no more than caricatures the documentary leaves out so much that a similar rating could seem quite generous but the special effects recreation of the actual sinking makes me feel that a rating of 510 would actually be reasonable averaging these and ignoring the problems associated with not knowing whether the film is a romance or a documentary yields a final rating for the film as released of 410 which is probably reasonable,sad
warning  spoilers  to an extent though this movie sucks so im doing you a favorputs the retard in retarded  easily one of the top 5 worst movies of all time  anyone who cried at the end of this film should immediately try and start beef with lw better known as twin glocks tasting the cold steel through your medula would be a much better option than continuing with your pathetic existence  this movie was not funny at all the lead female was morbidly obese and the hero was the homeless vagrant from growing pains i assume alan thicke was too busy hosting episodes of pictionary to be available for the movie  anyway how this trite piece of garbage made money is beyond me  the whole movie was pointless so ill just cut to the end the only remotely funny part  the kid from growing pains is freezing his nuts off in the water while his fat beast girlfriend is floating on some wooden raft all warm and comfy  there is easily enough room for the two of them however she refuses to let him on  i bet that kid never saw this coming when he was living in that janitors closet on growing pains before the seavers took him in  anyway the growing pains guy eventually dies however instead of floating on the surface like all the other corpses in the water the growing pains hobo for some reason sinks to the bottom  while all this is happening the fat girl is crying i dont know why  she clearly could have saved him by just moving over a few inches and sharing a bit of the raft  perhaps she just misplaced her twinkies  anyway she struggles to blow some whistle then some british guy saves her the end this movie was atrocious,sad
 for a blind man who cant see the different between good movie and the bad one actually i admit that is a very good movie but the good part from this movie just the technics eg visual effect sound effect editing art direction etc i think the most important part from a movie is story and the performance of all cast and had sucessfully failed on that part what a mess movie it has an excellent technic but weak in the story its like a human being without soul it had prooven by the result of 1997 academy award that refuse to give the award for best original screenplay best actress and the supporting one best actor especially this one leo is playing very very bad i think ill just stand next to the other film criticisian who believe that the 1997 best movie is not say congratulation to  l a confidential,sad
oh i do have to bow my head tobut not to cameron for creating a visual feast not to the actors for such inspiring and creative characterisation sic but instead i bow my head to mourn for the loss of respect for the millions of people who returned to see this twaddle more than oncea nauseatingly dreadful utterly manipulative saccharine dusted gob of tedious papdoubtless it will be hailed as the greatest film ever by those who think aliens is better than alien and who think that film history started with jaws,sad
wasnt one of the worst movies i have seen the idea is pretty good and the special effects are extraordinary but the script man how many cliches can you fit in one movie example dialogue as follows rose you have a gift jack you see people jack i see youyuckwant morejack do you love him rose you shouldnt be asking me this jack its a simple question do you love him or notim sorry you fans out there but the movie didnt move or touch me at all i rather preferred jerry maguire as a romantic movie or pretty woman also the casting wasnt good di caprio and his hair as well as speech irritated me and i think winslet although she is a gifted actress is too ugly for the role a wasted chance for a good movie,sad
anyone that says this movie is of any use to human existence is a consumer who has been brainwashed into conformity and an ethic of nonresistance and docility when james cameron selfproclaimed himself as the king of cinema he effectively tied the noose around his neck when people look upon this movie in ten years or so they will realize with shame and embarrassment what complete fools the general public were to ever think this movie was anything besides big moneysome of the numerous bad points about this movie are as follows special effects  made me think i was watching a computer game therefore not good for a movie acting  laughable dicaprio shows what a whining brat he can be script  melodrama over a subject hardly reinvented love between the lowly squire and rich princess directing  nothing extraordinary actually nothing unordinarybut i suppose the masses have the final say with their wallets i just hope we arent fooling ourselves to ever think to immortalize camerons waste with the likes of the epic citizen kane there is a difference between a movie that sells and a film that inspires,sad
after watching id be willing to bet that most of you could take 250 million and make a better picture  james cameron is a talentless director who made only as a pathetic ploy to garner attention and win an oscar  his immaturity shows not only by his vicious insults towards kate winslet whos a terrible actress anyway but also in his subliterate script  the movie sort of works like a coloring book except that it wasnt that inventive  i found it more like a colorby number foray into film making  this rancid piece of garbage plays out like a lowrent made for tv movierepresents the triumph of money and bad writing something that everyone in hollywood should abhore  oh and it won 11 oscars for one reason it was made by two of the larget studios in hollywood and all the employees voted out of loyalty  ive never seen anything so formulaic in my lifeif you want a quality picture from the modern day watch la confidential if you want something that will touch you emotionally watch saving private ryan,sad
wasnt the first attempt at turning the sinking of the big boat into a theatrical epic but its by far the best and will never ever be bettered camerons minute attention to detail commitment to realism and epic vision are light years ahead of the german propaganda version a night to remember where the ship sinks whole the dull catherine zeta jones version or the tawdry itv miniseriesthe hugeness of the production is every bit as impressive at the ship and the savage critics predicted that the film was doomed to fail as hard as its subject matter nope went on to be a 2 billion hit and scoop 11 academy awardsdespite the many positive reviews there are always film snobs who love to pick faults in popular culture phenomenons but i think is more than that and doesnt deserve any nitpicking its easy to focus on inconsequential details but has few faults the worst i can say of it is that leo dicaprios acting is sometimes a bit aggravating apparently macauley culkin was considered for the part of jack dawson now that was have been awesomemany snobs have called the characters flat and uninteresting its hard to develop such a wide cast in a film set within a short space of time not including the 84 year timespan of the story but the two and a bit days that the ship manages to sail before it sinks does have plenty of drama and development so anyone who complains otherwise is just deliberately being fickle i dont even think that billy zane comes across as a caricature as others have gleefully pointed out caledon hockley is actually a complex and somewhat sympathetic character i know hes the antagonist or maybe the iceberg is but the fact that he still searches for rose on the deck of the carpathia means that he really does love her in a wayonce the iceberg hits at the 100minute mark the editing and timing not quite realtime but close is perfect the growing panic matches the rising water as captain smith walks around in a daze completely unable to be believe that it really is happening the hole in the hull doesnt seem to be a problem at first but two hours later anyone not on a lifeboat is doomedin a way its an endoftheworld movie as much as a romance or disaster the was a microcosm of human society and despite its status as the biggest ship ever built it really was a tiny fragile speck on a dark unforgiving ocean even as a child long before i ever saw the film i thought that the sinking of it represented the futility of mankind trying to conquer the ocean and the meaningless of wealthits a very different film from terminator or true lies but james cameron has always kept a gritty earthy tone to his movie isnt but his commitment to realism keeps it consistent to his other moviesi dont think its the best movie ever but it scores almost full marks for everything deserves to be seen on the big screen which is why i have only seen it twice the new 3d conversion looks great and with a few corrections to the content of the film and the digital projection itself now really is the time to revisit the ship,sad
true that has won many many awards even tying for most awards ever given to a film  however there are many many downfalls that made me commentfirstly i would love to just say sucks and leave it at that but that would be rude   a predictable plot and acting is in question  i still have not seen the film but i will never watch it because of this  the astronomical budget did not meet the end result  comparing this to ben hur which has won the most awards from the academy would make this film look like showgirls to star warsi do believe the film did deserve some credit for special fx but the budget of several hundred million dollars could have fed millions of starving children in ethiopia for several months,sad
aside from being widely historically inaccurate the whole are there enough lifeboats thingnobody asked that question on that ship numerous other flukes the film was horribly written and badly acted depended too heavily on leonardo decaprios brief rise to superstardom among 13 year old girls whatever happened to that guy but it won a buccoo amount of oscars and this is just my opinion but still the sheer naive sense of it detracts from the entire film bud sturguess texas,sad
i definitely give 8 to 9 on a scale of 10  when i saw it during its theatrical release i thought it was overly long and didnt live up to its hype  but at home on dvd and in surround sound in the comfort of my own home it was totally captivating  part of the reason was knowing that it is primarily a love story and the disaster was a convenient way to tell it  it is one of the few dvds that i will actually own and watch a couple of times a year  great video transfer and great sound,sad
i the film this moment the interconnection between the countries fore man en women en the children of the world  look i peaceful i am whit and carry out the my job in the past  whit diligent and respect and carring whit you braking a dog bred ,sad
great practical and special effectswell actedcan feel a bit sluggish or long at some points,sad
definitely goes down well in history with some cheesy moments however making it fall short of 10 for me glad it did well at the oscars you will definitely cry even today if you havent already seen this film,sad
is one of the best movies ive ever seen i still remember the first time i saw it back in junior high school days starting on a single ship it is a story of love beyond the difference in economic position in the first half of the movie you can enjoy a pure love storyhowever in the second half it changes to a panic story with life and death the sinking of the ship has shortened the distance between the two main charactersthe scene where a person falls from a ship is miserable and can not be forgotten,sad
this movie definitely holds up after 20 yearsi was worried that the effects would be terrible but the story is so compelling i didnt notice if they wereand its one of the few movies that works at being the length that it isif you havent seen this watch it and if youve seen it before give it another go and see what movies used to be like,sad
i have watched so many films of the director james cameron and i liked them all is one of his great works that tells the story accident occurred in 1912 james cameron used special effects to make the scenes of sinking look like realthe film is about a poor boy named jack who met a rich girl with the name of rose rose was trying to commit suicide to escape her forced marriage jack convinced rose not to do so and there start their love story while crossing the ocean the ship hit an iceberg and sunk into the wateri enjoyed the appealing acting of leonardo dicaprio jack and kate winslet rose who performed well as the leading actorsevery second of the 194 minutes of the film amused me even if the end of the movie is sad because jack died after he has saved roses life if you love history drama and romance i a must to watch,sad
falls in the epic category along with movies such as gone with the wind pearl harbor and ben hur to name a few period costumes set design believable characters incorporated to share a story of what could have happened on that fateful night we just wanted to watch it again since it had been awhile,sad
just looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooveeee iiiiiiiiiiiiittttttttttt,sad
i dont need to say anything about it everyone knows how beautiful is it,sad
great moviejack jack comebackremarkable performances from leo and kate,sad

ok lets be honest im 17 and this movie is about 21 years old ive seen hundreds of hollywood movies including fictional romantic tragedies drama and action but this movie is included in all the above categories and in all of that it has been the number 1 top grossing blockbuster movie for over 12 years the director mr james cameron has done brilliant job in working on such a great project the movie seems to look alive even after 21 years the effects used in the movie are outstanding even for the present dayactually the reason why i wanted to give a review about this movie was that i loved the fictional part of this movie ie jake and rose cameron has done a great work in writting such a wonderful and fascinating love story ever written ive seen alot of dramatic scene but this movie actually brought tears in my eyes this fictional part of the movie looks so real and every scene that includes jake and rose in it just trembles my heart the theme song of this movie my heart will go on just refreshes the soul and gradually brings tears as we go on to listen it reminding about jake and rose the best scene was when rose survives and reaches america she looks at the statute of liberty city missing jake and a few moments later an officer asks her name and she answers rose dawson naming after jakei think im gonna need a physiatrist hehehe because ive been watching this movie 6 times consecutively i just love this movie so much leo and kate are my favourite hollywood celebrities of all time this movie is never dying master piece love you jake and rose 3excuse my english please,sad
i loved this film ive watched it 10 times and cry each time it really takes you back to the 90s through its writing style and cinematography then youre transported back to the beginning of the 20th century to a tragedy that will be forever remembered,sad
should i dare being hard on this film that is now a reference i darehonestly we know the end from the beginning and it is basically about people in a boat it has become successful because of all the commercial aspects that surrounded it even before it was released and because the audience felt empathy for the tragedy there is obviously a love story and a bit of humour to make you cry in the end as i watched it as a teenager i of course fell in love with leonardo di caprio but couldnt help but notice that the reason why his character doesnt survive is because there supposedly isnt enough room on one of the wooden plates that is left of the boat i beg to differ there was enough but the love story couldnt be a happy ending it just wouldnt make us cry enough,sad
ignore the haters they need to criticize the genre not the movie this movie is about 85  historically accurate about as much as you can want from a hollywood blockbuster1010,sad
what can i say i watched the movie everytime its on cable 20 yrs laterits still the most beautiful movie ive ever seen everything is so perfect the cinematography the storyline the acting the score the special effect i doubt people will make a better movie than this in the next 50 yrs james cameron is a genius,sad

if there is only one movie in the world it is i have seen it more than hundred times but each time it seems new to me there are no other movies to be compared with it is one and only jack dawson and rose dawson these two characters have become immortal characters as we see in epics the set the sound the script everything was perfect in james cameron spent his whole lifes effort on every actor each crew member were lost in the story during making of this film there are no mistakes at all costumes were hearttouching dialogues were breathtaking special effects were almost real the whole movie and every moment of it has the power to engage viewers concentration,sad
jack and rose are a couple you root for ever since you see there connection this helps the viewer get drawn in a really develop a sense of care for the characters that is what makes this such a powerful masterpiece its a movie of love and disaster romance and heartbreak my favorite movie of all in fact again i cry every time and im a guy who doesnt cry easily bravo,sad
is a movie of romance and drama the director of this awesome film is called james cameron well done to the director was made in 1997 the main characters of this movie are leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet this story is about two characters rose kate winslet and jack leonardo dicaprio who meet on the on this boat a terrible catastrophe will occur the will sink its terriblethe main music of this movie is very melancholic every time i start crying because i imagine its my family on this boatthe specials effects are very realistic but maybe it was actually filmed in the atlantic i dont know but its possiblepersonally i really love this movie it is amazing if you think it was one of the best movie ever i agree with you so frankly if youve never seen this movie go fast you will not be disappointed promisedand i do not liego see it   clmence g,sad
a pioneering significance is that it put money and technology together to create a new model at that time cameron always focus on technical movies the realistic performance of the green screen makes you so addicted since then the technical movies become mainstream business of hollywoodthe is real part of maritime history the romance story was just made up so movie watchers can catch up their feelings with the sadness of the event since most people have felt love and loss sometime in their lives but never experienced a life endangering sinking of a ship absolutely is a successful commercial movie on yidioocom you want to review it,sad
ive seen close to 15 times and i still get goosebumps whenever i see the ship leaving the port to those who put down for being to romantic i say your absolutely wrong this movie made a killing at the box office and for good reason this film is fantastic  is a one of a kind movie that will be remembered forever,sad
wow well what can i say that hasnt already been said these are some of my favorite actors and they are in a tragic love story how amazing leo and kate have chemistry that is so perfect and so sweet in the movie they really feel like they are friends that grow into a loving relationship the imagery is gorgeous and the story has such heart its still so terrible that this is a true event that has happened i couldnt imagine being on the ship when all of this was happening there are times that it was slow but other than that i will always love this movie it will always be a favorite leo is such a great character in this movie and he is such a likable character and kate is as well,sad
is an american epicromantic and drama film its was written and produced by james cameron in 1997 about a boat in 1912 to be more precisewas a british boat that sank in the atlantic ocean in the early morning of 15 april 1912 after hitting with an iceberg during the travel from southampton to newyork city this boat caused the death of more than 1506 peoplethe film is a global success and received 11 awards and elected best filmthe film tells the story of two passengers in love on the their love story began when rose wanted to commit suicide but jack a poor vagrant dissuaded to do this they lived love story but it became a nightmare because of tragic adventures people dont understand why rose left down jack  they think rose should have let jack get on board the raftthey think she is selfish but even if the film end is tragic it is better because it is more emotionalthe true story is a sad story no after possible so the logic want to be the first and last film with the same namethus end is horrible but another screenplay will be greatly less breathtakingwe love like thatthis incredible and timeless filmthat pushed all of us to cry,sad
warning may contain some spoilersim a child and i absolutely love this movie at my school i am criticized for loving leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet in this love story in the past year we lost an amazing man and terrific film composer i had been a fan of his since 2009 the first time i had seen this movie james horner was an amazing man who could make your heart ache from the very first note played to his final coda the love between leo and kates characters is heart breaking and tragic i had been an avid lover of and decided that i should watch the movie and i instantly fell in love with the whole story i may not be in love with the movie now as i was then but i still enjoy watching it even though it gets harder each time in the months that passed since james horners death in june 2015i know people criticize cline for the song but in my honest opinion i think the collaboration between her horner and will jennings was the best collaboration ever the song which has been one of my favorites for a long time really hit the tragic love story on the mark the idea that two people can meet in the oddest of circumstances and make love happen is really extraordinaryjim cameron really hit the mark with this movie sure there may be some historical inaccuracies but you shouldnt hate on the man for being fascinated with something that the world has been fascinated with since her sinking in 1912 many movies had been made on the ship and hit more of the actual historical accuracies but this one really takes the cake,sad
the greatest film in the history of mankind the most engaging love story ever made this film has mesmerised me like no other on the face of earth after watching once in childhood i watched this on again at the very start of 2011 and have ever since watched it a thousand times i am such a huge fan of this film that i have even dedicated a poem to it consisting of 53 verses a shame i have never shared it online fearing plagiarism a fear quite justified given the number of fans it has online i also watched it at a cinema when it was released in 3d on the 14th of april 2012 either hours or a day short of the tragedys 100th anniversaryeach time i watch this film i tend to stay quiet a few hours afterwards and usually have that heaviness in my voice it just affects my like no other film can just to avoid looking like an emotional fool i usually start a conversation with anyone who happens to be sitting next to me so that i dont end up being in tears at the scene when jack diesthe great thing about the love story was the joy that you so felt for them so many hurdles stood in their way there were so many things to fear from yet they bore every hardship simply looking into each others eyes it is one great display of what the power of love is and what love can make us do they way they rescue each other from one situation to the other and the way the whole story builds up and that once in a lifetime tragic ending scene it is masterly work by james cameronbesides that the whole depiction of the way the ship sinks the horror in the end the way the people die by either slipping from it or in the freezing cold the panic shown at the time it hits the iceberg all of it is pure brilliancelastly it should not at all be criticized for not being historically accurate as for that you better watch a documentary film they had to put up a buildup to the disaster that it was,sad
when the movie was released i was just 2 years old and i have no idea what was going on i watched the movie when i was 12 and didnt get it all because english is not my first language but i remember that its the first movie that brought me to tears and then i watched the movie 2 years ago i was 17 years old year 2012 thats when i fully understand the story and this year i rewatched the movie and still i feel the same way as i was years ago what can i say im really moved and to be honest i talked about it with my friends the whole week and they all laugh at me because its been years that was released and they said that i cant move on about the film and that im obsessed about it well i raised my forehead and proudly said yes i amhello thats youre a complete idiot if youre not moved by the story and if you dont find yourself googling about it thinking about what couldve happened if jack was still alive and you cant get enough of it i may not have my own jack but this film really makes me feel that i have one jacks life was full of happiness and adventure while rose suffered from being prison by her familys decision jack sacrifices his life for rose to have a life that she always wanted to see the world in a different perspective love and promises kept her alive and jack is a big part of it true love really last forever as long as you have that person in your thoughts and inside your heart true love is about making sacrifices true love is a promise kept forever,sad
a review of by eliswi recently watchedit is an epic romantic disaster film starring leonardo dicaprio and kate winsletthe film director is james cameronthe core of the film is an epic romance cameron said that this was the great love story while the love story appears to be the heart of the film it is however the anachronistic characters of jack and rose that make the film so appealing to todays audiences the story is very grippingexciting and romanticit is about members of different social classes who fall in love aboard the ship during its ill fated maiden voyage unfortunatelythe film has a sad endingi think the acting is very gooddicaprio is excellentas usualthe special effects and music were wonderfuli really enjoyed this filmi was crying in the endit was very excitinggo to watch it if you can,sad
when this picture came out in 1998 i was only a toddler but this movie will always be among my favorites each time im watching it im always taken by the same array of emotions and it never changed im still as impressed by the cgis and the impressive work the staff accomplished to make this movie possiblethanks to them the this gigantic british ship supposed to be unsinkable but did anyway during her illfated maiden voyage came back to life and we can see how beautiful she was being able to recreate her to the smallest detail is certainly a great achievement and the result is as amazing as they could have imagined it must have taken an incredible amount of research hours to reach this level of realism the success of the picture is also the ones of all the people involved in this project the sinking scenes are masterfully done but dont fell in the too much view we always see in nowadays hollywood movies its spectacular without being exaggerated and more interesting james cameron didnt take freedom with historybut the focus is not on the which is just the setting for a wonderful romance between jake leo di caprio who is just so cute and rose kate winslet who was the incarnated grace two young people who werent supposed to be together but fall in love and fought for survival together when the ship sinks in the middle of the atlantic ocean this romance looked like a fairy tale it has everything to be a wonderful one two young lovely people who met on the ship unexpectedly fall in love despite their rank differences jake is from common people he is poor and succeeded to get on board thanks to a poker game rose is from the high bourgeoisie a wife to be promised to a rich but jealous industrialist but is boiling inside by all the rules and etiquette but when the ship collided with the iceberg and start sinking everything change and both jake and rose will try to survive together in a freezing atlantic ocean waters what a powerful storytoday 17 years after its release is still a movie we are talking about some love and others hate but this movie is still in memories and im sure its not willing to fade away leo and kate are renowned actors and shoots with the greatest and me im still overwhelmed by the huge emotions this movie brings me its one of the kind and will have always a special place in my heart,sad
i never thought that a ship wreck would be able to produce such an amazing and romantic movie james cameron did an amazing job at synchronizing a horrific event in history with the everlasting love between jack dawson and rose bukater who was played by leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet is a movie that keeps you on your toes whether its between the two love interests or between the tragic events that is happening to the ship and the people while the boat plunges into the water to me is a five out of five movie because of the amazing actorsactresses the story line the message it relays at the end and all the different characters that made this movie so diverse while watching you have no choice but to fall in love with the characters which made me want to watch the movie even more the actorsactresses were amazing when portraying the characters they were supposed to be the way they fell into character so easily was elegant the director made the characters so diverse which made it more interesting to see how different classes of people were treated back in 1979 the people that were chosen to portray the characters actually looked as if they were born for that particular role you could feel the sincere emotions the actors were giving off while in character which made the audience open up to the movie the movie was so interesting that the audience could watch the movie over and over again and it will never get tiresome a contributing factor to success of was how the movie told the background of some of the characters they were able to tell the story behind most of the cast members like the husband mother newlywed couple and the young unfortunate families some of the characters in the movie might have not been intended to be significant but ended up being very important to the impact the movie had on the audiences emotions for example while the boat is sinking there is a mother who is tucking her kids away into their beds she felt like that was the only choice she had because she knows that with their social status they would have no chance of survival all she wanted to do was comfort her kids and make sure they were at ease right before they all perish just that scene alone played an important role in the audience reaction and emotions the movie also relayed a very unique personal message that was very meaningful the director showed that love can conquer anything and can last forever even throughout death in the beginning of we noticed that the very first time jack saw rose he instantly fell in love through the entire movie the audience see how their connection grows into this deep love that neither one of them have ever experienced rose was engaged to one of the wealthiest men on the boat and she gave it all away because of the connection her and jack shared even when the ship was sinking jack and rose was so passionately in love they literally did anything for each other for example rose went into the bottom of the boat which was filled with water to rescue jack who was handcuff to a pipe and left to drown also rose jumped off one of the only life boats in order to stay with jack cause she knew that she couldnt go on without him or how jack let rose lay on floating wood in order for her to stay out the freezing water and stay alive all of those contributing factors made the movie great i fell in love with and will recommend the movie to anyone after watching this movie it became a part of history and any and every one would love watching it when watching the movie you fall in love with the message that the movie gives you the characters that are being portrayed make you fall in love with the movie as well this movie makes you want to watch over and over and anyone would love it,sad
its 2014 and still the movie are mentioned in nostalgia showsbased on the real story of the sinking of this was the king of movies back in 1997the movie was told to be bomb but did the oppositein the meanwhile my heart will go on was played all aroundthis is about the woman rose finding her love onthe ship is split between people living in luxury and the poor one belowthere are river dancing fancy dinners romance and much moreuntil the ship slowly sinks and rose looses her loved onenow get the movie and its easy to findturn up the volume to max and see the movie on a large screen when you have over 3 hours to spare1010,sad
directed and produced by the famous james cameron in 1997 hit screens all over the world and left its audience speechless as the storyline was moving and timeless i highly recommend this film to others as it is extremely interesting not only by the emotional storyline but as it is based on real features of historythis film will leave you speechless and stunned by the experience of the passengers on board the as the unsinkable becomes the inevitable who will survive the ship of dreamsa must watch,sad
i dont even know how to explain how this movie affected me normally i am not a fan of either kate winslett or leonardo dicaprio but i cant image anyone else for the parts they played except for the beginning the entire movie takes place on the ship its like this beautiful timeless little universe apart from the rest of the world the costumes were beautiful and the ship itself was perfectly done and you feel such a sense of loss when its over it really makes you realize what a tragedy it was in a way that few movies can it feels like there is nothing in the world except the ship and the fact that you know whats coming makes it all the more bittersweet the scenes of the older couple the young mother and old rose throwing the necklace into the ocean and what come after that especially made me break down,sad
newly released from paramount pictures on bluray3d and digital didnt completely sweep the academy awards in 1998  it only took 11 of the oscar statuettes among them best picture a best director for james cameron and a best cinematography for russell carpenter some of that sweeping cinematography is bound to be lost on a home screen but home surroundsound can do a nice job on its oscar winning best sound seasoned kids first youth film critic raven devanney age 15 calls a romantic masterpiece the film evokes strong emotion partly because of the reallife tragedy it recreates but also thanks to the intimate love story leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet bring to life that the film is 15 years old does not diminish its impact says raven  even though ive seen it about a billion times i still get choked up on a scale of one to five she rates it a five only because higher numbers arent availablereviewed by raven devanney see her full review on video httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvhuglaj1fd0 is my favorite movie by far this romantic masterpiece starring leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet tells a tale of love loss and tragedy i remember the first time i watched i was 7 years old and ive been hooked ever since this was the first film that really made me cry and even though ive seen it about a billion times i still get choked up this movie is beautifully done i love that the cinematography is so grand and breathtaking even though the film came out in 1997 i especially love the way they capture the in all its glory im a total history geek when it comes to the ive seen every documentary and read every book there is to read about the so the fact that they used actual footage of the wreckage of was really cool my favorite characters are rose and jack of course they defy the rules of their different social statuses and are in true love not only are those characters great but kate and leonardo do a masterful job in these roles i love the whole movie but my favorite scene would have to be when rose and jack are running through the ship away from the butler after the drawing scene it lightens the mood of the film before the sinking and is quite funny plus you almost get a mini tour of the ship i also admire the final few scenes in which the ship is sinking the way it is captured is amazing its the perfect mix of chaos and emotion which really conveys the tragedy in a brilliant way like i said this film is very tragic and that fact that it was an actual event makes it even more sad i would recommend this film for all ages even though it is sad and slightly inappropriate i watched it when i was 7 and nothing bothered me this is a mustsee movie and i give it five out of five stars id give it more if i could is in stores now on dvd and bluray so be sure to add it to your home movie collection today,sad

definitely one of greatest movies of all time this is one of my most favourite movies of all time is complete we can find love thats the main theme action the sinking ship a little story of friendship jack and his buddy religious moments beautiful scenery and many valuesthis is a multilayered movie of which people can see from different views id like to say that this one of most oscar winning movies is full of values through which people can learn more about life it wont be boring to watch it over and over again and even when we watch for the 10th times we still can get something new from the movie either new moral message we just notice that moment or a scene weve possibly forgottenthrough this one of highest grossed movies of all time i get leo as my most favourite actorive watched it 12 times and still plan to watch it again sooner or later thank god for this movie,sad
an awesome movie by james cameroonwhat a movieit has been more than a decade that this movie was released and i have certainly lost count of how many times i have watched this moviean amazing treat to watchit feels as if i am watching it for the first timekate winslet and leonardo are simply brilliant and so are the rest of the crewamong the few movies that makes tears flow from my eyes each time i watch itwould love to see the same version on big screen at least once as i missed it many timesthe picturization is awesome specially the climax partindeed one of the best films that has been made till date and one of my all time favoriteit surely deserves 1010,sad
in 3d i had never seen this film before is that possible at least not in its entirety with bits and pieces here and there caught on tv throughout the years at the time of its release i said to myself ah just another love story and besides i know the ending i must admit now its not so bad quite good in fact almost 3 and a half hours well spent while watching i had a thought for my grandfather who had he crossed over only 2 years later might have very well gone down with the and i wouldnt be here to tell the story finally i dont particularly enjoy cline dions choice of songs but i have to admit to a guilty tear when i hear the song,sad
even after fifteen years is still talked about so much james cameron has made this movie so big that even kids in elementary school know who leonardo dicaprio is this film is more than just a love story and many people will agree the special effects that appear in this movie are spectacular well honestly if youre going to spend over 200 million dollars on making a film it should be at least spectacular the real reason this movie was excellent was because of jim camerons undying devotion to the projects perfection he did countless retakes of key scenes got behind the camera himself many times and made sure every part of the movie matched the picture in his mind the acting is brilliant based on a true story probably more than half of the consumers that watch the film will share tears thanks to an imaginable ending which can never be forgotten well if you havent seen this film youre missing out on something historical and a film to idolize for hollywood could it get better no not at all the most moving film of all time see for yourself then you will understand a landmark dont be surprised if you cry too 1010 hands down,sad
on the surface the plot lines and basic story seem trite and contrived poor boy meets rich girl the fantastic acting by the leads and the direction of the massive cast of extras along with the superhuman attention to detail are what makes jump from the screen at the viewerthink about the whole king of the world sequence with jack and fabrizio and the flying sequence with jack and rose in the hands of a lesser director both of these would have come across as selfaggrandizing pap but the way both scenes is shot and leo decapriokate winslets uncanny abilities and chemistry sent a shot of ecstasy throughout the whole theater these scenes along with several others works well to capture the fabulous grandeur of the originalwhat is most often missed in reviews are the performances of actors in lesser roles such as billy zanes turn as an elegant cad david warners perfect casting as the classy thug bodyguard kathy bates nailing her gauche nouveau riche embodiment of the unsinkable molly brown she was a last minute casting and scores of other astounding recreations from the captain to the top hatted billionaire and his eyes popping out when the water floods the stateroomaccording to the trivia page cinemas wore out their copies and needed replacements people have probably also worn out their vhs dvd and blueray copies nothing will wear out the enduring appeal of this classic as pure fullon entertainment,sad
is simply one of the greatest films i have ever seen the historical detail is almost spot on and though the script may have its faults to some like jack and rose being repeated too often i think that if you put it in context with the story it all works out james cameron did a brilliant job as this movie haunts me even weeks after i see it follows rose dewitt bukater kate winslet a young socialite and jack dawson leonardo dicaprio a carefree and penniless artist from wisconsin after jack prevents rose from throwing herself off of the ship they fall into a passionate love all the while trying to avoid roses fianc who is nearly twice her age cal hockley billy zane but as the sinks rose struggles with the will to survive or the intense need to be with jack was such a success because it portrays the great disaster through emotions not simply stating facts we smile with the characters as rose and jack fall in love we grind our teeth in frustration when cal and mrs dewitt butaker try everything to tear jack and rose apart we feel heartbroken with rose when she finds that jack succumbed to the cold it is the fact that we feel the event that makes this so sweeping is not simply a love story its a show of raw emotions and loss and love and the fact that everything the men who built the ship believed proved to be false,sad
when i first heard of the title and the year it was filmed in i was a bit cynical of it and very reluctant to watch 3 hours of it although after watching the whole movie from start to finish i was on the edge of my seat with a tear in my eye since then i have watched it countless amounts of times and it never gets old and i can proudly call it my favorite movie not just the love that cant be storyline or the beauty of the ship but the acting and effects are amazing having random conversations will occasionally bring up the question whats your favorite movie and every time i say and most of the time people will just look at me skeptically and say why as though its such a crime to love a classic i really do not see how people can hate this awardwinning masterpiece this movie has sunken as far into my heart as the ship did into the ocean,sad
imagine being the captain of the and told by its architect that it will sink with absolute mathematical certainty immediate denial sets in but the instincts are too strong the most incredible machine ever built by human hands will lie on the bottom of the ocean floor in a matter of hours and theres nothing anyone can do about it the sheer horror of it reels the imaginationit took me a long time to get past the hype of the films original release sometimes its better to let all that hoopla pass and see a picture on its own merits rather than on the recommendation of anyone and everyone while watching i tended to key in on the historical elements of the voyage rather than the love story realizing that most films like this rely on a romance to move the picture along im willing enough to go along with it to go too far in the other direction would move it toward a documentary and there are enough of those around if thats what youre afteri was fairly impressed with the technical aspects of the picture regarding the disaster following ismays jonathan hyde analysis of how the would take on water and sink and actually seeing it play out made for some dramatic special effects whats almost impossible to comprehend is how the passengers on board ship might have actually reacted on that fateful night the calamity of it is absolutely mind boggling and difficult to contemplatei give director cameron and the special effects folks all the credit there is for producing an epic disaster film dicaprio and winslet perform capably though i wasnt necessarily wowed by their portrayals even if your only motivation to see the picture is its inclusion as one of the top grossing pictures of all time you shouldnt be disappointed,sad
it is easy to understand why falling in love as a teenager feels so dramatic extraordinary and outofcontrol because usually our brains don t develop as fast as our hormone levels rises in our bodies in the case of jack and rose short romance on a sinking ship means a lot for them on a personal level rose is a prisoner of his mom who wants to sell her daughter to a rich man in order to support herself from that viewpoint she seeks a person who could set her free emotionally from her mother so she ends up to fall in love with a poor young man who has nothing else to offer her but that masculine freedom of his no money just a feeling of independence so on an emotional level this is much about a young woman and her struggle against the overly controlling mother and the gender role of her time through passionate romance with jack to be a bit cynical jack s death is not important when it comes to the message of this story but the idea of freedom he gave to her love doesnt die when the loved ones die because the very idea of love is to form a human the more it forms you the greater the love has been so it doesnt matter if it s just a petty teenage romance if it means life to you as it did in the case of rose jack saved her life in a way and that was the message of the storyeven if the essence of this film was the love story it is as much a portrayal of social classes gender roles way of life and the strong faith in development during the time of this is entertaining film for masses and in that category pretty well done,sad
i was still in 1st secondary school i remember going to the cinema with the family  watching the highly anticipated the whole cinema were in tears i wasnt  we all enjoyed it back then it was the biggest movies with biggest budget ever 200m dollars which was huge budget at the time they even built a full scale replica for the outside scenes  partial drowning scenes it was a great movie  i ended up watching the drowning scenes over  over again and now after 14 years  after graduation  employment it is enjoyable  still keeping its magic from acting  dramatic tragedy to the special effects  direction which also happens to be james cameron the director of the boxoffice hit avatar the highest grossing movie of all time finally i strongly recommend this movie for all future generations as our generation did by watching the godfather  casablanca,sad
its been a long time since ive watched this movie from beginning to end so i decided to refresh my memory i forgot how great and sad this film is it has great characters that we come to love and a powerful forbidden love storyline in 1996 brock lovett and his team explore the wreckage in search for a necklace called the heart of the ocean instead they find a nude drawing of a woman named rose who was wearing the necklace the night sank rose is now an elderly lady and tells brock and his team her story aboard thein 1912 teenaged rose is a firstclass passenger and going to england with her fianc cal meanwhile a drifter and artist named jack dawson wins a ticket aboard the when rose wants to commit suicide jack talks her out of it and they soon start a relationship defying cal and her mom soon hits the iceberg and slowly begins to sink every passing minute jack and rose try to find a way off the doomed ship together or not at all if youre a history buff and want a smart love story youll love,sad
i have to say that this movie would not have been viewed by me if it hadnt been for my 7th grade reading teacher this movie is great and i say  better 3 hours than 36 sadly how to train your dragon has replaced this film as my all time favorite this was well done and this review is late i saw the movie almost a year ago really good recommend it for ages 15 for some  ah  sensual content even though im 13 my 8 year old brother should not have seen this i understand it though he did not thank goodness but if you are okay with it go ahead this is a movie as unique and unforgettable as the tragedy itself 20 stars a,sad
hii reckon the film directed  produced and written by james cameron is a timeless epic romancethe actors brought a lot of life into the film so the story got really vivid and touching though in my opinion kate winslet wasnt the perfect actress for rose the specialeffects were really stunning especially if you remind yourself that it was made in 1997 also the plot was brilliant as it wasnt just an everyday love story with a happily everafter but a dramatic devastating end however is a mustsee film,sad
what a great moviejames cameron does a superb job of creating an almost you are there type of atmosphere the gaiety of life aboard the most elegant ship in the world the nonchalance as news of the iceberg first spreads then the rising sense of panic you dont just watch it you really do feel it then  the performances the lead performances from kate winslet as rose and leonardo dicaprio as jack are excellent  winslets being the superior i thought but both were good they had their rich girlpoor boy characters down to a perfect t i thought in my opinion though stealing the show was frances fisher as roses mother she was perfect as the snobby aristocrat and you could feel the fear and loathing she felt every time she looked at jack then  the details im no expert on the sinking of the but i have a reasonable general knowledge and this film does a super job of recreating the historical details accurately and then weaving them seamlessly around the fictional romance very impressive indeed then  the song who can watch this movie and not be taken with celine dions performance of my heart goes onproblems well the romance was perhaps too contrived in the sense that i just dont accept that jack could have moved so effortlessly from steerage to first class i know he was invited the first time but he seems to keep getting into first class without being stopped until hes been there for a while the realities of the separation of the social classes were much more realistically portrayed i thought when the steerage passengers were going to be left locked down there after the ship hit the iceberg while the first class folks got to enjoy half empty lifeboats a minor quibble though this is truly an excellent movie my only regret is not seeing it in the theatre where i think it would have been so much more impressive,sad
this is considered one of the best made films of all time james cameron outdoes himself big time but this wont be the last epic he ever makes the story of the like youve never seen it before epicness beyond anything reachablethe story is told in a flashback perspective with rose dawson a survivor of the telling it to a group of scientists and her granddaughter telling about her experience on the leading up to the fateful night where it would meet its historical doom it also circles around her life changing star cross love affair with jack dawson leonardo dicaprio another person on thebegins with one of the greatest music scores of all time by james horner and then slowly takes us back to the very beginning goes incredibly smooth with the camera movement making each and every individual scene epic as ever the performances are beautiful as ever with billy zane kate winslet gloria stuart and leo dicaprio leading a brilliant castthe first half is getting everything acquainted on the ship and introducing all the characters and setting the plot the second half consists entirely of the boat sinking which is very graphic the visual effects are mindblowing with excellent and detailed parts of the ship the music editing and setting really capture every single feeling and thought raced through the actual minds of the real peopleone of three movies in history to win 11 oscars the others being ben hur and lord of the rings the return of the king i had to watch the movie five more times until i finally managed to without crying its a real tear fest almost everybody in this film is crying its depressing as ever but in a good way it brilliantly captures the terror of the people its hard for a film to do that james cameron wasnt screwing around when he made this everything in this movie is excellent nothing is in fault absolutely nothing everything is 100 accuratethis film killed at the box office which it well should have its a film that will go down in history a film that nobody will ever forget and will always cherish every little moment this film brings,sad
the main character rose kate winslet is a 17ish year old society girl setting sail on the luxurious to america with her extremely wealthy handsome fianc who adores her what else could a girl wantor so youd think well inexplicably and unbelievably our rose believes that her life of luxury is just too boring for existence so she decides to jump off the ship until jack leo dicaprio talks her out of it from here you can see that a love story will unfoldrose soon learns that jack is a dirty struggling american artist who hangs around onelegged french prostitutes and she becomes impressed with his obscene drawings of naked women why wouldnt she dump her rich adoring fianc for this guy so how does the romance develop first theres beer chugging smoking and dancing at a raucous party held by the steerage class then rose takes jack back to her room rips off all her clothes and demands that he draw her naked after jack fails to take this as a hint that shes in heat rose drags jack to the cargo deck where they have sex in the backseat of some strangers car how romanticand appropriately enough this is when the shi hits the fani mean the ship hits the icebergthe problem is that no carefully brought up girl in 1912 would behave this way in that day and age this would be throwing her life away just as if she jumped off the ship clearly our rose has a death wish because she also gives up a spot on a lifeboat choosing to go down with the ship knowing that she will most likely freeze to death when she hits the waterdespite the storyline and the poor acting the movie was well produced in all fairness its understandable why the studio went with this story this was a huge budget production and if this had been styled as a historical drama with young ladies behaving properly it probably would not have had the boxoffice draw the studio needed all in all this was an entertaining and watchable movie though unnecessarily long but entirely overrated,sad
is a fictional story between two lovers on the ship that sank james cameron did a good job showing the sinking of the ship and the writing was very charming and at some parts kind of funny kate winslet as rose was a good choice for the movie and she did a very good job portraying the emotions and difficulties of rose leonardo dicaprio on the other hand was good for the part but he looked waaaay younger than rose and it kind of made winslet look bad in the movieat the end of the movie as the ship is sinking james cameron could have done a better job with the extras and their hard time staying on the ship when i first saw the movie that part actually made me laugh when i know i really wasnt supposed tokathy bates i also thought was a weird choice for the movie but she pulled the part off being new moneyeven though she had a southern accent all in all it was brilliant movie and i dont pull down the whole movie just because of mistakes by james cameron its mostly about the actors and how they pull off their parts,sad
watch the movie and youll understand the title of this reviewi watch it several times a year i own the soundtrack kate winslet leonardo dicaprio billy zane victor garber and bernard hill are among my favorite actors and yet for me the film is mixedeverything in is uneven some performances are great where as others leave much to be desired there are some great lines in the film and others that are awful etc the primary problem is a lack of realismfirst off with the story how likely would it be that jack would fall in love with rose and risk his life for her if he knew her for only 3 days i find the romantic scenes mixed and while they have a few good moments my favorite parts of the movie are when the ship sinks and with scenes with the crew and billy zane also the class envy lines get to a point of annoyance the quarters in steerage on were some of the best rich and poor alike sacrificed their lives to save others as the ship went down i really couldnt understand why james cameron hated the rich saying he earned more money off of this film than any of the people on ever earned then the feminist lines grate on me too constantly throughout the film feminist messages are shown such as how women have tougher choices than men how all the rich men are arrogant fools etc i just have to wonder how many of the women on would still want to be treated the same way as men when the order women and children first was givennow that were done with the movies buisness and politics lets take a look at the actingdicapriohes now one of my favorite actors but i didnt care for him in this he acting like an american tough guy didt exactly work hed been better off as a european artist part of it was the lines he was given such as im the king of the world he does get better as the film goes onwinsletamazing in the film perfectly cast and helps carry the moviebilly zaneif he werent in it i might not watch the movie his portrayal of cal roses fiance is outstanding maybe because his character is so unrealistically pompous and snobby even to the point where he pushes someone out of a life boat saying get out youll swamp us his lines are hilarious in the film everything he says is great i quote them all the time my favorites are i put my faith in you good sir not even god could sink it twice the size of moratania and far more luxurious and countless others he really helps the moviesupporting castbill paxton is solid victor garber is underused but brilliant as the designer of the ship mr andrews i love his line shes made of iron sir and i assure you she will sink bernard hill gives a good performance as the ships captain all the crew members are great as well i didnt care for roses mother who i thought was too unrealistic in her hatred cals henchman was also unrealistic i mean that he would kill someone just for his boss love i dont know the digital effects are outstanding and a joy to watch the music is amazing and my favorite score of all time the cinematography sets costumes and sound is amazing all in all is a movie i mixed with i watch it and i love certain moments but cringe at others i just wished they could have made a more balanced film to watch would i recommend it strongly but i dont like it so much for the love story as i do for the other elements of the film it was the classic that wasnt,sad
yes for a long time i did avoid this one eventually i realized that i had to cameron is talented enough to make this work ive now seen every film hes directed save for piranha part iiwhich i understand was taken away from him and the man always does a nice job no not every single picture of his is excellent but theyre all worth the timeand with hardly any exceptionsand this certainly isnt one the investment of emotions from the audience as well they entertain and hes yet to make the exact same thing twiceterminator 2 is different from the original in notable areas such as the tone i dont blindly love all of them i maintain that the quality of the abyss lies mainly in the gorgeous underwater photography he never phones it in and he always has something to say somewhere to go with what he does i was apprehensive of the idea that this would focus on a small group of peoplein particular the two leads when this was indeed something that actually did happen and many were killed however when you think about it it needed to be like that thats what makes the incidentin this have the devastating impact that i think we can all admit it does yes the fx are amazing and the production values offer a new definition of the term grandiose when applied to that aspect the reason we feel it though is that we care about the ones we know to be on the ship the characters are wellwritten thoroughly developed credible and all have something to do rose is a rather strong woman and without it reaching anachronistic levels either she is not just a wife and she is fleshed out something that many attempts at female role models neglect to do the cast is spoton everyone is wellchosen every single acting performance is flawless arguably this is somewhat black and white in its presentation of them with that said they are all convincing and have genuine personality this is one of the greatest disaster movies and epic love dramas in the world of cinema it is hollywood and mainstream at its absolute best will it please everyone perhaps not and probably not those who refuse to take it on its own terms it was always clear what approach this took and also about hype ignore it yes you read that right in this case and in all others pretend like you cant hear what everyone is making something out to be and watch what you feel like as unaffected by popular opinion as you can be nothing can survive a viewing by someone who has heard nothing other than positives about it regardless of its quality the pacing is marvelous for a running time of three hours this is not boring at all it has fun and humorous moments is it sappy i suppose thats up to the individual to judge i wouldnt say so there is a bit of violence and disturbing content infrequent mild to moderate language a little sexualityhinted at and brief nudity in this the dvd comes with a theatrical trailer i recommend this to everyone 1010,sad
is the story of brock lovett and lewis bodine who are searching for a very rare and valuable diamond called the heart of the ocean they are contacted by a lizzy calvert whose grandmother rose dewitt bukater claims to know where the diamond is brock flies her in and sets down to listen to her tell where the diamond is lewis is skeptical because the records indicate that her last name is dawson and there is no record of a mr dawson rose meets with the collectors searching for the diamond and begins a long tale she makes them agree to sit through her story before giving up the diamond she is old i mean old she explains that she was once engaged to a wealthy industrialist named cal hockley who had a slippery henchman named mr lovejoy she wasnt in love with him but her mother ruth insisted the marriage happen to protect their social status and help them avoid financial ruin rose feels completely cornered and without options she attempts to kill herself but is talked out of it by a young man named jack jack is a traveling artist who gets by on his own wit he has no money but seems to get by somehow he informs cal ruth and mr lovejoy that he saved roses life he wants to hang out with them all mainly because he wants to sleep with rose theyre pleasant at first inviting him to dinner then paying him to go away eventually they decide theyre going to have to kill himbrock is stunned this story is going on and on and has nothing to do with the diamond rose continues cal gives her the diamond brock sits up hoping this story is going to go somewhere jack will not give up on rose he stalks her and eventually she gives in and they hook up he tells her he is the king of the world brock interrupts to ask if this is the part where she tells them where the diamond is she says no and trudges ahead with the story jack does a nude sketch drawing of her and they have sex in the back of a car rose points out to brock that cars had just been invented brock could use a stiff drink at this point rose mentions that cal slips the diamond in jacks coat to frame him for theft brock sits up and asks where the coat is rose says they chained jack to a pipe to die lewis has heard enough of this story and leaves rose uses an ax to free jack he dies of exposure when the huge ship theyre on sinks in the atlantic she claims his last name which isdawsonbrock is stunned he shakes his head in disbelief rose asks lizzy for help getting to bed and she just leaves to take a nap brock cant believe he went to all that trouble to get the runaround he heard a 90 year old woman talk dirty for three hours and didnt get any closer to finding the diamond he takes lizzy aside and tells her how much the diamond meant to him and how disappointed he is for not getting it you can tell hes trying not to tell lizzy what he really thinks about her grandmother and her stupid darn story meanwhile rose gets up aimlessly walks out to the deck of the ship theyre on and randomly tosses the diamond into the water for no reason it was in the pocket of her bathrobe the whole time she chuckles at this i love this woman then she randomly wanders back to bed lays down and diesthis film swept the 1997 academy awards including best picture best director and best visual effects,sad
when i enquired my cousins about this movie they said that this is a ok movie but to my astonishment when i watched the movie its awesome later i got to know that the tragic ending of the movie is not appealing to them may be this is one of the reasons why most of the people could not forget this movie though it has got a tragic ending it stages a wonderful love story that blossomed between a poor guy named jack and a rich lady named rose it is a beautifully and carefully carved love story i could not stop crying in some scenes with as backdrop james cameron perfectly presented the drama you may say ohhits a routine love story with a bit of change in backdrop no i wont agree with you it leaves a lasting impression in your heart making to the top of the worldwide box office records is not a common thing and this adds strength to my statement the music in the movie is enthralling both kate and decaprio are in their tender age and are wonderful i watched this movie many times skipping the last tragic scene when jack dies this scene almost squeezes my heart as a whole the movie can be concluded as a master piece,sad
an epic movie which you will remember for the rest of your life after youll watch it simply the kind of movie which you cant describe in words you have to watch it at least once  to see what we the people who appreciate this movie are talking about after watching it for 3 times already in my life i still cant believe ive seen a gigantic ship sinking in a film with such an incredible realism i heard there were used some test puppets to make it look like people were falling off the ship well i havent noticed any everything looked so real all the people that were falling and screaming for help the fictional story about the 2 main characters falling in love is genially directed some of the scenes are very touching very well filmed and the casting was great i dont want to hear any stupid replies that dicaprio is a bad actor hell no  him and kate winslet both did a great job theres no doubt about their acting skills whatsoever those who are calling this a bad movie i hope you people never watch a movie ever again cause i assume all you know is teenage comedies and horror movies also please stop calling us pathetic fan boys this is not twilight where 15 year old girls claim it to be the best movie because robert pattinson is part of the cast i am a man i watched this movie 3 times already and i didnt cry i just know how to appreciate a well made movie we all of us that do millions of people much more then those of you that hate it claim this to be a superb masterpiece and the few of you that didnt enjoy it i am glad i am glad that you arent capable of appreciating good movies and i hope you stick with the genres i stated above you didnt even deserve to watch it actually i recommend this film to everybody no matter the age and if you didnt like it unlikely keep your opinions for you they are not welcomed here as you definitely dont have any idea how a good film looks like,sad

has to be one of my alltime favorite movies it has its problems what movies dont but still its enjoyablewhen i stumble across someone who asks me why i like i suppose my first reaction is wait a minute you dont i know so many people who dont like this movie and im not saying i dont see why the love story is too cheesy well yes but isnt it enjoyable and moving all right the love story between jack and rose is very unrealistic everyone knows that love like this doesnt actually exist but this is a movie doesnt everyone enjoy watching a beautiful story that lets us slip slightly into fantasy for a while the next complaint dicaprio and winslet are terrible actors well ok in this movie i agree that they do not perform to their full potentials however i think its unfair to say that they are terrible actors i personally think they are both very talented actors who unfortunately are very famous for a movie that they are not amazing in but the roles they are given are simple and the characters seem real enough that you can care about them quite a bit but i agree with many people that they did not do as well as could have been expectedand finally if one is going to complain that they dont like this movie because they hate romance or because they hate history or tragic movies then im sorry but why on earth did they go and see a movie that is so clearly all of these things its like people who complain the dark knight is a bad movie because they hate action movies simply for being a movie not because you dislike the genre this is a good moviewell deserving of its oscars in particular best cinematography which i find to be the best ive ever seen in a movie save maybe the lord of the rings trilogyi know some of the writing fails such as the constant screaming of each others names throughout the movie the flashback portion of the story can be quite weak at times but overall its an amazing achievement in making the look so real and the sinking feel so epici understand why a lot of people dislike this movie but for the most part it boils down to them disliking the fundamental idea such as it being a love story rather than them thinking the movie in and of itself is poorly constructedi can tell you that i have read more than five books about the including memoirs form the day it happened and this movie is extremely historically accurate save just a few faults the only main ones i can find is that the piping should be threaded copper not steel and the iceberg looks fairly unrealistic as is the scene where they hit iti give this movie 1010 not because i like romance movies but simply because its an outstanding cinematic achievement that leaves one feeling horrified by the realistic adaptation of events,sad
the ship may have sunk but the movie didnt director james cameron from the terminator did it again with this amazing picture one of my favorite scenes is the dinner table scene in which roses family and friends meet jack after he saves her rose has a look on her face that every woman should have when you meet the onei hope i have that look when i am in the room with my future husbandjack and rose have a connection that is movie stuff but its good movie stuff we have the greedy mom and all her elite stuck up associates who live off of their husbands wealth rose almost commits suicide but the gilbert grape star rescues her i really liked the hanging over the boat scene it was a good riskthe movie is long but its fantastic good story good flow good actors go see it twice if you want its worth it,sad
its not too hard to figure out what kept audiences flocking to when it came out the sheer spectacle of it as well as the sweeping sense of romance which cameron succeeds in evoking made this a mustsee theatrical experience at the time and even for a while after seemed like it would go down as an epic for the ages a masterpiece with the overwhelming reputation of classic epics like gone with the wind the oscar wins seemed to cement thatthen came the backlash which was inevitable for any film with this sort of popularity the thing is to some extent deserved its backlash it is obviously nowhere near as bad as some say but viewed today 12 years later in a home setting away from the theatrical experience many enjoyed back then the movies flaws are easily exposed the screenplay is really not strong at all the characters are more like caricatures and the romance not particularly convincing at most during the excruciatingly long hour and some spent on setup this romance which cameron seems to think is the epitome of romantic cinema a love affair to match the scope of the film seems like a cute fling jim camerons knack for writing some truly execrable dialogue is not gone just yet and while i can knock back a beer or two or seven and watch ripley lay waste to xenomorph after xenomorph in aliens while cracking oneliners its a little hard to take in this setting still most of the dialogue is solid or average and there are some good lines the narrative structure and momentum is nothing special at all poor dude meets rich girl they fall in love hits the iceberg and then theres an hour of running here and there and special effects so the film was overhyped yes jim camerons previous films were all better bar true lies and his cheap debut feature piranha 2 but that doesnt mean doesnt have its positive points it is obviously a wonderful technical achievement that still stands tall is very nicelyshot and there are a number of excellent scenes indeed the sheer spectacle of the final hour and some from the moment the ship hits that iceberg is still easy to get carried away by and cameron proves that he is more than capable as a popcorn entertainer dicaprio is very charming and proves himself as a dramatic actor in the latter stages while winslet does her typically annoying nonsense but on the negative side horners score is pretty mediocre its a good enough film overhyped yes but that is the fault of the public not the film which remains flawed but ultimately fairly enjoyable on par or better than most big budget flicks and disaster movies but its no masterpiece and now excuse me im going to watch aliens again,sad
i think james cameron might be becoming my favorite director because this is my second review of his movies anyway everyone remembers the rms it was big fast and unsinkable until april 1912 it was all over the news and one of the biggest tragedies ever well james cameron decided to make a movie out of it but star two fictional characters to be in the spotlight instead of the ship well onto the main review but let me remind you that this is all opinion and zero fact and the only fact that will be present is an event from the filmso our two main characters are jack leonardo dicaprio and rose kate winslet theyre not annoying too much but watch this and youll find out why they could become annoying  httptinyurlcomojhoyn  the main villain i guess is bad luck fate hand of god no blasphemy intended or just plain caledon hockley billy zane combine all of the above and what do you get oh yes we get a love story on a sinking boat the supporting characters are the following my personal favorite mr andrews victor garberidk he was so nice lovejoydavid warner murdochewan stewart lightoller jonathan phillips captain smithbernard hill molly brownkathy bates and many more we also got the present day treasure hunter brock lovett bill paxton they add something to the story something good the action in here is awesome especially in the second half the drama as also good in the end you can have your eyes dropping rainstorms or silent tears the story is simple and it works a treasure hunter seeks the heart of the ocean and instead finds a drawing of a woman wearing the said diamond she calls and tells her tale on the rms two lovers separated by social class and ultimately the fate of the ship everything about the story works and there are very few flaws i give an 86 awesome,sad
the movie makes it much more then just a night to remember it re writes a tragic history event that will always be talked about and will never been forgotten why so criticised i have no idea couldwill they ever make a movie like that is so moving and touching every time you watch it could they ever replace such an epic masterpiece it will be almost impossiblethe director no doubt had the major impact on the film a simple disaster film boring to watch converted to an unbelievable romance yes im not the romance type either but that should not bother you because you will never see a romance like this guaranteed everything to the amazing effects to the music to the sublime acting the movie creates an amazing visual and a wonderful feeling everything looks very real and live the legend herself is shown brilliantly in all classes too looks too accommodation the acting was the real effect dicaprio and winslet are simply the best at playing there roles no one could have done better they are partly the reason why the film is so great i guess its not too much to talk about the plot is simple the acting is brilliant based on a true story probably more then half of the consumers that watch the film will share tears thanks to un imaginable ending which can never be forgotten well if you havent seen this film your missing out on something hesterical and a film to idolise for hollywood could it get better no not at all the most moving film of all time dont listen to people see for yourself then you will understand a landmark dont be surprised if you cry too,sad
wow this is the most interesting that i have ever seen what makes the movie unforgettable is not only the great story line but also the talented direction of james cameron to me the time when went down under the freezing water was the climax of the movie at that moment the director did a great job in expressing the feeling of thousand souls fighting against the death the sinking scene appears to be extremely realistic and touching each action of each figure bears many implied meaning they depict one trues identity when trying to survive they have different actions aristocrats who always hide their nature or act above others they refuse to wear the life vests because of its informality however at the end they cannot hide their fears or tearsthe musicians decide to play regardless of the chaos why they want to be faithful with music the source of their life this is a very touching scene this shows us great love in a different kind a kind that is way above others love is beyond fears yeah i really recommend someone who havent seen that movie should try to watch it it is in top 100 movie you should watch in your life,sad
is one of the most successful films in recent history it won a lot of oscars and really is one of the better films that is based off a historical eventthe effects are phenomenal in this film the looks as how it should have and looks real they really got the details down perfectly and it seemed as if each room shown in the film was flawlesssome of the scenes in this film are just awesome especially the scene where the hits the iceberg the whole sinking scene in particular is dramatic and will keep you captivatedacting is good for the most part dicaprio is pretty good in this film and this may be one of his better performances but i really have not seen that many of his films same with kate winslett actually acting may be the biggest weakness of the film but that is just because everything else is outstanding i thought the captain of the was well performed as were the entire crew of themusic is spectacular not much more to addthis is a really good film not a ten out of ten for me but a solid nine out of ten and a film that i highly recommend to the likely two people out there that have never seen it,sad
anyone who saw the old black  white movie a night to remember will appreciate the improved special effects in this one but miss the more accurate portrayal of the historic event james cameron really managed to bring the old ship back to life for the big screen but at the same time he strayed from history painting a negative and inaccurate picture of the crew and passengersim not referring to the fictitious love story between the two fictitious characters kate and jack this addition is clearly pure invention a device to involve the audiences emotions in the tragedy in a way that a documentary style film doesnt thats fine whats not fine to twist the historical facts about real people which cameron clearly does in this film many of the portrayals of the crew members are fictionalized i suppose its forgivable to make ordinary people into heroes but to make heroes into villains as this film does is i think unethical its damaging to the memory of those people and im sure its offensive to their surviving descendantsthe biggest misrepresentation is of 1st officer murdoch who is portrayed as losing his mind and shooting passengers and himself during the sinking during the evacuation in reality murdoch did not shoot passengers or himself the writers of the film completely made this up captain smith is portrayed as a weak ineffectual human being incapable of making decisions for me bernard hill was wrongly cast in this role  he does not have the charisma and presence of smith according to most studies and records smith was also active until the very end a one point he was calling back boats on his megaphone when he saw that they werent full  a scene that was edited out of the movie for the final releaseive always had mixed feelings about this film the effects sets costumes and technical accuracy are impressive as are some of the characters i particularly like the chief engineer and murdoch but there are aforementioned inaccuracies and also many unnecessarily silly bits like the scene with cal chasing jack and kate down the grand staircase with a gun firing shots as he went which cheapen the filmi think that when you make a film like this dealing with such a monumental tragedy with characters representing real people in recent history its very shameful to invent bad things about thembut all in all this remains an epic film and was one of the most impressive films id ever seen at the cinema back when i first saw it in 1997,sad
this movie should have all ten stars but the only reason it doesnt because people like my brother put like only one star just to make it go down when its really one of the best movies in all time ok now im just writing more because i tried to put this comment in but they said that it has to be more than 10 lines so this movie is still the number one bestselling movie and the nudity scene was very classy and i think we need two more lines im just gonna copy and paste the two beginning sentences or im gonna just keep saying copy and paste copy and paste copy and paste copy and paste dude this is really a dumb rule i think i have enough now bye,sad
the film is absolutely awesome every last minute of it and james cameron did everything right the whole film seems so realistic and you really feel for rose kate winslet who i thought looked gorgeous throughout the whole movie and has a fiery personality and vast intelligence i also loved leo dicaprios character of jack as the traveling starving artist and helps rose realize her dreams that she thinks shell never be able to achieve i love how realistic everything was including the beautifully done vintage costumes hairstyles and sets which make you feel like youre really there the production team got the sinking of the ship quite accurately according to history and that was fantastic that they did research so diligently this movie is fantastic and deserves all the recognition that it has received over the years,sad
this is one movie which everyone must watch  i normally do not follow romantic stories but this is one movie which made me emotional and it is the only movie in which i shred tear drops jack and kate love story is still embedded in the minds and hearts of the people who have seen this wonderful movie  their chemistry is just perfect  there is never a dull moment in the moviethis movie was a paradise for all the lovers of the 90sthe music  my heart will go on  still keeps playing in the radio and is one of the best background scores of the 90s i remember when this movie came out  it was so historicalpeople were watching these movie over and over again  i watched it thrice it is also the highest grossing film of all time and the record is still intactno dark knight can beat itit is also the only movie to win highest number of oscars in all it won 11 oscars including best film i recommend everyone to watch this epic classic,sad
amazing this is the best movie ive ever seen what this film is about is jack played by leonardo dicaprio how wins tickets in a card game and then meets a girl on the ship named rose played by kate winslet who tries to jump of the end of the ship she is saved by jack and they fall in love but rose is going to be wed this film is good because it runs with a nice flow and exiting some of the best parts are when you see the water bursting throw the walls now if you dont like sad films dont watch this film it is sad some of the saddest parts are when you see every body floating in the water and when you see the woman not wanting to go in the lifeboat without their husbands and if you dont like romance movies dont watch this but if you do then watch it now for my finale rating 1010 but thats not all i think that this film should be listed on the imdb top 250 but it is not anyway i hope that you like this film but you may not,sad
where do you start with this film possibly one of the only films i have watched regularly since it was released a fairly simple but dramatic plot that coincides with the story of a sinking of the biggest ship of its time that has made such a huge impact on historykate winslet and leonardo dicaprio are absolutely perfect for these amazinglycrafted roles kate winslets role once again proves her versatility from film to film and it has to be said this is one of her best movies a young leonardo dicaprio also brings such a charm to jack that every woman watching the film cannot help but fall in love with him themselves the fictional storyline based around a nonfictional historical event is truly heartwarming for a short time before it quickly becomes heartwrenching the first half of the film is calmly amusing for the audience as jack and rose discover their love despite their profoundly different backgrounds the second half however is dramatically darker as circumstances threaten their love and their struggle to keep a grasp on each other and their new found connection brings a lump to the throat it is not a airyfairy happy ending  quite the opposite instead the majority of the audience are crying with the injustice that the pair suffer but there is also an element of acceptancewhat i find personally pleasing is that the engaging storyline does not detract from the horrors of the night the sunk in 1912 this film not only does the sinking and the traumatic loss of lives justice but also has included enthralling acting of the fictional storylinethere will always be many who find this film boring and cheesy as with all films  but the astounding amount of awards and fame it has achieved truly portrays the feelings of every person who has fallen in love with this film,sad
not a masterpiece but also far from a disaster movie i hate people who rate movies 110 when theres a minimum of quality in a movie i hate people who give 1010 for the chain saw massacre those same people see has a failure but the chain saw massacre has a masterpiece come on cameron and his crew made a success withwas not meant to be a documentary but only a movie with a love story and its a great one even if the characters are fictitious i just loved kathy bates in her small role and i loved hating the bad guy billy zane by now everyone has seen at least 3 times its entertaining,sad
terrific filmmaking which works on different planes directorwriter james cameron gives us a beautiful love story the mix of all of the characters are engrossingleonardo dicaprio as jack dawson does a great job and this actor is looking grown up beautiful and talented kate winslet as rose looks like she came from the past kathy bates misery as molly brown the brash american new money socialite billy zane as roses controlling fianc does a great job at being despicable frances fisher matches the rest of the cast with her talentthe special effects are fantastic and they never overpower the story and the music and title song are hauntingive heard that cameron was difficult to work with not to excuse that but sometimes when one has a vision it comes across that way in the end it seems that his vision was realized,sad
is my favorite movie this movie is very long but i have never felt that its boring i knew the real love by this movie jack dawsonrose and dewitt bukater were really really devoted to each other i thought its great love and i also like two main actors the music of this movie their play is so natural but we can feel their strong passion leonardo wilhelm dicaprio and kate winslet are so attractive actor i think when they play the seen of the real cold ice it must really hard from these serious seen i could feel their professional heart the music are so famous and these makes us feel sad happy relax i can see this movie again and again,sad
all right to start with i am giving 10 stars just for the fact that it touched my heart and inspired me that  to live is to love might not be technically flawless as if we have any movie like this n yea including godfather i meanits just that people love to hatefor reasons unknown to me this is also partly proved by the fact that this movie has i guess the highest no of comments written 2100 odd  you wouldnt find that for any pinkyponky film  i mean y would so many people bother to votecomment about the film if they hated it so much there are so much disastrous cinema these days well i wouldnt scribe much about the technical stuff since the oscars stand firm as the proof of that still heres my take on the technical aspectsdirection is quite incredible tackling such a huge production and a historic disaster is never easy minus a few goofs the direction would have been perfect  its great nonethelessthe performances of the cast just blew me away the casting seems perfect and kate winslet was out of this world  leo seemed a bit raw in few scenes but his very charm onscreen was more than compensatingset decorationart direction was best ive seen along with lotrbackground score is damnnnnnn perfect  james horner take a bow screenwriting was good tooyes inspite of the length of the filmand editing seemed mindblowingoscar deserving cinematographysounddrowning sequences were all breathtakingwhat could have been done better wasyestheres always scope for improvement leo was good but couldve done bit better towards the end of the film few goofups in direction were avoidable screenplay lacked just a little punch towards the middleabove every damn thing  the romance bw jack and rose is the most incredible ever captured on screenat par with casablancai just dont understand why a lot of americans hate this filmthats what we perceive here in india  but is the biggest hollywood blockbuster ever in india  i engrossed my 8 year old cousin and my 65 year old grandpa  a rare feat for any film finallyis one movie that can capture your heart and mind in a way that you cant even imagine  it might be fiction some call it stupidsobfiction but thats ok  but love it or hate it cant be ignored  cheers and peace  with love from india dhawal trivedi,sad
the first time i saw this movie was when i was four years old and my mother covered my eyes at almost every scene naturally i remembered how sad the movie was something that wouldnt happen for a four year old with most movies though was that the movie had such a great effect that even years later when i heard the song that was playing at the end i felt sad just recently i rewatched the movie and was blown away weve all seen movies that leave you with a feeling afterward whether it be one of happiness sadness or anger this left the viewer with all three of these emotions its not hard to guess why it would leave you with a feeling of sadness but id like to point out how strong this lingering feeling was i cried not only during the whole last hour of the movie but for thirty minutes afterward as well ill admit i cry easily over movies but usually the tears stop coming after the first two rounds the ending of the movie was just amazing this is left for the viewer to interpret but when the old lady closes her eyes and the scene shoots to the men on the opening the door for her and jack is standing at the top of the stairs next to the clock the ending is just turned over from a depressing movie to a very happy one depending on the readers interpretation it can be implied that perhaps she is dreaming of him or she dreams of him every night but this isnt quite so happy the reader could also look at it from a logical point of view and say that this is the dream people have in their last 12 minutes of brain activity when they die however the most happy and perhaps most common interpretation is that she has indeed died and she is now off to spend an eternity with jack her only true love the movie leaves you with a feeling of anger because you know that jack didnt have to die you know that nobody had to die but the maker of the ship had insisted on going faster and the people loading the safety boats didnt want to risk putting too much weight on so while they could have fit 65 people on each they stuck with close to 12 you know also that if the dang boats hadnt been so selfish towards the end he wouldnt have died this is by far the best movie i have ever seen and i would recommend it to anyone,sad
a lot of movies have been made about the however i do not think that there will be another james cameron did a fantastic job of bringing the back to life so we all could see wonderful cast wonderful story very sad ending as we all know i have seen all the tv movies with barbara stanwick and others no other movie tops this one kudos to mr james cameron for having the sight to bring this movie back to life in the 1990s a 10 for sure i know that rose and jack were added for the love story and wonderful acting between them the ship was identical to all the documentarys i have seen especially the state rooms were the first class were staying again this movie is a must see for all that have not watched as of yetby psywizard880,sad
so i had not seen tiatnic for like 7 yearsi remember the last time i saw it i was about 7 or 8 years old since then i have not seen it i remember that at the end when jack dies and rose is left in the ocean that i cried a lot a lot of people surely cried in the last year i have started to use imdb and i see gets a lot of hate well i decided to see it again to refresh my memorylet me start off by saying that gets a lot of hate because of its weak screenplay yes the screenplay is the biggest problem no it is not horrible but there are a lot of cheesy and badly written lines some scenes are very unrealisticlike jack grabbing rose when she slips in her red dress with only his hand also like when rose and jack start to run away from water scenes like this make the film look bad and some lines and dialogue seem unnecessary and poor but let me tell you that if wanted to give some emotion to its audience then in that way it does not disappoint or fail the chemistry between rose and jackplayed beautifully by kate winslet and leonardo dicaprio is strong their love seems real even though at times it feels too forced and the way they met is unrealistic but in having a romance story together with a real life tragic it is done very well the production design is very well done the ship and the effectsi am sorry for saying the effects were bad after seeing it all they were not well they are magnificent all the stuntmen and the effects done in the actual sinking of the ship is simply amazing the last hour of the film is so intense and it looks so realistic visually that you cant help but love it for that some scenes are so monumental they are some of the most tragically horrifying scenes in cinema history the costumes are also well done for the period of 1912another great aspect of the film was the acting kate winslet deserved her oscar nomination as did gloria stuart all the actors were on par the music in the film is simply heartbreaking the original song by celine dion is just wow one of the best songs in film history and its oscar win is very well deserved the direction is simply inspiringas a whole is satisfying for every film lover for people who like to be entertained this is a great film for them because even though it has some problems it never fails to entertain or to emotionally connect with yes this film gets a lot of hate but the honest truth is is a masterpiece of its time i am sure that it will be remembered in 50 years simple because of how well a film it is yes problems or not the fictional film about two lovers in a doomed ship just has to be remembered whether people want it to or not 1010,sad
although is a movie first shown nearly ten years ago but it seems never out of fashion even today a great number of people approach it everyday to recall that classical scenes to understand the film from a totally different perspective the society is developing but peoples pursuit of romance is permanent especially nowadays with the high divorce rate peoples desire for true love is much stronger than before the love between rose and jack is so holy so sparking moved nearly everyone to tears may be thats one of the reasons why it is so classicalonce more the song of my heart will go on rang in my mind love can touch us one time and last for a lifetime no more words can better describe the essence of this excellent movie,sad
ive seen this movie numerous times and it never ceases to amaze me that each time the movie ends i am still stunned and touched with the pure beauty of this film the film surely stand the test of time and is proved that even 11 years after it release it still has the ability to astonish each viewer that has the privilege to watch it it has the capability to stir every emotion inside it contains all of the elements that make a beautiful movie its created with its amazing cast and superb actingits also a showcase for winslet and dicaprio two actors who have much become the greatest actors of our generation and james camerons incredible and stunning directorial abilitieswhat few flaws it has are nearly unnoticeable in this film that is beyond beautiful almost everyone has seen this movie but if you are one of the few on earth who havent go out now and get it and you surely will be moved,sad
is a movie which i first saw when i was about 9 years old i was totally blown away by this astounding epic the movie starts in the present day with a treasure hunter named brock lovett bill paxton whom is searching for a priceless diamond artifact aboard the wreck of the failing to find it he is contacted by a 100 year old woman named rose calvert best supporting actressnominee gloria stuart who claims to be the woman sketched in a book that lovett found aboard the rose makes her way out to the salvage ship and proceeds to tell lovett and his crew her story of when she sailed on the supposedly unsinkable ship the movie then jumps back to april 10th 1912 in southampton where the is ready to set sail on its maiden voyage to new york the younger rose named at the time rose dewitt bukater best actressnominee kate winslet is travelling with her domineering mother and her tycoon fianc caledon hockley whom roses mother is determined to see her marry for his extreme wealth rose doesnt love cal and she attempts to commit suicide by throwing herself off the back of the ship however she is rescued by steerage passenger jack dawson leonardo dicaprio they quickly fall in love and soon she decides shed rather be with jack than cal however their love is to be shortlived at 1hr 36 minutes into the film it reaches a pivotal moment when the ship strikes an iceberg in the freezing cold atlantic ocean from this point onwards the ship moves from the love story into a dramatic thrilling race for survival the visual effects of the ship sinking are spectacular although most of the shots are of the real lifesize set built for the film the scene where the ship breaks in two is one of my favourite scenes as the effects are brilliant the film was directed by one of my favourite hollywood directors james cameron creator and director of the terminator1984 and its hugely successful sequel terminator 2 judgment day1991 his direction on this film is sheer brilliance he delivers a brilliant insight into how upper class lived in the early 1900s and he shatters it all with brilliant heartpounding suspense and dramathe film was hugely successful winning a staggering eleven oscars making it only the second film in history to do so after ben hur 1959 james cameron won the well deserved best director oscar and the most prestigious best picture oscar the film also won best costume design cinematography editing art direction sound sound effects sound effects editing and visual effects to date almost a decade on still stands as the highest grossing film of all time with just over 1 billioni would definitely recommend this film especially now as it will soon be celebrating its 10th anniversary it is a lengthy film running at exactly 3 hours however it is well worth it a fantastic epic filma well deserved 1010,sad
1997 dir james cameron brock lovett whilst investigating the wreckage of the when he discovers a diamond known as the heart of the ocean as well as a drawn picture of a woman an old lady contacts lovett claiming that she is the woman in the picture what follows is a breathtaking story of rose dewitt bukater on board the on board she meets a poor boy named jack dawson who both fall for each other days later they both must try to survive when the great ship hits an iceberg and goes down deep into the oceanif you ever want to see one of the best filmmaking examples then is one of them some of the lines might feel a bit cheesy and the love story lines might feel a bit too much love filled but just watching it was an amazing experience and i was only watching it on a dvd the fact that the film is based on something which actually happened makes it so tragic and so emotional to watch im not normally an emotional guy but i just felt devastated seeing everyone happening on it the music doesnt help prevent the emotional experience as its some of the best music ive heard on dramatic sequences the special effects are also amazing too with some amazing realistic shot of the ship a lot people seem to be put off by this film but i think its a work of movie making at its bestis there anybody alive out there  fifth officer lowe ioan gruffudd,sad
the is one of my favorite movies because it was based on a true story this movie has a lot of drama action and suspense i like the setting of this movie because it takes place in the early 1900s and the replica of the ship is very semilar to the one that really sank in the atlantic ocean this is a very sad movie and it also breaks your heart how all those people die trying to save their lives jack and rose are the main character they fall in love when they meet in the ship and they go through a lot of problems to stay together but at the end it is very sad to see him die and not be able to be with his loved one my vote for this movie is a 9 because it is a very good movie i believe that the producers and directors did a very excellent job with this movie,sad
ive read a few comments about this version of and most comments seem to be written by 20 or 30 somethings who probably dont know the first thing about the real sinking of the one comment said that he was in his thirties and that he was taken away by the fictional story intertwined with actual facts not true the did not break in two as seen in this fantasy and the director simply ignored the fact that the californian was only 10 miles away from the so the actual facts were skewered secondly at that time in history no one in steerage would be allowed to mingle with first class passengers and the young girls background would have never allowed her to go against her mothers wishes what seemed to have made the movie a smashing success is that cameron did what margret mitchell did in gone with the wind he took a modern girl and thrust her into an earlier society and the teens  especially young impressionable girls  were carried away by the simple minded story it would seem that most girls want to be  in the back seat of a car by the town bad boy finally unlike the 30 something man who thought that cameron had succeeded in the second half of the sinking i never once thought that these people were on the just a large ship i have to admit that i too have seen thousands of movies and the only time i was carried away by the sinking of was the 1959 version called a night to remember based on an actual account of the tragedy by an eye witnesslord walter lord but alas any of these viewers would call that film a documentary a dry word indeed heck even the clifton webb barbara stanwyck version seemed closer to the sinking that this over blown version i know im alone in this but its hard to get through the first five minutes of this tripe without wanting to stop the viewing my teen aged daughters worship this and i understand why this version is for children,sad
was a movie that cannot be forgotten for ages is the best movie i have ever seen was perfect it had everything drama love humor adventure action you cant say what really happened on the real because you were not on it yourself james cameron cool director just a gave us an idea of how it must have felt to be on the real ship he did a great job in using a love story to make people understand the tragedy of the real james cameron did a great job in showing us what it must have been to be in a sinking i really loved it and i really really recommend this movie to all of you,sad
before seeing it i just thought oh i dont want to see this everybody loves it i didnt want to be everybody but then when i saw it on the night of my birthday i just loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooved it i cried for about half the film i love films that give emotions that make me cry or feel anxious or anything to keep me concentrated to the story in an even paranoiac kind of way and i just loved it this is the film that changed my life and when i saw the vote that the users put on this website i nearly fainted absolutely not right this is the first film with kate winslet in it that i saw and i havent stopped yet i think both her and leonardo dicaprio are wonderful actors and it seemed like a very fun film to do loved it,sad
is not only the most famous disaster film of all time but also one of the most popular movies ever not to mention that it achieved the rare glory of wining 11 academy oscars many films were made during the 20th century but the famous james cameron film from 1997 is the most well knownthis film version of the legendary ship was a phenomenal and unusual success so much that it was something like 7 months on theaters and proved to be the most costeffective movie ever made many people even went to the theaters twice to see it and the number of academy oscars that it won is another prove of its success plus most everyone praised and liked the film back then it was a hit on vhs and dvd as wellstrangely in recent years the movie has been getting many lukewarm reviews and i read somewhere in the internet that it was considered the worst oscar winner ever how ironic huh it seems that it has become fashionable to hate this movieits an okay movie but not all that great however my biggest problem with the movie was always its length 3 hours is too much and becomes tiring even exhaustingthe story is well known for being based in a real disaster story which happened in 1912 that makes this a realistic movie the ships replica is very well made and detailed in that way they achieved perfection making it look just like the real ship which was the biggest fastest most luxurious and most beautiful of its time sadly it hit an iceberg and sank on its maiden voyage and more than half of the people passed away you know what bothers me most first the number of lifeboats wasnt enough because stupidly they believed that more lifeboats would be a waste of space in an unsinkable ship unsinkable yeah right second the ship was going too fast when its engines hadnt been tested enough and all of this just because of headlineshas beautiful instrumental music a beautiful ballad named my heart will go on sung by celine dion beautiful angles of view of that pretty ship romance tension suspense and incredibly tragic moments to see people falling in despair and committing suicide is a reality and it certainly happened in real life this movie also contains some nudity and sex and even some shocking and controversial scenes of homicide however its not just a melodrama it has also romance and even some moments of comedybesides to see the sinking breaking in two and to see its rear at an impressing height is breathtaking it will live forever in your mind because its very impressive spectacular yes but tragicthe actors do a good job in their roles leonardo dicaprio kate winslet victor garber danny nucci jason barry bernard fox and othersby the way mr andrews jack dawson fabrizio and tommy ryan are the best and nicest characters of this movieanother equally revolutionary ship was the french ocean liner ss normandie in the 30s its appearance was very similar to the rms and inside it followed the same concept of luxury in a classic and old fashioned style very different from the luxury standards of modern liners the ss normandie didnt sink but its ending was tragic too during the world war ii it was was converted to a troopship in 1942 caught fire capsized and sank at the new york passenger ship terminal although it was salvaged at great expense restoration of the vessel was deemed too expensive so it was scrapped in 1946 and i say it because i dont like to refer to the ships as she,sad
the boat who sank as they said in the movie 1500 people died so lets make a movie of it and what a movie leonardo di caprio makes the best acting the world have not seen on many yearsi nearly started crying when rose shake jacks hands in the freezing water and im not the one who often cries kate winstlet is my new favorite actor i gave 10 out of 10 not only because the love story but for the chaos scenes ive always been a person who likes chaos scenesits not the best movie in history but it should be in everyones top lists it is on mine,sad
is a dizzying compilation of a tragic event in our history and a phenomenal riveting love story grabs you the moment it starts and never lets go even after the movie is finished and the actorsactresses performances in this movie are as amazing as the special effects are brilliant even at the end in the grand staircase where you see everyones that was on you see their whole story play out in your mind as if they were the real people and as if you were on the in 1912 and knew everyones story all of this along with the spectacular soundtrack composed by james horner will leave you absolutely speechless and awe inspired this is definitely is one of the best movies of its kind ever even 10 years after its creation it never ceases to amaze thrill and touch phenomenal riveting amazing brilliant spectacular and a perfect ten,sad
as much as i really want to knock this moviei cannot it almost made me cry just like a chick flick the screen writing of james cameron is simply superb in this movie he obviously did all of his homework the excellent cgi graphics of 1997 is still topnotch by todays standards the accuracy of all characters and of the ship itself is deadon i have read a lot of books on since this movie and the realism is phenomenal the final sinking scenes of the movie are the most rivetingi have watched this fine movie over ten times and it never seems to grow old i am not a celine dion fan but her haunting musical score gave this movie the full effect it deserves watch this movie and get a firsthand feel for what its like to experience a turnofthecentury steamship and its catastrophic sinking a wonderful history lesson all in one fine dvd,sad
i have seen the movie in the box office summary i thought that the movie was very heartbreaking the song my heart will go on made me cry the movie was great and but i do not think i can watch it again without crying since it was a very touching cry it can melt the hearts of even the cruelest people in the world my favorite part of the movie was when rose was standing outside of the ship with her hands spread out and jack was right behind her i also liked the part when jack was tied to the pole at the bottom of the ship and rose came to save jack the part that i did not like was about the class being spread out for example the rich people were considered the important the poor or middle class people i recommend everyone to see this movie and guarantee that no one will be disappointed about the movie being boring or worthless,sad
this movie is so amazing to me it is a passionate love story a historical document and a reminder of the horrific tragedy that was the day the sunk i can never hold back tears when i watch this or at least that huge lump i get in my throat im not one to cry very much there are very few things that can make me cry and this is by far my 1 tearjerker this movie will leave you deeply changed and if youve never been in any kind of accident will leave you feeling sorry for anyone who has ever suffered this is one of those movies that only comes around every so and so years the kind of movies like this that are able to rip your heart out easily someday another movie may be able to top this but for now it remains the extremely emotional movie it is,sad
i loved a lot i wasnt around when the actually sank but this movie made me glad i wasnt around to see it the artwork and the storyline really keeps you wanting more and more from this film the acting was pretty good and the love couple of jack and rose definitely didnt make this movie boring because i wanted to see what would have happened in the end when the ship would have sank some very minors things with the movie was that the acting was a bit corny in a couple of areas and the fact that they didnt go a bit more into detail with the characters but doesnt make it bad in anyway what so ever another impressive is that after 10 years people are still talking about how great this movie is and for some reason you havent seen it yet go watch it now,sad
is such a good movie its a mix of comedy and mostly romance i think kate and leonardo did a wonderful job acting their parts for it i think the acting of the whole thing was wonderful if it was the funny scenes or the serious scenes or the romance scenes they all still did a good job from the beginning to the end it had nonstop great script great acting and awesome sets what i liked about most though was the emotion the actorsactresses all had if it was a romantic scene they acted as though they were in love and i think that is a great feature in a movie its such an incredible film if you havent seen already i recommend you watch it if you like the romanticcomedysad movies,sad
this is my favorite movie ever i have been watching it since 1998 and it has never gotten old i loved how the plot of the movie blended so well with the actual events and the attention to detail was out of this world the accuracy with the ships details such as the opulence of the interior first class areas the riveting detail on the ships exterior the wardrobes of the actors and actresses it all seemed so real like time went back to 1912 and stood still like it was all back again and the love story between jack and rose oh it was so nice i love how they had an older rose telling the story and when it switched from her now to how she was then it was awesome one of my favorite scenes though is definitely the king of the world scene because i think that james cameron really captured the feeling of the time of the she was the largest ship afloat the finest afloat and it was during a time when people thought they had nowhere to go but up things were changing and getting better all the time with new technologies and the was like an icon for that so the king of the world part is just awesome imagine a third class passenger winning a ticket like that you could only imagine that theyd had to have felt that way and then when the camera comes back and you see the proud on the waves in all her glory its truly awesome and then when they zoom in on captain smith beaming proudly what an awesome way to portray him you have to wonder if he really felt that way then how proud he mustve felt the only thing that i didnt like about it was how they portrayed first officer murdoch there were some witnesses who said they heard shots or saw shots being fired reports of an officer shooting himself that night but it was never proved and given the real officer murdochs character i dont think he did anything like that nor do i think any of the officers shot themselves or someone else they made him out to be a villain that i dont believe he was other than the fact that i thought rose said jack one too many times the movie was near perfect totally awesome this was just an unforgettable movie the best ever there will be no more like it its truly one of a kind that cannot be beaten i hope it forever stays above all the ranks,sad
i simply cannot believe what i see 7 7 to a movie that has won 11 o scars 7 to a movie that has won the biggest amount of cash ever 7 to a movies that makes you pass through all the emotions that make us be human beings 7 i was only 9 when this pearl came out but there are some things that come to me now about the time this movie appeared at i remember how i read in a newspaper about the enormous queues on cinemas from all over the usa and not only i remember how i once saw on tv a man with his sonboth with tears in their eyes  and how the spectators were standing on their feet and applauding minutes in a row after this movie came to an end i am wondering why the most marks given to this movie are marks of 89 10 and 1  an average is an average but usually the marks are insignificantly higher or lower than the average itself not in this case thoughcould it be so difficult to accept that there are movies that can make you feel something like that something is or was real  would it be impossible to admit that you loved this movie  and why do you want to destroy your minor contribution brought to the popularity of this masterpiece i think the rating of this movie stems from a source of rejection of the beauty i dare to shout out loud is one movie to remember,sad
ok let me sum it up rich girl rose duwitt bukater winslet is tired of being proper she attempts suicide but fails jack dawson  dicaprio is a poor artist who won his ticket on by a lucky poker hand who saves rose from killing herself the next day he is invited to dinner in first class as a reward for saving her roses mother who is a very selfish person who only cares for money takes an instant dislike toward him because he is in steerage cal zane is also a very selfish person who is roses fiancafter their dinner jack invites kate to come to steerage and have a fun time cals butler or whatever he was sees rose in steerage and tells cal cal is angry and later on he gives rose a rare blue diamond as a token of love rose is forbidden to see jack again but she disobeys cal on that same day jack sketches rose nude with the necklace and then one thing leads to another rose and jack make love then cal sees roses drawing in the safe where rose put it along with the diamond then he gets an idea hell frame jack for stealing the diamond he sends his butler to skillfully put it in jacks pocket and then jack is placed as a prisoner rose frantically sets out to look for him and while this is going on the ship is sinking and everybody is evacuating she finds jack and they escape to the top of the ship since only women and children were going first on boats rose gets on forcefully by cals and her mothers wish then suddenly goes up and to jack she leaves the boat without the people because she only wants to stay with jack when the ship sinks rose and jack dive to the bottom there they stay until jack dies then rose blows a whistle and a rescue comes and saves her and not jack so that was basically it it was an awesome story and i cried in the end very big tear jerker,sad
at the end of the movie they both tried to float on the piece of wood but they were too heavy although they were relatively close to staying afloat unfortunately the combination of their body weights with the large heavywhenwet old fashioned cloth life jacket she was wearing was just too heavy so he stayed entirely in the water and died from the cold they should have done the following take her life jacket off and put it under the piece of wood at the end that their torsosheads would be at and let their legs dangle on the other end perhaps in the water a little they both would have survived and lived happily ever after too bad they were too stupid,sad
flashy special effectswooden charactersforgettable scriptout of placetime dialogueunbelievable socalled one night stand romancepretty lead girl with no personalitypretty lead boy with no acting abilitythis was the first movie i had seen until thennot a particularly interesting historical footnote to me at the timelater i saw a night to remember and remembered why i prefer older movies so much more than todaysantr is so much better in many respectsi saw this movieonce in the theater and thought it was oksaw part of it later on tv a while backhavent seen it since and have nearly forgotten about it altogetherworth one viewing so you could comment on it but an obscenely huge waste of studio moneybut the shallow simpletons of todays time may think it is truly deep in naturehumor them,sad
such a lot of care was taken so im told with most aspects of the accuracy of this movie if that is so i cannot understand why one of the most important facts is glaringly wrong and that is the name of the ship it was not the ss but the rms ie the royal mail shipi could be wrong but i think it must be taken with a pinch of salt that the sketch left in the safe could have really been in such pristine condition after 80 years at the bottom of the atlantic protected or no it was an excellent movie in regard to the computer imagery and a marvellous treat for those unfortunates who wallow in disaster for their entertainment im not one of them and only really watched it out of curiosity after all the hype i couldnt see what all the fuss was about and for me even the a pitiful subplot couldnt save it its not a patch on a night to remember and that was in black and white with no computerised aids one last comment i can well understand an upper class girl falling for a working class bit of rough even in the second decade of the 20th century what puzzles me is how they managed to enjoy lovemaking in arctic conditions and in the back seat of a freezing car brrr it doesnt bear thinking about,sad
i love this film its in my eyes on of the most well blended films ive seen and yet one of the most tragic films everything about this film is brilliant whether it be the acting the effects the music or the directionthis film was a huge success back in 1997 when it went on the cinema and it seemed everyone loved it i was shown it on video was about 10 or 11 and thought it was a remarkable film and it seemed everyone 10 years ago loved ithow things have changed i dont understand how people can hate this film it seems almost cool for people to dislike this film calling it cheesey and corny when it simply isnt i rewatched the other day and loved it just as much as ever the brewing romance between dicaprio and winslett the illfated attempt to make the famous and the social issues between lower class and upper class peopleits understandable to see why this film was so expensivebut i dont care because it pulled it off james cameron worked a miracle with this film and truly deserves every bit of credit and more there is almost nothing bad i can say about this film except for the fact that the whole chase and shoot whilst boat is sinking was a little bit too far fetchedbut hey its only a film and it was still good entertainmentif you havent seen the film please ignore the hate buzz around and watch it you will enjoy it910,sad
i must say this is the greatest movie like ever made i wont spoil by saying anything but yeah its pretty darn awesome if you have not seen it i highly recommend itlook for it on tv or go to a movie store and get it or borrow it from a friend like i said best movie ever made i really have never seen a better movie in my life for people who love a good love story this movie is for youit has amazing graphics witch is a plus to this sweet moviei would rate it 100 out of 100 if you think im obsessing over it just see it for your self then come back i can not say it enough the best movie ever made i highly recommend it to anyone over the age of 12 or 13,sad
before this film the director james cameron was best known for action thrillers such as terminator aliens the abyss and true lies  all of which delivered the goods for action fans after sitting through however i think he should have stayed with the true actionthriller genre because when you mix genres you can get mixed results and in this case it showsthe story of the is well known an unsinkable ship sinks on its maiden voyage from southampton to new york in 1912 with most of the male passengers dying cameron using the technical wizardry hed perfected in his earlier works made you feel as though you were actually there instead of being a mere spectator the special effects are truly stunning for action fans that aspect of the film is relatively brief however because the bulk of the film and the very contrived plot are more concerned with the recovery of a fabulous jewel  a symbol of love  from the existing wreck left there by the heroine rose kate winslet with her all too brief lover jack leonardo dicaprio who perishes as the ship sinks how the two lovers come together in the film and how the jewel comes to have so much significance forms the basis of the plot the details of the subplot  the actual events leading to and including the sinking  are mere props to the overall story of first love the metaphor is thus complete  as the ship sinks on its first voyage so also first love sinksall of that is explored in flashback as a burgeoning love between two people who would not otherwise have met anytime anywhere else so the actual loss of the is in that sense incidental to the greater loss suffered by each and every person who lost a loved one in that tragedy to that extent the film succeeds in its presentation but only because of the calibre of the acting as an account of the tragedy of the however its a misnomer and a failure while as entertaining escapism  well as the saying goes  nothing succeeds like excessto find out how the tragic event actually happened youd be better off getting a copy of a night to remember 1958 from your video store instead,sad
seems like a split movie on one hand there is the implausible and badly scripted romance between the fictional characters jack and rose on the other hand it is a spectacular retelling of the story of the worlds most famous shipwreck whether you like this movie or not depends on which half you focus onthe bad the scripting is very bad there are many many lines which cause me to groan and wince the dialogue comes off as stilted and oftentimes an annoying stereotype of 1912 speech the fictional characters are annoying and unlikeable the whole film seems to have a leftwing antifirstclass bias where only the poor can actually feel love and the rich are simply snobs trying to oneup each other never mind how many real first class couples had much deeper love for each other than jack and roses fairytale relationship there are some very disrespectful scenes in here that have little grounding in history officer lightoller is portrayed as hysterical and unstable officer murdoch is made to shoot two passengers before killing himself the films score is often repetitive and bombastic the heaven scene comes off as very contrivedthe good the movie is spectacular to see buffs will love to see how good and accurate the large scale model of the ship looks thomas andrews and bruce ismay are portrayed very well by victor garbor and jonathan hyde the sinking scenes are quite accurate and show the violence of the event very well one feels very sorry for the passengers because of the horrors that they suffered the special effects look very good even the cgi the underwater photos of the wreck in the beginning are very beautiful and cameron would go on to do some very important research with his submersibles after this film in the end this film generated a lot of interest in the story of theverdict the itself is the real star of the film focus on that and you should enjoy it,sad
i try to like the movie i really tried i watched it as least 3 times i just cant find myself liking it i just dont find it a as a great movie that can win 11 nomination i mean i like the gone with wind froset gump and saving pivate ryanetc but titianic man its not touchy to me as to some of you girls i guess im just not compassion enough it meanly became popular because of the media advertisement and all the positive review i think the movie only attracts woman to see it because of love story guys go to see simply because kate winslet was totally naked in it the digital effect its not like mind blowing or anything its only a film set that fills with water and sunk a big prop ship jesus how could that be the best visual effect,sad
well after watching this movie a few times a think this movie is one of the worst movies ive seen here is why some many people made it controversial it was a huge and horrible event so people said hey this movie has it all naked people fabritzios dying gaint ships sinking and last but not least the two words jack and rose i accually counted how many times those word were said it was 143 for god sakes james cameron you used those words more than the vowel i but in the end this movie was awful 4 million dollars on nothing i mean lets look at night of the living dead that was the best movie i have ever seen that was a 6k movie james could of donated the money to the poor instead of making the shitty movie,sad
it is truly regrettable that is not in the the top 250i think this is mainly due to the fact that it was so successfulas the biggest grossing movie of all time it is a big target of those who think that nothing could deserve such commercial successi saw it for the first time when it first came out on the big screen and 3 hours later i left the theatre literally blown awayi have sen it a few times since and my experience has been pretty much the samei felt that i had seen a great classicpeople have a problem with romancewell the romantic story is the heart of this film much as it was with the all time favourite of many none other than casablancafor mejames cameron achieved the impossible he was able to convince you that you had witnessed the sinking of that gigantic shipthe acting contrary to the opinions of somewas finehave there been better acting performances on screen sure there have been but i dont see oliviers version of hamlet on the top listfor me the story telling was excellent not just in terms of the love relation between winsett and dicaprio but also how it adressed the notions of class distinction as well as mans arrogance as far as the forces of nature are concernedi gave this film a 10 and am not ashamed to admit it,sad
i guess people love romance and melodrama i found that this movie would only appeal to prepubescent girls with a storybook notion of romance and loveydovey mush this movie is one of the most highly overrated in movie history if only because it is the most successful film ever made and the critics seem to sing with the choir of the global audience that paid over 1 billion to watch it the love story is as i said pure mush with a cardboard yet effeminate villain played by billy zane the story itself is a flimsy framework to show off the grand effect of the giant ship snapping to pieces and drowning doomed computeranimated passengers the celine dion song for this is atrocious it polluted the airwaves for much of 1997 and is just as sickening as this film the characters are bland and uncompelling the story slow and plodding and the special effects are the only reason to enjoy this moviethis movie belongs with the likes of any of those mushy 1980s romance or romantic comedy sort of films for those who like melodrama you may like most guys will want to pass on this film unless your girlfriends force you to watch against your own will i personally found the story of the mexican props crew who built the pseudoto be far far far more compelling than the sappy love story between jack and rose,sad
i first saw this movie when i was 5 the special effects were amazingbased just on them i would have given the movie a ten out of ten the thing that was pretty much horrible was the actingdont get me wrongkates acting was the bestbut leo was how did he say it orrible i have seen him do so much better than that his dialog was cheesy he had no emotion and to top it all off he didnt make the character his own it was pretty much what a high budget fast paced actionchick flick was about glizt and sparkle trying to cover up bad acting but lets be fair its so i give it  out of ,sad
when i was in the third grade i learned about the the moment after i first heard of it i immediately got interested in it then awhile later i heard of the movie i wanted to see it so i rented it and watched it with my parents they already saw it so i knew how it ended and when it was done i was crying im 15 right now and when i see it i still at times hold back tears i couldnt imagine anyone who wouldnt be touched by this the plot is excellent the actors play the roles very well and the special effects are excellent it also shows that the disaster could have been less tragic if they put more lifeboats and put more people in them this is a film which is a defenet mustsee film,sad
ok so its been 10 years and i still havent seen a movie that beats from the sad romance to the actual horror of the sinking ship it is definitely the best what makes this such a great movie is the different geners there is a love story that many teenage girls might like and action that may take the interest of many guys who ever you may be theres always a part in the movie that anybody would like but it all fits with the love story between rose and jack many people love to hate this film but it doesnt make it a bad movie the box office number says it all yes there are people that say otherwise but there are still many people that still enjoy watching the movie i myself probably watch it once every two weeks yeah its a lot but what could i say it never gets old and every time i watch it it gives me the same feeling it always has as if its the first time ive ever seen it its definitely timeless no matter what people say and im pretty sure there are many who agree with me defintaly a classic 1010,sad
i love this film so much its so moving and powerful i cry every time i see it if you love like i do check out wwwyoutubecom and search for two an amazing trailer is on there for the socalled sequel to the film sadly the trailer is only a compilation of different clips from different leonardo dicaprio cant spell sorry movies as a fan i really want this film to be made i no its sad and it might ruin the original film but after seeing the trailer im so curious people whove seen the trailer have actually suggested it to be put forward to producers to be made check it out and see if you agree,sad
the is one of those films you have to seeno doubt it is very popular and the love story between rose and jack is touching dont get me wrong however i found the setting for the love story rather disturbingthe focus on the love story seemed to trivialise the death of hundreds of passengers i know that certain characters died but at the end of the day it was a tragic version of the romeo and julietesquire forbidden love that almost made light of a tragedyon a side note i found it laughable for all those people who didnt want to know the ending the ship sinks,sad
well i think it is about time that i commented on one of my alltime favourite films i have wanted to express my appreciation for this film for a long time and i think that today the 94th anniversary of the tragedy is an appropriate time to do iti first saw this film on april 22nd 1998 i wasnt expecting very muchafter all you know how it endsthe ship sinks but wowi was absolutely blown away by i literally could not think of anything else for weeks on end such was the effect it had on me in short awakened my interest in cinemathe film is presented as a love story between jack dicaprio and rose winslet jack is a poor steerage passenger and his character represents the least likely group of people to survive the disaster rose is a wealthy firstclass passenger and she represents those most likely to survive the disaster they fall in love against the odds and although some people find their story corny i found it incredibly touchingthe acting is excellent throughout kate winslet is a revelation as the feisty heroine and leo dicaprio is perfect as jack the winsome ray of sunshine the real standout performance for me was that of victor garber as thomas andrews the shipbuilderhis final scenes are truly heartbreaking also worth noting is the wonderful cinematography the beautiful historicallyaccurate costumes and james horners fantastic soundtrack and of course celine dion and my heart will go oni will admit that this is not a film for the cynical it is not your typical noisy disaster moviethe overriding message of is that selfsacrifice is noble and that true love can conquer all even death i cannot describe how emotional the ending isrose makes a promise to jack and she keeps itthe ending at the top of the stairs isgulpim going to start crying now a fine tribute to all those who died aboard the great ship on april 15 1912 thank you james cameron,sad
one of the worlds most remarkable movies ever its a 1010 movie the performances in the movie are some of the best ever the film is so remarkable theres not enough to say about this modern day masterpiece the work the special effects of this film are the best seen in film history deserved all and everyone of those 11 oscars the most ever won by a film in decades it was the worlds most expensive movie in film history and grossing the most money ever almost 2 billion worldwide the craftsmanship of the was outstanding i was very impressed on how the was built for the film the extras in the film were so amazing you definitely would of believed it was real since of the real sinking in 1912 three films have been made over the decades and they were called  1953 a night to remember 1958 and 1997 the film made in 1997 stacks such higher than the other two you definitely have to see this film on a big screen would be outstanding the performances the effects the emotions every aspect of the film are outstanding 101 quality excellent work from james cameron leoardo dicaprio and kate winslet the best film of all time 1010,sad
reading the previous reviews convinced me to write myself one a 7 is too low maybe going to watch this you expect to see only the tragedy because people by definition love them the love story and the humor are not the main pattern in this movie but the line cannot be followed unless there is a intrigue the effects are good for 1997could been a bit better in my opinionwhat really amazes in this movie is the greatness and the magnificence in everything is on the superlative we must give the man credit for that the presentation of each character along with their drama puts you right there and that is what a movie must do go see it is a classic already and i guarantee you that you will forget for a couple of hours of your problems ,sad
i already knew that jack was going to die before i saw the movie cause somebody told me but i was on the edge of my seat thinking he is going to make iti still cried this movie is the best ive ever seen its not just a typical love story if it were jack would of lived and cal would of died it would of been just another happy ever after but no its the most beautiful love story i have ever seen jack cared so much for rose he loved her so much thats what made most of us crytheres not always a happy ending thats life real life not just another movie it has so much emotion evertime i watch it i cry during the flying seen cause i know whats going to happen jack helped rose showed her things and made life better for her dont you agree with methis is a great movie cause it has a lot of life lessons in it such asthings like diamonds dont matter people do,sad
collide with destinystory two fictional characters put in place of one of the most memorable stories cameroon failed to combine the true story with the fairy tale relation of two characters the actual ship was more of a back up character during the entire film replaced by a sloppy love story that did not interest cameroon his passion was the ship only but he wasnt totally dumb he had the smarts to know what would draw an audiencecharacters jack and rose left in the mist of real character building to focus more toward the ship ironically the main characters seemed to be placed in front when it came to the actual screening instead of the focus on the ship itself creating a ugly mixmash of fiction to realityromance not a single true romantic moment went on during the course of their 24 hour relationship aside from when they meet all there was to it is a poor example of what we call true love jack and rose go dancing underdeck fine but not true romance jack gives rose spitting lessons gross and not romantic pose nude in front of one another erotic and childish so not romantic the final hours of their short wasted relationship is spent by running around the ship and having sex immature childish certainly not romantic finally after all theyve been through he gives his life to save her after all that there was not one memorable moment of their puppy loveall in all this was a dumb film that took two poorly separate stories and fit them into place with pieces in the wrong place and some missing from the entire picturedicaprio and winslet i can hardly blame their performances were well acted it was really all cameroons fault you disappoint me dude12 stars1997 rated r for some sexuality violent images and brief language,sad
i saw the film at 1997 when i was only 14 years oldmuch advertisement such as the most money paid on the epic productionanda touching love moviewas propagandized everywherethat made me tantalizing to see itas a resulti liked it very much and moved by it after appreciating the film as most people in the world maybe you think that i was only a boy thento tell you the truth that 8 years lateri still think it an excellent film although somebody think it notmaybe this love story looks not relative to our real lifebut it wont conceal that the musicspecial effect and picture are outstanding even much better than the ones nowi have seen the film only once despite many peoples several times and i still love it as one of my best favorite movies,sad
yes i actually saw this film 22 times on the big screen and many times on vhsdvd people like to joke that i can lip sync most of the script and they are probably right on that scoremost of the real beauty of the film lies in its accurate setscamerons is the most accurate movie to date it looks as if you are on the ship herself the take her to sea mr murdoch sequence is absolutely breathtakingseeing those engines start to turn faster and faster and faster and the sound track with made it sound as if they were saying fullahead fullahead fullahead was mindblowing i didnt think the love story all that plausiblenot with the strict class segregation of the age jack would have been able to attend church service on sunday in fact it was a ritual for people from second and third class to attend the service and was called going up the ship i do not believe however that he would have ended up at a first class table and especially not one where jbruce ismay was diningmy main demerits to this movie would be in reference to the actors and script sounding way too 90s so what are you an artist or something dunno doesnt sound all that 1912 to me but if you can get past the love story and the attempt to make characters living in 1912 sounds as if it was 1997 then i think you will enjoy camerons,sad
it was brave of james cameron to attempt an undertaking on this scale making the worlds most expensive movie ever is always to tempt fate the film which had previously held that distinction the kevin costner vanity project waterworld had been a disaster in both financial and artistic terms even before was finished rumours were circulating that it would be equally disastrous the critics began preparing their sinking ship metaphors in anticipation of its failurein the event of course the critics were confounded the film was a great success both at the box office and with the academy who awarded it eleven oscars including best picture and best director it became the most talkedabout film of 1997 eight years on there have been other films on a similar epic scale and some of the excitement it provoked has died away nevertheless even today it stands out as a fine achievementcombines two quite different genres the disaster movie and the heritage costume drama the late nineties saw a modest revival of the disaster picture that quintessentially seventies genre with twister in 1996 and dantes peak and volcano the following year cameron took the basic formula for such films and applied it to a real historical event making a film on a grand scale with lavish attention to period detail the real sinking had a number of features which fitted the genre it is something of a convention of disaster movies that the disaster should be caused or at least exacerbated by the incompetence or complacency of those in authority an element emphasised here bruce ismay the chairman of the white star line proudly proclaims the ship unsinkable then causes the disaster by urging the captain to steam at top speed through an icefield to make matters worse the company have neglected to provide sufficient lifeboats for all on boardcameron also imported into the film some of the conventions of heritage cinema that genre has often been used to examine the british class system often in films which feature romances between individuals from different social backgrounds such as loseys the gobetween or merchantivory productions like howards end cameron takes the same concept and uses the film to examine the historical roots of the american class system of which the ship with its first second and third class passengers is a microcosm intertwined with the story of the tragedy is the story of the romance between rose dewitt bukater daughter of an aristocratic philadelphia family and jack dawson a struggling artist from a workingclass backgroundthe america that we see is not as is sometimes said a classless society nor even one where class is solely determined by wealth the dewitt bukaters for all their oldmoney pretensions are in financial difficulties and roses late father died heavily in debt roses mother ruth sees that the only way to maintain the familys social status will be if rose makes a good marriage to a wealthy man and a seemingly ideal candidate has presented himself in the shape of cal hockley the son of a nouveauriche industrialist unfortunately cal is an arrogant selfish snob and rose cannot bear the thought of marriage to him she considers suicide by throwing herself off the ship but is dissuaded from doing so by jack and the two fall in lovesome have criticised the film for concentrating on the romance of jack and rose arguing that this focus is somehow demeaning to a reallife tragedy in which over a thousand people died this is not a criticism with which i would agree it would clearly have been impossible to tell the personal stories of all those who died camerons aim was to put the disaster into context and heighten its impact by giving us two characters we can care about and to make their story representative of the stories of all those caught up in the drama thus heightening the films emotional impactthe film has a number of weaknesses the liberties taken with historical accuracy such as the denigration of the character of william murdoch who in real life died bravely can sometimes seem offensive the opening scenes and closing which deal with the attempts of a modern salvage team to recover from the wreck a valuable jewel given by cal to rose were possibly unnecessary and certainly overlong and could easily have been pruned the acting is not always very good i was less than impressed by leonardo di caprio as jack in fairness it must be said that he has greatly improved as an actor since 1997 having given a good performance in catch me if you can and an excellent one in the aviator kate winslet as rose was better although even she fell short of the brilliance she had shown in heavenly creaturesthe weaknesses are however greatly outweighed by the films strengths a special mention must go to james horners evocative score and celine dions song my heart will go on there are a number of good performances in minor roles from kathy bates as molly brown shunned as vulgar by her fellow firstclass passengers but more goodhearted than any of them bernard hill as captain smith a decent man but without the strength of character to stand up to ismays bullying and frances fisher as ruth a woman who puts her social status ahead of her daughters happiness in the end however this is not a film one watches for the acting i would agree with the reviewer who said that the real star is neither kate nor leo but rather the great ship itself particularly during the spectacular scenes after it hits the iceberg the success of gave hollywood back the selfconfidence to make pictures on a grand scale with daring energy and imagination leading to recent epics such as gladiator and troy 810,sad
without doubt one of the greatest motion picture movies ever about one of the greatest disasters in history it is the present day and obsessive architect brock lovett bill paxton is with his deep dive underwater crew just above the dormant wreck of the for three years lovett has been searching for a blue diamond that belonged to a passenger but when he finds the safe and it is brought to surface he is devastated to discover artistic drawing of a beautiful young woman but no jewels meanwhile miles away an elderly woman gloria stewart sits at a table pottering when she sees the lovett news report her name is rose calvert rose immediately calls brock identifying herself as the woman in the picture and within days she joins the lovett crew she tells them all of her journey on the and love affair that changed her life bringing the past vividly back to life april 1912 and on the docks at southampton people from all nations look as the world famous cruiser sets sail on her maiden voyage on board in one of the most exclusive staterooms is the privileged and beautiful rose dewitt bukater kate winslet spoilt and suicidally depressed her world is thrown into turmoil when a handsome stranger jack dawson leonardo di caprio from the third class saves her life against all social standings and rules rose and jack embark on passionate affair that seemed doomed from the first kiss and as danger approaches in different ways rose and jack and the passengers on the unsinkable ship face a furious battle for survival the winner of 11 oscars is the one great movie that allows the world to recreate the class beauty and horror that took place early on in the morning on april 15 1912,sad
this is a brilliant movie it put life back into the classic and it made sure the was not forgotten it felt comforting for those viewers who appreciate the finer things in life i think that those who dont appreciate this film dont appreciate the true value of life and thats love the actors leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet acted the love beautifully and made it seem like a wonderful and natural thing and made some viewers want to have that kind of love although some are afraid to admit it the actors made the love believable and it was truly inspiring to watch this film is truly the best one ive ever seen and it is great for those viewers who are emotional and want to watch a tear jerker,sad
the best selling film at the world wide box office has a really bad rating on this website agreed this film is not to everyones taste but neither is casablanca the main fault of and why it is rated lower than casablanca is that more people have seen thus with its split opinion the film is destined to appear on top 100 shows on tv but will suffer when it comes to ratings of this kind the performances are excellent and every dollar of cameronsbudget is up there on screenand for once there is an engaging storyline to accompany the sinking ship the most notable performance is billy zanes performance as we all grit our teeth watching him as the snob villain of the piece the event that everyone waits for does not disappoint but the main reason why deserves its place on the top 250 is because the storyline that accompanies it is brilliant theres my two cents,sad
i am a big leo fan and to tell you the truth half the reason i went to see the movie in the first place was because he was in it but now that i have seen it it doesnt really matter that hes in it i mean dont get me wrong he was absolutely fantastic in this movie but its good no matter what and i will give james cameron major props bravo i thought this movie was a major tearjerker i cried most at the very end where it shows rose an old woman warm in her bed and its showing all of her pics and i thought it was so sad when it showed the pic of her riding sidesaddle like he was gonna show her on the surf and there were roller coasters behind her remember they talked about riding on them until they threw uploli guess the reason i thought it was so sad was because she kept her promise to him for all those years i mean she survived and went on even when it seemed hopeless she had babies and she died an old woman warm in her bed i think it is one of the best movies i have ever seen its number one on my favorites list,sad
i enjoyed this movie and thought it was real good for the price of the movie ticket and dvd a treasure hunter is looking for a diamond he finds a drawing of a girl with the diamond it is shown on the news and an old lady calls up claiming to be the woman in the drawing she is asked to come to the ship to help with the search however she tells her side of the story of what really happened she was rose a young girl that felt trapped inside her own world because she is being forced to marry a rich guy she meets a third class guy named jack dawson they fall in love while being separated by roses mother and cal sounds like a cow to me while all the chaos happens the ship hits the iceberg i believe you know the rest of the story,sad
very few movies have been able to move me as much time and time again as this one has this movie is the only movie that has the ability to make me cry every single time that i watch it is a tale of love and disaster all in one the irony of it is that rose saw as a slave ship yet she found jack who allowed her to break free and pursue her dreams finding jack on the ship changed roses life she did all of the things that jack and her had talked about doing which she probably would not have done if she hadnt of met him this movie shows that those that you have loved do live on inside of you forever and rose lived on for both herself and jack doing for both of them what they had only talked about doing is truly one of the greatest films i believe a piece of cinema that should be cherished,sad
hey i loved this movieactress kate winslet was superb in this movie i absolutely loved her role as roseomg and leos roll as jack dawson was so cool i loved this movie as a whole i own it and i would die if something ever happened to the disc its awesome i thought the mother of rose was all about having fine things and the only way to live is by having the very best and being better then all and not conversing with other below you oh and the fianc of rose was just omg i dont know how to explain what i thought of him anyways ya and thats why i gave this movie a 10 rating because no matter what anyone else saysnobody can persuade me to change my mind about this movie,sad
this movie is fantastic everything is just about perfect leo was a fantastic jack dawson leo made the character so believable kate winslet was fantastic you could always feel her emotions sad angry happy scared etc she brings such a powerful performance it leaves you speechless to save space i will just say that not one of the characters in this movie was unbelievable fantastic cast the special features are amazing if the ship is about to leave port you feel as though you are actually watching the leave port in the massive waving crowd i know this has been said before but i must say it again you truly feel like you are on the the script is extremely fantastic and unpredictable i want to just say thanks thanks to the cast for all of their outstanding performances thanks to the people that cast the cast thanks to all of the crew and anyone that helped in any way to make this film possible thanks to james cameron for writing producing directing etc this fantastic film if you have not yet seen this film i recommend you rush to your local videostore and watch it it will leave you speechless you will wonder how you ever went through life without seeing this incredible superb film,sad
is the fictional love tale of a rich girl and a poor boy falling in love on the unsinkable ship destined for new york city from europe jack dawson leonardo dicaprio is a poor boy living in europe well just sort of hanging out in europe in 1912 outside the bar he hangs in the largest ship ever built the is being set to sail after winning an unbelievable card hand he wins a ticket aboard and to americawhile jack camps out on the 3rd level rose bukater kate winslet is spending some rough time on the 1st level while jack spends his night on the deck rosw rushes past him ready to jump off the boat and to her death jack convinces her not to jump and the two begin to spend some time together and slowly fall in love but as the days slowly tick away an unknown obstruction stands in front of ship just a few miles ahead one obstruction that would set the ship into historythe film beautifully shot and wonderfully acting the love story is better then most instead of two kids just meeting and having sex that night cameron took time to let both jack and rose develop and progress into the relationship the dialog between the two flows easily and the love connection is strong and wellportrayed the special effects are a bit overwhelming especially when the ship is sinking my only fault with the film is its length i dont have a problem when a film extends 3 hours when necessary but this extending 3 was unnecessary too many scenes are shown of billy zane running around and could have been edited out other than that the film is perfect the story is told with great detail and flows less like a history lesson and more like a love story the film is quite gripping and overwhelming at some parts but is wellworth seeingstarring leonardo dicaprio kate winslet billy zane kathy bates and gloria stuart4 12 out of 5 stars,sad
i do believe that is a fantastic movie and if i do say so 1 of the best the way james cameron has done all this is absolutely amazing and i give him full marks for an award winning film and sad as it is with the loss of all the people on board that doom stricken ship the way he displayed it was immense and some members of my family were aboard that ship and i absolutely love the film because the romance shows that not even a ship that was doomed could break there relationship and it proves the real fact true love never dies the graphics dont look fake and basically everything looks realistic and so life like i have recommended a lot of films in my time and i may only be 13 but i would have loved to see this movie in the cinemas 1010,sad
the irish plans to tow an iceberg to belfast to commemorate the making of the seems a good enough reason to write a review of this movieso here is the spoiler of this review they build this big ship they think it is unsinkable it hits an icebergs and sinks other breaking news the earth is round christopher columbus fails to get to india but discovers americathe true genius of this film is that it understands that movies take us to another place that we could not normally go but where we have a desire either openly or secretly to venturewe have all heard of the and how it sank but do we really know what it would be like to be there in the ruddy north atlantic as the largest and safest ship sinks beneath you james cameron uses two methods to make this come alive firstly and the most obvious are the sets and special effects a full size tiltable and cgi even though the cgi looks look computer graphics it is good enough to mean we dont really need to worry about it i am sure in a few years they will run the computer models through better software and knock out a better print so fans can buy the experience all over againthe other technique is to create 2 fictitious characters that we care about who he put anywhere he wants during the sinking process so that we can really feel what is happening and meet many real people and see their storiesthe movie is 3 hours long but once the starts sinking you become involved in that part of the story as if it is a story starting afresh and your attention doesnt waver from that moment onoverblown pretentious film making that won the oscar because that is what american films want to be however it remains highly entertaining,sad
i would like to express my feeling after seeing this great film actually there is no other film that i have seen taking this much concentration and feeling i saw this film 12 or 13 times i liked it very much and most thing i noticed that in every frame not only the important part is highlighted but all the other minor things also all the actors and actresses have made their part very beautiful many of my friends have seen this film jack and rose acted in a realistic wayalso it has a famous background of the great accident of ship the ship of dreams i would like also to thank the all workers behind the picture who made it a real one,sad
i finally saw when it was on network television last week i had been avoiding it because i didnt think i would like it i hadnt liked any of james camerons other films and i didnt think i would be able to make it through the entire 3 hours the first half was like a merchantivory production and it was much better than i expected the second half was basically a remake of the poseidon adventure and it was pretty much what i expectedmy favorite part of the film did not involve any of the lead characters it was when the boat was about to sink and the string quartet had finished their last piece of music they said their goodbyes and started walking away then the violinist started playing solo the other members came back and joined him this part of the film showed that the musicians knew they had nowhere else to go because they were going to die while most of the other passengers were panicking the musicians chose to die doing what they loved mostthat one touching scene made the movie worthwhile for me while i dont consider it a great film and it is way too long it is much better than i ever thought james cameron was capable of 710,sad
the topic of this movie has been played out completely and i think this version was way too long for the silver screen because cameron dressed this film up too much much of the romance in the movie was too predictable and almost scripted i couldnt find a bigger reason to why this film was made because it was a big budget production with very little acting talent in it i think leonardo dicaprio was better off playing the leading man in a film that didnt consist of him playing some bum who falls in love with the rich girl role hes got much more talent for other acting genres than this movie i didnt find much going on with his leading lady kate winslet because she sounded very plain since giving it was a periodical piece i loved the costumes but some of the acting was not properly matched for the caliber of the film,sad
the tale of the doomed ocean liner remains continually ripe for cinematic exploration  films series and documentaries continue to abound on this most famous tragedy  encompassed within the simple tale of the demise of an unsinkable ship is a story of intense tragedy over 1500 lives were lost social divide the richpoor gap was highlighted here when the first class passengers were the first on the lifeboats leaving many in steerage to die and most of all of mans arrogance and opportunism overwhelmed by the forces of natureif anyone could bring this tale into 21st century when it was only 1997 it had to be james cameron  cameron had the technical experience and flair necessary to build and sink the onscreen  sex and violence are par for the course in almost every action movie but like his special effects cameron inventively works these elements to make them serve his storyso it is with where he uses a pair of doomed starstruck lovers as a focal point for the audience to empathise and relate to the passengers on the ship  the film begins in the present day where a diamondhunting mercenary brock lovett cameron regular bill paxton stumbles on a picture of a nude young woman wearing the diamond he is trying to locate  lovett is shocked when a very old lady gloria stuart identifies herself as the woman in the picture  she comes aboard his vessel and relates to him and his team her experiences oncut back to 1912 and rose dewitt bukater kate winslet boards the ocean liner a sullen rich young woman  shes being pushed by her mother frances fisher into a loveless marriage with cal hockley billy zane a vain selfcentred tycoon  the deadening misery of her life leads her to attempt suicide but encounters jack dawson leonardo dicaprio a penniless artist who won his ticket in a poker game  he saves her life and they fall in love but despite all their efforts the affair cannot last  especially when the ship strikes an iceberg and with not enough lifeboats its a race for survivalcameron is especially keen on highlighting the class divide between rich and poor on  the rich are shown as staid selfcentred and repressed caring only about their money and their social status  by contrast the poor are shown as lively honest downtoearth and fun  the depiction is crudely stereotypical but it works in favour of the story  when theyre locked below decks during the ships sinking you empathize with them and want them to get out  once the iceberg is sighted no shot is wasted in cranking up the tension every aspect of the ships sinking is seen from the initial iceberg impact to the flooding corridors the ondeck chaos as passengers struggle to board the lifeboats to the grand final sinking  cameron further shows the aftermath of the sinking with hundreds of survivors screaming and thrashing in the water as they slowly freeze to death  all this works through superlative cinematography special effects editing all underlined by james horners worthy music score  the human element is not lost amid the action  leonardo dicaprio is not roughandready enough to really convince as a seenitall poor boy but makes a good go of it and is well partnered with kate winslet who makes for a buxom comely rose  billy zane as cal and david warner as his manservant make for slick hateable villains and frances fisher brings roses mother a step up from simple caricaturethe fictional characters blend in well with the real passengers all of whom dont possess much depth but are still very well acted  standouts include jonathan hyde as the opportunistic ismay kathy bates as molly brown and victor garber as the ships sympathetic architectwhen the film returns to the present you really do feel as though you were on and its hard to suppress a tear at the misty dreamlike finaleepic and unforgettable,sad
if you want to see a good movie over the sinking see a night to remember1958 yes i know it is in black and white that is called an old movie today that is called a cinematic effect ala raging bull or schiendlers list if you want to see the best movie over the sinking of the splice the special effects from into a night to remember there is a reason that no one won oscars for acting in this movie they stunk up the screen my wife and i waited for months before seeing this movie so we wouldnt have to wade through the throngs of 13 year girls crying for the 20th time over leos dramatic death scene i wonder why you have really seen him in anything lately that is worth paying 7 to 10 dollars for including that campy little film catch me if you can,sad
is the sort of movie that you cannot critisize without mentioning its good parts and cannot praise without recalling its dire ones in many ways it is very reminiscent of the oldstyle hollywood romances epic in length enourmous in budget and popularity weak in the eyes of some of its more critical viewers and fast destined for a high place in the most famous films of all timerose kate winslet a young beautiful upperclass and miserable passenger on the famously unsinkable ship perhaps at this moment it would be good to point out that infact contrary to popular belief was never in reality marketted as the unsinkable ship ahem however is disullsioned with life bearing this in mind she makes a trip one evening to the stern i think of the climbs the railings and prepares to jump into the freezing cold waters of the ocean below as she prepares herself to jump she is spotted by the equally young and beautiful yet poor and freespirited artist jack leonardo dicaprio who manages to persuade her not to jump and thus begins a beautiful friendship between the two much to the distress and dissaproval of roses friends and family suprise suprise the relationship soon develops into sometihng more and they become lovers just as their passionate love affair reaches steamy heights the two become caught up inevitably in the ships sinking and one of the greatest distaster sequences ever ever filmed commences in the films last hour full of horror tragedy and terrible reality the first two hours driven by concentrated on and revolving around the romantic love affair between rose and jack are clunking and thin the script while perhaps not dire is certainly no masterpiece written by the director james cameron rather too full of cliche and annoyingly unsubtle messages designed perhaps to appeal to camerons conception of a modern audiences tastes rose somewhat unconvincingly for the daughter of a conservative upperclass english society family is an avid reader of freud and waxes lyrical about piccasso its like looking into a dream or something theres truth but no logicthis is perhaps too hard some moments in these first two hours are lovely i know that i might sound like a jackass for saying so but in one of the truly iconic moments of romantic beauty that this movie or indeed any movie has to offer what young girl was not lifted out of her cinema seat by that soaring beautiful shot of the lovers at the ships helm i think lol at sunset dicaprio a vastly underrated actor and this movie might have something to do with that as the inspired and inspirational young free spirit is at his most beautiful boyish best and manages to inject energy and charisma into a character who is sadly lacking in depth dont get me wrong i loved him in this movie being the hopeless romantic teenage girl i am winslet another wonderful actress is doing her best in her own role but this is a more tricky one to make work rose is a character that makes a transition from buttoned up serious posh spoilt brat as jack names her to impulsive adventurous and sexually liberated young rebel chick there is nothing wrong with this of course but the fact that even if we want to applaud her we find her character extremely difficult to warm to let alone grow to like or love this has however probably never been a hinderance to what turned out to be definately a teen girls movie who was concentrating on kate when we have leo to look at other major characters include roses angry idiotic and completely villainous fiancee cal who is determined to control rose in a way written to make any self respecting feminists sight turn red with rage billy zane plays the role in what i think is irony and humour but the character is so poorly constructed that even if this is so his turn is far too broad and characturish rather than a real performance of any kind also there is roses mother im not sure of the actresss name another shameful steriotype after watching this i soon seriously started doubting if james camerons writing skills could ever possibly extend beyond borrowing a tragic historic event and placing a collection of cliches to bounce and react off one another in a ridiculous way this time of the cold distant and selfish mother with little thought or feeling for others and who is mainly motivated by money and rich husbandsits no wonder rose was about to commit suicide when placed in such companyhowever this movie truly comes into its own in when as i mentioned events reach their penultimate inevitable conclusion and that fateful night that the collided with the iceberg in a gripping heart wrenching hour long sequence the love story finally takes back seat and cameron paints a portrait of the last few hours above water indeed this movie is well well well worth watching if only for this ending i have never met someone who wasnt movied to tears by this film however i dont think ive ever met someone who was moved to tears by the love storys tragic conclusion the fact that the enormity horror and tragedy of the sinking actually took place capsizes forgive the allusion the love story which now more than ever feels synthetic fake and trivialno the tears i shed for this film were for the musicians who played nearer my god to thee as the ship sank my tears were for the irish thirdclass woman and her two children as she tucks them into bed for the last time becuase she knows there are no life boats for them my tears were for the old couple who lie in bed together peaceful and ready for death it is in these scenes that the film displays incredible beautiful and tragic humanity and greatness,sad
it amazes me that almost 7 years later this movie gets criticized ok so is the highest grossing film of all time perhaps thats something for people to now criticize it with this movie has appeared in worst movie lists as well as best it seems that you will either like it or hate it nothing inbetween well i love it i remember watching it over and over again when i was 10 1997 the effects of the sinking are incredible for now and 1997i wont forget this movie ever and if you havent seen it you wont either even if you liked it or hated it you will still remember,sad
was simply fantastic by far in my opinion the best movie ever made great actors involved and the effects were out of this worldveryveryvery sad yet wonderful as it recaptures the magic of and deffinatly made the most of it,sad
this was a long expected film and indeed after the previous recent attemptdisaster with catherine zetajones a much needed long expected filmindeed i would go as far to say that only the music and the effects deserved the awards for anything else was only gained through the use of throwing money lots of it at the various areas this is perhaps a classic example of buying ansever oscarshowever this having been said the story is a sound one and is a must see purely for the attempt to retell the actual sinking of the boat which may have been a good film on its own without the storyline for i feel that the storyline made us detach a little from what the real tale should have beenthe acting was not at all terrible though dicaprio was perhaps not at his best winslet however is and the film is made a little better because of iti would give this film a 710 purely for the effects and tale behind the story which in places did not stick to historical accuracy which is professed to do though nothing can actually make us envisage what happened upon that night the film does try but tries a little too hard in places to make thing happen when it does not need to for just sitting back and looking at the screen would have done,sad
when i first saw i was completely blown away it was not what i had expected i only saw it once in the cinema and every viewing since then has been less rewarding the film is by no means perfect it is simplistic it is shallow but it is also extremely well craftednone of the performances are great but this is probably because the actors had such weak dialogue to work with what the film does best is awe the audience with powerful music and images its structure is very tight and clever and for a three hour movie it doesnt drag but as a film about an historical event it is disappointing that the whole thing comes across as superficial and triteeven so when i walked out of the cinema i remember being affected by what i had just seen when i watch the film now it doesnt really do anything for me but part of me wishes it would,sad
i think that one thing about this film that is easily overlooked is that cameron brings us a very accurate and realistic portrayal of the ship itself and the disaster that resulted from negligence of the ships designers and crew  however it is served up in a story that focuses on useless and unrealistic dialogue essentially a generic love story that is written to cater to the masses the film is written such that we see the modern day underwater wreckage at the beginning of the film as much as we may see on a half hour special on the discovery channel then transitions to the past to show us the ship in all of its grandeur  the love story leads to a romp of the ship showing all of the types of passengers their quarters and how they lived aboard the ship during the short trip across the atlantic  cameron also managed to show us all the major parts of the ship including the decks the engine and the storage areas  to weave all of this into the story is a notable accomplishment in itself the film falters in its attempt of a realistic portrayal of attitudes and ideas during the time in which it is set  many ideas and actions that are not true to the time period penetrate the plot as cameron attempts to tell a historic story in a fashion that is tailored for audiences nearly a century later  the result is a more of a fantasy meets documentary than a realistic film people who enjoy the love story tend to proport that this is a good film since there is so much focus on the dicapriowinslet superstar combination however others will overlook the accurate portrayal and the realistic sets and claim that the movie is a waste of tape  although cameron managed to woo love stricken audiences he fell short of reality on the plot,sad
spoilers includedalthough i made a vow to myself to never see this movie my girlfriend begged me to rent it and sit through it with her  so very reluctantly i did  and let me just say was everything i expected  is nothing but an overly sappy unrealistic historically incorrect drawn out trashy film  with all the hype this film received after seeing it i expected to see on imdbs top 250 listbut its not  whew good because it doesnt deserve to be  my god what was the hype about why was this movie 3 hours and 14 minutes  that alone is a big flaw of this film because we all know whats going to happen in the end why let the audience wait 25 hours to see the inevitable  this movie couldve been cropped to 25 easilywhich still maybe wouldve been too long  the corny love story was just horrible  the language used especially by dicaprios character was totally unbelievable and unconvincingwere supposed to be in 1912 remember  kate winslet came off as an annoying little bratdicaprio was barely tolerable  another thing that turned me off to the film was the story  how could people embrace this film so much in its account of the experience and the story is fictional  were supposed to take camerons word for it please  the love story along with the overall script he wrote was sickening  the only good part of the film is when the boat starts to sinkthats the only part of the film that really matters   now my major gripe with the film  what was the deal with rose taking up the whole door  lol  did you all see how big that door was  you mean to tell me that jack couldnt fit on the door with her  she claimed she loved jackeven went back to save him while he was chained to the pipe in that room that was flooding  if that was the case why couldnt she make room for him to get up on the door with her instead of freezing to death in the atlantic im curious whether anyone else has wondered thatthe scene i mentioned above embodies my feelings about  it seems cameron just wanted to get some oscars so he put the formula together to do so  get celine dion to sing da song the sappy score put leo in there so all da little girls would go see it and feel sorry for him have a huge budget use lots of cgi and make it a 3 hour film so it could be an epic of course  it all comes across as cheap  he was trying too hard to appeal to everyoneit has the sappy emotional boohoo aspect for the ladies and the graphic actionpacked death sequences for the guys  in the end we have 3 hours of confusion and essentially pointless narrative  i finally sat through this film and like i knew it would it justified my initial thoughts of it when it first released in 97  corny horrible story and completely overdone  bottom line this movie sucked and has to be the most overrated film ive seen in a long long time maybe ever  12 out of ,sad
only the effects redeem this film from the ultraquashy and sickly love story to the shameless stealing of countless scenes from the vastly superior british film a night to remember this film is a disgrace what was james cameron thinking pishposh perhaps if they rereleased an edited version with the love story cut out and the stolen scenes removed it could be a good film for anyone who likes this film i urge you to see a night to remember 1958 its listed here on imdb check it out,sad
this film was richly undeserving of the best picture oscar in 1997 it wasnt the first film about to win an oscar nor the best there are so many plot holes in this film that even an amateur cinematographer could critique it the historical continuity was horrid the only bright spots in the cast were cate blanchett and bernard fox leonardo dicaprio had yet to grow into a degree of maturity as an actor and delivered a lackluster performance as dawson,sad
surely millions of people worldwide a billion dollars and 11 oscars cant be wrong can they well yes actuallythe problem with is that cameron treats the whole enterprise like one of his action pictures replete with the kind of staging youd expect from that genre but not alas from a dramatisation of a genuine tragedy cameron has no faith in the emotional weight of the historical facts and if we were being cynical we could also say no interest this is an exercise in ego and directorial hubris from the outset namely the idea that the writers fictional teenage romance  a story that never succeeds in rising above its clichd origins is required to connect a contemporary audience to the events of 1912 you can see the logic because clearly the worlds worst peacetime maritime tragedy 1500 dead and the planets most luxurious ocean liner sinking on its maiden voyage isnt an interesting enough story in itself subsequently the titular ship becomes merely a backdrop for a populist voyage into tedium just as youd feel uneasy at the prospect of michael bay doing jane austen cameron doing period romance seems a little far fetched jack and rose allow us to spend some time on the ship prior to its sinking and an impressive recreation it is but youd quite like them to go away so we could see what the real passengers were up to that he sustains momentum throughout this picture is despite his script rather than because of it his talent for pacing and moving a story forward serves him well in this respect but with fictional characters as one note as these and with the ships real passengers reduced to supporting parts to bolster camerons mills and boon narrative we unlike the real passengers are quite grateful to see the iceberg emerging from the watery depthsonce the ship hits the film moves up a gear and suddenly there is enough to sustain interest until the stilted syrup drenched epilogue however cameron still stages the sinking like one giant set piece which saps the film of any emotional impact a real tribute to the ship rather than a cynical exercise in emotional manipulation would have taken an objective position and allowed the real events to unfold giving us a chance to take in the full force of real events this film concerns itself with fiction and doing so attempts to tell you what to feel and when to feel it for me this has the opposite effect and the scenes toward the end featuring winslet and decaprio are virtually unwatchablethe production design is superb and its all very epic and grandiose but ultimately is a disappointment because it takes a real tragedy and turns it into populist entertainment history for people not interested in history if you think thats a harsh assessment then imagine a similar scenario applied to a retelling of the september 11th attacks and think how inappropriate that would seem these people may be 90 odd years dead but they deserve more respectful treatment than this watch a night to remember 1958 for a far better depiction of events which was informed by accounts of the sinking not by one man who thought he had something to add to this terrible event avoid,sad
sometimes when i look up certain movies i simply cant believe my eyes some of the worst movies ive ever seen have been given generally high ratings and vice versa  however when it comes to the users here got it right on the mark  at the time of this writing the users have given the movie an average of 70  not a bad film but certainly not greati wont get into the movie much here as most people have probably seen it already anyway  however i will point out that the area of the movie that i hate the most is the desperate attempt at a love story  it truly was not necessary in a movie like this  well at least not a long drawn out love story anyway  i really got soooo sick of hearing the two main characters yell out each others names during the last hour of the movie  jack rose  jack rose ugh  what a dialogueif you havent seen this movie what rock have you been under the past 6 years i would recommend viewing it  it does have its good moments just beware of forceddownyourthroat dialogue and love stories,sad
was a throwback in a way to the big sweeping hollywood epic no it may not have been the best movie in the year when it won best picture but arguably neither was gone with the wind the year it won and adjusted for inflation gwtw still trounces box office numbersi must confess to a bit of a bias my mother was a buff long before the movie came out and the first time i saw it was with her i knew all the stories  i recognized herbert lightoller the third officer and senior surviving crew member harold bride the assistant marconi operator who sent some of the first if not the very first sos messages and of course maggie brown whom no one called molly until the musical came around long after her death when we saw the movie mom was almost in tears and not in the places where jim cameron intended she told me later that shed seen wellstaged portrayals of the sinking but this was the first time shed seen a convincing vision of it sailing hail cgi the first time i saw the spectacle was so impressive that i didnt notice the wooden dialogue the pointless sideplots the uneven pacing and the limp tinwhistle score that culminated in saints preserve us celine dion over the closing creditsi was awed the first time i saw it on the big screen in the plush theater seats but it loses much of its charm in a second viewing on a threadbare couch with a small screen im tempted to do one of those guerilla editing jobs cut the rosejack business down to a minimum and take the movie down to about two hours  thats something i could watch over and overas it is i have the 43 and widescreen versions of the movie mom was a collector and like many with that affliction strove for completeness one of everything on the rare occasions im tempted to watch it i thump the fastforward button like an epileptic morse code operatorhow great is that depends on your definitions if youre looking for its imact on an uncritical and awed audience its greatness is in line with its box office if youre looking for something that holds up under repeated even compulsive viewing it isnt in the citizen kanecasablanca league,sad
i have to admit i enjoyed billy crystals oscar night parody morethan i enjoyed the film true it does boast some superb visualeffects and the sets are truly remarkable but was this film reallyworth 11 oscars i think not as usual hollywood distorts historicalfact with romantic sideshows and although one cannot help butadmire the effort and expense of the film there has to be more toan epic than high budgets and pretty actors winslet and de capriolook out of place in such a grand design and the subplot of apsychopathic zane intent on dastardly revenge seem to pour wateron what could have been a triumph no pun intended all that wasmissing from his performance was the tweaking of a villainousmoustache disappointing,sad
warning  spoilers right aheadin we have a movie that is spectacular breathtaking beautiful stupid and offensive all at the same time  so you may ask how is this possible  truth be known i enjoyed this movie immensely when i saw it in the theaters  the production is so aweinspiring that upon first viewing one sets aside the stupidity and unlikelihood of the central love story one must admire the workmanship of this film  the set seemed so real  the costumes were gorgeous  the musical score was sympathetic and lovely  special attention was given to detail right down to the hymn sung by the congregation aboard during morning worship  everything about the movie seemed so authentic except for the love between the stars the opening scenes which take place in present day time set up the story beautifully  gloria stuart puts her heart and soul into a very convincing 102yearold rose  she tells the story of her relationship with jack dawson who she met aboard the  during this opening sequence and her interspersed narration throughout the film she convinces us of a deep abiding love between her and jack  but unfortunately we are not so convinced during the 1912 shotsnow on to what was terribly wrong with this movie  first of all the plot is brimming with offensive stereotypes about social classes  according to this movie if you are rich you are automatically callous snotty and well pretty much evil  unless youre new money then youre safe  but if youre poor you are kindhearted talented and ohsobeautiful on the inside  and of course you know how to party  im not even rich and i found this very offensive  what a judgemental statement and at last we arrive at the love story  beautiful rich girl rose is unhappy because she realizes being rich means shell become like her evil gossipy mother  besides shes engaged to marry another rich person who of course is also evil  so she almost throws herself off the bow of the ship when she is saved by kind hearted poor boy jack  miraculously in a whole 24 hours the two fall in love causing rose to run away from her rich evil mother and fiance have sex and then get parted forever when jack freezes to death because the evil rich people took all the life boats  gag because leo dicaprio was cast as jack we can automatically assume this was at least partially aimed at an adolescent audience  so what message did the plot send to teenagers  if youre engaged to someone its totally okay to cheat on your fiance with someone youve known a whole 24 hours  even better its just fine and dandy to sleep with someone you just met i am having difficulty rating this movie because i loved and hated it at the same time,sad
spoilers ah the most expensive movie of all time  and the most overrated lets look at the ingredientsan incredibly trite love story the romance in this film comes off like a dumbeddown version of romeo and juliet but with extra added clichetm as tales of forbidden love go this one is pretty boilerplate and pandering roses fiance is a smarmy twit so we dont mind that she screws around on him  wouldnt want to make the audience uncomfortable or challenge them in any way if you want to see a film with the same sort of forbidden love scenario but with exponentially better execution you just have to look at the previous years best picture recipient  the english patientincredibly dull performance by the lead actors honestly ive seen high school productions of romeo and juliet where the leads made you care more about the characters than winslet and dicaprio do in in fact the best performances of the film come from the supporting cast  especially kathy bates billy zane and james warner at least neither of the leads won oscarsjust plain annoying story perhaps the most irritating part of this film is the endless scenes at least they felt endless sequence where rose rescues jack and theyre trying to escape from the bowels of the ship and what happens next jack dies when i saw this in theaters there were people crying at this point  but all i could think about was how pointless the previous sequence was cameron just wasted 25 minutes showing us their harrowing escape when hes just gonna die 5 minutes laterthe only saving grace of this film are the visual effects but as george lucas has proven no amount of cgi eyecandy can make a mediocre film goodthat was ever made is proof of the low opinion mainstream film makers have of their audiences intelligence and success is proof that that low opinion is justified,sad
its really nothing special the first half of the film is incredibly dull and when the ship finally sinks that really doesnt do anything for me either its a great performance by leonardo and its a shame he didnt get a nomination because thats the one this film truly deserved sure the special effects were impressive but so were the effects in predator and james cameron once wrote a letter to the la times telling them to fire their film critic because he didnt like  thats reason enough to hate him and this movie,sad
ok i guess but nothing specialand i automatically have to lean toward not liking it because the melody from that damn celine dion song was playing in the background at various speeds for the entire movie  i wanted to strangle someone by the time the movie was half over there has to be some other melody you can play once in a while scary thing is i think it won an oscar for best score  which makes no sense since theres only one song in it over and overregardless its very overhyped and i could think of many other ways to spend 3 hours of my time that are much more worthwhile,sad
ever since i heard the movie out in theaters i thought that the movie was boring so i searched it up on the computer and it was based on a reallife story i havent had the time to see in theaters so i waited for it to come out on video i heard that it came out in near midseptember so i put the movie in my wishlist for christmas and i got it i watched it and i felt so into it im romantic so anything with kissing will do dont call me nasty but thats how i am i have watched that movie more than 50 times im sure alsoleonardo dicaprio is my favorite actor so he was really good in that movie i loved that movie till now and i have searched up to learn the old times of what really happened the special effects were really fantastic i really enjoyed that also the music was the best thing out of the movie i love the music its so soft and relaxing in my point of view right now since i have been watching ita 2 or 2 hours longi know the words to the moviei admire that movie a lot i feel like i am in that event that happened and the sank when i was on it it was so olden daysi still love that movie even though it came out in 1997 it is still the top bestmostexpensive movie ever made,sad
some of us like romantic movies  just because it had a love story doesnt mean it sucks  its truly the only movie that ever affected me for days after i saw it  the old couple in the bed holding eachother was too sad and i am not normally a sap  but of course i saw it before all the hype i am sure if anyone saw it after it was all hyped up then they felt it sucked  lb,sad
since seeing in theaters i mustve watched this movie a good twenty or thirty times  maybe it depends on taste but i dont understand all the negative reviews this piece so frequently getsits obviously a love story but surrounding that there is so much more going on that makes this one worth while  im normally not a fan of romance but this particular one was done so well  leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet had a belivable chemistry on set and both did outstanding jobs in their respective roles  secondary roles from the other characters were very well done also  my favorite happens to be billy zane i tend to favor the bad guysalwaysso anyway  the costumes the music the cinematography the direction the set the story line most of the acting  it all flowed great together i personally think this movie will eventually go down with the other classics of our time  it may take awhile but it will happen  i will admit the movie is a little tooooo long but the time goes quickly and easily  the real story of the has always interested me and i think this movie opened more people up to itworth your time 8 out of 10,sad
when this movie came out everybody went and saw it  one year later everybody was making fun of it  okay this was not a bad movie however it got way too much attention  and now there should be regrets  because this was so popular for three months we made it the highest grossing film of all time something that even harry potter or lord of the rings couldnt beat and it bumped such good films like star wars and et off the list  plus 14 oscar nominations and twelve wins for that  the only thing that was fantastic about it was the visula effects and music,sad
its in to hate this movie for some reason but i for one have this in my top ten favorite films list this would be about 9 heres whyits fiction but everything that happens around the fictional characters is real ah well almost everything either fact or legend a lot of the characters we only catch a glimpse of for one moment are inspired from real photographs and such it takes a terrible tragedy and makes you care about it because of the fictional characters they put you in an atmosphere of what things were like how they missed this in pearl harbor i have no clue perhaps they were too busy trying to dupe people into thinking they were real people and not bothering to show what things were like before tragedy struckthe music in this movie is spoken for many times in many ways but its not just the main theme that is worth talking about how about when the ship is sinking and the other various moments in the movie ive never been scared because of music before but this really scared me during the sinking in addition to the sights you know a film is a masterpiece when the theme music is famous worldwide think about it casablanca romeo and juliet psycho jaws schindlers list star wars all of these have their notorious themes and is no exceptionin conclusioni recommend this movie to everyone,sad
having been a fanatic of the story for as long as i can remember i was tickled with anticipation when i heard was coming to the big screenwhen i finally got to see it in december of 1997 i wasnt disappointedjames cameron did an incredible job in recreating this story down to the finest detailcasting only people who physically resembled the original passengers and crew was a risky movecould they actbut it paid offhis attention to detail was incredibleeven the napkins on the dining tables were monogrammed with the white star lines insigniathe scene on the boatdeck where a young boy is spinning a top while his father looks on is taken from an actual photograph taken by a passengerthe scene where captain smith is discussing lighting the last four boilers with bruce ismay and in the background are two women passengers sipping on lemon teait is based on the original eventthere really were two women sitting behind the captain and ismay on that day in 1912they survived to tell the story the movie does have rather banal dialogue in partsbut this is its only failingits three hour running time seems to fly by and the scenes of the sinking were nothing less than spectacularthe scene where officer moody shoots himself after shooting two third class passengers made me wince a bit thoughthis scene is based on conjecturethere is no real evidence that it actually happenedpersonallyafter years of researching the storyi think he may have fired his pistolbut into the airnot at passengersi guess cameron added it in to create more intensitybut reallythere was enough going on as it was to methe romantic storyline between leonardo dicapriooriginally cameron wanted brad pitt and kate winslet is secondary to the spectacle of the actual storythey do have a chemistryand their courtship was plausibleand it certainly helped the tears flow at the end of what was an already sad storynot to be emotionally moved by the films last half an hour would take a stout heart indeed it is truly a tearjerker this film only really works though on a big screenno less than 29and with digital surround soundi have watched it on a 21 tv without dolby sound and the effect is flat james horners score is perfect for this movie and comes in at just the right placesmy heart will go on by celine dion was a risk that paid off dividends for cameron who originally didnt want vocals in any of the films soundtrackhe wanted the music to speak for itselfit would have been a lesser film without it i loveand i keep going back to herto meshe is the heart of the ocean,sad
i loved this movie since i was 7 and i saw it on the opening day it was so touching and beautiful i strongly recommend seeing for all its a movie to watch with your family by farmy mpaa rating pg13 for thematic elements prolonged scenes of disastor nuditysexuality and some language,sad
i dont think a review of mine could do justice to a movie such as this i watched it in the theaters once when it first came out and found myself unable to hold back my tears it touched me in a way movies rarely do i did not expect it about six years prior to the release of i was entranced and obsessed with anything even remotely pertaining to the doomed ship i did research on it read heaps of books on it and generally ate up every information i could find so when i went to the theaters around two years before the movie was released to see something else i saw a billboard for a simple job with the big letters of printed against a steel pattern i almost fell over myself in excitement but having no internet at the time i could not research the movie as i would have liked to i had to waitwhen trailers and tv spots found my tv i did not know what to expect i knew there was something of a fictional love story added to the film so when i finally saw it i expected just that not what i saw i saw a film that was to quote the movie grand in scaleso recently after about twothree years i watched it again and it held the same effect on me as it did when i first saw it after seeing it again i popped on to imdbcom to read other peoples reviews i was shocked ok  first order of business  the love story now i know that seems to be the highest level of disgust radiating from people and at first i was somewhat uncomfortable with it but as i was watching i realized that a love story added would make the plot easier to understand and allow the events to fall into place the romeo and juliet cliche actually worked in this film and aided the audience to feel a certain way about these two people and those they interacted with so when the ship begins to sink one realizes for the first time that some of these people are doomed to die from the minute the iceberg hits andrews makes mention to rose about the lack of extra lifeboats to save everyone on the ship if in the event of a tragedy but of course that could not happen  because the ship was unsinkable jack and rose act as our way into the sidelines of the film for those who did not do research might not have known there were not enough lifeboats now of course it could have been say a fatherson story but in my opinion this story works much betterhistorical issues  many people are concerned with the mistakes the filmmakers made on some things but in my opinion they pale when compared to what they got right and embellished upon for instance the glass dome above the grand staircase was emphasised to show the glamour of the first class and when it came crashing down around them  it acted as a metaphor of the society falling apart so maybe they got certain things wrong  but regardless of that  it is barely noticable unless one is looking for reasons to dislike the film that is afterall why mistakes so small and subtle are brought to light anyway rightbut all in all and to wrap this up the movie kept my interest and made me wish i could do anything at all to stop that ship from sinking from each scene and how each one ties into the next and how certain things make perfect sense later in the film to the fact that the only thing about the plot we can know is that the ship will sink make this movie rating high on my top ten list this is how movies should be made epic grand beautiful heartwrenching with strict attention to details so small yet so widely recognized when they fall apart around the charactors we have no choice  but to know and likedefinitely an a,sad
zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz  need i say more  i watched this movie on video  everyone said it was so great dicaprio should be ashamed  his acting was boring his character sucked and his personality was tired  i sat for the first 45 minutes of the movie and struggled to find something interesting  after the first 45 minutes i got up and did some cleaning came back about an hour later and didnt notice i missed a thing  the only thing positive about this movie is that i found out how much cleaning you can get done when you are totally bored 14 out of 10 stars,sad
a tragic story and not in the sense that it made me cry this film is pathetic the love story is tedious the depiction of irish peasantry panders to the crassest stereotypes and celine dions stinky theme song is just the icing an a horrible anticake somewhere along the line around about terminator 2 and true lies director james cameron went badly astray he became so obsessed with setting new special effects standards that he lost sight of characters dramatic plausibility and any measure of emotional honesty which are all far more essential to a films credibility the characters in this film are bland and uninspiring to call them onedimensional would be an insult to geometryits ironic that a film which cost so much to make in terms of special effects should go for the cheapest possible emotional return  billy zane is his usual camp pantomimevillain self leonardo dicaprio is as wet as the sea he eventually thankfully drowns in and even the usually reliable david warner is flat and listless this film gets three out of ten and all those points are for the last hour when the ship sinks  the only good part of the film the rest of it should be consigned to the bottom of the atlantic and left there to rot,sad
first of all i cannot belive this movie made the most money ever how could it the love story was nothing new or great u want a good love story go watch casablanca hellsaving privet ryan was a better love story then this there is absolutly nothing great about the story or the way it was told however i will give the movie some credit the actual sinking of the boat is very historically accurate the speacial effects are amazinghowever the sappy unoriginal corney love story abourd the boat and the acting and cast and music completely sucked no imagination or geniuse flimaking or storytelling went into this film i am getting mad jsut typing this mostly because this atrocity is the highest grossing flim ever how u new the boat was gonna sink the love story was not anyhting new the only reason this made so much money was because geeky teenage girls who have nothing better to do and wouldnt know a real movie if it slapped them in the face went to see it about 90000000 times each i girl i know personally saw it about 9 times herselfwhy there is nothing great about this movie im sorry and the fact that it made this much money just boils me 10010 stars i wouldnt recomend this flim to my worst enemy and i wouldnt go see it again if u payed me what made at the box office,sad
despite how much you loved it in the theaters you fall out of love with it it is also rather overrated and the new star wars movie are very underrated this movie is the highest grossing movie of alltime this won 11 awards this was nominated for 14 awards harry potter deserved to beat this and espiecally did spiderman in shorti hate this movie,sad
when i saw this movie i was stunned by what a great movie it was  this is the only movie i think i would ever give a 10 star rating i am sure this movie will always be in my top 5the acting is superb  leonardo dicaprio and kate winslett are at their best  i dont think anyone could have a better job than kate if it is a rainy day and you cant decide what to rent well this is the one  you will love all the acting special effects and much much moreif you have not seen this movie go rent or buy it now  you wont regret it,sad
i sat through again after recently reading the glowing review on imdbcom purely out of morbid curiosity as to whether i had missed something the first time i watched it  after all it was the highest grossing movie of all time  and the reviewer on imdb said that it is not cool to badmouth this film  not wanting to be uncool myself i thought i would give it another tryi was not disappointed  this movie was as spectacularly boring as the first time i watched it  a female friend of mine asked me if i cried during any part of the movie  i did not  i was too busy trying not to roll my eyes i really really disliked this movie  maybe its because i was expecting so much more after all the hype i heard about it when it was released back in 97  the first time i saw it after the mindblowing surprise by the old woman at the end i was thinking thats it  thats the big finale  no frickin way  theres got to be more to it than thatso remains number one on the list of movies i love to hate,sad
special effects alone save this sappy romance from oblivion at the end the aging heroine throws a priceless heirloom into the ocean makes absolutely no sense  just an absurd gesture for dramatic effect pretty well sums up the whole movie how many millions of dollars were spent so that the ladies have an excuse to drag their menfolk to the cinema hmmm in that sense it works,sad
it is a shame thousands of passengers died  a real life tragedy i am willing to bet there should be many interesting stories to tell based on these passengers however most people all over the world would only remember this by its wellcalculated clichridden fictitious love plot hey its great movie making and 1 worldwide box office hit but a shame neverthelessjames cameron went for the oldest trick in the book even the 1953 version had a similar plot line and it worked wonder still i would appreciate the fatherson interaction in the 1953 version to be more genuine and less over the top,sad
filmmaking 101 every well constructed screenplay should have three elements a plot a subplot and a subtext in the case of about 95 of the viewers understood the plot perhaps as many understood the subplot but perhaps 1 in a 1000 really got the subtext which is the underpinnings of the filmthe plot an unsinkable ship hits an iceberg and sinks with great loss of life the subplot a love story which needed to be added to capture the teenage crowd which like it or not is the prime audience of movie goers in addition without the subplot all you have is a documentary rather than a fine dramathe subtext however may have been the most important part of the film its about the classicism that existed in the early 20th century and to some extent is still around  did you notice that life boats were available only to the first class passengers  indeed those traveling steerage mostly immigrants were locked into their deck and doomed to a watery grave  if theres a message inherent in it isnt that we should build better ships  we already do  with global positioning satellites only the most negligent captain would ever collide with an iceberg  it also isnt about the immortality of love  anybody who has loved and lost knows as much about that subject as any picture could ever conveyno the message is we are all human beings and deserve to be treated equally whether rich or poor regardless of race or religion that message is as fresh today as it was when the unsinkable ship plunged to its watery graveperhaps the next time you see a good movie youll think more about the subtext and ask yourself what this film is really trying to say  the answer maybe worth more than the price of admission8510,sad
this was the first movie i and my family watched in our personal computer we all love this movie we viewed it twice on the same day my two kids then aging 4 and 2 were all glued to the computer screen  my wife just forwarded the restricted parts  those nude painting  and love scene i can definitely says its entertaining and one of the best movies  the ticket sales proved it cameron rules,sad
leo dicaprio is a great leading man in this  i wish some of the supporting characters were more fleshed out we dont get to know them enough to really feel with them  i liked terminator and aliens more than this one and i think of james cameron as a great director more becuase of those movies but this had great romance and action,sad
did i listenthis movie made 800 gazillion dollars in the box office and every woman in the office had seen it 5 timesme being a big history buff and totally familiar with the detailed plight of the i though perhaps i should see the movie for the highly touted effectsbut something in my head said but brian youll be sorryfinally i succumbed to the pressure and hype and saw it second run i held out till the very endjust as i thought  what a sappy three our cheesy love story borei knew it i just knew itthe women just love this movie  ughi am glad it isnt rated in the imdb top 250 at least  i still dont know why it made so much moneywait a minute  yes i dosoccer moms,sad
now i dont mean to be dis respectful or anything seeing that many peopleespecially criticslove this movie but my summary says it all who wants to watch a movie about leo dicaprio and kate winslets characters love life as a matter of fact i saw more history on the actual ship in a little childrens cartoon and pg13 pg13 nudity violencemild i must admit and language for a pg13 movie maybe the critics love leo and kate but the main point is that this movie should be called rose and jacks drama of the sea or somethingrating2,sad
this film is three hours long i mean who is james cameron kidding it nearly took longer to sink in the film than in reallife when i went to the cinema to see this they served coffee during the ten minute interval to wake everyone up people started cheering when the boat sank one more thing surely there was enough room on that bit of wood the rose was lying on for jack but who cares its leonardo di caprio,sad
this movie had a lot of eye catching effects  it could be quite fascinatingfor a minute  cameron would knock you out with some stunning image and then throw cold water on the proceedings with his goofy tired ordinary teenaged love story  a pathetic waste  i may have been too generous with my three star rating,sad
i have no clue how this one 11 oscars i wouldnt have nominated it for 1 despite what everyone says i think that this movie was a waste of time the plot was boring and lame and the acting sucked at the end rose could have easily saved jack by letting him on the piece of boat she was hanging on instead of letting him freeze to death in the water like the idiot she is i have nothing good to say about this movie,sad
finally got around to watching the highest grossing movie of all time and i wept bitter tears for money spent honestly what was the deal about this movie the story was one we all know dialogue was apparently adlibbed and the special effects were just satisfactory in all a mediocre movie dont rent it wait for it to come on tv and spend the money on a pizza instead,sad
voice of dean stockwell as admiral al calavicci sam ziggy says youve leapt into one jack dawson of chippewa fallsmichigan and that theres a 785 chance that youre here to save the life of one rose dewitt bukater well at least thats the way i see it i may not see scott bakula or stockwell but for some reason i get the feeling that behind decaprios pretty boy looks it is bakula as timetraveler sam beckett pulling his strings i can just hear stockwell after the nude drawing you drew that while she wasand i missed it rats back to the movie it may be a chick flick for girls to see leo but it does have kate winslet for the guys she looks incredible with red hair billy zane should get an award for the sheer arrogance he plays maybe it comes naturally and david warner should get the jerk reward for his portrayal as zanes stooge exceptionally talented kathy bates is wonderfully likeable as molly brown a far cry from her misery role but then she does excellant work in everything she does cameron pays a lot of detail into this work or not considering the bloopers constantly being nickpicked the story of two lovers separated by fate works well against the tragedy of the sinking as does telling it from a past point of view at the site of a salvage expedition with bill paxton i havent seen him since wierd science the sinking is very well done we just dont see a miniature sinking as have we seen in so many other movies we see the drowning the suffering the deck going up the sheer terror and true nature of the human spirit when faced with its mortality the people fighting for life boatsthis is the movie to put an end to further movies cameron has put together here not just an incredibly powerful movie but a chick flick that even guys would want to see,sad
i have an idea lets take the greatest disaster in maritime history and make a love story out of it whats next love over lockerbie scotland or perhaps hindenburg the love story the screenplay reads like a sidney sheldon novel alternating between syrup and sap while oh by the way lots of people are dying is the most overappreciated bunch of schlocky dreck to hit the screen since gone with the wind its an allout attack on the emotions by a hack director albeit a bigbudget hack director it could have been so much more maybe even a study of the horror that must have been that fateful night a true talent could have given us multidimensional characters and if the love story angle must persist could have actually made the love triangle interesting or god forbid unique instead we have the tired film cliche of the nice girl engaged against her will to an unspeakably unscrupulous wealthy and unbearable man when along comes aawww a kind hearted but down on his luck artist was anything original about this tribute to movie special effects and technical innovation no its more of the same james cameron junk weve seen time and time and time again explosions onedimensional characters spewing forth ridiculously saccharine dialogue while the music tells us how to feel i didnt much like this movie in case i havent been clear enough,sad
i just saw this movie on video after missing it on the silver screenwith all the hype about the movie i was a bit skeptical about how good the movie was going to be  i sure was mistakenit is riveting   1997 is absolutely the best movie i have ever seen  it is more than just a movie  it is an experience,sad
this movie really put you at a loss for words i especially like the character rose dewitt bukater played by kate winslet this is because i can totally relate to what she was going through before she met jack dawson leonardo dicaprio her mother was always worrying about money and class her fiance cal hockley cared only about what he wanted and didnt think much of the lower standard people jack really guided her and made her happy,sad
the sets and costumes for this movie were good other than that it was ok but really drawn out and at least 45 minutes too long to keep from being tedious  the characters have the beginnings of something  the girl is a trapped feminist character but i got the idea that her character was more to be politically correct  as for the conflict between classes as the passengers struggle to get positions on life rafts leaving the sinking ship this is set up as a little too black and white  this is all acceptable for a simple action film which tend to have cardboard characters to a certain extent,sad
one of the best films ever madekate winslet not winning the oscar proves that there is no justice in the academy outstanding performances aweinspiring special effects plus the juxtaposition of rich and poor and an ironic heartwrenching climax make it a cinematic masterpiece,sad
wow i loved it everything was great the actors were perfect and did a brilliant jobboth leo and kate deserved an oscar each well done to cameron another masterpiece,sad
what can i say  honestly i think the movie ran a little too long when it took the ship three hours to sink  i wasnt particularly sorry when the sinking part is over but sort of glad that i didnt have to remain in my seat any longer  the love story is too saccharine to to have any substance although i agree with some of the reviews that the movie has its merits some of the supporting roles and scenes are touching and the cinematography is pretty good with a multibillion dollar budget and three hour run time a movie better be magnificent both in cinematography and story development james cameron spent way too much money time and focus on making a grand picture and neglected characters and story development  for the very reason will not collect the kind of fame a multibillion dollar film is supposed to bring  so on the whole i think the money couldve been well spent elsewhere both for the moviegoers and james camerontwo great movies in this category are worth seeing gone with the wind and gladiator,sad
the start was very disney likevery bad dialogue and very condescendingbut i was patient and i found the movie turning into gold with every passing minute starting with the scene where leonardo was dining with the rich peoplethen from then on the film just kept impressing methe movie started loosing its disney compromises with every minute passingthis movie could have been perfect with a better startparticularly with the dialoguebut after all the positive things this movie has shownit has my blessings as a bonafide classicvery depressing thoughvery sad story but that was intended and the love story had its power thru the tragedies around itone would expect tragedy with a movie regarding this sort of historical disaster anyhowit reminds me of another romantic movie with a very tragic ending that i love which is a place in the sun with elizabeth taylor and montgomery cliftbut i accepted the tragic end of that one becouse it was made clear that clift confessed to murder in one form or anotherbut leonardo in this movie was such a gallant heroic young man that it depresses us to see him end that wayim not a nut for depressing romantic movies but i can appreciate themthis movie won me in the endit also had one of the most suspensefull scenes i have ever seeni was literally sweating and could hardly contain myself when leonardo was being rescued from those handcuffsthis movie had that classic magic indeed,sad
annoying cloying script i dont think i could ever stomach seeing this movie again the characters and script seem to have been based on a comic book the cinematography is pretty good though watch it with the sound off,sad
folks id just like to point a couple of thing out to you  there is an art to moviemaking  part of that art involves developing a storyline unless it is a satire or otherwise involves a comment on an existing storyline a good movie will have an original story line  was a romance with a story that has been told before too many times to count  the inaccessible girl the boy who must overcome the odds including a betterplaced suitor to get the girl  such a lack of imagination makes for a bad movie was an unimaginative story with a very large budgetthere is an art to marketing  to market something you appeal to peoples emotional centres  one of the best way to do this is to apply the tried and tested formula of the human courtship ritual  gets em every time if you spend enough moneywas an extremely good marketing exercise  however many people who dont know better got good marketing confused with good movie making  let me make this clearer for you  was a good marketing exercise was also a bad movie,sad

i almost wish this film was not as financially as successful as it was so that some people are not prejudiced by its mainstream appeal for they would miss not only a great movie but an experiencethis is one of the rare romantic films that i felt worked the dialogue from beginning to end was top grade sure a few cheesy lines may have slipped here or there but for the most part the dialogue that delivered the story transcended that of any romantic film i have seen to dateanyone that has seen the movie knows this was not about a boat that sank but rather the love of two people jack  rose that was so strong which over shadowed the danger they faced both willing to die so long as they were together for they would have no reason to go on with out each other this is the romeo  juliet of the 20th centuryif i am to find a love at least half as strong as that of jack  rose i would consider myself extremely lucky,sad
this movie is a movie with the capital m like gone with the wind places the love of two normal characters into the story involving us in one of the great disasters of all time if the story beautifulrichnexttomarryrichbrdgirl meets younghandsomepureandintelligentguyis already known cameron shows us how cinema can reconstruct the real world years of study on the original projects of the ship a perfect research from the structure of the ship until the resemblance of the actors with the real persons bernard hill and victor garber are the clearest examples all is made by cameron to take us on the we taste the beauty of the ship the elegance of the rich people and the dreams of the poor ones and then we sink with the ship and its inhabitants a perfect movie with a perfect cast and a perfect crew never forget the james horners wonderful score or the fantastic art direction by peter lamont perfect nothing else to say,sad
this is one of the best movies ive ever seen everything about it was excellent the james cameron really did a good job on this movie the music was so beautiful the plot was so touching and sweat the character are excellently written i dont know anything about this movie that i dont like i recommend this movie to anyone who like a really good romance story this is the most beautiful movie ever made,sad
leonardo is a great actor in this boys life his best role he plays a troubled youth with an abusive stepfather in the basketball diaries his 2nd best role he plays a troubled youth with a heroine abuse problem in romeo  juliet his 3rd best role he plays a troubled youth with a love problem in his 6th best role he plays a troubled youth with a sinking boat problem in the 4 years between boys life and youd think leo would be able to master the whole troubled youth role which he also played and better in marvins room but its still at the same level energetic yet empty loose yet fragmented forceful yet tentative the script doesnt help though in a word its awful kate winslet towers over leo here and seeing her naked was a lot more rewarding experience than it is seeing her bare it all in holy smoke kate and leo however make a good team and they make it seem like they really love eachother though their tacky lines are an obstacle to cross this could have been a great film but it settled for alrightwithacoolending instead,sad
i think the reason i was so disappointed in this movie was because i didnt go to see a ship sink or to awe at the spectacular special effects i went to see it based on terrific earlier performances by leonardo dicaprio in the basketball diaries this boys life and william shakespeares romeo  juliet marvins room etc as well as kate winslets roles  in hamlet jude and sense and sensibility shes also since done great work in hideous kinky and holy smoke in hindsight though that may have been a bit credulousi knew going in that the main pith of the movie was the stateoftheart effects showing the preeminent sinking i had hoped that that was going to be an added bonus not the only thing worth mentioning i found the whole storyline of kate winslet the rich upper class socialite rose falling in love with dicaprios ragtag wrongsideofthetracks jack very cliched as the formula goes he repulses her at first then they grow to love each other then they realize they cant have each other because of their class differences but love perseveres and naturally there has to be the evil boyfriend played here by billy zane as cal who seems charming and elegant on the surface but has a mean and jealous fervor in him there are a lot of other ingredients to be interpolated into the formula but this is the gist of it and the material never strays too far off the beaten pathnow i have been to movies where all i expected to see is great action  special effects and conceded that the acting and story werent exactly on the front burner mission impossible ii comes to mind however i was so disappointed that this movie which i dont think you could classify as action and with all of its potential turned out to be so mediocre the story and plot were very hackneyed and trite and the actors really had no room to move in such a formulaic offering if you want some good titles to look at from 1997 try good will hunting la confidential or as good as it getsin the end for me the special effects werent enough,sad
who honestly believes that leonardo di caprio deserved the main role in that moviewhy oh why oh why do we always insist on putting the page boy of the month for the leading role of such an important moviethe film was good in every sense but imagine a proper actor playing the leading rolei mean lets face itanyone can act like little leowhy not use somebody like stephen nugent or adrian cleevesthats what i say,sad
i know everyone is sick of reading about how the simple plot is wonderful and kate and dicaprio did a nice job with their roles  of course these are all true however no one has ventured to ask why this movie is the greatest of all time  the key  the haunting musical score of james horner  it takes all the effects and images and gives them meaning and emotion without his score even john williams probably could not have done it better the movie would have lost a serious amount of the magic it held for me and the majority of the american public  from the trademark flashback scene in the beginning to the life boats at the end horners music captivated the emotions of the people and the tragedy of the shattering of a supposedly unsinkable era  consequently dont buy the video unless you plan on buying a surround sound system  you will not only be insulting horners phenomenal score but you will lose a lot of the emotional drive the film had in the theaters,sad
at over 18 billion worldwide excluding rentals is the most commercially successful film of all time  that is double the next highest grossing film star wars the phantom menace  nominated for 14 academy awards it won 11 including best picture in 1998  everything about this film was big  it ran over 3 hours and had a budget of 200 million which is larger than the us box office for all but 30 movies in the history of filmmaking  this was a film in every sense of the word  but was it any good  well actually it wasthe film was written and directed by james cameron who before this was most renowned for writing and directing terminator films  the story was a combination love story period piece and disaster movie  as a love story was good  as a period piece it was wonderfully precise in its myriad details both generally and as to specifics about the and her passengers  as an epic disaster movie it was utterly colossalfrom a directorial perspective this film is unparalleled a feat of gargantuan proportions  in addition to the normal directorial duties cameron had to coordinate mammoth modelbuilding projects deep sea filming of the original ship thousands of hours of painstaking research elaborate visual effects and hundreds of special sets  to be able to pull all those elements together at all is a superhuman task  the result was truly remarkable entertainmentcameron took a chance on leonardo dicaprio  the studios wanted matthew mcconaughey but cameron insisted on dicaprio  it was a gamble that paid off  dicaprio gave a career performance and his enthusiasm and charm lit up the screen  kate winslet was also a fresh talent with only five minor films to her credit before  her performance was sparkling and her chemistry with dicaprio made the love story urgent and magical  oddly she hasnt worked much since and is fast slipping back into the obscurity from whence she camethis was not as much a film as it was a fluctuation in the spacetime continuum  forces and emotions from the original event were transported to 1997 and they clutched us with a power that left us spellbound  it was neither the best story ever told nor the best film ever made but it was certainly the greatest filmmaking achievement to date in its sheer size and scope  as a motion picture i rated it a 910  as an epic there is no scale large enough to rate it  the box office speaks for itself,sad
i am sick of people saying this is a bad film get used to it this was a breathtaking journey it deserved all its 11 oscars and all its success i am extremely surprised that it isnt in the imdb top 250i liked everything about this movie the performances from kate winslet leonardo dicaprio frances fisher kathy bates and billy zane were all impressive but this time the performances arent the sparkle in the film it is really the effort that went into the direction visual effects sound and sound editing and musical score that made the film such a sparkling memorable gemthis is the best film of 1997 no doubt and after which will soon be 4 years i still cant stop thinking about this amazing achievementrating 10,sad
in james camerons finest film to date he writes and directs a period piece worthy of its name and a solemn homage to those who passed on that fateful night in 1912 the labour of loves only due comparison is to hollywoods yesteryear classics such as gone with the windwith a commentary on social classes and the trappings of the victorians cameron goes beyond his norm  and excellsleonardo dicaprio and kate winslet charge the screen as jack dawson and rose dewitt bukateer respectfully  a strong supporting cast including the invisible mans gloria stuart who carries the film in flashback brillantlyif youre one of the very few people who havent seen it yet be aware that you are missing one of hollywoods finest films  the combination of awestriking special effects and corsetted costume drama mix only too well,sad
i have been fascinated by the story of the white star lines most luxurious liner that sank on her maiden voyage ever since i first learned of it 20 years ago and my dad would always say and they still dont know where she came to rest remember it wasnt until 1985 when national geographic found the wrecki have many books articles and video programs about the history of the rms its people and its impact on the entire world following the tragedywhen camerons debuted in the theater all i heard was how great the love story was i didnt think that any film that put fictional characters in a real setting especially one as dramatic as the disaster could succeed i was wrongis an excellent film in all respects both dicaprio and winslet have a realistic and charismatic chemistry with each other kathy bates was born to play the role of molly brown billy zane is wonderfully despicable as the intended husband for winslet and bernard hill lends a great deal of respect to his role as captain john smithbut the real star is indeed the ship itself it is absolutely phenomenal how the filmmakers recreated the legendary ship for the film the grand staircase with the carving of hope and glory crowning time the staterooms the ballroom the smoking lounges all replicated with incredible attention to detailthe details surrounding the sinking were incredible as well i believe this is the first motion picture to address the fact that the ship split in half as it sank instead of going down whole the entire sinking sequence is incredibly chilling and you will not be able to turn your eyes away from itif you are one of the few that have not yet seen watch it soon and see if it doesnt amaze and move youand by the way if you find yourself in orlando fl check out the exhibition you wont be disappointed,sad
when i vote for a movie i always comment on it i want to do that now too but i dont know what to say except the usual this is one of my favourite movies of all time and it made me cry this movie is just too beautiful to put into words the director worked on it for five whole years and his work paid of oscars great reviews everybody was and still is in love with this moviemy rate 10,sad
james camerons masterpiece is without a doubt one of the greatest movies of all time it is the ultimate human story action suspense romance drama and historical accuracythe characters of jack and rose break the social boundaries to be with one another creating an emotional love story by appreciating these two characters feeling their passion love and desire they create a gateway for the audience to feel what it was really like to be on the the presence of historical characters such as captain smith mr ismay and thomas andrews produce a greater sense of realism and allow us  appreciate the true tragedy of what happened to the luxury linerthe film had incredible music creating a sense of awe and respect for the great ship and all of its doomed passengers the sound and groundbreaking special effects brought the ship back to life we see the contrast between the huge pistons the hundreds of stokers below and the guts of of the ship with the beautiful majestic swooping shots of the ship out at sea so we appreciate it on a much higher levelthe action was brilliant as the ship keeps going down the action gets more intense and more lethal obstacles keep coming up harder and more difficult keeping us intensely involved the passengers get desperate trapped on what was once a beautiful ship but now a crippled mass of metal pulling them into the freezing oceanthe sinking of the was a great tragedy this film represents it truthfully and emotionally it is a classic and should never be forgotten,sad
well if you are reading this how is the weather on mars  you see in the early 20th century there was this boat that sankwell you know this movie is the 1 highest grossing movie of all time as well it should be  i was going over some of the other reviews and there were a lot of you who said this movie was very bad  well ill tell you what give me your address and i will buy you the glasses you obviously need  watch it again and you will clearly see the greatest love story of all time coupled with some top notch special effects casting leonardo dicaprio as jack dawson was a great idea but when i heard that someone named kate winslet would be the love interest i said who well after seeing her in the movie she filled the role of an early 20th century woman great costumes added to the perfection of this movie,sad
i really enjoyed almost every scene and the overall movie but i feel they ruined it by using a trendy teenheartthrobheroine storyline to tie it together  it was a great historical portrayl of an infamous tragedy and a good tearjerker i would shed a tear anyday for the string quartet that plays in spite of certain doom but i almost laugh when leos corpse sinks,sad
alright lets get the hard part over with this was an ok movie and is probably one of the greatest historic films ever made in that sense phew now that thats over let the degrading begin first off id like to say it sunk get over it ill tell you what i feel from a male perspective this movie is over ratedfull of over acting and under acting bad lines some stupid effects a cheap ending and a teenage boy that had his fifteen minutes of fame for drawing a nude picute of his girlfriend those who think this movie is 100 pure gold you are wrong those who think this movie is 100 pure trash you are also wrong those who really dont care you dont matter if you have the time to watch this watch its three hours longer than it should be but still see it once,sad
i a good interesting movie with not such a good script but with a good direction i saw it six times  it get 11 oscars by luck because there wasnt any good movies in 98 in my opinon it shouldnt take 11 oscars the actors didnt play so good  it is a good movie just because they invest so much in it and it is so long if it wouldnt eat so much many would be a bad movie ,sad
i saw last night for the first time before watching it i believed it was only a over hyped film for stupid girls who love dicaprios smart face butits not so at alli think is a very pleasant film well directed technically perfect touching but not pathetic ok the plot isnt original and it is a bit stereotyped the old story of a poor guy who falls in love with an aristocratic girl   dicaprio was really better inspired in romeojuliet than in this film and  of course  is not the greatest movie ever appeared but  however  it deserves to be seen without prejudicesat least to enjoy all the marvellous digital effects,sad
is an extremely well acted well written movie  all of the characters are so believable that you might think that the love story of rose and jack actually happened on the  james camerons depiction of the sinking was thoroughly researched so that he could come as close as possible to recreating the actual event  kate winslet and leonardo dicaprio played the parts of rose and jack beautifully  kathy bates was extraordinary as molly brownall of the detail that was taken to recreate is amazing  the spiral staircase was perfectly detailed  the actors were in authentic 1912 costume  the cutlery was stamped with the white star line logo  the carpets were even woven by the same company that wove the carpets for the actualthe scenes of the sinking were superior to any of the other movies about the  there was more emphasis on what all of the people actually went through to try to save themselves and their familiesis a wonderful movie and i would recommend it to anyone,sad
the film was well made but nothing worth applauding for it does not have one creative bone in it the whole thing is obvious from beginning to end and i am not talking about the well known fact that the ship sinks i am referring to the exchange of the characters the film is choking on stereotypes from begining to end  the acting is good only because the actors dont have any hurtles to jump over mabye this is why the film made so much money it is food for the masses  i did enjoy the realism of the desperate hours on the boat but outside of that it all sucks if you did not like this movie then i recommend that you see bigas lunas the chambermaid of the a much more original piece that does not put us through the typical paces if you liked then you will not enjoy bigas effort i was so embarassed when the audience clapped at the end of camerons long film it only made me have to go to the bathroom twice during the film it was sooo long  and that was in france and all of my friends were applauding for it at the academy awards with celine dion sang the overplayed ballad  please avoid if possible i wish i had but i have a wife so that was a lost cause,sad
this may sound incredibly lame or sappy but i had never seen a movie that made me cry for a week afterwards until  now dont get me wrong i am a very emotional person and this story just hit me  i believe that was james camerons intent when he wrote it  he knew just what to write and when and how to write itthe movie had its flaws yes  i incredibly disliked the story with older rose and believed that it would add to the suspense surprise and story if it had just started out back in 1912 and was just the disaster story and not the whole other story  the old rose part is pointless and just an extra halfhour to fast forward through  someone did make a good point in an earlier comment also about the fact that old rose is narrating the story yet she manages to know all about other things that had nothing to do with her or things that came as a surprise to herhowever flawed the movie is however it makes up for it with its effect many people criticize the love story but i believe that it was needed in order for the viewer to actually get the movie  by knowing the ship was doomed we knew the characters were doomed and it forced the feeling of wanting them to survive by any means  call me sensitive but i felt for jack and rose and pulled for them the entire timenow three years later sometimes i will sit down to watch the epic after fast forwarding the first halfhour  some parts i now find cheesy or boring but it could be due to the fact that ive seen the movie so many times  i definitely believe the movie deserved the oscars it won  it may be flawed or hated but the phenomenon hit people like no other movie has done before  it was a gamble by cameron and it won  those who truly appreciate it enjoy it and those who cant see past leo or computer effects and believe me star wars has those effects too just arent as lucky as those of us who can and have and are able to truly enjoy the moviean epic of proportions and worthy of my appreciation,sad
if you havent already seen this movie run do not walk to the movie store and rent it the catch  watch it with the sound muted the special effects and cinematography are brilliant the costumes and characters look stunning but the dialogue acting and plot aside from the ship sinking of course argggh my favorite part occurs when dicaprio is handcuffed  to a pipe trapped on one of the lower decks as water is rushing in all around him this could be serious he exclaims no st sherlock even putting aside any personal animosity you may feel towards leo it soon becomes apparent that all the acting is atrocious if they spent god knows how many hundreds of millions for the movie they might have bothered to get a writer and a couple of actors,sad
so that was what all the fuss was about it was ok but that was about it to be entirely fair i didnt see it when it was in the theater im probably the only person on the entire planet who didnt but saw it on video instead perhaps if i had seen it in the theater i might have been swept away by the spectacle of it all but on the small screen it simply did not hold up yes it had gorgeous art direction and costumes and even on tv the ship sinking was impressive but the love story which was at the center of the film did absolutely nothing for me i really cant fault kate winslet  shes a wonderful actress who did the best she could with the flimsy material she was given  but dont even get me started on leonardo dicaprio,sad
the way that this film depicts the sinking is excellent the love affair between jack leo di caprio and rose kate winslet is complete garbage the former uses great special effects to tell the story of one of the biggest disasters of the 20th century whereas the latter is filled with trashy oneliners which the scriptwriters deem romantic but are in fact endless cliches which have been heard before in other love films the lead characters are annoying leo is completely fake in his portrayal of a poor person it completely ruins the characters personality as you the viewer in fact know that he is getting half a million quid for doing this and is about as poor as a multibillionaire kate winslet is infuriating as rose an upper class girl turned into a scruff by the wayward jack but is amusing to see how out of place her snobbish accent is at the slobbish 3rd class party the actors who play her family are also extremely irritating and you get the impression that they are all this disgustingly upperclass in real lifethe special effects on the other hand are amazing the flooding of the great hall and the boat being dragged down stand out as memorable and you cant help wondering how much better the film would have been if the makers had scrapped the whole love story idea and shot the film in the third person perspective for effects 10 out of 10 for the plot 1 out of 10,sad
after rave reviews and incredible marketing i still couldve cared less to see this film  then a friend brought it over to watch  so i did  it was just what i expected the big wigs pumped this balloon full of hot air  the basic storyline reminds me of shakespeares classic romeo and juliet  a story of two incredibly stupid and starryeyed kids which could only end in disaster unfortunately it isnt as well written money timing and power fed this puppy through the mainstream american gut however i couldnt stomach the silly writing and overthetop special effects  and then theres always the question of why they gave it a pg13 rating with the slow camera paneling across the naked female anatomy the characters backgrounds seem highly contrived a gambler who just happened to win a ticket to sail across the ocean and a young welltodo girl trapped in engagement for money then theres the matter of the suicide meeting where jack tries to talk her out of jumping ship with tactics which would impress even freud    if such tactics would ever actually work  well rose and jack make a lovely couple of crazy kids with their wild days of drinking below decks standing on tiptoes nude art sessions and making out in the backseat of a car  honestly who put this stuff in a script  i didnt know whether to laugh or walk away and find better use of my afternoon as if this werent enough bull to swallow they add the whole search for the jewel  then at the end the old rose drops it in the water  she could have done that years before  was it some obvious imagery that totally missed me or did anyone else think she was whacked now we come to the best part  special effects  and this cookie was loaded with them  the water slosh was great  but seeing the ship sink was a big disappointment  rather than using a tasteful display of the ocean liner in the murky black of night brightens up the entire ocean better than the stadium lighting  in fact its brilliant enough for us to see the passengers fall like pingpongs off the deck  i think they shouldve used less cg wizardry and more brain power to sink the boat not all of was bad though  in fact i loved it when billy zanes character slaps the silly girl around  it was one of his best performances and during my favorite scene rose drops jack into the drink  the blue monochromatic coloring and the music are perfect  sigh and then rose is rescued  what a disappointment  we could have saved the jewel if she hadnt lived so long  what a twist  i really thought the jewel would be recovered as the climax or was the sinking ship supposed to be at the bottom of all of this  did this movie have some real purpose  because i missed it,sad
i dont think im giving away a huge plot line here but im not very familiar with whats considered a spoiler and i dont want to be in trouble so there might be one in here read on at your own discretionthis was one of the worst movies i have ever seen and believe me it took three girls and two guys to hold me down and make me watch it  as i watched i was stunned by the visual effects  i marveled at the sheer brilliance of the men and women who did the spectacular visuals you people are heros to all the little people like me in this world who want some sort of redeeming thing in a movie  however my review now turns to the rest of the movie complete and utter schlock  our good mister dicaprio gives us a speech about how the water is so cold youd die in a minute or two but himself spends eighteen or so hours swimming around in it up to his neck the villainous character has no redeeming qualities whatsoever  the hero is constantly being chivalrous  the heroine is this superwoman that can drink like third year freshman at a state college dance like someone whos been learning since she was able to walk and has the body of a supermodel thats all well and good in say oh a fairy tale but with all this attempt at realism here what with filming it all in real time and such youd think that the characters could be more human  the storyline is so predictable the music unbelievably repetative the characters one dimensional and the entire production longer than the time it takes to cook a thirty pound thanksgiving turkey   i give all props out to james cameron he has made some great movies but whoa,sad
really isnt very involving in terms of its drama as it starts out at this point main thing that can be really worth observing is the camera work  there are numerous long shots the movie progress you are able to gain more of a interest with the story around the ship and its atmosphere it that can help grab a hold on to the scenery fairly well  as occasionally cuts back to the present day setting were the movie begins but not on a constant basis  the drama itself at times feels to be lacking  it tends to force several situations for dramatic impact  most of the bulk in belongs to the sinking of the ship  the process of these action sequences is seemingly carefully and well constructed but along the way it falls into various repetitious situations and dialog eg the lines come back oh shi and never let go  for example we either see children standing around and crying or crew members who set an example of the onedimensional supporting characters and in the process of this type of scenes usually gets punched arguing with a group of passengers who paths are blocked  any other way this period in the movie albeit going on forever is still interesting since its obviously at moment of panic,sad
i personally feel like many other level headed peoplelikely to be labelled cynical and unromantic by fans of this simplisticsappy movie that this film was highly overratedthe films casting also left to be desiredleo just doesnt cut it as an all american son of the soil midwestern boy that saidthe film does have some positive pointsof course the photography special effects and editing are magnificienti would recommend watching the film onceonly once if only for rose and jacks beautiful exploration of the ship in the 1st 45 minutes of the movieinspite of its cheap mills and boon typemy sister used to have these booksi peaked okay romantic setting with its stock bad rich people and sweet poor peopletime somehow passes mainly due to kathy bates and kate winslet who manage to rise above the sloppy scripti found it embarrassing that most people in the theater in tears toward the endnot just womeni was not embarrassed due to a show of emotion but that the audience had reserved their tears for some fifth rate schlock like thiswould they have a similar reaction to emotionally and contentwise richer films like amistad and kundunreleased the same yearhell no finally how in the world did james horners cheesy theme manage to score over philip glass vastly superior kundunwhat the hell is wrong with the academy,sad
this was a great film in most respects but i didnt like the choice of lead actor they could have found anyone more masculine than dicaprio to play the supposedly rugged virile allamerican boy some of the lines are just plain bad im the king of the worldthe special effects are indeed spectacular but i found myself growing bored waiting for the iceberg to come i have to admit that the fantastic sinking sequence is a good reward for being dragged to see the movie by your date and sitting through hours of love story7 out of 10 just because i dont like dicaprio,sad
this movie was a sure fire hit at the box office and at the academy awards but perhaps the production was the only thing that deserved recognition cameron is able to bring back the true flamboyance artistry and historical significance of the but i believe the storyline and acting could have been more closely examined it was really no shock to me that the movie received all of its awards for production and received not one oscar nomination for screenplay when all that money is put into a film to bring back something so beautiful and extraordinary why not work with it more and put better writing and acting into it then all the heads will be nodding,sad
ive read some of the comments on this film  i agree  the fx were good but the acting was horrible  this is surely the most overrated film of all time  la confidential a much fresher story was robbed of best picture was the forrest gump and la confidential was the pulp fiction the highest grossing film does not necesseraly make it the best picture  i agree with the person who said that saving private ryan and glory were way better movies to make you tearyeyed  plus you actually get something out of the two war films  my choice 5 out of 10 for the fx,sad
ive just read some of the readers comments on this and it amazes me how this film can receive so much praisetechnologically i would say the film is very good and this is perhaps its strongest point  the fact that a film has been made which visually shows the grandeur and impressiveness of and conveys in a relatively effective way how amazing it would have been in 1912having said that  does anyone really care about the fate of kate and leo in the film  their acting is terrible and i think they are both extremely talented  this may be because of the difficult circumstances surrounding the shoot or because of mr difficult himself  james cameron the plot is nonexistent how can you invent a story around the sinking of the and there is far too much inconsistency throughout for a director who spent millions on real crystal chandeliers and real china platesit was a travesty that this beat la confidential at the oscars when la confidential has brilliant acting by all concerned and a plot that actually keeps you,sad
okay deserves a large amount of attention for the special fx brilliant score and amount of detail  but come on not a single performance was oscar worthy so should this movie really be rated so highly  maybe the movie will make you tearyeyed and filled with romantic thoughts but it wont touch your soul  if you really want to see something unforgettable and that leaves you in awe watch saving private ryan or better yet glory,sad
is this the most overrated film everdrawnout boring predictable uncreative and above all unconvincing ah little kate and leo how sweet  are we really meant to believe its 1912the bits that flank the main story with the old woman are superfluous and mindnumbingly banal and the only real amusement value is when the people slide down the boat as it snaps in halfis this meant to be funny tragic romantic original historical because it isnt go watch trading places or weekend at bernies or groundhog day or derek jarmans blue and learn what goes into making a real filmunfortunately the likes of will invariably appeal to the mainstream sentimentality of middle americanenglandetcand why when theyve got that big hot boiler room on the boat didnt they just melt the little iceberg why did they take so long to sink that old woman is the same character as kate winslet groan110 is overrating this bland unconvincing trout of a movie frankly,sad
the movie had some good special effects but the love story they built around this true life tragedy was rather boring  the only part of the movie i could really get into was the actually sinking of the ship but even that is not good enough to make me want to see the movie or any part of it again  i think this is a perfect example of how hype can sell  everyone was so amazed at the little touches and details and special effects that they never stopped to realize they were wasting nearly 3 hours of their lives for a 1 to 1 12 hours of special effects  i have argued this point with people who swear it is one of the best films and all i have to do to shut them up is ask one question will you ever watch it again  the answer is always no,sad
a movie based on an obscure footnote of maritime history is a mixed bag of a movie  on the one hand theres the amazing visuals the intense attention to historical detail commendable performances and to top it all off a nude scene with kate winslet  on the other hand this movie has a subpar script and a cliche of a plot coupled with stereotypical onedimensional characters and a threehour running time  even when you factor in the surprise ending hint it involves an iceberg this film is far from the greatest ever in fact i wouldnt put it in my top thirty however despite the fact that it is overrated is still an entertaining piece of cinema and an enjoyable if predictable journey through history,sad
i felt mixed emotions at the end of this film sadness amusement wonder and excitement firstly there are no spoilers in this review so dont worryi thought the main characters acting was poor kate winslet really shown up in her worst film to date pity because heavenly creatures was so good and leonardo dicaprio was nothing special compared to his performance in man in the iron mask which was very good however some of the supporting characters did very well and it was from them that the emotion was created you really got a sense of terror and helplessness that they felt without being clouded by very corny dialogue like the lead characters werethe special effects were magnificant well done to them definately a cinema film with plenty of stunning visuals long shots and wide pan angles  the ship looked fantastic and realistic  the effects had to be good otherwise i think the film would have sank without trace and james camereon would be mourning his lost millions for a long time to come neil,sad
in the beginning of 1998 there was not a teenage girl in the world who didnt love some even dared to call it the greatest movie ever made when i finally saw it i realized that  it was highly overrated even somewhat of a disappointment it begins great with some beautiful special effects and cinematography good directing and witty dialouge but as it progresses along it becomes almost a shotforshot remake of a night to remember however that film was more of an emotional story of opposites colliding and hope conquering hopelessness this is more of a disaster flick the biggest problem though is the lack of charactor development the films protaganists dicaprio and winslet are the only ones who seem to do anything all anyone else does is say a few lines look scared scream die or get rescued near the end it seems as if dicaprio and winslet are the only ones on the entire boat everyone else is just a cardboard cutout floating in the water,sad
it was the most amazing movie two years ago but in 2000 the flawed fiction account of the most famous ship in history seems overstatingly unbelievable attempting to be faithful to fact while making leonardo look overwhelmingly good to drag girls around my target age group to the box office now makes me embarrassed to be once part of the phenomenon that once was unfortunately fact could not combine with romance on that one with a director who seemed more intent of running bills into the millions of dollars to break into the record booksi will not be entirely venomous towards the movie because it was after all at one stage my favourite movie kate winslets performance was perhaps the best in the whole film but her lower key and lower profiled oscar nominated performance in sense and sensibility as marianne still exceeds this one entirely she has a knack for costume period drama in a good showy part but she has done better work elsewherewhat once seemed to be perfection of movie making is quickly becoming evident with its misconceptions of film making the screenplay at the time and the musical score seemed completely breathtaking but now merely looks the complete fluke that had enough star drawing power to get people to hand over their cash to the box office celine dion assaulting the world with a maudlin ballad about a sinking ship of course increased the movies success to a greater extent than it deserved perhaps the art decoration costume design and cinematography will outlast some of the mediocre elements disguised beneath the surface of the gloss the hype lasted long enough to secure a record equaling amount of oscars first reached in 1959 with benhur during the 1990s the academy seemed to be handing the best picture statuette to the wrong pictures with the exception of schlindlers list and the silence of the lambs without a doubt it will retain its place in history as a movie epic for all the generations but it is certainly no gone with the wind or casablanca and in sixty years well be wondering what we were thinkingrating 510,sad
admittedly this film did nothing for me it isnt the best movie ive ever seen but it certainly isnt the worst either although my husbane would beg to differ  he wanted to leave after an hour of jack and rose prancing around the decks i persevered feeling that i paid good money to see this epic and would see it through to the end unlike the assertions of previous comments i did see the film early on in the piece and wasnt led by the hype no matter how much they tried there wasnt much chemistry between leonardo or kate im still having some difficulty trying to imagine them as lovers needless to say i didnt get goosebumps looking at leo and kate pashing or warm fuzzy feelings when they were finally separated foreverstill i wasnt totally devoid of feeling i was transfixed by the last hour or so of the film by the many faces who realised the inevitable who accepted their fates quietly and bravely right to the tragic endthat ladies and gentlemen  is the real story of the,sad
warning cloaked chick flick i have had more fun watching my own sink especially after i have had a few bowls of chili too long and boring and full of canned romantic drivel,sad
first of all did not tie benhur  it got 11 benhur got 12  so there  benhur is also infinitly better  anyways is an ok movie try reading a longer review of it and ponder what the critics were thinking they usually mention a mediocre script poor acting and a ridiculous villain yet still call it things like a masterpiece or the best movie of the decadecentury etc  seems odd  is an ok movie though much of its impact is lost on the small screen  disaster movies will and always will be best in the theatre  i just wish i could of seen this at an imax itd be close to real life size in the ending ,sad
what the hell was james cameron doing  this film has got to be the worst film ever made in my opinion this film is sick  cameron makes a fim abut the where 15000 people died i might add and he did the story about two fictional charcaters that werent even on the ship he didnt even mention any of the people who died  he might as well of called the film jack  rose  because the only thing related to the actual true story was the ship they were on and the sinking at the end  james camerons other films were great but for this one he should be locked up oh by the way all those people that froze to death in the water at the end of the film would not have been there because the suction would have pulled them down even though they were wearing life jackets,sad
when first came out i knew it was going to be bad and refused to watch it on a dull summer evening i decided to watch  on cable it wasnt the worst movie ever it was watchable at best but for those who think this was a great movie or even a good movie i beg to differ lets analize this leanardo di caprio has the acting skills of pauley shore the plot was as thin as cheap toilet paper it failed in the drama category because it sure as hell didnt move me but perhaps i could have learned something it was a major historical event perhaps they could have added some historical information in to a three hour film well i didnt learn a thing if anything made me dumber so if it wasnt really a drama and was in no way a historical documentary than someone please tell me what the hell i wasted three hours of my life watching,sad
ok who hasnt seen this film since i just saw it tonight i am unquestionably the last or next to last person to see it just on the chance that the last person to see it is reading this then here goesthere are very few things to quibble about in this movie the sets are phenomenal the ship is magnificent how they could create such a marvel is beyond me the story is the key however it really is a relatively simple boy meets girl falls in love saves her life gives his sort of a tale a romeo and juliet on waterthe performers are engaging but i wouldnt go so far as to say the acting was spectacular dicaprio was very good but otherwise the acting was adequate the story was extremely good and fit in well to the historical eventi only wouldnt give this movie a 10 because it was a little depressing in the end and it was also a period piece  not my favorite genre but otherwise it was truly a magnificent achievement,sad
the search for a missing diamond is the excuse for this film to tell you a love story and the love story is its excuse to tell you the story of if you can let yourself be amazed by james camerons vision of both the boat and its sinking and ignore most of what else the film is supposed to be about you are in for a treat of course the movie isnt what it could have been and should have been for the first half we see how a fair damsel rose played by kate winslet is rescued from a life of misery by another fair damsel jack played by leonardo dicaprio rose is a child of the upper class and is being forced to marry cal perhaps the most evil film character since darth vader and the most onedimensional creature dreamed up since euclid defined the line in geometry now as we all know rich people like rose and cal are repressed and have no sense of fun while poor people like jack are jolly and streetwise and like to dance dance dance jack must save rose from her snobbish fiance and show her what life is really about and if she falls in love with him in the meantime well all the betterthis is not to say that the part of the film up until the disaster is wasted it is here that we see in its glory a sumptuous recreation of the most luxurious ship ever built and we get to see a lot of it too from the bridge to the deck to first class to steerage to the engine room mostly brought to us by means of rose and jacks merry frolickingthen runs into an iceberg this of course is what we came to see how will the sinking be depicted and by the way what does one do when one is on a doomed vessel surrounded by freezing water and there is not a hope of being rescued by now rose is trying to save jack now locked in the brig for a crime he did not commit but they often seem more intent on saving their love than their lives which is more important is a matter of tasteyet surrounding them are normal people people who are terrified of drowning but who nevertheless have to think of something to do to save themselves and their families there are moments of panic bravery cowardice regret disappointment and selfishness and even ones of extreme warmth and nobility and as you watch you are constantly asking yourself deep down how you would fare under similar circumstancesit is these glimpses of human behavior under the most dire circumstances combined with camerons amazing technical work that make this film more than worthwhile it should have been much better but its still fine the way it is,sad
unlike the majority of the population i did not see in a theatre my sisters who love leonardo dicaprio bought the video and i saw it at home i must say that i was disappointed with all of the hype and accolades i expected a masterpiece from director james cameron instead i watched a boring drama with poor acting first of all in my opinion leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet cannot act perhaps with different lead actors i would have liked the film but with those two actors playing jack and rose the movie began to sink  like the secondly perhaps it was just my eyes but everything seemed brand new on the set i realize that the was a new ship but even at the beginning of the movie the place where jack was playing cards his clothes etc all seemed impeccably clean that feature didnt really make the movie bad at all but was a detail that stood out for me then of course there is the length of the movie itself  about 3 hours after the first hour i could and almost did fall asleep wake up an hour later and not have missed anything the movie drags on foreverin the end i was left wondering how the movie could be so popular i honestly didnt find it emotionallymoving at all its not a bad movie but not exactly a great movie either im glad i didnt spend money to see it in the theatre,sad
let me explain by picking this flick apart  beginning good established the characters nicely set a decent pace  its all downhill from there folks  leonardo dicaprios performance could only be described as a poor imitation of a twelve year old doing a poor imitation of clark gable he should at least be happy that i said theyre names in the same sentence and kate winslet was either too subdued or well way too subdued  dont get me wrong the beautiful costumes and lavvish sets were aweinspiring i do admire james camerons attention to detail  i also admire james camerons ability to direct an exciting actionadventure film and therein lies the heart of the problem this is not an action adventure film when the boat was sinking it played more like indiana jones and the temple of hypothermia than a tragedy of epic proportions and the fact that the two leads didnt seem scared during the whole ordeal didnt help matters much to be fair i did however enjoy the band the old couple in bed the architect turning back the clock the captain enduring the oncoming surge little things not big enough to save this big picturerent the poseidon adventure,sad
robotscyborgsdamsels in distress what more can you ask for in a fine science fiction film brought to you by junedreaming productions take the kids to the sitters get in the ol family truckster and go rent this movie right now this is the action packed special effects masterpiece to hit the science fiction genre in a millenium scifi fans unite two very good cyborg thumbs up,sad
wins many awards in my book  worst script of 1997 for starters then theres worst overacting billy zane worst underacting leonardo dicaprio worst song my heart will go onif only celine dion had gone down with the ship and probably more  thats just scratching the surface on how disgusted i was with this movie  particularly the script  why cant jim cameron just stick with the technical stuff hes so brilliant at  who told that clown he could write  moreover who told him he could write dialogue  i hope and pray for the sake of the legacy we bring our descendants that this movie never makes any important top 100 list  people tend to take those things so seriously  and this movie has nothing that should be taken seriously,sad
technically flawless is a movie without soul not one single shot is intended to draw the audience in and make viewers want to continue to watch we know that expansive historically accurate movies that use fiction and an unusually long amount of time to make their point can workthe godfather godfather part ii and gone with the wind among them we also know that historically accurate movies that use fiction dont have to be unusually long to workfrom here to eternity and reversal of fortune among them unfortunately james cameron and his backers learned nothing from these examples instead they have shown us that it is possible to be extremely successful financially with a movie that is without soul or purpose as i watched this lethargic painfully overdesigned product its not really a movie or a film i was reminded of movies like top hat bringing up baby the grapes of wrath and rebecca these wondrous offerings and many other of the most entertaining and memorable movies are freed from such concerns as historically accurate sets costumes and props by relying on the obvious talents of their performers and crews for every period picture that cannot match the perfection of its design with laudable acting writing and directing ever see the bostonians or the great gatsby there are thankfully a good number of period pictures that surmount any shortcomings in design accuracy with otherwise skillful storytelling and acting i really wanted to believe that could break through the barrier of a recreated ship with an interesting and entertaining story alas the ship at least the one built for the movie proved to be more impervious to true emotion than the icy atlantic,sad
many of my friends have bought now that it is available on videocassette yet i have only seen it once  i believe that this movie is horribly overrated  i am not saying that i did not enjoy the movie because i did  it was a very interesting account of the lives of two central people aboard the one of the worst disasters in history  the real excitement hit when the boat hit the iceberg  the movie kept my attention from then on out  many people say that this movie is the best movie ever created  i beg to differ  in my opinion the best movie ever made is gone with the wind  you just cant compare to such an epic  doesnt even come close  when you really boil the movie down it merely is a dressed up romance with an actionadventure tagged onto it  it is a very exciting movie but i prefer to see it only once and it does not compare to the classic old movies which have stood the test of time,sad
before i saw i wasnt aware how this movie would affect me but it sure was a movie i just couldnt see once  i saw it 9 times in the cinema the thought that this event actually did happen was also something that makes it even more amazing james cameron is a genius he has totally captured the whole event in a way that so many people have related to for people to say that this movie is no good is to say that they werent watching it the way james cameron has included jack and rose with actual people who were on the is very well done and the fact that they used such a fantastic cast and movie set only adds to the reasons why this movie will always be regarded as a classic i give it ten out of ten,sad
spoilers ahahhahh  rememberin the late sam kthis is a film which simply doesnt hold up upon repeated viewing in fact this is the only film i have that i purchased that seemed to get palpably worse each time i viewed it really it should have won the oscar its big budget it has some good acting great innovative effects costumes and so on great film but then it was a very weak year has been for a couple of yearsmaybe its that the sob scenes are so calculated that the effect or novelty is exposed 2nd3rd time around maybe the flying prow scene just seemed too setup maybe truly after seeing the film the next time or time after that when you see it you think of the real deal the real ship the real sinking and wonder if the irwin allen treatment here isnt just a little too cynical and a little bit too much bloodmoney for the filmmakers i dont knowthe docuscenes that bracket the film will probably hold up the best the heaven scene depends on the emotion sweeping you up and that of course is lost on repeat viewing but that would be expected if the film were about something fantastical unbelievable wild adventure or weird scifi it could be viewed over and over without a thought given to reality if it were a character play from jane austen to shakespeare it could be repeatedly view precisely for the insights into reality and appreciated for the fantasy as well but this is just poseidon adventure with superficial character studies and a quick sinking cause it was that leaves little time for shelley winters er whoever to put in a just help me get off of this tub performance or was jack playing shelley winters  almost gave the film away to a friend almost threw it out was surprized i still had it on the shelf dont plan to view it anytime soon,sad
there is in the motion picture academy a hidden criterion for awards its called the miracle factor  if a huge overblown spectacle film production manages to make a killing at the box office and isnt as bad a everyone thought it would be it acknowledges this miracle with its best picture award  this has happened at least twice  in 1952 the malign redbaiting cecil b de mille bullied the corrupt redbaiting academy into presenting him with an oscar for the ridiculous circus spectacle greatest show on earth then in 1997 an equally corrupt politically correct academy presented with its oscardeserved an oscar in only one category  special effects  the story was trite the acting mediocre except leos which didnt even get nominated the editing ok maybe deserving of an oscar since great special effects demand great editing  beating out la confidential is akin to greatest show on earths beating out high noon  standing alone is just another disaster spectacle  but placed beside a film like la confidential becomes pure garbagethis view is no better vindicated than by the academys choice for best picture the following year shakespeare in love  if got the miracle it wasnt that bad oscar then shakespeare in love was given the bad conscience for oscar by the way if you want to see a good dramatization of the disaster get a night to remember instead of this travesty,sad
i guess im in the minority but i dont see what all the fuss is about the special effects were spectacular but the death of 1500 people seemed incidental behind dicaprio and winsletts rather corny romance aristocrat girl betrothed to the villain you love to hate falls for the streetwise tramp who looks years her juniorat least the producers got their facts straight and depicted the sinking accurately but i cant see this film ageing gracefully when in years to come the 90s special effects lose their impact and our kids mock the mid90s hairstyle dicaprio sports in this film,sad
my wife and i have just finished watching or shall i say wasted our time watching this movie  the script was obviously written or geared towards 13 and 14 year old girls  a few observations 1  why would a character as shallow and ignorant as the one winslow portrayed fall for decaprio  should we believe that she would leave zanes character who is a multimillionaire  the ignorant character that she portrayed would have never married a homeless painter 2  i have never seen so many stereotypes in one movie  rich snobbish people drunken irish and english people 3  dolphins do not habitate the north atlantic 4  when its 30 degrees outside you can see your breath 5  when its 30 degrees outside you cant survive in water for more than 3 minutes 6  this movie is a plain and simple cornball  i can see why it isnt in the imdb top 250 after watching it4 stars out of 10 for the special effects,sad
is the greatest film i have ever seen in my life  and it was one of the very few times i watch a film in the cinema twice great story  huge production and a list of great elements that is hard to be counted if somebody has any negative opinion about the film im telling him just ask your self what in the world makes a film wins 11 academy awards and makes more than one billion dollars  could it be a coincidence  no its just one simple answer the film is perfect ,sad
its a decent movie  but it was all hype  the two most hyped parts of this film kate winslet and leonardo dicaprio were the two worst actors in the movies  billy zane and bill paxton were surperb but they didnt get nearly enough screen time  anyway if you see this movie expect to both hate and love the bad guy which is what a makes a good movie great  the rest of the acting excluding victor garber and bernard hill was weak overall it deserves a 3  sorry girls,sad
the first sign of an excellent movie is when over 2000 people took time out of their day to give this movie 010winslett and dicaprio put in some of the best performances witnessed on tv with a fantastic soundtrack directing and storya perfect film that will be treasured as one of if not the best film of all time  10  10,sad
i figured that everyone who voted would give it either a 10 or a zero so i knew that my vote of six would be next to useless  no its not worth a ten but not so bad as to give it a zero  anyway after watching it on cable not the big screen i had to think about my feelings about it before commenting  the obvious things have all been said the bad script etc but what i was bothered by was the cinematography  the use of filters and such was too prevalent  i realize this was to diffuse the light and give everything a soft antiquey look but it bothered me nonethelessi watch movies and ask myself what does this scene add to the overall movie  in many cases with this film the answer was nothing at all  i understand the importance of establishing shots but i dont see the need for them to be that long  i got up once to go to the bathroom and when i returned it was still the long sweeping panoramic establishing shot ok by this time i had figured out it was a big shipi also didnt think the whole outside story set in the present was necessary but i guess james cameron wanted something to differentiate this story from all the other true love versus class struggle storiesi do often get emotional at sad movies hard for a guy to admit but i didnt cry for this one for whatever reason  it seemed too fake i guess,sad
this movie isnt all its cracked up to be i was disappointed it really didnt deserve all its awards like best picture and other stuff like thatone thing though the special effects are amazing the sinking is really cool if it were up to me i would just have released the second video the first one was dismal the second one made up for it alldont buy the hype the acting and the script arent that great as a matter of fact the script is somewhat bad anyone could of written it if you absolutely have to see it pay to rent it and just watch the second video thats definitely worth the price of a rental,sad
this unconvincing lovestory wrapped around a human disaster made a fairly average hollywood blockbuster  the characters were 1 dimensional stereotypes and utterly unrealistic perhaps best summarised by the moment in which billy zane crumbles beneath the weight of traditional hollywood narrative conventions and pulls a gun on the young lovers  did people really believe that  the action is average the acting okay the drama tedious the special effects a dime a dozen these days and the ending predictable  steven spielberg would have done it so much better  come on face up to the hype,sad
i once had a dream  a vision if you will  i had the idea that when i died at age 92 on my tombstone would be the words last woman on earth to never see i thought i could do it but just as the unsinkable ship took a swift nosedive to the ocean floor i too hit an iceberg and in a moment of weakness watched the epic i was the outspokenbashing zealot who claimed it couldnt possibly be that good its all effects well my attitude hasnt changed much now with my melted resolve i ask what was all the hype about the im king of the world was just too much i suppose knowing leo was going to turn human popsicle sort of ruined the moment too  the effects were impressive but i just didnt feel involved yes leos a looker and i assume men say the same of kate but i was looking for something more,sad
please dont think i am just a male coming here to bombard  my wife and i watched it together on hbo the other evening and she concurs with me about the following summarywhy did james cameron need 3 hours to tell this story  this was one of the longest and most tedious films i have ever watched  the contrived storyline was incredibly dull and unbelieveable  come on folks do you really think winslet would have fallen in love with baby faced dicaprio in real life like a shallow character like winslet would have left a millionaire for a person that doesnt even have a home  also dicaprio would have been never invited to dinner from steerage  above all of that there was no chemistry that existed between dicaprio and winslet  as far as the effects were concerned i dont know what all the hype was as the effects looked very fake  granted i watched it on my tv on hbo and not at the movies mind you thank god i did watch it at home i would have been very angry at myself if my wife and i had spent 7 dollars to see this film  i agree with the other negative comments on this board  people who say this is good film dont know what good film is  try watching casablanca and you will understand my character chemistry comment above,sad
ive finally seen this masterpiece  hmm i missed the masterpiece part was it the part where jack teaches rose to spit  or was it when rose gives the steward the finger  nice touches bothbefore i ever saw the film i was prepared to give the script a break  i didnt really expect much  it came from james cameron after all a man who writes mindless action fluff like terminator and aliens  good action thats what we expect from cameron not a script  so here is my break for the script  the movie was pretty to watch  soft lighting soft colors opulent sets the ship sinking sequence was just nifty  i was entertainedbut the story  lets see  this street urchin sketch artist wins a ticket for the maiden voyage of the and finds himself on the love boat inspired  i cant hold backtake away the sinking and cameron was left with over two hours to develop three characters  he couldnt pull it off  start with rose  shes pretty shes rich shes unhappy  can we get a little further than that please i mean where did this rich girl get working class tastes  where did she learn to drink beer and party like she does with the steerage folks  she has been forced to agree to a marriage with cocky cal hockley billy zane whos forcing her  in one short scene we see her mother stressing that the moneys gone  what we dont see is rose caring much about the money or that mom might have to take up sewing in fact rose seems to disdain wealth and her mother  cameron has another chance to develop rose in the character of the present day  but all we see is a seemingly likable old woman who ultimately throws a multibillion dollar diamond into the sea thanks grandma  sure it means nothing to you but several generations of your descendants could have lived quite nicely on that little baublethe zane character  what makes him so bad  or do we just accept badness as a side effect of being richcamerons best effort was with the character jack  unfortunately what little cameron made of the part dicaprio threw away  not one of leos best efforts in my opinion  maybe he couldnt figure out the scriptlack of character development wasnt the least of the childish scripts problems either  there were holes big enough to sail the through no not the fact that a rich girl falls for a steerage passenger i can almost buy that  start with the big dinner where jack and rose first fall for each other  jack borrows a tux from the unsinkable molly brown  it fits  why is molly brown packing around her nephews tuxedo  why is molly brown even in this mess  then theres the nude sketch scene  rose is being followed by manservant spicer lovejoy who came up with that name  yet jack and rose are able to sneak away to roses cabin long enough to finish the intimate portrait  maybe its time to get a new manservant the holes get bigger the movie gets worse  during the sinking scene were asked to despise the rich men climbing on the life boats with women and children  and yet when the third class folks make it on deck and the men rush the lifeboats were asked to pity one who gets shot  i guess chivalry is just for the upper classesand when is james cameron going to get past shots of darkened hallways with flashing lights  move on jimranting now  who cast this thing  is it just me or did anyone else feel like kate winslet was dating a minor  and i can picture the meeting where the cal hockley part was cast  suzanne crowley  lets see crazy man on a boatcrazy man on a boatget me that guy from dead calmsomeone stop me  my comment has taken on proportions  one last gem  when rose and jack do the dirty rose comes up with this line put your hands on me jack  wasnt that jessica langes line to jeff bridges in king kong 1976  enough said,sad
really couldnt see this as anything other than an effects movie they were good but not that good and neither was the film and i was a bit uneasy about the slight whiff of exploitation of a human tragedy just to add a bit of background to a very humdrum wrong side of the tracks love storynot a turkey but not an oscar winner,sad
on account to its great success takings 18 billion  i had very high expectations of this movie but unfortunately i was a little bit disappointed it was quite boring especially the first 25 h of 3 as well the special effects are not so well done for example the unrealistic animation of the water the special effects of star wars episode i or starship troopers are much betteri think the reason why i find this movie boring is not that it is badly done or the average quality of the special effects i even suppose it isnt possible to create a better film about this theme but im not interested in a movie just about the sinking of a shipevaluation 610,sad
i liked dont get me wrong i thought it was beautiful  the direction was marvelous the costumes the musiceverything was great except the acting  i found all of the characters except molly brownkathy bates and the billy zane richboy totally fake  leonardo dicaprio on one hand is an excellent actor  if you watch him in whats eating gilbert grapewhich scored him a nomination for supporting actoryou can see his passion for actingin you can see his passion for the paycheck another former actor is kate winslet who was nominated for her role as rosecmon please  i could have played a rich girl better than she didand i am neither rich nor female  the fact that she fell in love with the jack dawson character not only upset me personally but it also disturbed mein a very weird way  i never expected to not like jack dawsoni just liked the billy zane character so much i couldnt stand to see him loseeven if he did deserve it i think the real problem i have with the movie is that i saw at least three better movies and didnt think was anything great  i was rooting for la confidential to take home the best picture awardmaybe im just not sensitive enough to understand the love between the princess and the pauper but thats just my opinion i may be wrong,sad
this movie had lots of potential but because of poor acting jobs with the exception of cathy bates it was only decent it is worth seeing but it will probably not be your favorite movie unless you find it so romantic that it rules out the bad acting,sad
it is a sad commentary on contemporary taste that this movie has received so much critical and popular acclaim it is redeemed only by its admittedly spectacular special effects the acting of dicaprio  winslet is sophomoric the romantic storyline is improbable and saccharine the billy zane role harks back to the ridiculous mustachioed villains of 19th century melodrama  laughably unbelievable the score is a disgrace a movie which aspires so high deserves a symphony orchestra and a john williams not the synthesized tin whistle effort it received the portrayal of social class everyone in first class is an evil repressed sneering capitalist oppressor while everyone in steerage is a vibrant lifeaffirming peasant saint is right out of a marxist primer dicaprio teaching winslet to spit over the rail is both ridiculous and disgusting and as for camerons ballyhooed fetish for historical accuracy there is absolutely no evidence that any ships officer committed suicide during the sinking but it sure works great on screen doesnt it further he neglects to give a name to the infamous ship that lay 10 miles away and watched the sink while doing nothing it was the californian and this is the 90s so we have to have our obligatory and gratuitous nude scene and sex scene dont we cant make a film without one nowadays those with an interest in the possible as a result of this movie are directed to walter lords incomparable book on the disaster a night to remember and the 1958 jarthur rank production of the same name although the effects are not as great its 1958 after all they stand up well and the script acting and whole tone of the movie are superior to this bloated and overrated blockbuster and those who glibly call this the best movie of all time are gently advised to go out and rent one or more from the following list  lawrence of arabia spartacus the bridge on the river kwai citizen kane treasure of the sierra madre patton sunset boulevard the quiet man,sad
this is a movie that unfortunately had a lot of potential but never lived up to it  there were some wonderful aspects of it ie costumes when the actors were wearing costumes the ship kathy bates and the man who played mr andrews but on the whole this was a very disappointing movie  the acting was bad the script atrocious and the music annoyingly repetative there were a total of two musical themes in a movie over three hours long to make matters worse most of it was synthesized and the musical themes were never developedthe movie did have its moments though  these moments did not involve the two main lust interests however  the most beautiful moments and the ones that made me cry were when the mother was reading to her children and when the band bless the band decided to stay behind and play music so that perhaps it might make things easier for the passengers  gentlemen it has been an honor playing with you tonight  that was truly movingim utterly embarrassed that this movie was so successful  it will never really be remembered and honored in history as gone with the wind star wars to kill a mockingbird etc  it is just a trendy movie full of irritating oneliners and cliche characters  bad form,sad
i know there is a million respones already written but i just cant help letting some readers know that this is not by all means a great film there was one moment that caught my breath  i dont believe j cameron intended this scene to be though  it was when jack said he was from chippewa falls wi since i am from wi this line made me enjoy the movie for a few seconds if that was the only scene i liked well this film will be and is in big troubleok there are a few things that werent bad  1 kathy bates should have been nominated for the statue 2 a likeable theme in music  3 good opening sceneit was pretty spectacularnow the rest i have to say are for the freaks1  this script was beyond pathetic  cameron trys to be touchy by having two completely different people fall in love  true they could have been made for each other but the way cameron incorporated all the scenes were hideous the script of the present time is decent but the story telling part is horrible  i couldnt get rid of the feeling of numbness in my butt 2  acting was for the most part not good except bates  winslet is the worst  she could not get me to feel for her  her jumping scene is simply boring  leo was better but still did make me feel like he is in love with her  and please leo cant lift her when she fell over maybe thats why we never saw them together in the scene 3  the graphics ok it was pretty neat how they sank the ship  but the scenes never made me feel like i was on that ship  the boat was very fake plus the water looked like a giant swimming pool  and the sky looks like something i drew in kindergarten  just look back at other movies jurassic park had much better graphics 4  music  i am a music major and james horner is not a composer i admire he developed a fairly interesting theme  but he never went anywhere with it  all the music seemed to be in the same mood finally storyit was simply boring  no one will ever beat spielberg or lucas in telling a storycameron should have stuck to his t2 or t3  stay away from other genres all the films nominated in 97 were better than  i thought amistad should have won it but thats my taste  but to see people saying was a great moviei just want to puke,sad
no way is this the greatest film of all time not by a long shot to compare this to gone with the wind and leo and kates performances to that of viven leigh and clark gable is ridiculous though is good it is no film of all time leo and kate though excellent in their performances are no gable and leigh and though the film may be an epic the ludicrous amount of oscars slapped onto it so predictably makes it less enjoyable because of the tons of hype lavished on it gone with the wind was made at a time when films won oscars for being good today it depends on what film has the most budget and hype gwtw of the 90s i think not,sad
positively awful  the fact that i sat through 3 hours of this is a testament to hype what is more amazing is that claims were made through the press that this was the most realistic version yet made this proves that special effects and realism are not one and the same thing in historical dramathe fictional characters and some nonfictional ones were nicely cliched the romantic subplot having no bearing on any historical accuracy in relation to the period depicted let alone the specific events for example any woman running through a boiler room of a ship of the period would be probably regarded as insane and apprehended she would also come out of it rather black the fictional suicide of officer murdoch is in bad taste considering he survived the sinking and rendered valuable assistance to survivors  this is after all  a movie which purported to be strong on historical accuracythe lead characters are wooden perhaps if the subplot had been real they would have made excellent life rafts the characters which say least are probably the most memorable examples would be captain smith bernard hill and thomas andrews victor garber not to mention the ship itself or the icebergso for all the millions spent on special effects you still have a made for tv disaster movie which in my personal view is of lesser status than the poseidon adventuremy advice would be to watch a night to remember rather than this  that is a valid account of an awful event,sad
im truly uplifted to see the floods of bashing posted here renews my faith in humanityheres my two cents1 horrible script the most telling fact about its unworthiness for best picture go look at the screenplay nominees for the past 50 yearshow far back do you have to go to find another best picture that isnt even nominated for an award that has ten nominees2 bad acting especially winslet and decaprio in their conversations on deckinsipid dialogue with acting to match3 cheap plot devicethe tragedy was truly cheapened by the fictional romance at its center we know enough about the real people on board for a truly fine drama yet were stuck with these two selfabsorbed losers4 celine dion nuff said,sad
james cameron should stick to scifi  this is a complete mess of a film alright it is accurate in the period detail but having the english as evil upper class snobs and the irish as wonderful but poor heroes is just so cliche ridden and no im not english but frenchaustralian leonardo di caprio cannot act to save his life ha ha and i felt sorry for kate winslet who showed that she can act in heavenly creatures  if you want to see an excellent film on the watch a night to remember  it is far superior better written and much more moving,sad
what disturbs me the most about that in the minds of millions of people the tragedy of the eponymous ocean liner will be forever replaced with a fictional romantic story of a british girl and a american boy did the film make you actually care about 1500 passengers who died in the crash very unlikely were supposed to mourn the girls lost lover instead 1958s a night to remember offered both the more historically accurate account of the event and the human drama behind it along with schindlers list and saving private ryan is a sad example of how the actual history is being replaced by hollywoods fictionalized versions of it dream factory indeed,sad
is not the best film ever in fact its not even the best film of 97 but its a great movie the visual effects are amazing but some of the acting is awful leonardo dicaprio kate winslet and especially billy zane the last 1 12 hours of it are an emotional powerhouse but a lot of the dialogue is cheesy also it made me angry that leo kate and gloria stuart she was good but not great got all the acting spotlight shined on them when it was kathy bates finely tuned performance that stole every scene and showed that she can truly do everything an actress can do and more the billy zane character was poorly written poorly acted and poorly conceived all he was missing was a pencilthin mustache and an evil laugh there was a lot of talk about how bad the script was the script was great sure the dialogue sucked but dialogue is about 10 of a screenplay and storytelling is the other 90 james camerons storytelling abilities are today only matched by spielbergssomething i really hated about it was when everyone compared it to gone with the wind what is up with that sure there are some similarities in the plot but gone with the wind is regarded by many as the best movie ever and a classic there is no awful dialogue there are no awful  onedimensional characters there are no bad performances its just full of good oldfashioned hollywood storytelling at its best it is more entertaining than too it is a half an hour longer but holds your attention even better than ever could plus if you take into account inflation gone with the wind made twice as much as in america alone that is a true epic is only a pretender to the throne but it is a great movie8 out of 10 12 out of ,sad
i still dont see why anyone thinks this is one of the best movies ever this is a good movie not a great one the screenplay was simply ridiculous it doesnt even look like the inside or outside of a ship it actually looks like a stageleonardo was terrible he made no attempt at playing a young punk he simply played himself he was magnificent in whats eating gilbert grape but hasnt done anything since worth watching hes simply a prettyboy who cannot play this type of rolethis film is filled with lots of good actors in pathetic roles kathy bates is one of my favorites but her character in this was horrible it represented absolutely nothing had no substance and was completely fictionalfictionalthats what this movie was from the start the foggy appearance of the movie which was supposed to give you the illusion of the early teens just made the movie look like poorlydrawn animation this was obviously an attempt at making a classic this is a recipe for disaster classics were never meant to be classics they were meant to be movies try making a good movie and it might become a classic try making a classic and its lack of substance will cause it to break apart into tiny little piecesthe good thing about the movie was the final scene in the water this was a marvelous job by dicaprio and winsletunfortunately this was just another example of the public being sucked into an extremely highbudget overpublicized pathetic movie,sad
i hesitate to write anything at all since there are already more than 400 entries on this site so let me just pop off the first few things that come to mind 1hardly best picture caliber as has already been noted the dialog is ridiculous the leads have no romantic chemistry and  most shocking of all  the fx really arent worthy of the hype the sinking is impressively staged but scenes of the underway dont seem much more credible than a lot of backprojected stuff coming out of hollywood six decades ago the computergenerated pans of the ship and the ocean are staggeringly obvious 2billy zane must give one of the most unbearable performances in film history granted camerons script gives him nothing to work with the viewer who noted he seems to be playing satan has it just right the scenes where he shoots  repeatedly at jack on the grand staircase wouldnt the list on the ship make it pretty damn hard to navigate the staircase by this point and uses a child to ensure his place on a lifeboat are just idiotic i found myself grimacing every time i looked at zanes sallow face and slanted eyes this brand of villainy went out in pictures  i dont know  about the time of the real sank 3the leads are pretty hapless and the fact they are able to spend so much time submerged in freezing water while unlocking doors wielding axes etc beggars credibility 4a lot of the supporting roles are wellplayed david warner doesnt fall into the trap of overacting like zane does and comes off quite well as the villainous valet he seems to be having fun which is pretty much all an actor can do in a flick like this gloria stuart is extremely effective as old rose she moreorless singlehandedly endows the film with all its human pathos i also enjoyed bill paxtons performance he etched pretty effectively the character of a jaded adventurer if only he had some decent dialog to work with victor garber  a very fine actor  is wasted as thomas andrews he is invariably excellent in all his scenes 5folks who take umbrage to the fictional characters would do well to remember a similar framework was used with clifton webb and barbra stanwyck as an estranged fictional couple in negulescos 1953 6where was the californian if youre looking for a movie villain this ship fits the bill the decision to cut scenes set on the derelict vessel is really regrettable 7on the whole a decent passable picture with many striking images and a great last hour but it pales in comparison with the 1958 a night to remember which better captured the human drama of the ships final moments on the other hand far better than the stanwyckwebb opus,sad
i forget what prompted me to see for the first time  i think it was a comment i read in an article by a japanese man who said he was moved by the bravery of the men putting wives and children aboard lifeboats and telling gallant lies to comfort the little onessee it i did however and i was so visually stunned i entirely missed how lousy the movie wasi went to see it a second time because my son had been reading about the and wanted to see how the sinking was depicted this time i noticed how lame the characters and plot werei went to see it a third time because a friend of mine who doesnt have a car asked me to bring him and offered to treat me and my kids to popcorn and sodas and pay for our tickets if id take him that last time i left the theater absolutely outragedis a sorry example of the moral decay of western civilization characters we were supposed to sympathize with were elbowing women and children out of their way to save their own miserable skins instead of reaching out to help the woman clutching a baby kate and leo reminisce about the night they met leonardo hefts the worthless and shallow kate onto the floating door to save her life when he could have saved a dozen innocent children instead was a monumental egotrip and monument to selfishness the only sympathetic characters were the designer the captain and the irish widow with the two small children i could smack cameron in frustration  imagine what a wonderful plot he could have built around this woman and kates shallow character picture it  the widow flees ireland to join her brother in america after the town rich creep offers to save her from poverty at the expense of her virtue the widow sees kate on the railing and gives her a picture of what suffering really is take it from there  it can go in any number of directions far more interesting than the cookiecutter lust story patheticas i told my kids on the drive home from the theater if you every survive a shipwreck by ignoring the cries of drowning children dont bother coming home,sad
ok so there has to be a romantic story intertwined to make a real blockbuster  i like romance but too much is too much  if  half the time spent on the romantic fling had gone into historical or technological accuracy or even developing some of the stories of the lives of the hundreds of others aboard i would no doubt rave that this was the best movie of the year  but they didnt and i wont  it was a good movie that could have been a great movie  a night to remember is far better for my vote,sad
what can one really say about this movie lets start with the facts you either loved the movie or you hated it there is no third direction it has magnificent special effects the acting is weak and the script is even weaker im betting there isnt a person using the internet movie database that hasnt seen this movie so i wont be too careful giving away the ending oh did sink i didnt know i have a question what has happened to leo dicaprio he was brilliant in bball diaries and whats eating g grape and why didnt bates get a nomination for supporting actress though it wouldnt have mattered cause basinger was even better i look at the oscar and i see 11 oscars go to who decides anyway who gets an oscarlike i was saying this movie is a technical masterpiece and has my full respect for that but its not what makes a great movie and certainly not the best movie in history about the boxoffice record almost everybody i know saw the movie just to see what everyone said was so trilling about it and one out of five actually liked it but only two out of five admitted to not liking it its like theyre saying i know everything about movies i liked what im trying to say is people say they liked it just so they wont seem ignorantmy definition for a spectacular movie is one that you can watch over and over again like braveheart or the shawshank redemption if you liked the movie ask yourself do i like it because everyone i know liked it or do i really know nothing about moviesif you want a sure thing rent the return of the killer tomatoes anything but,sad
for a long time i hated this movie  the drawn out scenes the ridiculous plot line the horrible script the melodramatic acting and to top it all off an annoying ballad to accompany this poor excuse for a feature film nevertheless this movie enthralled some moviegoers to sit through it four of five times  could i have been that wrong about the biggest box office hit in historythe answer is no  although i have seen the movie for a second time and now more clearly realize how remarkable the visual effects truly are i cant let go of everything elsekate winslet actually received an oscar nomination for her flat uninteresting portrayal of rose and people were really upset that she lost i find this hard to believe considering that winslet came off in this film like she ordered her sag card off of the home shopping network  also her pairing with dicaprio was as odd as kermit the frog and miss piggie only without the onscreen chemistry of the famous puppetsthe two interesting characters in this whole shipwreck  didnt even receive the recognition they deserved in my opinion  billy zane and kathy bates were the only people keeping me awake and they were ignored while gloria stuart received a nomination for playing a role my grandmother could have better demonstratedbest picture  i think not  however does deserve every award it has received for visual effects and art direction  im also willing to agree with the academy in choosing james cameron as best director nonetheless this movie does not have the ingredients to be considered the best picture of 1997 let alone of all time  perhaps if i watch it a third time  i doubt it  6 out of 10,sad
i admit i only wanted to see the ship when i first heard that this movie was coming out when i actually went and saw it i was so impressed with absolutely everything ive been fascinated with the for years and often wondered what it would have been like to be there not for the sinking but to be on the ship this movie brought me as close to that feeling as i think ill ever get now i know what it would have been likeim also impressed at the historical accuracy of the film its definitely a tribute to those who perished and the survivorsfor anyone who is passing judgement on the film before they see it because leonardo dicaprio is in it should get over it and see the film if you like the its worth it,sad
is not the greatest movie of all time  except box office  it is not the greatest movie of 1997  the flaws are many 1 we know the end to  that makes the last hour and a half amazingly boring 2 james cameron trivialized it by using two fictional characters 3 not many of the performances were that great  i liked paxton bates and stewart 4 overlong,sad
the special effects are of course ground breaking and the main redeeming feature of this overblown epic  unfortunately the plot and the dialogue are immensely disappointing and cause one to twitch and turn away  motion sickness bags should have been provided  would it not have been so much better if the protagonists had been a little less black and white  then a masterpiece could have been built on that wonderful background of one of the most compelling tragedies of the 20th century,sad
yes i said it george of the jungle the sequel piecing this movie apart what you have is the brendan frasier version of the old television series taking away the sinking of the ship which james cameron truly did backstage analyze what is left you have a rich girl engaged to a rich man with whom she does not wish to marry that girl our heroine falls in love with the hero who happens to be of a lesser social status the heroins mother wishes for her daughter to marry the rich fiance only for her own good and tries to convince her daughter not to marry the hero the evil fiance continues to try to kill our hero what happens in spirit at least the hero and the heroine end up together sure jack dies in but that is truly the only difference between t plotsgeorge of the jungle is by no means a better movie i didn like either of them however if you want to spend half the time in front of the screen pass over and go for george,sad
im not a person who is greatly interested in romance stories  i tend to go for actionpacked flicks horror stories mysteries or good suspense thrillers  comedies are also favorites  however shed new light on romance stories  the people in were portrayed so realistically unlike other movies  in you could actually feel what was going on inside the peoples minds and hearts  the special effects were among the best ive seen  ive only seen it four times to date and its definitely worth another four,sad
before anything let me say that this was a very good movie the special effects were incredible and the final hour was spellbindingly powerful and if the entire movie had been about this had been about the itself then i would have loved it however it wasnt instead it supplies us with two and a half hours of a boring predictable badly written and badly acted romance that is no different than any other movie romance that has been seen in the past 10 years lets see a pretty girl is engaged to a rich snob because of pressure from her parents and then a young drifter who looks suspiciously like a 25 yearold model rescues her and they fall in love gee no cliches so far some of the script was awful for example at the beginning rose says you think you can save me and jack responds no only you can do that thats fine except then at the end old rose tells her granddaughter there was a man named jack who saved me in all the ways a person can be saved which is a total contradiction to what jack told her and the worst line of the whole movie or any movie ive seen in recent years the ship is going down right in front of their eyes thousands of innocent men women and children are dying so what does rose do she looks at jack smiles and says look honey this is where we first met how dramatic i wanted to puke i realize that im nitpicking here but my point is if youre going to make a drama about such an important event why give us two hours of watching kate winslet spit over the edge of a ship and other such things ive met some morons say that they consider this to be the greatest movie ever made say what better than star wars better than the godfather better than casablanca better than schindlers list get a grip people its a good movie but youre blowing it way out of proportion,sad
i like millions rushed to see this overhyped film when it opened and what it did was just confirm what hollywood does to true life events for decades overdramatization and inaccurate storytelling of real events for those who are really interested in how events actually unfolded on the doomed steamer go run and see the 1958 film a night to remember i kept comparing the story of that film to this one and kept asking myself how can it be so different and omit so many scenes as to why the ship went down the way she did but then again james camerons script went for the old formula love story with class discrimination thrown in with a jealous fiancee does it entertain the moviegoer  it doesthe film does an incredible job of recreating the feeling that you were there through the finest details costumes sets special effects etc but the most important thing to note here is that with the sinking of came the end of the gilded age and with the release of this film it will probably close the 20th century as the highest grossing film of our era finally this film should not be on anyones best list,sad
i wont lie  i enjoyed the movie when i saw it in the theatre  the effects were awesome the cinematography was outstanding and the designs and costumes were perfect  the plot and acting were far from spectacular however  i have not seen leo act decently since his basketball diarieswhats eating gilbert grape days  now i think he rides more on how can i make this character more attractive and sexy  than how can i act like i am this person  he lacked this integral characteristic of acting in and as a result i didnt care at all what happened to poor lovable scruffy jack dawson  to be honest i cared more about his scottish friend  kate winslet was alright but throughout the entire movie it was oh no i hate the man im to marry i want to be with the dirty tramp my mother and her high society friends hate  by far the best acting came from kathy bates unsinkable molly brown,sad
ive been reading a few comments and i have finally found that i am not the only one who found this an overstretched boring waste of 2 hours an hour out of 3 was good the dialogue was boring and corny the chemistry between the leo and kate was nonexistent they did not even remotely look suited to each other he was far too small for her dicaprio didnt act that well in itwinslet was pretty goodthe effects though were excellent some of the best effects ive seen the way half the boat breaks in half and falls is amazing also when the propellors the water they look amazingbut overall i came away dissapointed my little sister 12 yrs looked bored during the film but due to the hype she said she loved it and saw it another 3 times shows that no matter how bad the film is people will flock to see it if there is enough hype,sad
you managed to push this film off the imdb top 250 list and push its rating down to 75 now i would not say this is the greatest film ever made that honor should go to seven samurai or even the best american film ever made that honor should go to casablanca but you cant tell me that there are more than 250 films better than this one certainly not the three colours trilogy the most overrated set of foreign films to come out in recent yearsi just have one request for the more than 18000 people who felt compelled to vote for this movieplease rent the quiet man only 900 people have bothered to vote for this masterpiece which is far greater thanand im a fan if nearly 20000 watch this film and vote their honest opinion there is no doubt that the quiet man would vault to the top 10 in the top 250 list thank you very much,sad
i find it interesting that so many people take the time to trash this movie they cant understand why so many people have taken this film to heart well it is after all just another piece of artistic work  and like all such endeavorsbeauty is in the eyes of the beholder  not everyone thinks the mona lisa or the eiffel tower  or even the viet nam memorial wall are worthy of praiseive seen many many times  and in my opinion it will stand the test of time as one the greatest films of ever made  i realize not everyone agrees  and i wouldnt expect that  but please dont infer that im stupid for loving this movie,sad
i have only one thing to comment got down in 1912 russians reached it in 1992 or 1993 the new russian flag on the craft was adopted in 1992 so what should be the age of rose dewitt bukater 107 as minimumit is dangerous to go so deep at this age mom,sad
this film was billed as the most accurate recreation of any film yet produced millions of dollars were spent on recreation of the ship and the voyeuristic realism of the drowning and sinking of 1500 souls it is a shame that the money spent on the script amounted to no more than 50 cents the characterisations are but unoriginal stereotypes given dull and uninspired words to mouth over the  amazing special effects  the social realism was only that of an ignorant american we are expected to swallow as believable that a 17 year old girl has the knowledge of an art historian and the wit to perceive that the works of degas and monet will be great some day the love story between her and jack dawson is laughable in its pastiche of great  cross over  love affairsfor a film to pride and promote itself on realism it seems unbelievable that social realism is completely lacking this film is more about the ego of hollywood directors and about the disturbing aspirations of nobodies for a place in historythis film will in due course sink like the eponymous ship and i trust that it to will never resurface,sad
this movie is good  it is a love story that has you rooting for jack and rose against the odds  it redeems even cal in the lifebost scene the special effects are stirring and the way cameron uses the past and present to tell the story gives the viewer a complete picture of rose  when we see the pictures of rose as she grows older especially riding the horse in front of the roller coaster you realize what jack has done for her  she has been set free to live and not exist  this movie deserved the oscar and im glad it won,sad
that is how strongly i both hated and loved this moviei hated 1leos acting job  have you noticed he plays the same character in every movie 2the fact that they got married at the end in somebodys dream 3that kate was wearing a white dress during her wedding 4that an old grandmother told her granddaughter about her sexlifei loved 1the special effects  excellent portrayal of the ship sinking 2the eye transitions were awesome 3i loved most of all when leonardo died  true i am jealous because my girlfriend had a crush on himi might be the most conservative 18yearold youll ever meet i honestly closed my eyes during the painting session but i dont think that the sex added anything to the movie  hollywood is almost forced to do that sort of thing nowadays to please everyone but it didnt please meohh and when rose tossed the diamond back into the sea it was romantic but thoroughly unrealistic,sad
 out of i have to be honest i saw this movie in the united states  in houston to be more precise and i was extremely reluctant to see it because when i first had notice that cameron one of my favorite action directors was going to recreate the tragedy i thought wheres the fun in thatso i sat down with a large popcorn in one hand and a large coke oin the other expecting to see cameron fail big time i have to say that when the movie started the music and the underwater scenes of the on its underwater and cold grave haunted me and when the movie finished i was so shocked that i couldnt even speakill start with the cinematographic elements and then ill continue with the personal ones the movies cinematography is beautifulthe edition amazing the costume design is excellent but the art direction and set design i have to say that the artists that worked on this film deserve all the existing awards for that marvelous effort james horners music is extremely beautiful and it is used in the exact momentsit is at times so subtle that it can make you weep and at moments it is so intense it can make your palms sweat leonardo dicaprio makes such an excellent performance that there were times i could swear he is really like that kate winslet is perfect as rose dewitt bukater and the loneliness and desperation her character feels is so well portrayed that i really cared for her james cameron made a movie so beautiful and well researched that he managed to create a movie that is a perfect amalgam of the historic drama romantic disaster fiction and even the action genres the movie is in its first hour and a half a movie in which we get to know the characters we get to care for them or hate them then the crashes with the iceberg some people gasped at the moment we were first confronted with the iceberg as if they didnt know that moment was inevitable in the movie and the movie turns into an action movie with dizzying chase scenes the disaster feeling of the movie is always thereand you sometimes can feel crushed by it what i also liked about this movie that at first was one of the main reasons i didnt want to see it was its budget waterworlds publicity was its budget and that movie is one of the worst movies ive ever seenso i thought what could changeoh but not every cent of those 200 million dollars is on that screen and that is something i appreciate about every cameron film i watch i think this movie deserved those 14 oscar nomination and the 11 it won because james cameron and his team outdid themselves for this movie the research cameron did and the way he manages to make fiction alternate with historic moments is magnificent i criedthis movies vision about the tragedy is so well done that i couldnt avoid it and i still cry every time i see itin the movie a character says even god himself couldnt sink this ship well that ship sank and i dont know if it was god or nature but what i do know is that someone tried to teach humankind a lessonjames cameron makes a movie approximately every three years and because of that his movies are so exact in every detail i will be desperately waiting for his next movieit will no longer matter if he changes to another genre again,sad
this movie portrays how a society based on money  power really function in sticky situation it gives a fair picture of how unfair this system can work along with being a realistic and believable movie james cameron manages to hold the audiences attention by evolving the movie and the historic happenings around the beautiful love story that occurs between rose and jack although the ending might seem unfair i think i cried my heart out the moral is that unless you are willing to let go of the safe solution in life you will never be able to gain something better she did  a wonderful movie that will make you laugh boil with anger cry shake your head  you name it it is absolutely a mustsee movie that surely will make you think 1010 stars enjoy make sure you are in a situation where you can cry and dont have to worry about your mascara running  that will just spoil part of the joy of seeing it,sad
hold on a moment roger ebert and everyone else who gave this movie a high rating the sank in 1912 with a large death toll and over 1500 stories of bravery cowardice selfishness regret horror nobility and so on is a movie about the event and unfortunately only a triumph for the special effects people the script is trite making cheap melodrama of tragedy to see the spectacular sinking you only need to view the last half hour or so,sad
if you cut out the first two hours you might have a decent movie here but most of the movie is wasted on the stupid love story and not on the true facts of what actually did happen on that night the special effects of the ship were excellent too bad it was wasted on a bad story,sad
i have heard people herald this as the work of genius  i have heard just as many people declare it the work of the antichrist  i myself spent some time most intensely i might add around the time of the academy awards in the latter group  now that i have had time to step back and organize my opinions objectively i can no longer claim that is the worst movie in history  though there are a number of places where the dialogue is unforgivable and the performances of dicaprio and zane are downright laughable i must admit that the cinematography is superb as are the directing and the special effects  i find it horrible that the lives of some 1100 people or so are trivialized by focusing on the clichd love story between the two lead  i cant however in clear conscience continue to condemn this movie as i have in the past  glistening amongst the arrid wasteland of poor dialogue are gems of writing though most of them are factual occurrences that not even james cameron would dare claim to be his ideas and visual communication  is a film of superlative nature both the best and the worst  no movie in history has been so polarized as this  there is no room for mediocrity in this selfindulgent epic,sad
i thought this movie was overrated and overhyped  the story was so dull i just wanted the ship to start sinking for possible interest  during the time when the characters could have been developed preiceburg they werent  i didnt likedislike any of the characters to care if they sunk or not  the young romance just seemed young without much chemistry between the two  sticking up the middle finger sophisticated humor there was ridiculous  they didnt do that back then  it was just thrown in for the guarantee of a laugh from the immature  the movie seemed contrived  it would have been better off as some sort of documentary minus the lame storyline,sad
i rented this a while ago with very high expectations after all it is the highest grossing movie of all time as of the time of this writing i was left pretty disappointed thats not saying the movie is without its perks the special effects are breathtaking you can tell that lots of time money effort and care were put into creating them the special effects are about all there is to the movie the story really isnt too bad but how many ways can you tell the same story a rich girl meets a poor boy and fall in love her parents disapprove not really groundbreaking the story has been told better many times before the acting is pretty mediocre leonardo is definitely just there for his looks if they had casted a good but not as attractive an actor would the movie have grossed as much as it did i think not i know about twenty girls who saw the movie fifty times each to see leos face kate winslet isnt as bad and the remaining actors do fairly well its just no surprise this didnt win any awards for acting length is also a problem if the movie were half as long id like it more the boat sinks for over an hour it looks good but it could have easily been cut down as kevin murphy might say its like they have two servings of tension and theyre stretching it out for seven people it just strikes me kind of funny that the best film ever made failed to win academy awards for best actor actress supporting actor supporting actress or screenplay on the whole there are worse ways to spend your time but the best film of 1997 should have been won by good will hunting or as good as it gets instead of this ill give it 510,sad
is an average film at its best  but certainly it is the most overrated movie in historyok the visuals were great and the last hour was exciting  but the first two hours were nothing more than a routine predictable love story that has been done over and over again  were you able to tell which characters would live and which would die the moment you first saw them enter the story  if not then youve only seen two or three movies in your entire lifeand that dialog  uggget to the theater late for this one  catch the last hour only,sad
a complete disappointment  i may be a little harsh by giving it a 5 it could have been a 6 if i did not expect so much more  the only redeeming quality was some of the special effects  most of the actors lines were corny and canned  the acting was subpar,sad
after hearing for months and months about how great was and how it will live on forever i was very very disappointed when i saw  i saw it on video and i didnt lose any of the effects because i have a theater system in my house  over all i thought the plot lame and stretched out way to far i cant belive it was that long  i could have taken a nap during any part of it and when i woke up i still would have understood what was going on and leo really didnt give that great of performance  if you really wanna see him at his best go watch whats eating gilbert grapethis movie is not going on my list of all time greats and to anyone who does put it on theirs go see some more movies,sad
i think i must have seen a different to everyone else this version lasted about 4 years had comic book characters and an ending no not the boat sinking that could be seen from miles away all in all its not a bad film the effects are breathtaking and almost make it worthwhile sitting through the sentimental claptrap that drags on and on throughout the rest of the film billy zane can be seen reprising his earlier role as a comic book character ably assisted by david warner hamming it up big style the only actors who seem to take this film seriously are leo and katethe problem is that after about 2 years all the character development is done kates marrying billy for the cash leo is the skint but lovable type and all the rest do what theyre supposed to then it just goes on and on and on until 18 months later when the boat starts to sink then this film finally starts to live up to the hype then after sinking and freezing its back to present day for a few weeks and then we get to go home againsorry i cant join the gushing praise for this film but no pun intended the rambling middle 2 hours left me cold,sad
i cant for the life of me figure out why james cameron spent so much on  okay the effects very lavish and spectacular but everything else was how can i put this politely reused  has anyone else seen a night to remember  well apparently james cameron has he recycled the entire movie and decorated it with a few pretty faces and called it  or how about that wonderful score by james horner didnt we hear the same stuff for braveheart  dont get me wrong i like horner but hes only written three soundtracks in his life he just recycles them to fit other movies winslet and dicaprio got away with sleepwalking through this film both are capable of a whole lot more but i wont deny them their moment in the sun dont get me wrong i liked its an enjoyable movie but i think the praise is a little over the top  cameron is not fit to lace steven spielbergs boots when it comes to directing and its tragic that in a world with morgan freeman that anyone with a brain can mention leo as the best actor in the world    im talking to all you teenage girls out there so lets raise a glass to get ready to toast george lucas and that golden moment when star wars episode one kicks ass at the box office cheers,sad
oh dear  i really wanted to enjoy this film but it had too much wrong with it yes you really feel that youre on a big ship but everything that happens is as phoney as a dream would they really let you roam everywhere and stand at the prow would the characters be so stereotyped with the friendly plebs dancing their joyful irish jig in the basement and the stuffy aristos so hopelessly unable to have a good time and no i dont believe the iceberg would have been so big brash and inyourface watch a night to remember for how it should be done,sad
while is not a horrible movie it really has no merit to be dubbed the greatest movie ever the love story is wishy washy the action sequences are mediocre and to really believe that a homeless man can get a woman from an aristocratic dynasty is frankly just laughable aside from all that the computer graphics were ok given the 200 million dollar budgeti just dont get it john carpenter can make a cult classic like assault on precinct 13 or halloween for a mere 100 thousand dollar budget if you care to make the argument that well that was in the 1970s well youre wrong take for instance richard rodriguez  1993 hit el mariachi he made the movie for a mere 25 thousand dollars and went on to earn more than 20 million what i am afraid of is the sort of dismembering of the real creativity of writing story script plot acting directing that really make watching movies enjoyable if you wish to add to the overblown hype to this mediocre trillion dollar production shell out your hard earned dollars and buy the video buy the soundtrack buy the laserdisc dvd and rent it,sad
right off the bat id like to say that in general i think that three hour long movies have a tendency to repeat certain parts of its plot over and over to reach its intended length see the thin red line however producer and director james cameron managed to do a noteworthy job of avoiding this snag unfortunately he made a bad movie in the process kate winslet did a formidable job excuse the phrase of trying to keep afloat her efforts were hampered by her thoroughly unbelievable lover jack dawson dicaprio his poor boy image was hampered by his lessthanrugged good looks for a troubled kid who is supposed to lead a rough life he hardly looks the part hollywoods traditional technique of making a male look more rough around the edges smearing a little mud on their cheeks and tussling the hair fails miserably on dicaprio mainly due to his flawless face and hair after two minutes of standing in the mist of the bow of the he looks frustratingly like the leo we see walking around town the film tends to drag on when it could have been accomplished in little over two hours by the time the film is over the fact that the movie is longer than it took the actual boat to sink seems much more believable,sad
sorry to add to the clutter but isnt this just one of those films you have to comment oncontrary perhaps to my rating of 510 i will say now that i actually enjoyed this movie quite a bit however 45 mins of enjoyment out of three something hours aint a lot reallyi feel this movie was an odd joining of two completely separate films one half was a good disaster movie the other was one of the worst romantic movies i have ever seenmy dad and another imdb commenter has called this romeo and juliet on the sea what an insult william shakespeare wrote some of the greatest dialogue ever in that play and it is probably the best romantic storyline ever on the other hand has some of the most awful dialogue this side of power rangers and is so absolutely and utterly cliched i could easily have written it myself in fact id be willing to bet jim cameron had a friends 5 year old son write the first half of the script its that badthe acting hmmmmm most of the supporting cast are wonderful kathie bates billy zane et al but kate and leo have no idea how to handle the romantic leads not that they were given much to work with mind you so perhaps theyre not to be blamed i doubt even robert deniro or al pacino or any other great actor could really make that trash sound realisticon the other hand i enjoyed much of the second half though not all it was suspenseful and very moving the quartet was a wonderful touch playing as the ship sinks and there are many other nice moments but for this bit of nice filmwork to be lumped onto an extraordinarily long piece of crap is a very odd dramatic choiceby the way i enjoy long movies if theyre good i love things like wyatt earp the postman dances with wolves um any costner movie thats long actually but was two movies sandwiched together and that just makes it feel clumsy and drawn outfinally the score is very nice and i do like the tune for my heart will go on which is used in the score but i hate celine dion that doesnt affect my enjoyment of the score overall thoughto conclude the way i began 510,sad
cameron wields metaphor like a terminator in a gun store but the film is still enthralling  the love story is weak and the dialog cringeworthy at times sure but film is a visual medium and is a luscious visual feast  a perverse but tantalising glimpse into the tragedy of 1912  his forte is wellpaced seatofyourpants action and it is this that he injects in to a night to remember which by comparison seems slower quieter and shallowercameron  not noted for eloquent dialog  avoided the trap of adding an archaic edge to the lines and instead went for modern phrasing in many places  this irritates some of us but probably makes the story more accessible to the younger audiencesome of us can forgive camerons attempt at a love story but only just and see beyond it to his wider skill of producing an imaginative and intricate actioncanvas  i like the film because i can see a lot of good and hard work in there,sad
the neverending story or how to take roy ward bakers film on the subject and remaking it without fantasy but with lots of money a real insult for the viewers intelligence and for the victims of this tragedy one of those cases like gone with the wind in which masses of people are taken for inexplicable reasons in the absent vision of a narcissistic director two hour and a half of absolute boredom rescued by the wonderful sinking the script seems to be done by a 12 year old kid maybe thats the reason why kids loved it that much besides kate winslet is too old looking for plausibly falling in love with a spoiled brat like di caprio appears to be no matter how hes dressed he never ever ever seems like the charming artist vagrant he declares to be mr cameron youre a damned lucky guy but i preferred you when you did terminator,sad
despite having excellent special effects there was something definitely wrong with its script was mediocre at best though some good acting did break through however in my opinion it had one major fault it was antibritishnowadays people dont seem to care about hollywood insults to their country but signs of this prejudice appear in the film for instance all of the british are portrayed as upperclass twits cowards etc who bumbled into this in the first place the irish appear as being oppressed and the americans and irish are all the heroes it was also a fact that first officer murdoch didnt act in that way and the makers had to apologise to the town and famly where he lived so when is hollywood going to end these films which attack the british evidently or subtley,sad
was one of the movies we walk into and know the basic outline of the plot before even taking our seat and watching the lights dim  the is a legend and it was an interesting idea to make a movie out of the true drama it was  however the poignant relationship between jack and rose failed to faze me at all the whole ironic situation at the end affected me little  i couldnt really empathize with such sappiness i felt like the characters and even the whole tough love story were unnecessarily cliche also it took way too long  over an hour could have been cut while still making the point  however i think the scene with the musicians and the scene with andrew staring at his clock were quite sad and wellmade the rest of it is probably not worth the 200 rental fee,sad
those are the only words to describe this truly unforgettable film i saw this film first back in december and have not forgotten it masterfully directed written and the actors are near perfect the combination of a compelling love story and the background of the and her tragedy has made a masterpiece thank you to mr cameron for making such a wonderful film i cannot wait to purchase it in september,sad
a truly beautiful film  though the dialogue was meaningless it would be just as emotional with the sound off but for the score  nice performances but nothing special again terrible lines  i cared about the characters but as usual had no idea why our two protagonists fell in love  hormones perhaps  had there not been a tragedy i dont think rose and jack would have lasted more than a yearlovely ending not the ship sinking the final scene  with a cheery sentiment ill never forget you  for sure its sappy but its also very well put together  the costumes set designs special effects  all superbly done,sad
i do not understand what the hoopla was over this film it was a decent movie that i would watch once but i would never go back to see it again and again and again  i will not be renting this one on video because it is not worth watching it if you have already seen it  i think we all know what happens in the movie a guy and a girl fall in love even though they are worlds apart the boat begins to sink do the lovers survive  since the ending is already known without having to view it even once  i am curious to know what drew so many people to see it numerous times  the storyline was sometimes no better than one of those nickel romance books and perhaps that was what drew the audience it did  there was nothing spectacular about the acting on the contrary i found all of the performances including leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet quite uninspired and boring  leonardo dicaprio does a much better job in this boys life and kate is wonderful in sense and sensibility  i think this movie is one of the most overrated films of 98 especially when la confidential was released in the same year,sad
i dont get it how can a movie with such a weak unoriginal contrived love story receive such accolades i never cease to be surprised by the stupidity of the society of the united states to consider a film great based on special effects doesnt anybody appreciate the power of the medium that can be achieved with a strong story,sad
hi my name is slim and i just saw a movie that cost enough to keep me and all my inbred cousins supplied with hooch and chips until the next millennium we are talking big bucks here so many millions that it makes even me drool and heres the kicker the plot of the movie can be summed up in about a dozen words poor boy and rich girl meet they fall in love ship sinks some folks say theres all this other stuff about man vs nature and man and technology and man and the haves and haves not but all that stuff is about 15 minutes out of the 3 12 hours the film takes so it doesnt really count you know by now im talking about made by the same guy who gave us the greatest arnold schwarzenegger flick ever made terminator by james cameron well this time around jimmy boy decides to make a movie where everyone knows the ending so he can use all his creative juices and tons of dollars from who knows where to build a 34 size replica of the ship none of those miniatures for jimmy boy oh no he wants the real thing so we got lots of nice shots of the ship sailing in the ocean shots from above and to the side and above and from the side and oh hell youve seen one youve seen them all too bad whenever the shots go into the ship and onto the ship and show what is going on you realize youve seen all that before also as i said everyone knows what happens to the ship and to most of the people on it not much suspense here we got rich folks strolling about with the women wearing these hats that could be used as landing fields for seagulls we got teeming masses of humanity dancing and drowning but not at the same time we got lust and the two backed beast between the poor boy and rich girl we got lots of people going swimming against there wishes in the dark and cold ocean we got the star of the show sinking and sinking and sinking but being brought back to life by the wonders of modern day technology three stars check it out but only if you like big ships and tear jerking love storiesel monte slim,sad
i have to admit that the sinking of is done extremely well  it is terrifying to watch and probably the closest to the real thing we will ever see  amazing special effects as well as realistic direction of all the extras  you could see that every person aboard was scared  it was very clever to show us earlier in the film how the sank from the computerised sinking shown to old rose so you knew it would break in half and how it would go down etc  i felt that added another sense of tensionthe love story that underlined the movie was what disappointed me  this kind of terrible scripting and loveyoutilltheendoftime encounters is now seeping into other movies eg armageddon  does anybody honestly think a proper girl in 1912 would indulge in spitting lessons  or pull the finger at hockleys henchman whilst going down the elevator  or make love in the back of a car with someone she has only known since being aboard thethe sketching scene is the only love scene needed  it is showing us that rose is starting to come out of her shell and rebel although it is a private moment  there is an unspoken intimacy between rose and jack that is beautiful and expresses their love for each other better than a hand pressing against a steam covered car window  im sure that scene made many a man wish he could draw his girlfriendfianceewifeon the whole parts of the film make me twinge that bloody song frinstance  as well as blatantly obvious computer generated shots and terrible scripting notice it didnt get a nomination for best original screenplay  it has been years since a film that won best film was nominated for that award the effects are brilliant along with the editing and the action sequences,sad
totally overrated dicaprio sucked when you consider his ability winslet played her cookie cutter heroine and the plot was so simplistic it was almost silly sure great wonderful that it had awesome effects and an impressive set but as a movie i found it to be lacking,sad
i saw it 5 times  i loved it it is not my favorite movie neither is it the best ever made but it is the one that has had the greatest affect on me crying months after seeing it just by listeneing to the music looking at pics etc   kate was so wonderful  so was francis fisher people thought leo was bad he did his best that the role could allow people also say that the script sucked well what could have been done to make it betteradd more complex words and if there were different actors how could they make it better love is love and true love stories are corny thats how it is ive defended in most of the ways people have complained about it i wanted to show the other side to the arrgument so all you people who hated it its ok to says you didnt like it  why just dont say outragrous remarks like leo sux  whoever liked is a moron thanx bye,sad
no matter what anyone says i still feel that is more than just a romance story people tend to forget that everything portrayed in the movie besides the love story actually happened and thats what makes it a wonderful movie i have seen it many times and every time i see it there seems to be something different something i missed something better james cameron put his heart and soul into making this movie and the result is fabulous the cast is great no not just leonardo dicaprio but it also includes other great actors and actresses academy award winner kathy bates the movie deserved to win best picture as the story includes more than just the special effects this three hour epic has continous action and never a dull moment that would guarantee to leave you crying or sitting at the edge of your seats not to mention the continous images of leonardo dicaprio for all those drooling fans out therewell done a definite ,sad
well of course i saw the movie on the opening weekend and i guess i was kinda way to psychedup because the flick didnt really live up to my expectations hey it was big  and i mean really big  beautifully shot great special effects fine actors first time i saw leonardo and he was actually okay and a really over the top budget just too bad the story sucked bigtime i mean there was absolutely nothing new it was just one big rewrite of films already shot a hundred times thats kinda too bad well,sad
one word i am sick to death of hearing jim cameron who has the biggest ego on the face of the earth has only done three good films as far as im concerned and they are the terminator the abyss and true lies i would add strange days but he had a small part of it back to why is this movie so talked about and loved im sure its the mass hysteria over leo dicrappios cute little girly face that charmed female teen audiences or kate winslets breast shots first off i did not care for any character on this boat none zilch so therefore i was relieved when the ship sank and the heartless snobs drowned note to movie makers if youre going to make a film like this give the characters some depth and life instead of flashing their cute smiles and snobby attitudes and then maybe youll have a halfway decent movie secondly why was boogie nights shunned when it was a far superior film than this and why wasnt russell crowe nominated for best actor and why oh why did this win so many oscars im crying now this is a travesty on movie goers everywhere they expect someone like me who thinks he has some sort of brain to swallow this garbage it makes me look like a fool to watch it it also has come to my attention that since this is the biggest film of all time puhlease that everyone is trying to milk it for every penny tshirts jewelry puzzles novelty items you name it its being done i could go on and on about this but i wont so to sum it all up i hate this movie i hate it i hate everything about it i detest it i despise every single thing about it  i hate hate hate hate hate this movie i hate it so much that whenever i see a commercial for it i am tempted to throw my remote control at the television and smash it yes i hate this movie i hate it i hate it i hate it so damn much i hate it,sad
easily the best film of the decade sure the script might have been polished a bit more to make it less modern but it was still very well done the cinematography and the score are simply outstanding a lot of people criticize because it didnt follow the real characters on the ship well guess what this was not meant to be a documentary it was meant to be a fictional story set against the historically accurate background of the some people have tried to say that the movie was not accurate like walter lords book i have read the book and cameron must have memorized it to match the details so well besides lord wasnt even entirely accurate his first book had the ship going down in one piece well to all the critics of i have this to say if you want to go raise 200 million and make your own version of you can do it however you want to cameron got the bucks for this and it is his vision of the story i happen to think it was money well spent wait and see but i think will be viewed as one of the more important films in film history,sad
i am just going to pretend that this didnt win the oscar for best picture and while we are in my fantasy world where people actually realise that spending the entire economy of a small country on a visual game of pretend is a terrible thing lets also pretend that helen hunt wasnt even nominated i feel better the sheer anger i feel when i see the massive amounts of money squandered in an ode to capitalism im sorry mr steinbeck some people just didnt get your graperelated novel overrides any positive points to this movie acting i would be more convincing as jack and im femalenot that leo isnt and dialogue im laughingactually im crying now i would fomally like to apologise to the cast and crew of la confidential and explain to them that the judges had all too much fun glueing those envelopes together helen hunt how could they but like to remind them that they failed to nominate pacino for the godfather or award brando for streetcar two of the most pivotal performances ever hopefully the recognition of these two colossal whoopsies will ease the pain in that neither guy pearce nor russel crowe were nominatedi just hope people dont put this movie in the same masterpiece bracket as star wars then ill be really piannoyed,sad
lets get the negative out of the way dicaprio and winselt are akin to a boston terrier and a golden retriever  they really needed a more masculine lead for the love story to be convincing but then that would have cut into ticket sales for the 1319 female demographic right  anyway one other thing that bothered me was unevenness of the dialogue  winselts dialogue seems to jump from victorian to gen x somewhere during the halfway point the merging of 90s attitude with a prewwi setting bothered me in general language cursing general attitude of some of the characters etc not to mention the way cameron manipulates the audience against billy zanes character who really has done nothing wrong until he whips out a gun near the end wouldnt you be mad if your fiance was carousing around with some strange guy days before your wedding  me too  and what was the deal with old rose throwing the diamond off the ship  that made absolutely no sense to mewith all that said the overriding message of the movie which was summarized in jacks speech at dinner is a good one the storytelling is well done for the most part and the special effects are awesome with the exception of one or two scenes,sad
the first time i saw i was swept away no pun intended by the emotion of it  i cried many tears  i claimed it was one of the best movies id seen  then i saw it a second time  let me set the scene  about 5 months after i saw the first time im in an airplane on a 5 hour flight  bing the intercom goes on annoucing that the inflight movie will be and that our captain is bob  i think that was a really good movie  so i buy a pair of headphones and settle down ready to watch a really good movie and get even more out of it that i had the first time   im watching and i start doing something i didnt do the first time i actually listened to the dialouge and paid attention to the acting  what a disappointment  this was just a stupid movie that had  some really sad parts towards the end  the acting is so phony and anyone that actually thinks that the i feel like im flying scene was the least bit well written or acted should be taken out and shot first of all youre telling me that even though this ship is in the middle of the north atlantic where there are icebergs that somehow jack and rose could wear little shortsleeved outfits come on  secondly you arent allowed at the front of the boat you are in big trouble if you are caught  i could do this for every scenelook im a teenager and a girl i think this so dont think that im some old guy  if you need a tearjerker watch terms of endearment instead it has better acting and dialouge gets a 5 out of 10,sad
in my review is the most powerful and incredible film yet to strike the theaters in sixty years ill be dragging my kids into the theater tellign them how amazine it is when the ship sinks and how real it seems the opening weekend i saw and im still watching it today its a powerful movie and it changed my life ive never felt this much about a movie sincewellno movie has shocked me like this and for yous fans there truely is never an absolution,sad
hmmmmmmmmthis film is quite goodit doesnt treat itself like it is the only film of the tragedyfor instanceit pays homage to other films of the incidentsuch as many scenes from a night to rememberone more notable being when ismayin a lifeboatturns away from the doomed liner with a look of terror on his faceis repeated hereeven the story itselfnobody who has seen 1953 can deny that the stories are a little similiarfx wisefx movies have gone from 23 to 45 and is no exceptionwith more eyecandy than firework night in las vegasthe acting is exceptionalin the collision scene you can see the fear in murdochs eyesdicaprio was oki didnt think he was ready for this rolebut he handled it quite wellbut with not as good and convincing a performance as arnie in whats eating gilbert grapebut he was goodoverrallyan excellent filmcameronyet again youve outdone yourselfjust dont make sequel,sad
its a shame  if leo and kate had given better performances especially leo this would have been a decent movie  it certainly benefitted from great cinematography good direction and awesome special effects  all it lacked was good acting and a decent story  sorry girls but leo really is a crappy actor no matter how good he looks  if they had gotten someone good like tim robbins or tom hanks to play the part my 3 hours watching this film would have been much more enjoyable,sad
after watching once many things went through my mind  people see this as a masterpiece while i see this movie as another aboveaverage movie i felt like going to the restroom after staying in my seat for more than three and a half hours counting trailers one glaring aspect i personally do not like is camerons portrayal of the third class passengers being locked in their area  this did not really happen in the true story of the  many famous people died on the ship and cameron does not refer to this  instead he plays on peoples emotions to make them feel sorry for the third class passengers misfortunes another setback i saw in the movie was dicaprios less than average acting performance  he was not nominated for best actor for a reason and kate winslet was a poor match to put with him  she looked a lot older than dicaprio and her better acting ability made dicaprios acting look even more disparaging even with the movie hoopla the teenage girl infatuations of dicaprio and the great boxoffice records it broke is not one of the best movies of all time but good enough for a night with a loved one,sad
this movie is very well done i recommend this to anyone who loves history even though the story is fictional it is still a well thought of story the graphics are excellent with the stunts and people falling into the water and screaming although mabee disturbing at times i still think it was very well done i just want to say that all the characters in the film were not real except for molly brown the countess the crew the astors guggenheim aubart the duff gordons and some other people old rose played by gloria stuart was never on the real she is simply just an actress they chose to play in the movie she was however the only person on the set that was actually alive when the real sankandrew maheux,sad
pros directing special effects score kate winslet cons turns to melodrama at the endnot the best film of that yearla confidential takes that title but the best epic of the 90s james camerons 200 million dollar tale is both epic in size and intimate and cameron provides wonderful directing and pacing for the film often named the most popular film in history it broke box office records held by jurassic park due in part to the leading man leonardo di caprio camerons film starts out slow but once the ship hits the iceberg its nonstop action till the end kate winslet character seems a bit spoilt and billy zane is unbelievable but these are minor quibbles to an otherwise terrific filmpremise film details the fate of several passengers in the maiden and only voyage of thewas nominated for fourteen academy awards and won 11 tied with benhur as the most in historygrade 9510 breathtaking epic,sad
the movie was released in 1997and after 5 yearsthe same peoplewho went gaga over the movie in 1997 are criticising it apparently for the lack of  screenplayactingdirectionwooden dialogues misinterpretation of a historical and tragical eventmy advice to them  just shut upthe movie won 11 academy awardsout of a possible 14earned billions dollars worldwidethe top grossing film of all time and what is even more heartening isit is just a simple love storyjack dawson and kate winsletthe 2 loverskate winslet is stupendous in the stripping scene and leo acts like a typical 1910s arrogantfunkyimpish lower class youthtrue to his charcterthe sinking scene is mesmerising3 hours length is perfectthe movie keeps the viewer on the edge of their seatsat least in 1997upto the last framethe movie concentrates on human emotions and understandingwhich i feel is the most paramount reason for its phenomenal successso folks get your popcorn ready for this lifetime experienceeven if it is the 140th time,sad
this movie is exactly that it is almost like a love story and a history all in one i like this film too much it maked me think hard about love toleonard caprio is the hero of the and he is a little boy who saves the ship from sinking while also having the best love affair ever it is a movie that will make me cry and you to the special effects are awwsome and kate beckingsmale is so beautiful dont worry about what they said about her being fat she could sink my boat any day so you should see this movie since it is sooo awesome and the love story even the old lady will make you cry and erecti give this movie 10 out of 10 go and sea it  ,sad

i would like to consider myself a very thoughtful and respectable film viewer i really do i have been a movie lover for my entire life and there have been a number of films that have truly changed my life thats how special some films are to me let me emphasise the word special every once in a while a film comes along that does truly change the world it is a rare occasion indeed but when it does happen it is a truly magical experience when i think of special films i think of star wars its a wonderful life singin in the rain et and the shawshank redemption these are films that have shaped the world we live in today and the way we view it movies are that powerful this is exactly why i am so incredibly displeased with many viewer comments on one of the most influential films of that last 20 yearsare you guys out of your mind truly i do appreciate the fact that everyone does indeed have an opinion to be heard but that does not give some people the right to make a complete ass out of themselveswhen i saw this film for the first time along with half of the world the lobby outside the theater was in a state of awe there were people crying smiling and in an utter state of disbelief of what they just saw there were many that were just plain speechless i had never in my life seen so many people touched by a film than of course five years latermany of the same people who i saw crying their eyes out at the end of the film and were on record as saying it was one of the best movies theyve ever seen are now blasting it why is this happening it all goes back to my original psycology theory my theory is that people just love i meen love to be the first ones to say something truly horrible about a great thing it makes them feel special unique heard and in a way powerful in their own weird way so whats the best way to recieve the attention of the cinema world with a review lets take a film that won eleven academy awards it should have won 12 kim basinger won uhh she played a prostituteuhhh yeah far stretch right the number one grossing film of all time 18 billion dollars world wide for you math experts out there for every dollar jurassic park made made two and a film that is now a cornerstone in hollywood historyand bash it to death i really do question the hearts and souls of some of the people on this planet i really truly do i will never froget the first time i viewed this film again the film isnt about effects the ship or the money this film is about love ill say that again the film is about love the musical score was stirring which won album of the year by the wayyeah it sucked the direction was flawless and the two main actorswell if you want to know why the film did so well look no further than these two the world fell in love with them both if anyone else would have been casted in these two parts it wouldnt have been half the movie it became the film caught the attention of the world in a way no film has not just the preteenage girls of the world the whole world 18 billion and 600 million alone in america there arent that many teenagers believe meso where am i finally getting at why cant people just sit back relax and enjoy the many great films we have been given over the years like again if it looks good if it sounds good and if it feels goodgosh darn itit might be good so finally for the millions excuse me billions of film lovers who loved trust me we are in the majority keep enjoying and experiencing the film over and over as for the rare few who bash it publicly so your rebel film critique minds will seem to look even more coolerdo the rest of the world a favor and watch it one more time but this time dont watch it with an open mouth watch it with an open heart,sad
deliverson that there is no doubtits a supreme blockbusterthe acting is good and the script fairly goodits the classic boy meets girl story on the doomed voyageit has been unfairly riticised for not having a documentry approach but if you want that try the splendid a night to remember the main characters are well developedpersonally i would like a bit more sub plotbut because rose and jack become real people it makes the story so much more movingthe last hour is simply breathtaking and one asks the question of one self how would i behave in that situationso watch this film in april every year and thank god you werent there 810,sad
what can be said about that hasnt already been said seriously who hasnt seen it well if your one of the few and you finally decided to take the uhmm splash pun intended there are a few rules you need to remember first give yourself time for an intermission the film is quite long second the film caters to all people there is a love story for the preteen girls and for hopeful romantics generally women and for us guys there are some cool special effects in one of the most intense disaster films ever made the final rule sit back and enjoyworking with a budget james cameron director put this gem together and created this intriguing story obviously the fate of the doomed ocean liner is true but the fictitious love story is thrown in to attract more viewers warning there is a brief but tastefully done nude scene and parental guidance is suggested also the illustrations of death and dying in the later parts of the film may be a bit too much for younger viewers now aside from that i mean honestly what more convincing do you need the film earned over a billion dollars worldwide and scored a number of oscars including best director and best picture,sad
from writerdirector james cameron presents this unforgettable cinematic event of a movie that earned all the hype awards including for best picture and became the highest grossing movie in history its the story told by a former survior named  rose  gloria stuart she tells her incredible story of her memory on including the romance she had until the disaster happened the all star cast includes leonardo dicaprio kate winslet  a total babe sam neil billy zane kathy bates david warner and bill paxton in this amazing and powerful retelling of the famed sinking this movie is true to historic detail in ways james cameron is a director who i worship and i even loved this one1010  a modern classic fable of love and tragedy you bashers should fall of the boat itself and be frozen,sad
this movie is perfect the love story was believable the acting was great special effects were wonderful this movie couldnt be better this is only movie ive bought i like to watch it again and again truly a masterpiece,sad
this is a very good old fashioned hollywood epic the two leads  leonardo decaprio and kate winslet are ideally cast their performances are good but not their best work on film the two of them however do have wonderful screen chemistry which is essential to this film because at its heart is a beautiful love story the final hour of the film detailing the sinking of the ship and fate of the passengers is heartwrenching the special effects are superb but this is not at all what impressed me about this movie films overdone with special effects today are plentiful its usually a sign that a good story is lacking has a good story though in spite of what several people have said in their comments its not a masterful screenplay but it can stand up well next to most of the great epics in film history i dont think that james cameron was trying to duplicate orson welles here this is a very entertaining film and it is really sad to see that so many people have rated it so lowly more than 5000 people have given a rating of 1 on this website i refuse to beleive that most of those people actually think this film is that bad a vote of 1 would mean that you can find absolutely no redeeming qualities in this movie whatsoever if is complete garbage as some folks have said id be curious to see what other movies you have given the lowest rating to as for myself i didnt give the highest rating of 10 i gave it a 9 it is a throw back to the kind of films that we rarely see come out of hollywood anymore also la confidential was not robbed at the oscars i liked la confidential i thought it was a real good movie alot of people though who have never seen a movie before 1990 might be overrating it a bit there are several film noirs from the past that are more cleverly written than la confidential besides the people who are voting for the oscars are not some genius film students theyre no more intelligent than the average joe so if youre gonna say that la confidential got robbed by losing to then you should realize that about 700 other pictures and actors over the last 75 years have probably been robbed as wellits nothing new prefering one film over another is a matter of personal opinion and more academy members voted for this is not the worlds greatest injustice you guys anyway anyone with half a brain knows that it was the ice storm in 1997 that got robbed not la confidential,sad
this movie is my alltime favoritethis was the first movie i ever went to a movie theater to seei couldnt wait until it came out on videoi had to see itjames cameron did an excellent job directing this movieand the time it took to finish it was worth the whileleonardo dicaprio and kate winslet did an astonishing job as young loverstheir parts show that when you love somebodyit doesnt matter if youre richpoorfatskinnyyoungoldwhen you love somebodylove is all that mattersi cried more than anything else when i saw this moviebecause its sadespecially knowing that it really happenedthe unsinkable sank and so many innocent people were killedits a sad truthand helps us relive ita love story til the tragic endis a mustsee,sad
this moviehas great moments in it such as the dramatic sinking of the ship with all the intense desperation that event brought about in the crew and passengers as they struggled to live there is no denying that movie has appealed to audiences around the world fever has once again hit young and old and im sure books produced about this tragedy would have sold well my frustration with the movie was not the special effects which were brilliant but rather the way in which the two main characters jack and rose acted in the movie it was almost as if the two characters had hopped into a time machine and magically appeared on the deck of the behaving just as they would have done in our era who really would have tolerated the activities of jack and rose as they moved about the ship in such a free and easy way the strict manners of 1912 were not the easy manners of our era i for one did not shed a tear when jack went under the water in 1912 as i would have done if he had drowned today because today he would have been at least a real person of our time the jack in this movie is so out of place and time and rose is too liberated in her behaviour for that era  really the love scene in the car is a laugh a minute the real heroes of the were the crew who sacrificed their lives for the safety of the passengers the poorer passengers who lost their lives because of the preference given to the rich in allotting spaces on the lifeboats and those men who bravely remained behind to let their wives and children get onto the few lifeboats available fictional characters such as jack and rose simply created to appeal to a late 20th century audience do these real heroes of 1912 a great disservice is a movie to see because of its special effects but it is hardly memorable in its presentation of its lead characters,sad
although ive always been very keen on movies since my childhood the ones with such classic ingredients like were never my thrill in fact they were the movies not be seen i mean a teenager is not expected to like gone with the wind fortunately one grows old and starts to appreciate movies in another dimension its not that i like gone with the wind i think its quite ridiculous nevertheless a masterpiece in its own right and timewhen my first seeing of was over i thought to myself well well my generation has a classic and what a classic excellent i was absolutely overwhelmed we all knew the story so the finale would not be the highlight you might say its quite simple but why complicate love if i were jack i would also fall in love with rose like i felt in love with kate winslet but what you may ask makes the movie so good watch it and enjoy it as a whole youll have the answer three and a half hours latermany movies ive seen since many more are to come so far this is the one the movie of my life,sad
its been a few years since i first saw yet for me it has lost none of its charm setting a love story against the backdrop of the doomed liner was bound to be a worldwide success in fact the film is probably more well known than the ship was unfortunately the film does lose something when it is not on a big screen as a tv screen in my opinion does not to justice to the sets which are exquisite and match the luxury of the actual ship although i found the love story a little disappointing it works remarkably well and keeps you guessing until the end whats going to happen to jack and rose and the fact that they run practically through the entire ship as shes sinking give the special effects ample time to shine for me the film steps up a gear after the hits the iceberg and you as the audience become enthralled in watching the chaos that ensues may i point out at this point that officer murdoch did not shoot anyone or himself in fact what actually happened to him still remains a mystery if you havent seen this film yet then crawl out from the rock youve been hiding under for the past 4 years and see it its great and the very last scene brings me up in goosebumps everytime,sad
i recently saw this great film after avoiding it for nearly three years and am sorry i did the work they put into this movie is incredible just about all details concearning the unskinkable ship herself was flawless only this year have they matched the special effects the directing was awesome couldnt of been better but what really stands out in my mind was the score the music fit the movie so well it caused the viewer to really expierence the feelings of tragedy love excitment suspence grace and pain all in one it wasnt just threw into the movie it described the essence of the film and made the movie seem that much more real the ending was very tragic and yet very exciting at the same time the entire moive was just incredibly moving even leonardo decaprio who ive never been impressed by pulled of a surprisinly well done acting ability kate winslet really made the movie though i would recomend this movie to anyone who appreciates great detail and tragical drama even those action lovers like myself but this movie isnt to be taking lightly its a journey to the past a chance to expierience history as it was and does an incredible job at it i feel real sorry for those who do not see it like that a very captivating film i am not surprised at all its the biggest money maker of all timebut this movie isnt to be taking lightly its a journey to the past a chance to expierience history as it was and does an incredible job at it i feel real sorry for those who do not see it like that,sad
there were a lot of mistakes in this movie go look at the goofs section to see for yourself it still seems pretty accurate though and its still an enjoyable movie the special effects were breathtakingly awesome the ship was beautiful and so was the background there were poignant scenes at the end like with the husband and wife and the musicians were extraordinary heroes that is the stuff i am complimenting as for the jack and rose thing well i dont really have anything to say about that i liked their scene in the third class party dancing to the music that looked like a a lot of fun this is definitely not a movie for everyone some will like it and some will not the end,sad
the portrait of a disaster the colourful description of a love affair the memory of so many lost souls on the biggest sea disaster ever a classic soundrack by james horner and a great theme song given by ms celine dion although not a fan of mr dicaprio i must admit that in this film his acting is very good indeed together with ms winslet they managed to sweep the viewers into the the world of with wonderful shots on the ship the viewer has to be prepared for a long film as it portrays many aspects of the passengers lives including love scenes between caprio and winslet if you havent seen it yet then wait no more,sad
i just finished watching this on tv its easy to see why this movie was initially overhyped and overrated then trashed as nothing more than a preteen chick flick in truth its a lot like dances with wolves a big screen three hour plus epic that grabbed a fistful of oscars then ped everyone off by beating out what many thought was a superior film for it was la confidential for wolves it was goodfellas i dont know if it was oscar material but it was definitely better than the critics now claim on the plus side no expense was spared in getting every detail visually perfect i dont know how he did it but james cameron managed to thoroughly convince his audience that it was the real we were seeing and the sinking scenes were amazingly real enough to grab the heart of the most jaded movie goer on the minus side far too much time was spent on the fictional romance between jack and rose the story of the itself contains so much drama that wasting two hours on this love affair was simply not needed in short this could have been the film of the 1990s instead it ended up as a good but not great moneymaking blockbuster,sad
i am amused by the rash of negative reviews lately  a few points1  the reason isnt selling like hotcakes anymore is because everyone owns it2after the first viewing of any movie the experience cannot be as special because you know whats coming  movies dont get lame with time they just lose their luster and mystique3  does it contain faults  of course did it deserve multiple oscars probably not  is it horrible bilge  absolutely noti honestly think some reviewers prefer to go against the crowd simply out of spite rather than worthwhile objectionsthe only gripe i had was the constant stereotypical portrayals of the rich as evil soulless jerks except for kathy batesotherwise we have a beautifully shot tragic drama without the obscene graphic filth present in so many modern films  that alone makes it a pleasurable experience for me,sad
perfect in practically every way and probably my favorite romance aside from casablanca 1010 the 3 hour length did not bother me the ship itself of course is gorgeous and the score is excellent leonardo dicaprio who never had impressed me much before was quite good but not nearly as good as kate winslet who i feel deserved the best actress oscar although i love helen hunt dearly victor garber who played the builderdesigner of the is excellent although underused and underappreciated gloria stuart is great in her supporting role but not as good as the incredible kathy bates as the unsinkable molly brown my favorite character the direction by james cameron is incredible especially during the actual sinking of the which is incredibly moving and well done sure to be considered a classic for years and years to come1010,sad
some day there will be commission of people consisting of film critics movie fans and of people with good taste  intelligence  they will investigate the crime that was winning the oscar for best picture for 1997   it was bad enough that won anything at all but for it to be named best picture over la confidential or any other good film that came out in 1997 is a crime against anyone who values wellacted intelligent and wellcrafted films is basically an overblown soap opera featuring a manboy hero leo dicaprio a cartoonish badguy zane and an inaccurate portrayal of life in 1912 and of events that took place that terrible night    women in those days did not flip the bird  no officers or crewmen killed anyone or committed suicide with a gun what is worst is that is simply a banal film  yes it has very impressive special effects and looks quite real but its boring to sit through it a second or third viewing  it has no more depth than an episode of baywatch,sad
i like leonardo dicaprio i think he was excellent as jack dawson and i think too that he deserved at least an oscar nomination for his work deserved to win best picture and i really dont care what sort of flak id probably get for saying all that but i like i was 12 when i saw it and i remember clear as day being touched by it it may be tacky sappy or just plain unbelievable but is one of the more memorable movies ive seen its basically mindless entertainment brought to life by a group of actors who can really act dicaprio kate winslet billy zane etc its mindless entertainment that tells a rather corny but moving tale of two people brought together and torn apart by fate and its mindless entertainment that just happened to make millions at the box office and just happened to scoop oscars left and right what are you going to do about thatwhat i like about is the simplicity of its plot yes it has one i hate to reiterate but a story about two different individuals falling in love while theyre on the legendary doesnt get anymore complicated than that call me a sap if you must but my attempts at swallowing the huge lump i had in my throat when the film concluded were futile one cannot help but be touched by jacks sacrifice for rose and it also helps that theres real chemistry between dicaprio whos a truly gifted actor and winslet and again you cant help but want them to be together i usually stay away from romance films as a lot of them are crap and have retarded plots but is an exception its 3 hours long and throughout those 3 hours theres not a boring minutelet me first declare that my admiration for dicaprio has got nothing to do with looks i have just recently became a huge fan of his and if its got to do with looks shouldnt i be obsessed for lack of a better word with him 3 years ago having that said despite what a lot of people think dicaprio is more than a teen idol or a pretty boy with no acting talent jack dawson may not be an awfully hard character to play but dicaprio excelled in his role like he always does hes one of the most talented actors of his generation others include joaquin phoenix and his works before should more or less prove thatsomething to ponder about if was an independent movie with a budget of much less than what it had would you hate it too,sad
i have set it upon myself to write this review to tell the trough about to expose its number one weakness so that it no longer be confused with any others why do so many hate this movie and are ready to swear that it is one of the worst ever made perhaps they should expose their eyes to everyday movies more often if they speak thus let us examine the movie the acting while not all that brilliant is sufficient for the parts to come through honestly enough the dialogue while not the greatest or deepest is appropriate and lets face it in view of what comes out now a days quite descent the length of the movie may be long but is i feel necessary and the movie does hold attention with ought becoming a bore the special effects are no one can dispute magnificent and the costumes realistic so what is so incredibly bad about this movie it is alright it is in fact better then alright it is a rather darn good movie about love with a historical background the biggest weakness of this movie is that rather then being viewed as pretty dang good it was rather viewed as the best thing ever created by man or god as history shows when something is overrated a lot of people start to boo it for being unworthy and thus call it total crap,sad
i loved the movie it was wonderfully directed acted and produced the special effects were amazing the best part was the love element leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet made a great team the end made me cry i love the romeo and juliet playover it was very factual ive read a lot about the actual what amazed me was how the actor playing the captain resembled the real captain so much,sad
is one of those films that is truly better then the sum of its parts  has a servicable plot good acting great special effects there is some real chemistry between the lead actors and has one of the best scores for any film i have ever seen  at 3 hours and 15 minutes long the film is surprisingly well paced and except for a few instances is never too boring  though is a good film it does contain some flaws in some insintances very poor diolouge some poor acting on some occasions ecspecially by leo and the end of the film gets a little repetitive at times  other then these few mistakes jim cameron did about as good a job as possiable if you want to see how bad it could have been go and see the piece of crud that was pearl harbor  i give the film 9 out of 10,sad
it was much better than i had expected having heard mixed reviews  it didnt seem to be just an excuse for special effects even if they were extremely impressive  overall i would say it was one of the best films of the 90s,sad
four years and many notable awards including best picture oscar after and the alltime box office number one position why did succeedpersonally it was magical the recreated ship the sinking the digital effects were all a beautiful backdrop to one thing  the love story the love story was the fantastic notion that love has no limits love crossed class barriers and it won our hearts in the endeven if true love like this doesnt really exist its nice to think that for three hours here at least it does,sad
i have always been a little against so called classic films especially gone with the wind which i really dont like  but even after seeing about 50 times i still agree with my first impression of it  i was basically dragged by the hair to watch this film by my friends as id seen a night to remember and couldnt really be bothered with this new film  however i was so mesmerised by my first visit that i saw it another 5 times at the cinemas the story is simplistic yet powerful  the acting is great  and the cinematographywell what can you say about some of the shots in this film  will one day be a classic up there with casablanca etc,sad
on first viewing i loved against my desire it had one of themost beautiful musical scores id heard so haunting and captivating itmade my heart sink in a dizzy flutter of melancholic wonder idpreviously loathed celine dions music and despised her milking ofemotion  but my heart will go on broke down my resistance via thisfilm and its instrumental scoring therein one of my guiltiest pleasuresremains this film which many of my alternative instincts demanded i hateon principle ie 10 or more smaller films could have been made for thecost etc i saw several times at the cinema but avoided seeing it on videoi doubted it could work minus the giant screen and surround soundlast night  nearly four years later  i watched it on televisionnervously but revisiting in this way didnt destroy the majestybut brought a sense of renewal the film retains a magical romanticquality that becomes most apparent in its moments of silence as thesails over the water and the characters exchange wordlessglances while that wonderfully melancholic and dreamy score drifts roundthe mind i was also afraid the external issues which came to shadowover the film the oscar stuff the cost the negativity star egooverexposure and so on would impact on my experience along with ageand changes in my life yet none of these issues took hold the film isstill arresting sweet powerful and convincing small moments andcertain shots remain classic touches and trademark the film as amemorable movie the plot involving love against the odds and a struggle between socialdistinctionsclasses is hardly the simple cliche that many criticalapproaches to the film emphasise its a daily everday experience thatthe film raises to epic grand levels  as film inevitably always doesby its very nature the story of two strangers who  through luck onjacks part and failed social engineering on the part of roses mothermeet aboard the unsinkable supership and find themselvessubverting the order of things in the name of love  and finding thatlove changed forever by the tragic sinking of  resonates with agrandeur that is never arch or distant the film always trusts theyouthful idealistic exuberance of love and the rest of the events paleinto the background if the script is anything it is a submissive crutchto the passion which drives the film if there is a commonunsophisticated touch to it maybe that shouldnt be so quickly dismissedor treated with such negative ire  common after all also means widelycirculated and available to more than a privileged few the performances grow more interesting as time flows on dicapriossmarm becomes more and more of a charm as winslets reserve feels moreand more a crumbling cage for her passion as a couple they offer ayouthful charge never more apparent than in the scenes in thelowerclass quarters below as their romance takes a furious hold andthe framing story is a nice adjunct as the adventurers and divers areenthralled by the older roses heartbreaking tale of love loss and themagic of memory as a depiction of oral storytelling it makes one longfor the intimacy of such a situation and cherish the deeper feltcommunication between friends lovers and sometimes  maybe mostmagically of all   strangers characters like jack and rose remind us of the romantic dreaminess ofbeing young and growing learning and experiencing which remains agreat antidote to the cynicism and callousness of many other popularfilms long live diversity and unexpected treasures like,sad
this blockbuster is a milestone in film making and a career peak for directorproducer james cameron  when this film bowled over the competition except in acting and writing categories at the academy awards  it could be the occasion of a gleeful selfcoronation mr cameron as king of the world  it had set box office records and was probably also recordbreaking for multiple ticket purchases by teen fans of such a long epic  like its older sister gone with the wind this best picture oscarwinner exists in a selfenclosed quasihistorical environment where the beautiful survive and thrive despite morally despicable transgressions it claims to be inspired by actual events around the sinking and recent rediscovery at oceans bottom those who love feel that the mismatched couple outdo romeo  juliet as a most appealing eternal couple  teen fans of leonardo dicaprio would gladly throw caution to the wind as did the lead actress who poses nude quite immodestly  as an unimpressed but still positiveminded fan of this movie overall however i have loads of questions to ask those who defend this as one of the alltime best movies afi put it in the category of most thrilling in its 2001 list recently  for example shouldnt a more specific disclaimer be attached to the closing credit acknowledgments about the ships crew and captain who are transformed unnecessarily and untruthfully into brutish villains since real names of actual dead are attached to some inspired crew and passengers attentive audience members assume that those historical people who deserve blame like bruce ismay are those who did kill and threaten others and otherwise act like the most wicked people ever  too many names can be exonerated and should be since this script took liberties with depicting the desperate final actions of the crew  as a second example why doesnt molly brown get her lifeboat over to help those floating in lifejackets in regular history this is  part of her claim to fame  furthermore what happened to fabrizio in the films middle  how is it that the 100 yearold is unsupervised at films end  does the special effects wizardry paper over and rationalize the simplistic chase elements of the films quite long middle  i felt a bit confused whether the drowned victims were mostly caged in by the classbigots among the fictional crew stewards or if they were just too slow in figuring out a strategy like the romantic couple had as the goes down for the third time  any help on these issues mr cameron and defenders of his script  i didnt expect to know if time stood still when the ship takes on water but the film takes the worst spin on how the lifeboats get loaded and away in time to save only 13 of those aboard  were these numbers strictly correct the facts could have been a little better adhered to in my opinion again this is an amazing entertainment product and a hollywood legends masterpiece,sad
what can i say that hasnt already been said this film really is good a sweet little fairy tale turned into a tragic and thought provoking story true theres a cliche romance between a princess and a pauperbut i can think of no better princess my favorite actress kate winslet and no better pauper the boyish but talented dicaprio unlike the bloated and lets make you tear up and hey james cameron did it lets just pick another historical event pearl harbor this film some how stays with me and manages to jerk a tear or two even the 43rd time ive seen  it my friends and i mock this show at times but deep down if we admit it or not we all love this film it really do think it will stand the test of time,sad
i have seen this movie over 20 times now and i still fall in love with this moviethe tragedy of the was very sadit was also a very touching story tooall the men who was on aboard the risked there lives so they can let their wives and there children live to see another daythats what life is about men does everything for their wives and their childrenbut when it comes to the day when the world comes to an end or the ship sanks they would risks their lives for their love onesleonardo dicaprio and kate winslet were both great actors in this movie and the two charcaters from this movie really had alot in common and they really knew that they were meant for each othercal who is played by billy zane was never there when she had troubles in life or etccal didnt even want to talk to rose even she had problems of her own and also with cal she never had fun in her lifewhen people grow up they missed out on alot of things toysvideo gamessportsfriends partieseverything people had are gone and rose just wanted to had fun in her life like she never hadthis absolutely a great story its rated pg13 and is only permitted to teens this will teach a lesson to all of usthis movie gets 10 out of 10 stars,sad
never deserved best picture and certainly not in a year when as good as it gets was in the running a movie which received a higher rating on this site bytheway i hope this means that people are realizing that selling lots and lots of tickets does not a great movie make especially when sales are heavily tipped by groups of 12 year old girls going to see leonardo dicraprio over and over but this is for whom the movies are filmed and the music is made so i deal with it by writing reviews like this about movies i hatethe movie was just too damn long about 3 hours too long i thought boat would never start sinking and then i thought it would never stop the only part of the movie i really enjoyed was the scene with them dancing on the tables if this movie was cut to 85 minutes it might have been tolerable but as is i gave it a 510 i only gave it that much because it was visually impressivei dont think i would have been as hard on this film if i hadnt been subjected to night after night of hearing about it on the evening news but nothing changes the fact that the film is very clich and a big waste of time,sad
i saw a dismal film ahead when i first saw the opening credits but it was still entertaining and a little tragic  in the typical james cameron style this film is just crawling with stuff you wouldnt believe  the movie starts out dull with gloria stuart helping to pad out the first ten minutes but then it really gets rolling  afterwards i had to ask myself hey got a cigarette  i felt spent and thats typical of cameron movies too  if cameron made a biblical film i bet hed have a twenty minute crucifixion scene  the sinking was incredible and they saved the best for last the rest is just another day on board a loveboat style ripoff  oh well camerons not much without his special effects here but thats what everyone who goes to see this movie already knows  james cameron should stop giving himself orson welles injections and just stick to making action movies  i just keep thinking of those slick effects in his other films and how beautiful they all were  this movie  i guess james was just trying to display some emotion but it was corny  the sinking is what this movies about rating 710 bill paxton must have been depressed about his part in the movie,sad
has a large number of fans that will cheerfully proclaim that it is the best movie ever made and a large number of detractors who will cheerfully proclaim that is nothing but puerile overrated garbage  the truth lies somewhere in between  definitely shouldnt have won the best picture oscar in 1997  but to dismiss the film as utter crap is very unfair  tells a complex tale and for the most part tells it very well  the fact that parts of this tale are either predictable or flawed shouldnt be ignored but it also isnt enough to turn into a rotten movie has a slightly predictable story but most films involving a wellknown historical event tend to be predictable  before the movie even starts anybody watching should be able to predict a few things the will set sail in glorious fashion with its owners grandly proclaiming its unsinkable nature there will be a story about the passengers some fictional some real the will sink in a slow and horrible fashion and while the ship sinks the characters will be forced to deal with their own mortality and some will be heroes while others will be craven cowards  see  predictable  it doesnt take a genius to realize that the historical nature of dictates this story structure after all its the structure james cameron actually uses  but the execution of that structure    well that takes some talent if the film has any aspirations of being good  it means blending action romance drama and historical accuracy  and james cameron blends them all splendidlythe main story concerns a young girl named rose dewitt bukater kate winslet traveling to america in order marry an arrogant millionaire named cal hockley billy zane  the marriage which has been arranged by her formerly rich and nowdestitute mother frances fisher is abhorrent to rose so in a desperate attempt to escape her fate she attempts to jump off the ship  of course she doesnt jump but is instead saved by the happygolucky jack dawson leonardo dicaprio and of course the two begin a brief if implausible romance  this romance which is perhaps the weakest part of is still vitally important to the story    because it gives the audience a very strong reason to care about these characters when the ship hits the iceberg and about the choices they make could it have been better  absolutely  but considering that the romance is a means to an end rather than the end itself its not baddicaprio is superb as the wideeyed vagabond jack dawson  he brings enough earnest enthusiasm to the role to make it totally believable as to why rose would fall in love so quickly with him  winslets slightly less believable though shes good but not great  she puts in a nice quiet restrained performance but its so restrained at times that it borders on comatose its actually the minor characters that add some zip to  billy zane is outstanding as the villain hockley as he gives hockley enough human nuances to make him seem like a flawed arrogant person and not just some standard bad guy ripped straight out of a flash gordon serial  also worthy of note is the modernday interaction between deepsea explorer brock lovett bill paxton and the elderly rose gloria stuart floating on an exploration ship far above the watery grave of the  no only does their interaction serve as a brilliant unobtrusive way of relaying the historical facts about the final hours to the audience but paxton also manages to become a surrogate for the audience  as the movie unfolds and gets more and more interesting its a neat touch to see his character lovett become more and more fascinated with roses storiesit would be remiss not to mention the special effects of which by and large is the films strength while the ship and its sinking is a product of cgi effects and model works its done it such a realistic manner that it never calls attention to itself or reminds the audience that theyre watching a movie of more importance is that the films effects while spectacular never are the film  they always support the films storythere are many things to nitpick about although i find it hard to believe that people really nitpick the minor historical inaccuracies of the film cameron got all the major details right and the films probably more than 95 accurate for crying out loud  but those problems are nitpicks  very tiny but slightly irritating details nothing more  they keep the film from being an alltime great but they certainly dont make it a bad film  the blend of romance action history and special effects probably explains the films vast appeal  theres certainly something for everyone in this film  and it also makes an excellent if not perfect movie  grade b,sad
forget all the hype forget that since this tradegy happened it has been americas most popular story  if you strip all the attention surrounding this movie away youre left with a bigbudget film that is just that  bigbudget  the film overwhelms itself with a ridiculous amount of foreshadowing  the acting is nothing to be accoladed  i wasnt even impressed with the magnificent kathy bates performance  the costumes special effects and soundtrack were all good points in the film however i do not like the fact that the academy awarded this film so heavily  it was simply an overhyped epic not a film worthy of 11 of hollywoods most prestigious award  james camerons egodriven direction really spoils this movie  i would recommend seeing this movie just because it is the tragedy of the century but dont fall into the trap of thinking this is a quality piece of filmmaking  i voted 510,sad
let me start by saying that this is a good film and i enjoyed it the first time i saw it in the theater  whew okay with that out of the way let me just say that this is quite possibly the most overrated flick in history of film  its good and thats it  its not great its definitely not rewatchable and most importantly it is no best picture  i dont mean to sound angry but if you can honestly say that this film is better than either good will hunting or as good as it gets then youd be the first ive come across  the only thing that saves this movie is that the horribly predictable and cliche story line doesnt get in the way of the barelyaboveaverage special effects  and boy does it drag on  when i saw it the second time i kept looking at my watch thinking that the flim was really dragging and then it occurred to me  the hasnt even begun sinking yet  its such a huge relief when the film ends that its hard to be moved or amazed by it leonardo di caprio could not have played his role more flatly if he tried kate winslet barely pulls her part off as well and her perfomance reminded me more of a soap opera rather than a best picturei have no idea how this movie made so much money at the box office if you didnt catch it in the theater then dont even bother renting it  whatever little charm it has is entirely lost on a small screen maybe if you rented it and muted the sound you could enjoy a few parts of it at leastand to conclude i just want to say how dirty it was for the films creators to sneak in bill paxton  bill paxton is notorious for sneaking himself into film roles and promptly ruining the movie  youll never see his name or his part in any of the commercials or trailers but sure enough wham suddenly he appears all fired up to ruin the movie  lucky for him was already sunk before he had the chance to put another hole in the ship nice work billall in all its an okay film thats easily forgettable because something better comes along all the time  i feel for the producers  directors  writers of as good as it gets because they were robbed by this movie i bet you cant sit through it twice,sad
james cameron is one of worlds greatest directors even before he was but this is magic movie making of him as usual everything from directing acting score technical wonder to the story everything is great thanks to camerons vision james horner is another master i can still hear his master work from aliens in my ears this is the best epic i have ever seen and its one of camerons best pictures but all his films are great really,sad
bloated syrupy disappointment  even the special effects were bad  it was painfully obvious every time they went digital  took me right out of the movie each time  watching little digitized people fall down the screenwhat entertainment  i rather play pong,sad
the real history of some of which is touched on in this mess is a compelling story while this flick might be romeo and juliet at sea i found the whole shebang was at seathe good thing is is full of fine actors from david warner to bernard fox right through jonathan hyde and even soap star eric braeden the bad thing is we dont see enough of themwhat we get is an awful lot of leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet if either of those two if youll pardon the pun float your boat then youre on easy street i cant stand either of them and unfortunately what should have been a mawkish subplot is the mawkish major storyline the trivia item that leonardos part was offered to johnny depp and he declined practically broke my heart i tried making it through this gargantuan waste of celluloid with the lovers then i tried fast forwarding through scenes of those two infernal bores    and realized i was losing nearly all the movie there was no escaping themthe movies major flaw apart from casting those two simps as the leads is that the major part of the movie set in 1912 doesnt really gel with the modern scenes furthermore not for a moment did i buy gloria stuart as an older kate winslet i assume that idea which was presented up front and so isnt a spoiler was carried on through the movie i dont know because i was simply unable to finish watching it was boring fortunately i was watching on vhs tapes i picked up for free at a book sale it was on two tapes and i never bothered putting the second one in i suppose thats where all the real drama and big effects come in but the first half was so tedious i saw no reason to bother with the rest after all i know what happened to the ship in the end though i wont reveal it hereits too bad because i was something of a buff in high school therefore i was able to spot little historical errors i also hate historical movies and tv shows where some familiar actor is introduced briefly as a real person and then the fictional ie phony story rolls onin this case the affair between leonardo and kateperhaps its a curse but no really good movie has been made about the one with clifton webb was too soap operaish and had a silly ending the one with kenneth more tried to be fairly accurate with information known at the time now all blown to bits by the discovery of the ship itself this one is not really about its about the love story and is worthy of any 1970s disaster movie it could be set on the poseidon in a towering inferno or on krakatoa all i know is it seemed to go on and on and on until little bits of me started dropping off if id been on with those two id have gone down with the shipperhaps people were drawn to this the same way they were to the practically endless doctor zhivago in the 1960s for a fiery love story at that time set against a great historical backdrop too bad omar sharif wasnt the lover in this one at least hes always been good for a few laughs but kate winslet is no julie christie and why should she be she was bad enough in hamletoverall this must be the most overrated monster in the history of the talkies it was supposed to be about the tragedy of with all its needlessly lost lives yet i was reminded of the line of oscar wilde about a work of dickens one must have a heart of stone to read the death of little nell without laughing but doesnt even have enough hoots in it to make it as watchable as plan nine from outer space just because something is popular doesnt make it good,sad
my favorite moviei really really enjoy that and enjoy leonardo dicaprio actingi love that,sad
i really hate the yes its full of romance yes its a real life tragedy but please people stop crying at it because its a crime against film i dont care if soppy romantic types did spend their entire weekends crying after seeing it get over it its not that good and no i did not cry ghost made me cry bambi made me cry reading true life accounts of what happened on the made me cry but the film it is so bad that i cried more at marley and me i wish that theyd just hurry up and get to the part where the ship sinks honestly they completely romanticised a terrible event so my verdict is over watch ghost instead,sad
im a guy this is a love story put those together and you get my answer meh i really dont see why this is the topgrossing movie of all time but hey bush was elected to a second term well the whole movie is leading up to the best death ever in a movie the propeller guy i mustve watched that scene a thousand times in fact i dont even watch the first tape for those who have the vhs you know what im talking about the last half of the movie is what makes it screw the love story this gets a six outta ten just based on the propeller guy this is just filler to get 10 linesthis is just filler to get 10 linesthis is just filler to get 10 linesthis is just filler to get 10 lines im too lazy to put something,sad
truth is stranger and more interesting than fiction and this movie proves it  aspiring comedians that take courses on perfecting their art are always told that their real life is a much more interesting place to start than the imagination when writing material  why  truth is often more interesting than anything that you can come up with on your own  i think this is the reason why this movie is so contrived and phony  rich girl poor boy snobbyevilshallow rich people noblehappy poor peoplecan you get any less original  the stereotypes are offensive as well  all the irish people are drinking partying poor people and the rich are all coldhearted wasps  then there is the dialog  i was cringing at every line and actually felt bad for the actors because they had such awful lines to work with when i first saw this movie i thought the lines sounded so bad in part because of some poor acting  since then i have seen other movies with leo in them and can see that he is a good actor but just had some awful material to work with ini wish that the creators of this film used the real story of the as a source of their inspiration  instead the main focus of the movie isnt the or all the real people that lost their lives in this tragedy the movie is really mostly about a fake love story that reaches new heights of cheesyness  i think making a movie about two fake people two fake annoying people named jack and rose makes light of a very real event where many real people died  i bet every single one of those real people had a more interesting life than jack and rosethe movie does however have one good thing going for it  it does have good special effects  this saves it from getting the lowest possible score i gave it 210,sad
however apparently fans of this film are quick to think people dislike it because of him not true this movie could suck the ship itself through a coffee stirrer its so horrible i love most of james camerons work but honestly after i saw this i lost faith how do you go from terminator aliens t2 strange days etc to this howanyway back to the dicaprio thing you people who bash this movie simply because you hate him need to see whats eating gilbert grape or the basketball diaries or something he in fact can act you people who think everyone hates this movie because of their jealousy or whatever towards leo can it i know im not the only one who thinks hes a decent actor yet also thought was a stinkerthe problem lies within camerons script the dialogue sounded like he was still writing for arnolds t800 not a problem if the characters happened to be cyborgs but unless im mistaken they were actually supposed to be real peoplei give it 310 it wouldve been a 2 but i got a chuckle when the guy fell and smacked into the propeller,sad
by now everyone has seen this film so theres no need to give details youve heard all the preteen girls and middleaged housewives rave about it now here are thoughts on this film from a male i dont have a vendetta against this film except being dragged to it twice and being forced to see it again on video oh the humanity ok maybe i do have a small vendettais visually impressive sfx are impressive as well its really sort of neat to see the whole incident recreated on film as for the story is at the same time a selfimportant and impossibly simplistic film characterization in seems to be done with a very large club the dialogue in the same fashion dont expect any subtleties here what you hear from the characters is exactly what is going on its pretty much a paintbynumber lovetragedy and unless youre especially sappy the dialogue is likely to range from flat and predictable to downright appalling it reminded me of watching a couple at a junior high dance call each other pooky or somethingthe old woman at the start and finish of the film is a bunch of boring nonsense why waste the viewers time seeing the heroine as an elderly invalid no one came to the theatre to see that they could have at least made her accent match winsletsyou know the drill the princess falls in love with the pauper im not totally opposed to the romance picture if its done well but this one simply is not they call each other by name in every sentence very annoying a romance film is only as good as the dialogue and the scenes where you see it all come together sorry but teaching a girl to spit before having her pose nude for pictures isnt really my idea of romanceits also very clear what cameron wants you to think except for jack and rose every poor person has a heart of gold and every rich person on the boat is evil and deserves to be well drowned like a rat the passengers are stereotyped so badly the rich people being snobs scenes will likely leave you rolling your eyes ok they are bad rich people and poor people are basically good we get it alreadyi find it puzzling that so much time was obviously spent on the effects which were to be fair excellent and yet we get such a basic script that this basically becomes a thinlydisguised welltargeted effects movie effects are great but cant salvage a poor eccentric script and belowaverage performances from its actorsnot much was made about the length of this picture but i found it to be excruciating it boggles the mind how cameron could write the most simplistic script ever and stretch it out to be so long that you start hoping the  damn  boat would just sink alreadyahemcameron is great  at directing a visual picture but dont expect him to write a masterpiece effects are great but this film is far far too long for a script with all the complexity of a coloring book visually stunning is no doubt about that but when it comes to substance is all wet,sad
is probably the worst movie ever a 200million dollar budget and all we get is a sappy lovestory james cameron proved to everyone just how bad a director can take something when his ego gets in the way there is no one good thing about this unecessary sex bad cast annoying special effects and no boat this was clearly camerons vision as he knew that if he did not sell out he would have the biggest bomb in his laps there were so many historical inaccuracies that i lost interest within 1 hour needless to day i wish i could have those 3 hours back the film attempts to cross modern survivor recalls past theme it doesnt work the movie was not art in anyway when a director is spending 200 million i have a right to expect a little more than a love story that is a historically impossibleupper class never married nor dated lower and b horrible acting to this junk get all those oscars is a crime how could something like this win over gandhi and the last emperor those are art films that didnt need a huge budget the in short is nothing more than a chick flick no art no talent no screenplay makes for one giant piece of junk,sad
pardon my bluntness but this movie sucks  its nothing more than a cheesy love story that weve all seen a hundred times  nice girl bad boy evil fiancee blahblahblah oh yeah the ship sinks at the end what this movie should have focused on the tragedy of what happened that night is missed  we get a three hour love story and a one hour sfx overload  yeah greatest movie of all time alright,sad
perhaps my expectations ran too high when i watched this movie but im rather inclined to think that this is the most overrated movie thats ever been made although the historical facts are of course known the story holds no surprises at all and the characters are full of clichs which makes it really hard to watch the whole movie without being lulled to sleep or bored to death of course its a very emotional film with a romantic love story but the lovers stay twodimensional unless you happen to be a true leonardodicapriofan and as i havent been one before i certainly wont be one now as to the ships sinking itself which is what the average viewer might have paid for to watch its probably impressive and satisfying for most viewers but i think it is reaching our lowest instincts by satisfying our greed to watch catastrophes from a safe distance eg your livingroom or local theater and gladness its not us who are fighting for life unfortunately theres really no more than that to the film so if you havent seen the movie before keep your money and find something worth while doing,sad
this movie which is mediocre at best has been called a modern classic by many if there wasnt such a media following to this soso movie i mightve actually enjoyed it but however my expectations were high and the movie simply did not deliver not worth wasting 3 12 hours of your life on,sad
i dont know quite how to describe this film when it was in release everyone was calling it an instant classic but now it seems everyone hates it people make up one opinion and stick with it but i say this film is and always was terrible the most horrid was of 194 minutes in my entire life the story of the first off is not very interesting to watch for three odd hours and the artificial love story does not help down this horse pill of a movie the music is the only thing that i enjoyed but even that wore out its welcome near the last hour of the film cameron shouldve sunk this film before it came out and robbed people of 18 billion hardearned dollars im sorry to myself for seeing this film because everyone else was and im sorry to everyone else who saw this embracement for this reason it is not the fan of film just the fan of stupid dialogue and great big ships sinking with bad graphics and all now give the phantom menace a break will ya and say something about this shipwreck510 i cant bring myself to give a movie the same rating i gave to the 1998 version of psycho otherwise i would be most inclined to slap a goose egg on this one,sad
warning slight spoilers this movie was supposedly great an unbelievable experience i heard well of course like all other leonardo di caprio movies it is boring from start to finish the main story is peasant jack dawson leonardo di caprio falling in love with rose kate winslet who is of a much higher class that storyline is supported by the great ship crashing into an iceberg  doing the unthinkable it sank on its maiden voyage this film is poor because really in my view its just an excuse to get leonardo di caprio together with yet another woman it is one of the worst films i have ever seen  after all the praise it got i was surprised when i saw the film my advice is if you havent seen the film yet dont bother you will be disappointed my message to director james cameron is the film took 3 hours and 10 minutes of my life away and i want them back i rate this film a very generous 2 out of 10,sad
this film is so egregious i sometimes wonder if it wasnt constructed to be campy on purpose a la a john waters film  the dialogue is beyond cheesy and the scene where kate winslet spit on billy zane is like something out of a gradez soap opera  i didnt believe a second of this film  it is extraordinarily fake in every respect even the special effects are bad even a blind man could tell that the ship is computer generated which is especially pathetic given the bloated budget  do not watch this film,sad
this movie is complete rubbish it is two hours too long and it has terrible acting in it the ship was the only thing really impressive and kate winsletts boobs but leonardo dicaprio was totally miscasted for the movie the love story is pathetic the sinking of the boat is also quite impressive but pearl harbor has much better effects than this this movie stole a whole bunch of academy awards,sad
11 oscars for was a misjudgment ben hur is the only movie for 11 oscars,sad
oh and a ship sinksimpossible to watch in a single sitting,sad
it is quite easy to be swept away by outstanding cinematography or exceptional musical score and as a result a lot of its obvious flaws and faults seem to be overlooked as an objective viewer however it is quite obviously an unfortunate disappointmentas stated before the cinematography in is fantastic with a lot of widescreen shots of the ship from high angles a couple of scenes such as the attempted rose suicide near its start or when the final part of the ship goes down do look pretty bad and fake though but for most of the film it looks pretty beautiful the indoor set design is also amazing and it basically breathes 1912 to look at its elegant and artistic design the musical score by james horner is also  as to be expected from him  a beautiful emotional piece that seems to fit extremely well in however while it is a very stylish film this way it doesnt manage to be impressive on the actual substantial aspects of cinema such as its acting or its screenplay which are both very inconsistent to say the least billy zane kathy bates  bernard hill are some examples of actorsactress who do show a impressive performance but kate winslet as young rose has this monotone emotionless look on her face all the time and i find it hard to see what jack  leonardo dicaprio  sees in her because of this winslet is not capable of acquiring the emotional intensity that is required for a role such as this since her acting is so theatrical and not very natural while dicaprio is a fantastic actor he seems to be struggling in every scene in primarily because he is simply miscast he is not the type of actor for a supposed heart tugging romance and he is thus unable to truly capture the essence of their bond  for an actually good young dicaprio role watch the basketball diaries 1995 unfortunately james cameron not only wanted to direct but also write a film as grand in scale as this one this results in a pretty mediocre screenplay and dialogue that a kid could have come up with offers little sub text symbolism or depth since its writing is sub par to say the least there are a lot of corny moments and clich dialogue  the entire scene of rose discovering jacks talent for drawings for example  and all the while it has very little subtlety and it is unable to tell the audience something without blatantly having some character saying it which in itself is ofcourse an insult to the audiences intelligence and it results in being quite a poorly written movie that is not intelligent and most of the time just plain dumbthe first part of the film seems more like a social commentary instead of a film as cameron tries his best to show the audience what a bunch of snobbish unlikeable  arrogant folk the rich people are and how outgoing and free the poor people seem to be this might not have been so bad if cameron actually managed to be subtle in this matter but this was not the case as for example billy zanes character cal is such an unsubtle way of telling the audience that the rich are bad ofcourse no offense to billy zane who was great as his character but his entire character is utterly ridiculous and he is unable to perform a single likeable action throughout the entire film and this never changes we get it cameron the rich guy is the bad guy no need to shove it down our throats camerons greatest mistake seems to be the decision to write the movie himself instead of bringing in an experienced screenplay writerthe second half of the film is more of a disaster movie and it isnt so different from your average modern day monster blockbuster except the monster in this film is the water even if there were any hidden meaning behind the first half of the second half contains no depth whatsoever and shows us the demise of a lot of characters nobody knows and nobody cares about in the end we dont really care that much about rose and jack either since their acting was not up to the challenge and the dialogue provided by cameron was not fantastic either it also shows us multiple instances of weird moments of self sacrifice with people sacrificing themselves for no obvious reason instead of trying to escape while this might be realistic in a film about the japanese bushido code in it feels out of character and it just doesnt fit since these are all normal people who should want to simply get on with their livescameron might show some images to impress the audience with his take on this real life tragedy  the opening scene with the old footage of actually setting off with horners score is ofcourse fantastic  but in substance is severely flawed and the experience of watching it is therefore less immersive which in turn makes it lack the emotional impact it should have had,sad
1997  out of 4 james camerons oscarwinning love story about star crossed lovers leonardo dicaprio kate winslet who come from different back grounds but fall in love aboard the i remember seeing this on its opening weekend and its amazing to see how well the film holds up after all these years yes since it became so popular there are always going to be those who hold that against the film and while its far from a masterpiece i do think it holds up quite nicely against many of the classic epics that have been made since dw griffiths the birth of a nation that film gone with the wind ben hur and other epics were all grand on scale told big stories with big effects and each of them had flaws here and therethe most amazing thing about is the way cameron is able to tell the fake story and mix it in with so many reallife people and events since 1997 ive watched countless documentaries on the real subject and watching the film on its rerelease made me appreciate it so much more the little details given about certain reallife people was a major plus and so were the smaller touches the amount of love and detail that cameron puts into every single shot of the movie makes it very poetic and at any time you cant help but just look around and try to take in everything in the frame very few films have gone allin with their subject matters but this here goes for everything and just comes up short at a few times it certainly helps that you have two strong leads turning in fine performancewinslet was clearly the best of the bunch as she brings so much life to her character and perfectly manages to fit every side of her be it the rich spoiled girl the confused one the heroic side or the love story aspect i was less than thrilled with dicaprio when i first saw the movie but looking back on the movie he too really stands out and delivers billy zane kathy bates frances fisher bill paxton and gloria stuart also deliveri think the biggest flaws in the film can be had in the screenplay many people objected to having the fake characters so close to the real ones during the finale but this here didnt bother me too much as when we see the real people its in situations based on what were led to believe happened what bothered me in 1997 and today is that cameron decided to make zane the main villain over the iceberg i really think the story starts of go overboard during the third act as leo gets chained up and then we have more drama wrapped around the real event theres no question that the romance made this movie such a hit but i think it could have worked with everyone had the stuff with zane been toned down god knows there was enough drama with the sinking to make up for zane running around with a gun with that said thats about the only problem with and those things arent disastrous enough to ruin the movie theres no question that the romance works the special effects are terrific and on the whole this is just a movie that works on every level,sad
when this was released in 1997 with camerons infamous speech proclaiming himself king of the world most of the movie going population agreed at the time this was the biggest movie in the world biggest budget biggest male lead biggest ship ever and using the biggest special effects but once we see past all that and look at the content of the film itself we see a lot of poor acting and extremely poor dialogue and a film that is based in reality yet focuses on 2 fictional characters with zero chemistry billy zane was the real star of this film if there is one with his line i hope youre very happpy together but since 1997 the movie going public has grown up and are not so fooled by all the hype anymore we have arrived at our own conclusionsi think that is an overlong flatulence filled clich driven sickly vomit inducing self absorbed egotistical pompous pile of hot air a ridiculously over the top zealous ego orientated steaming pile of substanceless horse manure which in 1997 fooled nearly the entire population into thinking it was this great masterpiece no other film in the history of cinema built itself up so much before sinking so deep ha ha get it that is why is the worst film ever inflicted on an unsuspecting public,sad
is one of the best movies ever made and that is proved with the record for the most money made at the box office about 700 million this extremely long movie stars leo dicaprio who plays jack a poor teen with only ten dollars in his pocket and kate winslet who plays rose a spoiled girl whos life has already been planned by her controlling mother and malicious fianc jack and rose fatefully meet aboard the unsinkable on its first and last voyage in 1914 jack saves rose from her predictable life and teaches her that shes in control of her life not her fianc or her mother rose and jacks romance is shortlived as we all know what happens to thethis movie is the saddest and the longest movie ive ever seen but 3 hours spent watching it are completely worth it won 11 academy awards and when you watch the movie you can understand why,sad
i understand why every dick and jane on the planet liked this but why did the critics give it such good reviews i mean it is not contrary to popular opinion the worst movie ever made although yes it may be the most overhyped although the matrix and star wars episode 1 are huge contenders it is merely bad there are very few things to like in this film technically it succeeds to a point i really did believe that i was watching a real ship sink well since the model built by cameron for the film was just barely a model and more a fullsized ship it ought to look real some of the cgi was terrible though the people falling from the boat were so obviously digitally created that i laughed a bit the writing is extraordinarily weak dialogue is just as bad everything that happened in the film which takes over 3 hours can easily be related on a cocktail napkin the worst part about it has to be the acting kate winslet has actually been good elsewhere but here she has nothing to work with dicaprio is bad theres no saving him  his career much like that of a boy band is going down the toilet as i type hes starting to gain weight and get greasy like marlon brando did  this sort of right is only reserved for actors of brandos status so stop it now leo billy zane is awful too but it is mostly that his part is so insubstantialso do you believe in payolas its beginning to make me curious that such obviously bad films as american pie and the matrix all got rave reviews from critics all three of the films were abominations and you may ask what does it matter if a critic reviews it well i dont care about their opinion not true my friend even if your insecurities tell you that critics are unimportant you always secretly feel victory when the consensus is for a film you really like therefore there are no guilty feelings after you have enjoyed something like so much instead you feel for a fading second that yes you are part of high culture you understand art blah its all just sinister psychology working its claws over simple mindsand for those of you who absolutely despise this film i can guess your favorite pictures pulp fiction reservoir dogs fight club and of course the matrix well you people should actually begin to learn what real film is rent a night to remember the best film about the sinking it is not the greatest film ever made but it is great,sad
a movie is well crafted when you fail to realise that it has been three hours since you entered the cinema there is so much detail in but the detail never seems to overshadow the story which story about the ship  about the survivors about the tragedy there are hundreds of plots and subplots which all disappear when the inevitably hits the iceberg then it is all about survival and the true character of people in the heat of battle finally it is about generosity and selfishnesscameron allows you to tour the floating palace and the sinking palace you meet kings and peasants you get to see an enormous ship and you get to see a tiny light in a dark  dark oceantruly one of the masterpieces,sad
okay so why didnt they take advantage of the fact that satan was on board the ship  did he cause the iceberg to appear  i mean thats who billy zane was playing right  the devil  because after all only amon goeth from schindlers list in recent history is more of a despicable character in a movie  he had absolutely no redeeming qualities which leads me to question why a girl supposedly as smart and emancipated as rose would have anything at all to do with him i just completely fail to understand the appeal of this movie  stock characters stock situation2200 people on board the ship and this was the best story cameron could come up with  the effects were cheesy and then he throws in tearjerking scenes of people dying that we never got to know as a way of making us feel sad  you want to see a really romantic movie  rent the english patient,sad
nice movie superb directing excellent effects good enough actingkate was ok leo is the best actor among those least talented beautiful people an empty script specially designed to show off its special effects that sums up the most overrated film in history i will resist commenting on the overplayed soundtracklove lovin schoolgirls and horny boys who enjoy goggling at kate will certainly adore it the oscar judges are probably retired businessmen who know nothing about movies heard they rarely accept female memberschauvinist they are into the panel of oscar judges thus they rate as best pic under pressure of their junior school daughters,sad
the simple fact is that the lead characters are badlywritten cliches serving a formulaic story  the richpoor conflict is overdone and not believable and the suffering of those below versus the comfort of those above amid the chaos of the sinking ship an exaggeration of history at best virtually every line spoken by the lead actors is wooden false unbelievable it is hard to judge the acting when the actors  who have shown considerable talent elsewhere  are given such awful things to say  i do think zane looks particularly bad here but id give everyone a benefitofdoubt due to the script  the frame story is of course ridiculous but we could say the same thing about citizen kane the difference is that the latter film is beautifully photographed superbly actedimpressively composed brilliantly edited sophisiticated in its use of sound and extremely wellwritten  is most interesting when it shows us historical figures  kathy bates molly brown is impressive though her intervention in the love story is utter nonsense and again because it is made up and badly so  the engineer whose awareness of the fact that there are not enough boats to save everyone is also interesting  the story of the band playing on whatever they may have actually played there is some debate was handled in a fairly moving way  there is a lovely shot of an elderly couple resting in each others arms awaiting the end this too echoes at least one such wealthy couple who chose to die together rather than be separated amid the women and children first calls  the ships demise looks impressive and of course is welcome given the excessive length of the film  but overall the film sinks in onedimensional characters spewing out onedimensional linesto even characterize some of them as onedimensional is charitableover onedimensional music  the terminator films and aliens are more believable and show more depth though if wed listened carefully to hamilitons lines in the second t film we might have foreseen aesthetic failure,sad
i saw this movie twice  ill admit that  however i got over the whole thing  the dialogue is too 90s the acting good but not oscar caliber the main thing that makes this movie are the fx atmosphere and set decoration  other than that this movie doesnt really have that much to offer  why didnt la confidential win best picture  also doesnt james horners score sound recycled from braveheart  this movie is not as great as 15 year old girls make it out to be,sad
i checked and i was right this film did not win any american or british academy awards for acting the main purpose for a film right it didnt win any golden globes for acting either the reason is simple this film was terrible the writing was bad and the the performers were worse for all the awards this trash did win nobody with any clout gave the actors anything leo didnt even get a nomination the ship sank and people died because a big company traded lives for profit this story is nothing new and it has been told many times before in much better films of the same namethis is 3 plus hours of my life i will never get back,sad
this is itthe film that made leonardo a household name as well as typecast him as a heart throb for the past 8 yearsthis is the film that made over a billion dollarsand sent director james cameron into a self imposed underwater exilemainly because after aliens and the terminator im sure all he was asked for by the studios was ii for the past 8 yearsthis is the film that gave us the celene dion song that makes us groan inwardly every time we hear itand this is the film that has give us a whole new batch of clichs  from the pair of lovers at the bow of the ship to the love story over a necklace lampooned perfectly on a episode of futurama  this film hasnt stood the test of time and frankly never willis it entertaining maybe if you can get past the sappy romance and the annoying actingthe true story of  characters like kathy bates as the unsinkable molly brown  arent covered enough in this film they are just there to frame a love story between the irish boy in steerage and the high class girl he woos with his talent aw how sweetno this film was the embodiment of every chick flick clich wrapped up with a bow and a celene dion song and sent to us the film audience when films of the late 90s are rememberedwill be included for all the money it made but for movies that really affected people other than being a tear jerker its at the bottom of the list,sad
this movie sucks like a 200 lady of the night who has been given 2000 and told to keep the change only a vacuum cleaner thats been left running for 24 hours straight sucks more than this movie its the suckiest movie that ever sucked ive seen grade school plays that were better than this movie honest to god playswhat has warranted such dislike from me two words forced viewing i was forced to watch this drivel by my wife and not only that i payed my hard earned cash to waste my life watching a poorlyacted lovetragedy that seemed to go on and on i actually felt envious of the characters that died in the movie as essentially their suffering was over never have i seen another movie that was filmed in such a manner that would please the luvvies so much so theyd just throw oscars at it but what about the cashpaying viewers sure the special effects are impressive but that alone does not a good movie make a good story thats interesting would be greatly appreciated but instead we get lenny d crapio as eye candy for the ladies the obvious target audience and the poor men whove been dragged to the theatre get no love at allin conclusion this movie would be playing on repeat for eternity in my version of hell i wish i could give it minus 1000000 stars,sad
so much money spent for nothing theres nothing special about that piece of crap nothing innovative nothing really interesting plain old stupidashell trivial boring love story a welltested moneycollecting formula product in a shiny package nothing else shame on james cameron for bringing such a mess into the worldwhat did you people see here that is worth 600 mln dolars 010 and remember people the phrase i shop therefore i am thats all this movie is about,sad
i dont know how to begin its amazing that a movie with a known ending made this success james cameron managed the impossible it took the story to another dimension isnt a movie its an experience,sad
perfeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeect,sad
perfeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeect,sad
yes right beside gone with the wind is the greatest loveliest most beautiful tearjerking love story in movies ever2h15m straight to the heart,sad
im so in love with leo in this film still after so many years and having watched it so many times it never gets old,sad
my rating is based on watching the movie edited without the one nudity scene and the sexual encounter between both characters i would have portrayed those scenes without the explicitness the movie depicts the expansive gap between the rich and the poor during the era it was filmed and the drstic difference in lifestyles of each the acting was genuine and it immersed you in the relationship and developing love of the characters the ending is a moment you never forget as it leaves the love story behind and puts you in the dire circumstance those passengers faced before their time of their death i have never finished this movie without tears in my eyes,sad
is an enjoyable film which can make you cry it is based on a real story about a liner which got into difficulties in the ocean the film stars leonardo dicaprio and kate winsletthe film begins with a boy jack who won a ticket for a cruise where he meets a wonderful women called rose and immediately falls in love with her she also understands that she loves him but they cant be together because she has a fiance the film reaches a turning point when an impatient man asks the captain of the ship to go fasteri think that the best thing about is the love story and leonardo dicaprio of course this film doesnt have any bad things for me the film is the best of the best overall i would recommended watching at least once in a lifetime for everyone if you love drama then this is for you,sad
never have i ever been fascinated by a movie like did the story of a dream sinking on her maiden voyage killing 1500 people and affecting the lives of several thousands this catastrophy would shake a whole world james cameron made remembered on a whole new level james cameron reached for the stars and he got emthis movie changed the movie industry imho for ever the amount of ressources and time spend on reproducing this vessel is astonishing and even 20 years after i have no complaints to the special effects or the plot for that matter the plot is somehow a bit of a clich jack a handsome third class passenger falling in love with the stunning first class passenger rose and their struggle together to leave the doomed ship normally i would never go for a love movie as but james cameron built it really well especially because of the endingthe music composed for this movie has become legendary and builds the emotions that define the whole impression of the movie james horner did a remarkable job to achieve this i have in my 22 years never seen a movie like i have watched it 20 times and i will watch many times again the ending never fails to wet my eyesi can only recommend this movie everyone watch it and cry yourself to sleep,sad
if you like to turn off your brain for three hours watch this i am not saying this in a negative way because sometimes you just need a sappy movie to take to bed not everything has to be shakespeare to be enjoyable so get some chocolate ice cream and a glass of red wine and dont think for an evening trust me it will be fun,sad
a rich girl good family rose kate winslet engaged to cal hockley billy zane falls in love with a poor boy jack dawson leonardo dicaprio and live an adventure few days more intense than living some people in a life adventure love emotion history are just a few words that can synthesize exceptional cinematic transposition of a real event that has forever marked the history of the xx century although i watched the movie more than 10 times every time i was enchanted for the first time is one of the most loved stories and since the time when i look at it i leave a conclusion that is the moment must be lived just like the two lovers who live your love story in front of all the obstacles i encounter all without regrets they also feel the intensity of life and slowly build their own world on a wonderful boat which eventually this carefree world of those missed lovers would turn into a painful reality a real disasterfrom my point of view this film is a masterpiece of all supremacy director script protagonists memorable scenes and every review could only confirm my theory that time is the most hopeful friend and simultaneous enemy of mankind but love is the only feeling that can overcome barriers of any kind especially in limit situationsin conclusion the film is appreciated by millions of peopleis a 10foot movie i recommend you watch him review you whenever you are in a difficult situation even if you do not find solutions to problems at least you will disconnect from selfdestruction,sad
the movie puts light on the romance that jack and rose shared although jack died that night but the love he placed in her heart will not die till she is alive is among the first hollywood movies that i got to see on television i like this movie from the day i first saw it it is just not about the emotions of the characters in the movie but the emotions of people who watch it as welldirection screenplay cinematography i got to know about huge investment made in construction of sets water bodies and their working well i would say they all got well along 45tone movie takes us on a ride where two people fall in love but one dies as sinks it is how rose has those emotions still with her and would go away only with her death as they call now grown old rose to explore sank to find lost jewel the jewel is although with rose and the secret that what she does of it will die with her i would say it as epic romantic tone 55music the movie puts light on how the musicians on board were still performing as was sinking it captures your heart 355acting acting is good 355final verdict it is worth adding to your dvd collection 45 910,sad
ill start by saying was in no means a bad movie but i thought there were way to many flaws in this film to be oscar worthy in my opinion kate winslet was far from her best when it came to acting in this movie she said jacks name  leonardo dicaprio way to much like everyone watching would forget it or something it was really annoying i also found later on when there running from that guy who was like billy zanes characters assistant or we and after they loose him later on they go back up and he plants the heart of the sea diamond on jack and the fact rose believed he stole it after willing to leave her life for him just really bother me because if it was true love she would of trusted her so called love of her life that made me real annoyed also then when the ship is sinking and she finds out its a lie and goes after him rose and jack go all the way back up from the basement of the ship and find a life boat but they wouldnt let jack on and he tells her he will find away which he probably would since his character is pretty savvy but instead she jumps back on to the sinking boat like what the heck now that made me madfinally the last thing that no movie has made me feel such anger and disgust was the scene when there in the water and rose is on that door and poor jack is in the water shivery his butt off after all he did for her and instead of switching or taking turns she just hogs the whole door till hes dead shes all sad about his death and talks about how much she loved him but in my opinion shes the reason he died overall it wasnt a bad movie and if it wasnt for kate winslets acting in this movie i would also agree it deserved an oscar i just think she was a huge flaw to the film and i also think james cameron could of found a way better actress to play rose because in my opinion kate winslet ruined this movie for me,sad
warning spoilerfolks the point of this movie is about the love story it just happens to take place on the kind of to give you two tragedies like when older rose said there was a jack dawson and he saved me in every way a person could be saved its supposed to show the affection between them then later own jack says this was the best thing that happened to me winning the tickets to be on it led me to you something like that cameron did a great job combining the two and making it feel like we were the third wheel or something lol leo and kate were amazing they both did great of course kate did better it had more to do with her life and how she wanted to escape but didnt know how to i cry every single time i watch this movie its so upsetting not only with the and everyone dying but with the love story as well rose and jack finally found someone who truly loves them and yet one had to die i love this movie its romantic its sad its fun its everything,sad
rounding out a threeway tie for most academy award wins james camerons 1997 best picturewinning film was as massive in scope as the doomed titular white star liner leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet join together to tell the story of the most wellknown nautical disaster of the 20th century cameron takes some liberties with the telling of the disaster largely through the injected romance between a young aristocrat and a struggling artist the story is told in sweeping cameron fashion that he is well known for through a beautiful juxtaposition of tragedy and doomed courtship boarding the luxurious rms with her family and fianc rose dewitt bukater kate winslet feels like she is in shackles boarding a slave boat the beautiful young woman of 17 is being married off to a man that views her as property and a reflection of himself rather than a person to build a life with once the ship docks in philadelphia rose is to marry caledon cal hockley billy zane a wealthy oil businessman in a union arranged by her mother ruth dewitt bukater frances fisher rose has no attraction or interest in building a life together with cal and their marriage is seen as a way out of the financial difficulty the death of roses father has brought to their family while pondering her future plight along the ship deck jack dawson leonardo dicaprio a poor vagabond who won his ticket on the liner in a poker game locks eyes with her instantly smitten jacks new role is to break social barriers and explore a romance with rose jack finally gets his chance when he talks rose off the ledge of the ship one night when she is consumed by despair over her upcoming nuptials and sees suicide as the only way out being invited to dinner with cal and roses family as a gesture of thanks for his being at the right place at the right time jack borrows a suit and charms rose knowing how she feels about her life and fianc jack stops at nothing to convince rose that they can endure a relationship with each other filled with love and the mutual freedom rose so desires the story of the doomed love is told through 101year old rose after her necklace has been found aboard the sunken wreckage by a team of excavators led by brock lovett bill paxtontaken at what it is is a wonderful film cameron beautifully juxtaposes the romance along with the historically accurate depiction of the ships voyage the film is heavy on romance however and if thats not your preferred genre you will struggle to look past it and focus on the history alone the film looks as beautiful as it sounds which is no easy feat given the subject manner the elegant music accompanies the riches that shine through the set and cinematography in a perfect union leonardo dicaprio is wonderful in the film and walks the line between boyhood charm and adult charisma that can be counted on quite well as good as winslet was in the role she seemed miscast for the part her mature beauty was difficult to accept as a 17yearold young woman the chemistry between the two actors however was magical and may be the reason to overlook winslet not being believable as a teenager class and social standings are mainstays of exploration throughout the film rose loves art and jack is an artist in the time where even pablo picassos works are looked upon as infantile with cal proclaiming that he will never amount to a somebody in a world that only accepts one way to live and one idea to live up to jack and rose cant find a place to fit in which is only made better by them finding each other and really who cant relate to the feeling of being an outsider in the world in which they live,sad
the hype surrounding james camerons when it was released during christmas 1997 and early 1998 was so great that it worked against the film in a way few films could live up to such ballyhoo nevertheless viewing it apart from the mass hoopla it shines in allaround greatnessthe movie of course details the doomed maiden voyage of the magnificent from april 1015 1912 this is one of the greatest tragedies in human history there were only enough lifeboats for half of the over 2200 men women and children aboard why because the was so great they thought she was unsinkable when it was all over only a little over 700 people survived and 1500 people went to their grave in the cold north atlanticthis is a movie and not a documentary and as such includes a fictional drama to hook the viewer this is where people will either embrace the film or criticize it as far as im concerned the story of jack leonardo dicaprio and rose kate winslet is excellent rose is only 17 years old and is being forced by her fearful mother frances fisher to marry the pompously rich cal billy zane jack by contrast is a dirt poor wandering artist whos free as the wind and brims with life love and humble honestyrose instinctively feels trapped and would rather die than marry some fake snob no matter how handsome and wealthy shes attracted to jack because hes the antithesis of cal by contrast her mother views jack as a threat because she thinks that her only hope of retaining the airs of wealth is through marrying her daughter into a rich family the unsinkable molly brown kathy bates is another significant personality shes new enough to high society to still relate to the commoners and so goes out of her way to help jack and his brushes with the stuffy aristocracy thrown into the mix is cals priceless diamond necklace for rose and what happens to itspeaking of which theres a modern story 1996 anyway that brackets the main plot bill paxton stars as a treasure hunter obsessed with the necklace suzy amis as roses granddaughter and gloria stuart as oldaged rose gloria was 8586 years old during filming and she just shines in the rolethe casting and acting is exceptional particularly the main performers its no wonder that dicaprio and winslet went on to great success in addition the depictions of the vessel and her tragic sinking are magnificentyet its the powerful subtext that inspires most what good is great wealth without love virtue respect and freedom in her untainted teenage idealism rose would rather die than have this jack lacks the former but possesses the latter and therefore possesses the former as well even if you cant see it if you know what i mean rose instinctively senses this and therefore throws all caution to the wind some criticize that she goes too far by prematurely getting intimate in the vehicle but  remember  she grewup with her lifestifling greedy fearmongering mother and so when she finally gets away from her clutches she naturally goes overboard have some compassion as for the fate of the necklace spoiler rose didnt cashin on the diamond because she didnt want to rely on cal for money and she didnt give it to her granddaughter or the treasurehunter because it wasnt hers to give since the insurance company paid out on the policy cals dad took out on it the diamond belonged to the insurance company if found it was no longer the property of hockley or his heirs and it wasnt the property of rose either because it was not made over to her by a deed of gift or a bequest she came into possession of it by mistake and so was obligated by law to turn it over to the rightful owners or if that was not possible to legal authorities more importantly the necklace was a reminder of her promise to jack to never let go she thus throws it into the ocean because she had fulfilled her promise to live life to the fullest and was now ready let go particularly since she finally returned to jacks watery grave end spoilerit wouldnt be right to fail to acknowledge the great score by james horner and the theme song sung by celine dion great movies are great because their producers take the time  effort to achieve excellence on every levelneedless to say because the film runs 3 hours and 14 minutes you have to be in the mood for a long movie to fully appreciategrade a,sad
it is a normal love story with a bit action i personally think it is way to over hyped i bet it is because it is based on a real story everyone loves it and they say that it is such a beautiful movie but i honestly dont think so i mean it is okay but it really does not deserve the hype it got now when it came out maybe okay i give it that but not now it just got boring because you know what happens even before you ever saw it you just know it because you have tobut it got the girls on its side ill give it that when can live thru a boring movie for a girl do it,sad
i loved when this movie first came out in theaters i loved it on in that bulky vhs box i loved it on dvd and wellyou guessed it i love it on bluray some of the negative reviews are saying they had issues with either sound or playback my bd played all the way through from beginning to end without any issues other than one small freeze up between a particular chapter change i dont think i lost more than a second or two it could have had something to do with the issues people were talking about or just dust on the disk or a smudge either way im not complaining it did not interrupt my movie experience and i continue to love this movie so glad that i can own it in such high definition it looks and sounds great you see every detail of every scene like never before they really went out of their way to make this as clean as possible and were talking about a movie that came out in the late 90s oh and the commentaries and special features are great still havent gotten through all of them maybe ill do that nowenjoy,sad
is my favourite film off all time i can watch this film night after night and never get bored of it every time i watch it i feel like i experience a range off different emotions to the previous time watching it is just such a beautiful thing it really does win the heart of the audience the film makes you cry and laugh it is a tale of history and romance leonardo dicaprio plays jack dawson a character you cant help but fall in love with this is one of james camerons brilliant pieces of work i would recommend this film to anyone it is beyond me how people can say they dont like this film i mean what is not to like,sad
this is an excellent movie ive never watched a sort of since years this is an excellent movie ive never watched a sort of since years this is an excellent movie ive never watched a sort of since year  since its release ive doubt a little on watching it  but after asking some friends of mine  ive realised that im missing a huge movie  i think that is the movie to watch with your friends family  or even alone  its always a pleasure to watch leonardo dicaprio excellent actor playing on this kind of movie hes a genius  kate winslet have also made a good effort into playing the role of a little rich girl in the boat of  the end of the movie was a little sad but it worth seeing,sad
was not as good as i was hoping it to be i was disappointed in the film i want to like this film because leonardo dicaprio is in the film because i like him  hes a great actor but i could not get past the fictional romance the movie was focused on i was hoping for more of a documentary type of a film but alas it was not sothe casting and acting was quite good the set was realistic as well there are good moments in the movie so i cant knock it completelyidk maybe i will have to be alone and in a romantic mood to enjoy this movie more than i actually did the first couple times i viewed it or maybe i really did want a modern documentary type of movie on thei hate to dislike this film but i do its a movie i should at least like better than i do but i do not i have to rate the film low due to the fictional romance the film was focused on610,sad
i just watched this for the first time in about 15 years last night i saw it when it came out and i was entirely too young to appreciate it i was about 9 when it came out the movie over all holds up and it good but there are few things i dont care for visually even 17 years later the movie is a masterpiece sets costume cgi all of it is a impressive as it was when it first came out the first half of the movie is slow and plodding which everyone complains about but this is a love story not a disaster movie so i personally think those people need to readjust their expectations and watch this again my big problem is the 2 leads dicaprio and winslet are ok but thats honestly about it lines are delivered i feel either flatly or are over acted i see them falling in love and honestly it doesnt grab me and thats not because im a guy i love a good romance something about their chemistry just doesnt seem as genuine as i was expecting some of the lines at the end are painfully corny especially dicaprios telling winslet that she is going to make lots of babies seriously that could have been beautiful its the gut wrenching end to a romeo and juliet love story but i feel like that whole scene was written by an 8 year old kathy bates as always i liked and billy zane gets my vote for best scumbag in a movie ever i do like that cameron make winslet transform as so many of his characters do sarah connor and ripley start out powerless and end up tearing the movie apart and in much the same way winslet starts as a trapped helpless woman and ends the movie by taking an ax to doors and saving the lead male that is done very well im still giving this 8 stars because even though this may have snags that i dont care for the over all story and the setting are very very strong the pathos of the passengers drowning or trying to save their children had a knot in my stomach and most of the characters are great even if the 2 leads are only good,sad
spoiler alert ok ready for it here it comes the ship sinks i know bummer right  i think maybe james cameron was up against a deadline and ran out of time to write and film a more believable ending so he took the easy way out and just sank the ship  oh please hits an iceberg like that could really happen sheesh give us a break  all in all an ok film  up until then but the ending is a real downer or is that drowner maybe the 2 sequel will be better or at least cameron could release a directors cut edition without the total buzzkill ending its a wonder that any movie studio considered this film commercial given the near absence of explosions and car crashes there are only a couple of explosions in the whole movie  ships boilers yawn  and there are no car crashes at all in fact the closest thing to a car crash is an antique car in the ships hold with the two lead actors in a little steamupthewindows backseat action seriously im not kidding  palm to forehead shake head and groan cliche alert   they literally steamup the windows good grief fortunately there is some gratuitous nudity although the actress exposing her ladybits clearly weighsin at well over 100 pounds  and i think we all would agree thats just wrong in the directors cut edition cameron should photoshop a few pounds off the actress and redo that scene in 3d  and maybe the nekkid actress could be painted blue and sport pointy ears and a tail  and it would be great if cameron could add a parallel storyline that the lead character jack is actually the greatgrandfather of john connor and at the last possible moment greatgrandson connor hotly pursued by a homicidal cyborg terminator travels back in time through a wormhole lands on the foredeck of and fires a couple of missiles and blows up the iceberg small pieces of iceberg rain down all over the deck and its celebratory ontherocks cocktails for everyone cue the music  fade to black now that would make for a commercial hollywood film ,sad
is brilliant every single actor knows how to act i never saw 1 bad actor i love everything about this film 1 of leos better films i think and i would recommend to anyone that likes romance with great acting also with top actors and actresssyes ok this is a very very very long film but it never gets boring all way through the film is enjoyable most films rush into things and end up spoiling the results whereas this film builds up and knows how a good film should be i have watched this film a number of times now and over the years it has always been a favourite of mine i am sure if you took the time to watch this sometime you wouldnt be disappointed,sad
it tells of the fictional account of the 1912 tragedy 101 years ago as it shows of a rich but sheltered woman named rose forced to marry in order to keep her rich lifestyle by her mother to a snobbish rich guy named calmeanwhile jack dawson a happy go lucky but poor artist who has managed to travel the world wins his ticket in a game of poker with his italian friend as they go on the third class while rose is on the first class of coursefate steps in after rose tries to kill herself and jack saves her from doing so after a brief misunderstanding jack is invited to dinner with her as both end up falling in lovebut their different lifestyles clash along with disapproving family and friends that they need to overcome despite also fate in the form of the sinking of the now famous or infamous ship however you want to put it goes downleonardo di caprio and kate winslet really have grown as actors since this movie di caprio has been nominated for two oscars and winslet has won one of many nods she was nominated forrip gloria stuart who played the 100year old rose narrating the tale is the very last or one of the last lone survivors on the ship of dreams,sad
directed by james cameron presents a fictional love story on the historical setting of the i saw this movie opening day and it took my breath away james camerons fictional story of jack and rose entwined with real life occurrences was haunting and absolutely beautiful he is an amazing director and writer that this movie would not have worked without himkate winslet was astonishing as rose and this movie certainly did great because of her as you couldnt picture anyone else performing this character leonardo dicaprio was also truly good as jack he should have got the oscar nomination for this character their connection appeared to contain all the features that every hollywood romantic movie has the two teenage lovers are breaching the social rules to be considering each other they are both sufficient to surpass as teenagers james horner music was simply unforgettable and he forever lifts up the movie that he works on to his ultimate level desert leather offers all types of hollywood style leather jackets this movie has got to be one of the most magnificent movies of the 20th century and one to remain unforgettable it truly mentally hurts me when i dont see this movie in top 200 in imdbs list it upsets me when people say that they didnt like the movie it might not be a stunning success but it really was a good cinematic success cameron did reveal way too much of enthusiasm to presume what the people on the ship resembled but it was in fact after the collision that the movie finally got interesting this is the ingredient of the story which the director wanted to convey many remarkable scenes of this movie settled on your brain not just the disaster or the romance scenes were memorable but the immense gap showed between the rich and poor i completely love this film and it gets from me a good 910,sad
this one is one of the best romantic movies ever released up to date the cast of the movie was great and the story line was awesome the way they have carried on the story just to make the viewers to be attentive throughout the work of the leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet was something watchfull i loved the movie it is still one of my all time favourite a must watch movie for every one who love a romantic movie it is one of the finest with great story line and awesome production and direction skills shown by the directer and the producer bernardo bertolucci directed it with such a great class and experience it must be admired that was just awesome great movie every one should watch this,sad
i am dean scheu i am from the usa i have watched nearly 78 times up to now because i like this movie very much is a true sensation of love it is a very nice movie for true lovers in this movie the actor sacrificed his life for the safety of his beloveds life on the other hand the scenes of the movie specially sinking of the huge ship was excellent has a great impact on viewers mind from starting to end this movie impress us a lot there were 2235 passengers on this ship and 1522 met their death only 713 people could be saved there is romance some action drama and a true love story in this moviethanks dean scheu,sad
james cameron takes budgetbusting to a new level for his bold ambitious attempt to create a film set around the titular ships doomed voyageit becomes clear after awhile theres only one character the director is really interested in  the and what an impressive job hes done at recreating the sights of what was then the worlds largest ship truly a loving ode to the tragic white star linerleonardo dicaprio and kate winslet are just likable enough as lovers from different social states that one can almost stomach the schmaltzy slushy moments of the film not to mention some pretty weak dialogue certainly kate makes us guys like her a lot more when she doffs her clothesthe rest of the cast are good enough but tend to boil down into onedimensional stereotypes including the ones playing real people billy zane on the other hand while perfectly hissable is only missing a moustache he could twirl mwahahaha you are marrying me pretty mwahahaha when the ship finally hits the damn iceberg after about 90 minutes have passed we get to the best part of the film the sinking provides moments as tense as the terminator stalking sarah and kyle in the computer factory and ripley making her way through an alien nest in her search for newt it is in this segment we see the relentlessness james cameron often puts into action setpieces at first theres slowbuild tension with the ship slowly taking on water before it drives the film into fullblown panic the later scene of floating frozen bodies perhaps does more to convey the true horror of the sinking than the actual effects workall of this is told in flashback by a much older rose to a treasurehunter and his team searching for a diamond these are actually the weakest moments in the film and often detract from the tone of the 1912 scenes gloria stuarts narration pushes the film further into schmaltz overload but thats nothing compared to an ending recently voted as the corniest scene ever put on filmone factor that helps absorb you into the viewing experience and just stops you from vomiting is james horners sweeping score fortunately we dont hear celine dion until the end creditsfor all its flaws it still works on the level of a grand oldfashioned epic,sad
james camerons is just one of those movies i can watch all day and never get sick of when it comes on television i watch it immediately there is simply nothing bad about this film thatll make you want to hate itevery scene from from start to finish is fantastic the love scenes to the final moments youll find yourself getting way into the plot as well as feeling for the charactersleonardo dicaprio and kate winslet are brilliant as jack and rose once they enter the picture you cannot help but love any moment they spend together and their forbidden romance is so emotional and powerfulthe ships final moments will keep you on the edge of your seat as well as shock you james cameron does an excellent job of recreating the sinking its hard to imagine that a horrible incident like this happened 100 years ago cameron marvels at bringing the disaster to lifeon the whole is a wonderful movie nothing can describe the sheer greatness coming out of it if you havent seen it i strongly suggest you give it a trymy rating 10 out of 10,sad

okay so lets start with the bad the script is mostly atrocious key characters are cardboard one dimensional cartoons that are little more than plot devices the score can be incredibly overwrought and overdone james cameron while a skilled director is also one of the most ego maniacal people in the industry as his infamous oscar acceptance speech testifies the final shots of the film should have been left on the cutting room floor and dont even get me started on celine dion blechand yet for all its predictability triteness and recurrent sicklysweetness works and works wellwhy i cant really answer that question except to say that this particular love story which spans an unbridgeable class divide and nearly nine decades is for all its flaws immensely satisfying 17 year old rose kate winslet of an aristocratic but recently impoverished philadelphia society family is heading home to america after taking in the grand tour of europe with her fiance a pennsylvania steel tycoon billy zane trapped in a soon to be arranged marriage and deeply depressed she attempts suicide by jumping off the bow of but not before being talked out of such drastic action by a young drifter from third class named jack dawson leo dicaprio in the part which rocketed him to super stardom overnight the story that follows is predictable but never boring it speaks to our deepest desires and most poignant longings the love affair between jack and rose is the kind of love that by its very definition cannot end happily and at the same time you completely believe that the experience of those 48 hours with jack have transformed rose forever and for good theres a fairy tale quality to the romance sure but whats wrong with that the story of jack and rose is perfectly integrated into the dramatization of the most famous night of the 20th century the last two hours in the life of the unsinkable rms a marvel of engineering in its own time and still so today the white star lines and her sisters olympic and brittanic stood at the forefront of the technological revolution of the 20th century well before humanity developed the means to annihilate itself with the atom bomb and her sister ships belong to an era which imagined a world of endless benign possibility where man might eradicate all natures obstacles and reign supreme over the earth man would become in short a kind of god and then came april 14th 1912 and a meeting with destiny given form in an icebergjames cameron is fascinated by this night in the frigid north atlantic and it shows the last hour and a half of the film is a close as well ever get to a time machine sent back a century to the horrific early morning hours that saw the leviathan plunge over two miles to the ocean floor and 1502 souls expire in the subzero waters of the atlantic ocean while jack and rose are fictional they allow cameron to remind us without delving into the historically correct trap that would have hindered him if hed followed the story of one of the historical characters to experience the desolation of those who survived while those they loved froze and fell into the void below the horrible beauty of that frigid clear atlantic night is vividly evoked the most beautiful scenes in the film in my opinion are in the last 15 minutes as cameron allows his tragic story to play out in that eternally cold unforgiving icy water in reality a five foot deep swimming pool but such is the effects budget that youd never know the stars blazing like torches in the sky this is one of the few films that bring me to that place where no matter how hard i try i cant help but tear up sissels vocals in this part of the film are oscar worthy the bookends of the film involving a subplot about salvagers looking for a rare diamond believed to have gone down with the ship allow us to see the end of roses story and provide us with an immensely satisfying sense of closurein the end i think the film succeeded so well because it provided two apparently contradictory things to its audiences firstly it allows us to feel the pathos of this heartrending event and it so doing encourages empathy with all human tragedy secondly it allows us to dream of experiencing whatever it is that jack and rose had for those brief 48 hours  most of us will never know what that thing is like but we all hope to experience it whether well ever admit to it it or not,sad
james camerons is proof that a movie doesnt have to be original to be good im not saying that originality is bad i like it its good but its a minor factor in how good a moviestory is the story doesnt necessarily have to be original but it has to be compelling to people has to capture the emotion and interest of the audience and keep them riveted throughout does just that it captures the heart and interest of the viewer and keeps it completely riveted all the way through the end it did for many people anyway including mecombines fiction with nonfiction the more important of which is probably the non fiction aspect the tragic sinking of the luxury cruiser r m s in 1912 there have been a few films that portrayed the tragic event such as in 1953 and a night to remember in 1958 then in 1997 along came james cameron who despite some weaknesses with script and dialogue is good at storytelling and always pushes the advancement of visual and special effects and uses them to his advantage therefore a film about the was a perfect project for him the recreation of the ship is great with excellent detail and scope except for a few brief moments here and there when something doesnt look quite real its it looks spellbindingly realistic and while watching it it felt almost like i was really there james cameron really spent his 200 million budget wiselysome of that money also went into filming some footage of the actual wreck at the bottom of the ocean this footage is seen in a scene at the beginning of the movie shot via a remote controlled underwater camera as roger ebert says these shots strike precisely the right note the ship calls from its grave for its story to be told however instead of only telling a story of only the real event he also weaves a fictional story ingeniously into it specifically an almost romeo and julietlike story of forbidden love in modern times actually during the time the film was made a fictitious survivor of the sinking old rose dewitt bukater gloria stuart tells the story via flashback and tells about her brief yet intense forbidden love affair with jack dawson leonardo dicaprioseventeenyearold rose kate winslett from a wealthy upperclass background is betrothed to a rich snob cal hockley billy zane she hates this and is extremely miserable meanwhile jack is basically poor and he wins a ticket to the in a lucky win in a card game he eventually finds rose who is about to commit suicide by jumping off the ship and he saves her life what follows is the development of their forbidden love story which is told in such a way that shows off different parts of the magnificent cruise ship its a simple predictable and clichd story but its still very compelling especially since we know how that the ship is going to sink eventually and cause heartbreaking results on their romance predictability is actually good heremeanwhile there is the subplot regarding the actual historical events leading up to the sinking  the arrogance of the builders and the people who ran the ship they thought the ship was unsinkable at the midpoint of the movie the ship hits the iceberg and the second half of the movie begins and develops into a thrilling yet tense and dramatic race for survival the entire movie from start to finish is handled extremely well in terms of story and is completely full of heart and soul its all very strong in emotion and yes its predictable but in this case it actually adds to the power of the movie but its not completely predictable there are a lot of things that are not fully given away like exactly who dies besides jack and who lives besides rose and some other things along the way toosome people would definitely argue that the love story between jack and rose is completely unnecessary but it actually helps the movie it adds more emotion to the story and makes it that much more compelling it also provides more structure to the story and the showingoff of the ship and even allows the audience to really connect with the passengers on the ship innocent people whose lives are ultimately ruined or permanently altered as a result of the builders arrogance and ignorance  unsinkable yeah right and the special effects also made the film work well too however despite having great special effects in his film james cameron did not lose sight of whats truly important  story characters emotion etc the movie does not rely on special effects it wouldnt have worked nearly as well without them but they are not the main driving force of the filmif i had to criticize one thing about the film it would be the length in my opinion its too long at three hours and fifteen minutes however it still works brilliantly as it is every moment of the story serves a great and important contribution to the story the drama the emotion and everything else the performances by the actors were very good the pacing of the film is great if a bit lengthy at times and the tone of the film is great james horners score is fantastic very memorable absolutely beautiful and perfect for the film and despite having a good deal of fiction in it the movie excellently portrays the historical tragic sinking of the and captures the horror and tragedy brilliantly with lots of heart suspense drama and great historical portrayal combined with fiction and stunningly realistic visual and special effects james camerons is arguably the best film of 1997my rating  out of fore more reviews visit my website httprobertsreliablereviewsblogspotcom,sad
simply is a masterpiece a movie that in my lifetime i have no doubt in saying will never be surpassed as soon as you hear the word in truth you dont think of the ship you think of the movie sad fact but a true one none the less cameron no doubt has cemented his name in movie history for many years to come thanks to this epic amazing tragic heart felt  emotion jerking movieive ticked the box that states  may contain spoilers but im sure it comes as no spoiler to anyone that in the end the ship actually sinks and if it does buy a brain as we all know the was rereleased this year in 3d for its anniversary and also money making purposes none the less as i watched it in the cinema i realized  it takes ages for the movie to get to the point which if youve seen the movie like 100 times makes it even more difficult to watch in an uncomfortable seat in a cinema however its defiantly worth the wait the beginning was extended in the 3d version this year i hated that because even in the 2d version i always thought that the beginning was a bit pointless and it annoyed me not the showing of the ocean i love that basically because of the superb music hymn to the sea is a magnificent piece of music that draws on every piece of emotion one has and i just love it however the boat scene where they spent like 20 minutes of the film taking rubbish at the beginning annoys me and i felt it didnt need to be extended i must stress although apart from the opening scene on the boat i find every other scene that includes the boat and an elderly rose gloria stuart brock bill paxton and his crew vital to the development of the storyabove all else in this movie the acting etc i love the plot adaption the fact that yes was a tragedy and without the love story of jack and rose the sinking would have still been a horrific and sad moment in the film but the fact that jack dies adds to tragedy because we followed their relationship through the whole film just as married couples who lived together for years were separated and thanks to the amazing love story of jack and rose we as the audience really feel the pain of everyone who lost someone on the and personally i feel that this was a genius move by cameron as it filled us with more emotion which is exactly what the sinking of the deserves emotion the acting was also good in this film i think that jack and rose are just as famous as romeo and juliet at this stage and i think that it will remain the same for many many years the script was brilliant the introduction development and ending of their relationship was superb and the fact that it was a rich woman falling in love with a poor man even makes it more enjoyable as she risked so much for him and sacrificed so much that in the end when he dies we feel her pain also the scene of the old couple in bed hugging preparing to die hits me like a ton of bricks every time or the mother telling her kids the story of tir na nog where the youth live foreverboth are for me easily the saddest scene in the movie and probably in movie history  because it arouses every emotion in me it makes me feel saddened that an old couple who spent their life together will die yes its nice they go together and holding handsbut it is such a sad sceneand then in contrast it shows how young innocent kids died who never got a chance to live the fact that each scene comes after each other is clever from cameron as it shows us an elderly couple who lived life too 2 kids who never got the chance i have to admit i cry like a baby every time i see these scenes and hear that wonderful piece of music in the background hymn to the seaoverall it is so obvious that this film will always be a classic the type of movie that in 20 years us teens will watch with our kids is the best film ever made that i have no doubt in saying the acting storyline music use of emotion use of the love story between jack and rose and the contrasting scenes make it an amazing epic every word in the dictionary for pure class movie as i said at the beginning the truly is the unsinkable movie,sad
i saw this movie when it first came out in theater and the whole theater was packed and for good reason this has many elements to make a good romance movie yeah it gets a bit sappy and corny but that is passable i thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie when it first came out but acted like i hated it for the sake of hating it because it came out sometime when i was in elementary school and all the kids back then was making fun of this movie although some of them probably enjoyed watching this movie as well this is the movie that made leonardo dicaprio and made him a teenage heartthrob so the plot is basically this to put it simply its about a romance that blossoms on a ship called between a poor guy named name jack dawsonleonardo dicario and rosekate winslet but rose is engaged to a douche but the romance between jack and rose increases even during the sinking of the ship i am not giving anything away since anyone that knows a bit of history knows that the sank and when the human nature when it comes to survival kicks in that is done in a pretty realistic manner even if the romance aspect of this movie is pretty straightforward but at least its engaging and that is what matters everything from the cinematography to special effects were phenomenal for a movie from the late 90s and its still spot on today i finally got the chance to see this movie in 3d again and it was still good and the conversion to 3d is done well7910,sad
the announcement that james camerons 1997 blockbuster was to be rereleased to mark the centenary of the ocean liners disastrous maiden voyage was met with a considerable amount of vitriol from historians and cultural criticsalongside the somewhat more sober events set to take place on 15 april to commemorate the sinking of the unsinkable ship  including an exhibition in belfast where rms was built and a series of seminars in nova scotia close to where it sank  many saw this as cameron once again cashing in on the tragedy with his fiercely sentimental film the fact that it has been remastered in 3d has made its release feel all the more in poor tastei was all of six years old when first hit our screens it was of course one of the biggest blockbusters of my childhood so large was its impact in fact that on several occasions during my schooling i was subjected tothemed history and art projects all of which involved watching the threeandabithour behemoth as a primary piece of research in the years since it has become the nostalgia movie of choice among my friends so ive seen it more times than id care to count seeing it remastered on the big screen however made its inadequacy as a historical film more laughably evident than evergiven the policed divide between the haughty classes of the upper decks and the lowly paupers of steerage and the shameful priority given to the wealthy when it came to filling the lifeboats the tragedy has often been held up as a telling snapshot of the class politics of the time through the starcrossed and completely fictional love affair between penniless rogue jack dawson leonardo dicaprio and drippy debutante rose dewitt bukater kate winslet cameron attempts to explore the inherent tensions which the ship contained this rendering however is reductive to say the least the gilded dining rooms of first class are populated by sarcastic brandyswilling poshos and the steerage is full of armwrestling germanics and guinnessguzzling irishmen who are prone to punch one another or break into a fiddle recital at the slightest provocation probably the most coherent message about class we are given as the two lovers move between their respective camps is that its much more fun to dance a jig below decks than it is to discuss oil prices over caviarthe stories that survived the ships demise are a mix of startling inhumanity and incredible heroism but camerons manipulative approach often robs his material of its inherent pathos and breeds drastic historical inaccuracies in its turbulent second half poignant moments come thick and fast but many of them are either wholly fictional or shamelessly skewed for the sake of taking some cheap tugs at the heartstrings the unsinkable molly brown who in the real tragedy insisted the halffull lifeboats return to collect those still stranded in the icecold water is robbed of her triumphant moment and recast as a much less domineering symbol of feminine subordination similarly as is widely known the ships string quartet played on top deck as the went down in order to calm the passengers but even this incredible part of the tale is soured by the schmaltz cameron lays over the scene as the quartet finish their rendition of orpheus and eurydice one of the violinists turns to his fellow musicians and says gentleman it has been a privilege playing with you tonight such candycoated moments continually deaden the impact of the films rich source materialcameron once quipped that he only agreed to make the film because a free deep sea dive to the wreck came as part of the package suggesting this was never intended to be his magnum opus indeed given the directors famous meticulousness the film feels like he has been oddly careless in places kate winslets accent is allowed to wander between american irish and english with little consequence and despite a rigorous casting process for the part of roses malevolent fianc cal  which saw innumerable famous actors rejected  the appalling billy zane was selected who ends up playing the role like a camp count draculadespite all this the clunking oneliners the dreadful acting and the cheesy artifice actually gives its distinctive charm when watching the released film on the big screen i was surprised to find that most of my fellow audience members were giggling along at all of the abysmal moments which also had kept me returning to it over the years for myself and others it seems this film is more of a trip down 90s memory lane than it is an historically accurate snapshot of a turnofthecentury tragedy as such criticising on the grounds of historical infidelity is tantamount to damning top gun for giving a rosetinted portrayal of the lives of fighter pilots  doing so would be to miss the point of what makes these films so memorablei completely agree with those who feel has no place in the proceedings for the centenary of the original tragedy not because camerons tacky blockbuster does a disservice to the 1517 people who lost their lives but because this film is so inescapably naff that really it shouldnt be taken that seriously i urge fans to go and enjoy this guilty pleasure with a clear conscience,sad
this james camerons ambitious venture is a cinematic masterpiece which is easily the most meticulously rendered and relentless disaster movie ever madethough it has various clichs and flaws and may deviate from what actually happened that night people should remember this its not a historic or biographic movie its a fictional epic love story with the historic setting of the sinking of the some may say the two main characters so easily  neatly fall in love in such a short period of time or that the division between the social classes is exaggerated but the amazing acting by the long list of talented actors james camerons brilliant direction russell carpenters elegant cinematography and production designer peter lamonts intricate recreation of the ship truly bring the story to life help us overlook the minor shortcomings and makes us all fall in love with it spoilers over the years its effect on me might have changed earlier it was the disaster and the deaths which affected me now the various characters and their journeys just make me think  rose who was bored of meaningless aristocratic life finds a purpose and new meaning when she meets jack with his help she finally gets the courage to cut her ties from that highsociety world even after jack dies she keeps her promise and explores other fields becomes an actress marries and goes on to live for over 80 years  jack who has been to many places studying people and drawing them meets a complex rich girl and falls for her  cal hockley who is used having whatever he sets his eyes upon couldnt bare it when he realizes that his fiance rose is slowly slipping through his hands in the end he becomes so frustrated that he even starts shooting at them  there are so many other such interesting characters from the architect who feels guilty that he wasnt able to design a strong ship and decides to die along with it the captain who after 26 years of experience feels remorse for not taking his last voyages ship safely to shore to the crew member who shoots two people for creating a chaos and finally killing himself not able to bear what he had just done end of spoilers and who can forget the last one hour of the film involving the sinking it has been shot and executed quite brilliantlyunfortunately people love to comment negatively about something good because they are unable to think for themselves and have a need to be accepted in their clique many people who loved the movie at one time or another now talk derogatorily about it thinking that it would make them seem cool fyi talking crap about a movie like doesnt make you look cool it tells a lot about the person or hisher taste in movies,sad
greetings again from the darkness of course i saw this one a couple of times when it was first released in 1997 having only watched it once since i was happy to hear it would get a rerelease on its 15th anniversary  even if the marketing hook was the postproduction 3d my thought was with james cameron working his technical magic the 3d would be fine and maybe even add to the spectacle of the sinking ship after all he was the mastermind behind avatar which with hugo are the only two films in my opinion that havent been weakened with 3d technologyunfortunately i cant overstate my disappointment in the 3d for the colors and lighting are destroyed when we first see young rose kate winslet arrive to board the majestic ocean liner her lavender hat appears almost gray through the 3d glasses and later the crimson renault where rose and jack leonardo dicaprio get to know each other appears dull and darkened additionally so many face shots are darkened rather than illuminated by the beautiful fixtures that adorn i was so saddened to see such dullness on top of such greatness sure there were a couple of times where the 3d gave a boost to a special effect but the film is so beautifully made and such a technical marvel that the impact is minimal to the positivewhat i will say is that despite my frustration with the technology i do hope a new generation is introduced to the film personally i am no fan of the love story between jack and rose however it is such a delight to see the young eager versions of little leo and kate as they go about their antics they were 22 and 21 respectively during filming and we now know them as mature actors and major movie stars that wasnt the case when first premieredthe real genius of this film is two fold the storytelling and the technical achievement gloria stuart stars as 101 yr old rose and she is used to perfection in telling the personal story of her love story with jack allows director cameron to show off the amazing ship from all angles  first class third class dining rooms and engine rooms she also allows the viewer to connect with the characters on a personal level the technical aspect is even more astounding sets models cgi and documentary footage are all blended to form a cohesive presentation of one of the most dramatic events of the past 100 yearshere are a few notes of interest regarding the movie and those involved the movie was number one at the box office for 15 consecutive weeks and grossed more than 18 billion  a record that stood until camerons avatar eclipsed it cameron was already an established scifi director with terminator i  ii and aliens but he almost had the plug pulled by the production company due to cost overruns matthew mcconaughey was the producers first choice for jack but cameron held firm for dicaprio the elderly couple hugging each other in bed as the ship sinks were based on the strauss who owned the macys department store chain and yes there were astors and guggenheims onboard when it went down if you have seen the movie before pay particular attention to the secondary characters  the wardrobes and acting are tremendous francis fisher as roses mother karthy bates as the unsinkable molly brown billy zane as the fianc david warner as his henchman bernard hill as the captain victor garber as the architect and jonathan hyde as the sleazy ship owner also catch suzy amis in one of her last acting jobs before becoming mrs james cameron  she plays the granddaughter to old rosethis is an historic film version of an historic event and should be seen by all movie lovers some of it is a bit hokey but if you doubt the technical achievement compare it to a night to remember the 1958 version of the story,sad
i had seen 15 years ago and thought it was great thenalthough there were a few details that bothered metodayi was mesmerizedmaybe because i am years older and saw it in a different lighti am still thinking about this movie four hours laterthe over three hour running time went by in an instantthe 3d effects were fantastic i felt i was on the shipin the dining room  struggling to get into the lifeboatthere was not a second i was boredkate winslet  leonardo dicaprio were better than i rememberednot overacting but giving very natural performanceskudos to james cameron for giving us this amazingentertaining stunning film no one left the theatre dryeyedif you see only one movie this yearmake sure its 3dthat this tragedy happened 100 years ago this month makes it all the more relevant,sad
simply the best film of all time in my opinion  with the godfather in a close second its brilliant it couldnt be done again and will a film ever make 600million dollars at the box office ever again from start to finish this film will have you gripped even the music at the beginning sets the film up perfectly  the acting from all those in it is superb  billy zane plays cal brilliantly and leo di caprio is possibly one of the best actors of his generation  probably just behind johnny depp in my opinion but never the less he puts in a stellar performance in this film and who better to play rose than kate winslet a great actress who from this has turned out to be one of the best of this current time  all in all this film is a must see for those who havent already watched it not many  1010 and nothing and no one will ever stop me from loving this film ,sad
looking at all the reviews before mine it seems that either is hated or loved to the extreme either way my verdict is that its very entertaining as a mindless special effects fest but as a enthusisast for some years before its release can find much faultfirstly its historically poor key to this is the scene where officer murdoch shoots a passenger then shoots himself after taking bribe money my problem here is that this officer murdoch actually existed and is it really fair 85 years on to make out that he got up to such business another gripe is the script and acting its terrible not least some of the lines between winslett and de caprio somehow all the actors seem to be too uncomfortable to deliver their lines naturally much as i approve of seeing a 1930s era actress in a late 90s blockbuster gloria stuart i really cant stand her dialogue delivery i assume they had called fay wray firstthere are positives the sinking is exciting enough in other words good special effects which seems to be enough for some people i even rather like the very final scene where rose is reunited with all the people on the ship who died but to call this the best film ever is perhaps going a wee bit too farperhaps having seen both 1952 with a very well throughout family tradigy and the more documentary style night to remember 1958 i was never going to fall in love with james camerons effort i reckon kenneth more would of told him where he could stick the line ill shoot you all like dogs one more moan de witt buckator most unintentionally awful movie name ever,sad
rating  out of 4well here you go once the no 1 box office champion of all time beaten just recently by avatar which was also directed by director james cameron and a forerunner as the most popular movie of all time theres really no way to sink this from the popularity and relevance it has on modern pop culture did it deserve all the praise or was it an overrated piece of fluff doesnt matter what anyone says about it now like it or hate it theres no putting it down nowbut even with the multitude of backlash it got is still a great movie sure it has its flaws just as camerons new avatar has flaws but counting them down would be irrelevant to the overall beauty of the film its sweeping wonder spectacular scale and unforgettable storytelling that pulled audiences in and it still does leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet the stars of the picture that eventually became household names during the films release got more serious with their careers and got more significant roles and they owe just as much to their performances as the starcrossed lovers jack and rose are believable enough to make us believe that they had something special many who diss on cameron not being able to write a love story may have their points there are some cheesy dialogue here and there but you got to hand it to him he knows how to establish chemistry between the twocould have been done using the standard disaster movie format multiple characters silly subplots but the addition of the romance adds that oldfashioned hollywood feel to it reminiscent of those classic romances from the golden age of hollywood the supporting cast including frances fisher a spunky kathy bates the wonderful gloria stuart and others are terrific but the final touches to is the titular vessel itself using the latest in special effects technology cameron is able to bring back the from its watery grave every detail is expertly crafted and further enhancing the experience of being in thein spite of its very few flaws is an absolutely timeless epic,sad
this movie will not earn as much money as it did if it were not at least excellentits good for movies to have integrity to the facts if it boasts that it is based on a true story yes but  all i know is that i rather spend my time and money watching this than the feature of discovery channel i may have been less informed of the facts but who cares its a ship that sank in some era when my grandfather was not even born yeti would have forgotten all about a ship called by now if the film wasnt this great  do you care about any other ship than sank some bajillion years ago other than i dont think so,sad
the movie was about appreciating and treasuring the past learn the lesson and be grateful of the kindness of those who crossed the path we have two intersecting story the and rose sunk by arrogant rose the leading lady revived through her spirit with the help of jack the leading man the movie started in the present with the explorer digging the wreckage for treasure we met the old rose as she visited the explorers to help identify a drawing she helped us worked our way into the past with the back story romance between her and jackthe young rose who was unhappy with her routine life was an engaged socialite her engagement was forced upon by her mother jack was a poor wanderer who won his way onto they met at the bow one a night when rose was considering suicide jack and young rose took up much of the movie their story not only serve as the back story but our tour guide of to get our feel for before its fateful tragedy jack and rose are two very uplifting people i found their behavior interesting to watch jack is kind of representation of an everyday man the many immigrants who landed in america in the early 1900s he had a speech during a dinner which he was invited to first class covered it allrose was tied down by tradition that is the people who own was overwhelmed with arrogance there was a struggle between the two extremes she was saved by meeting half way with a sacrificial help of jack no drastic changes without some kind of sacrifice the future of shipping is saved by the sinking of with the sacrifice of the victimsas the story unfolded the explorer understood that the is more than a gold mine the audience understand the value of the back story helped us understand the importance of to her and the symbolism of for the explorer basically the movie took us to a meeting with the haunting ghost of the pastthe movie had many powerful lines about life particularly from old rose and jack old rose has quotes about the past jack has quotes about living a life the sinking scenes of was haunting it was jack and rose take us to the moment for those got stranded waiting for the boat to return after watching the movie i felt i have gone through the experience of jack and rose and many other victims i cant say that about the other movies of course even with great idea the story wont work without the acting the setting the cinematography and the music which were all superb watching this movie was like i was on the maiden voyageit was a sad movie in one sense because of the disaster but it was also a hopeful movie because of what a person can struggle through despite of a traumatic event in the past james cameron had triumphantly raised the for everyone he brought stardom to leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet who played jack and rose respectively he also revived the classic age actress gloria stuart who played the old rose with the success of this movie he was able to spent time in the next 10 years doing research in revolutionizing digital 3d hopefully in not distant future he will be able to rerelease this epic in glorious digital 3d,sad
for those who cherishes the true love is the greatest movie ever thanks to director cameron who casted the most wonderful romance and tragedy film that whenever i watch it over again i always have a strong feelings of love and to be loved the first time i watched i almost focused and be amazed of the unsinkable for some reason i did not recognized the hidden message conveying throughout the film which were the meaning of freedom the power of true love the right to live the trust in god the price of an action and the devil inside anyone it teaches me that even if a person can live in the richness and has power it does not mean that person has freedom a person actually has a freedom when heshe is himselfherself look at rose when she joined the dancing party in the thirdclass desk she enjoyed and felt free the film also persuade me that when someone loves someone from their heart there is no boundary that they cannot overcome how rose could leave behind the richness and how jack gave his life to her were the meaning of how love works in this real life everyone has the right to live no matter where they come from a person can be the owner of the greatest building in this world while others have just a penny in their pocket they have the same right to live this life and money can not steal that genius right from anyone elseabove all i understand that every action a person makes always has its price and that person will be responsible for any decisions he makes it really teaches me how to deal with important decisions in my life and help me to figure out how to be the good person and prevent me of nurturing the devil inside of meis a good film to watch over and over again there is sometime i lost the perception of what love is i watch it and i know that there is somewhere on this earth someone can give another one hisher lifelike jack,sad
i have made the goal of seeing all of the films on the top 250 many deserving to be on the list and in my opinion some not i has shocked to see was not on this list this is the reason why the 250 can lose some validity when people say the movies on the list are not the best movies now i understand some films are fan boy films and cult films i beg all users to vote for ten stars for a movie that not only should be on the list but in the top twenty five if not the top tendark knight wasnt that great this film has one the most oscars than any other filmtied for 1st in a three way tie vote ten maybe im just a huge jc fan but this film needs to be on top 250,sad
i watched this movie on theaters 11 years ago around december or january 1st 1998 i cant remember all i can remember is that everybody watched it twice or even more times on the theaters while it was enough for me to watch it oncethe plot is directed only for girls or guys who have to go with their girlfriends in order to get laid or somethingthe situations are romantic oriented and nothing more the soundtrack is catchy but thats it and the fx are really spectacular but nothing you havent seenstill this is a perfect romantic movie that will have your girlfriend crying and hugging youeverybody hates it because its filled with clichs but on its time it was extremely popular that everyone had to watch it to comment about itnowadays its just looks like a hallmark production,sad

beautiful film because this contrast i know the reason since assumptive reviewers good part favorably sees the past and as the past is better than the present they have given several credit to the preceding episodes being still the last episode more explosive and spectacular at this point should reject also the old episodes but there are here two weights and two measurein fact also cinema masterpieces have been criticized and denigrated good part some reviewers of this site belong to the very bad reviewers better think separately with its head for edward shossor hand 76 shame this is masterpiece of hollywood 11 oscar for a poor 72 shame,sad
james cameron has come of age in delivering this grand production of an amazing tale one of the most fascinating true stories around is every bit as good as everyone has been saying you can see the three hundred million dollars up on the screen authenticity is second to none as new footage is seamlessly faded in from old spectacular and awesome to say the leastall the facts and events are so fascinating you hardly need the human story provided i certainly could have watched this as a documentary james cameron has left nothing to chance i am hard pressed to imagine done betterthe cast are all spot on and thoroughly enjoyable leonardo di caprio is the ideal devilmaycare yankee who wins a ticket to sail to new york kate winslett is perfect as the welltodo little rich girl who hates her existence and billy zane is at his impressive best as the possessive fianc who is heir to millions the superlative support cast includes kathy bates frances fisher bernard hill johnathan hyde victor garber gloria stuart and suzy amisgrand often haunting music is from cameron regular james horner editing is smart and the film passes quickly though it is over three hours the technical team have performed brilliantly with computer graphics a particular treat set decoration including a near to scale replica and incredibly intricate interiors and art design are both amazing recreating the most gallant ship of all with unerring grandeur and style cinematography sweeps through it all with panacheafter viewing this youll feel you were there dont miss your chance to see this at the movies i will certainly be boarding againsaturday february 28 1998  village sunshine gold classin an era basically void of epics james cameron has managed to produce a film that measures up with the likes of ben hur grand stylish sweeping and larger than life is the best way to describe this astounding cinematic experience i freely admit that i was one of the many cynics who having heard of the films monstrous budget thought that would be the biggest flop of all time i like many felt this 300 million dollar production would sink faster than the great ship herselfthat was not the case as history will now show as has gone on to smash box office records collecting a record equalling eleven academy awards along the way the films visuals alone justify this with the ship of dreams brought fantastically back to life thanks to some awesome set design huge scale replicas and access to the original blueprints mind blowing special effects coupled with superior sound editing make a must at the movies preferably one with digital sound and a huge screencameron brings it all together brilliantly backed up as he is by a thoroughly enjoyable cast including leonardo di caprio kate winslet billy zane bill paxton and kathy bates as the unsinkable molly brown final master stroke comes from maestro james horner whose haunting beautiful score is the spirit of which of course inspired the love theme a song jim cameron never wanted originally my heart will go onsaturday may 30 1998  knox district centrejim camerons grand film of the fateful and her maiden voyage loses a great deal of its impact if viewed on anything other than a huge screen it is still a fascinating tale of how the ship of dreams went to the bottom of the atlantic for all the wrong reasonsforget about dicaprio miscast and winslet charming they are mere scenery in a fascinating true story all those mistakes not enough life boats which werent filled anyway only one boat returning for survivors going full speed with virtually zero visibility no binoculars on the lookout people locked behind gates below deck and a seaman who tried to round a giant iceberg in an enormous ship that doesnt turn worth a dime if the hadve struck head on it would have stayed afloatspecial effects sets and costumes are all awesome but you do really need that huge screen james horners score is top stuff toosaturday january 2 1999  video,sad
after reading all the posted comments it left me wondering why this film so underrated after all the huge successi wish i could be in 1997 to feel it some people are too serious when judging this film id watched this film for the first time in 2005 but simply love it i loves the plot although its quite long but its paid after watching the great ship finally sink think a minute how this film becomes so famous if it is too boring and awful too watch give a breaki really think that it deserved that 11 oscar awards its a expensive movie ever made with excellent actors and actresses an with equally good romance story sadly too many people put too offensive comments over this notsobad movie after all it is the biggest hits everstill no movies could ever beat,sad
i loved this movie it was so good i just loved it and had to own it on dvd cassette dvd platinum edition special edition directors cut leonardo dicaprio is a very good actor i enjoy his work i enjoyed his work i enjoy his work because his not like other actors who are like the same character in movies but hes acting chooses do change and i dont know of another actress who could have played the role of rose as kate winslet did i also dont remember being bored of watching this movie my first time watching it when i was young i do remember my folks taking me to the picture and i didnt know what was going to happen next but it made you wonder and unlike other movies this movie makes you want go and meet the director james cameron as i watch movies sometimes in my head ill be like the camera would have gotten a better picture of the set if i had been placed at a different angle and for 1997 i did this maybe twice i recommend all of you watching it if you havent already,sad
what has been called by some the best movie of all time and by others the worst movie of all time is absolutely incredible not only is it a movie it is an experience let me say to begin that i am a teenage boy and practically every one of my friends laughs and scoffs at this movie especially when they learn that i like it i just cant believe my ears whenever i hear them say things like ive never been so bored in a movie in my life or dude that aint cool or you cant like that movie or what a disgrace to history or i want my three hours back along with my sanity each one of these quotes is direct and an accurate depiction of their feelings toward this magnificent work of art there are so many things to be remarked upon in this film first let me say that leonardo dicaprio is even more beautiful than kate winslet which is definitely saying something i completely understand and sympathize with all of the teenage girls who used to kiss their tv screens whenever he would appear you ladies have wonderful taste furthermore his performance was exactly what it shouldve been it was dramatic when needed subtle when required sarcastic and glib when appropriate there was absolutely nothing wrong with his portrayal of jack dawson there were so many charming moments like when jack is teaching rose how to spit and he gets ready to spit a giant spit ball and roses mother and mothers friends suddenly appear out of nowhere or when he starts drawing his glowing portrait of the angel that is rose dewitt bukater and the beautiful wordless piano lyric sweeps the viewer off their feet its the moments like that so wellthoughtout and wellputtogether that make this film stand among the greatest of all timethe next thing to remark upon is kate winslets performance which was even better than leos she captured the melancholic poetry romanticism intelligence poise lyricism and beauty of her character rose the moments just before rose meets jack when shes running to the back of the ship to commit suicide after having escaped dinner with her perilously wealthy sycophantic judgmental hypocritical crowd are thrilling and devastating they represent the worst of the darkness in her character and i happen to find them fascinating in contrast nearly every moment she experiences with jack before the ship crashes is romantic and real sure their story is not historically accurate it isnt supposed to be the movie is meant to be a work of historical fiction with historical fiction there will inevitably be facts that have been twisted around to fit the more dramatic and recent interpretations that goes with the definition of the genrelastly the music in the movie is by the illustrious and unparalleled composer james horner my personal favorite is his best score to date and i have every single one score is an explosion of diversity lyricism simplicity and complexity it unites so many different styles of music each of which represents a class and type of passenger on the ship hats off to mr horner he is a genius not even the overrated but brilliant john williams can match his creativity and talent he should be worshiped as should this movie,sad
so much has been said about  pro and con i doubt i can add much to the discussion i am one of those that has seen it numerous times at least a dozen and watching it now is a lot like putting on a comfortable old shoe the nostalgic quality of the film was always a big draw for me anyway and now seeing it again brings on a sort of double nostalgia ie a nostalgia both for the movie itself as well as for the time period in which it took place we all know who rose was or rather who she represented she was the miss liberty that appeared on all the coins of the era and whom also was the inspiration or model for the statue of liberty at the moment she proclaimed her freedom in the movie in fact she traded her tight corsets for the same free flowing gown worn by those early feminist icons i think a lot of people missed that point and instead took to making negative comments about her weight etc as though an actress with a super model bod would have done a better job of projecting that miss liberty persona anyway the more i see the movie now the more i love both the old rose and the kate winslet rose young rose wasnt an overly strong person through much of the movie but that to me was consistent with the types of relationships she was in i can see some wanting a sexier rose while others a stronger and more assertive one but to me the balance was just about right as it had to be for the movie to succeedotherwise there are many other things i still marvel at while replaying this movie over and over again for example nine times out of ten long movies suffer from problems related to pacing and holding the audiences attention but take it slow approach was in my mind a stroke of genius not a fault and the pacing was magnificent in the first half pre iceberg paradoxically for me the second half of the movie actually contained some of the slowest scenes with slow being a relative term tied to ones expectations and then there is dicaprios jack and my only lingering regret with regards to this movie maybe i was wanting matt damon for the role i dont know but jacks mix of humble roots and paris sophistication was just too hard for me to swallow it reminded me of how super sophisticate hawkeye pierce of mash was actually fromcrabapple cove maine this is hollywood wanting to appeal to as broad an audience as possible jack did have to be an artist though because that was central to the plot but his humble roots was to me just a case of balancing the ticket politically so to speak and was irrelevant otherwise anyway is still a beautiful and moving film to me sure i might have toned down the cheesy aspects of the romance and cast a more mature and believable jack but the real achievement here lies elsewhere people use terms like timeless and enduring when describing movies such as this and yes they are clichs but when applied to a historically based film they have real meaning implicit is the requirement that such a film span generations and appeal to filmgoers from across the decades accomplished this beautifully in a unique and powerful way as serious historical epics go i suppose this movie will never be a heavyweight but yet it still has that power to endure in ones psyche  almost as much as the original disaster may have endured in the memories of those that experienced it first hand,sad
in a lot of ways i feel that people slightly overlook the wonderful story of the movie did win 11 academy awards including best picture that says somethingis based on a true story about the terrible tragedy of the ship but with a love story twistthe movie has a beautiful yet simple story of two lovers named jack and rose leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet do an amazing job of capturing these characters hearts and bringing them to life in front of your very eyes they board a ship called that will change their lives forever this pair light up the screen and when you see them have their moment when they first lay eyes on each other you fall in love with the couple as they have fallen for each other their chemistry together just sizzles in no way that you have seen before they come from different social worlds but that doesnt stop their lovejack is the artist just trying to get by rose is the poor little rich girl that wants to end her miserable socalled lifejack gives her a new take on life and changes her views and opinions in a much better way than she could ever imaginebut as we all know this couples fate is a little more planned out for them then we think i wont ruin the ending but if you look back on this movie you realize that it has so many different emotions that it captures love rage pure happiness desperation passion sadness everything you can imagineit has many memorable moments that will go down into film history the flying scene on the bow of the ship with that beautiful scenic background and the excellent movie score by james horner playing jack dawsons amazing take on life and that wonderful toast at the dinner scene rose dewitt bukaters desperation in her face as she runs seeking to end her lifejack certainly changes her mind the captains look when he realizes what happens to ship the look of terror on murdochs face when he sees that iceberg the passengers cries of help and of course the ever popular ending of this movie who can forget that this movie has everything a good movie should have amazing actors that have great chemistry together an excellent story line that isnt complex to say the least but nevertheless impacting a movie score that is ready to leave you breathless powerful quotes that just touch your heart and an ending that is unforgettable all in all i like to call this movie my favorite movie because it is and although its a sappy love story and some might call it a chick flick which of course its not its one of the greatest love stories ever told 3,sad
dont get me wrong i love the but the historical inaccuracies really annoy me like the fact that when the ship went under you could see the word liverpool written on it but it merely sailed from liverpool it was created and built in belfast also for a ship created in northern ireland there was english scottish irish and even welsh accents in it but not one northern ireland accent which is strongly different from the rest which fails to show the true origins of the film and i have to say i feel cheated i am from ni that being said i dont think that camerons aim was to show the history but to in fact show the emotion of the event which he does very successfully definitely worth the tears i shed every time i watch it,sad
this is a typical rich girl meets poor boy story but it has got so much more than that first of all a great cast leo dicaprio kate winslet billy zane kathy bates and many more they were all good and the special effects were awesome i mean really i have never seen anything like that before or maybe i have i just cant remember it the point is that this movie captures you for like three hours and never once did i look at the time and see how long its been or how long its left this movie deserved all the oscars all the credit and all the good reviews i love this movie a classic movie and i cant imagine how anyone would think its bad or that it didnt deserve all the credit it got watch it and enjoy it and dont think about how long it is some of the greatest movies of all time are like really long thanks ,sad
wasup everybody i dont understand why are people giving 1 for pretty good movies this way any crazy people can give stupid marks maybe they didnt even see the movie i dont understand why are people giving 1 for pretty good movies this way any crazy people can give stupid marks maybe they didnt even see the movie i dont understand why are people giving 1 for pretty good movies this way any crazy people can give stupid marks maybe they didnt even see the moviei dont understand why are people giving 1 for pretty good movies this way any crazy people can give stupid marks maybe they didnt even see the movie i dont understand why are people giving 1 for pretty good movies this way any crazy people can give stupid marks maybe they didnt even see the movie i dont understand why are people giving 1 for pretty good movies this way any crazy people can give stupid marks maybe they didnt even see the movie,sad
the is soooo cool i love the story of the its tragic yet it reminds me of romeo and juliet in a way leonardo decaprio is so sexy this has to be one of kate winslets best films when i first saw the movie i was grossed out by the lovemaking and stuff but it was really cute the effects are so real its like going back in time they are so authentic and i always wondered how they did it the facts are actually accurate as i can say for some biographical movies i saw when the sank it was so fascinating i felt like i was actually on the boat screaming with all the other people i was just in shock the cast rocked and they did a great job i will always watch this movie its romance mixed with drama and i love movies like this this is by far the best movie ive seen its just outstanding and fascinating,sad
we can certainly go on criticizing a movie talk about its errors and ponder over with others to give it a rating but having seen at least 7 times i would say that it is nothing less than a classicguys its just a movie is it not i really dont think this movie was meant to send out any strong message to the audience it was just for entertainmentif that is the case why do you wanna go crazy about the goofs all the timei dont mean to say that you can afford to have glaring errors in such an anticipated movie but guys forget it and just go enjoy,sad
is probably the most unlikely successful films of all time it really was no kind of provocative theme at center it was quite simply an epic and an epic love story at that yet this film went on to be the most successful movie of all time both in the box office and the awards seasonsthe movie does what many people thought would be absolutely impossible it takes you back to the and truly captures exactly what it must have felt like when the unsinkable ship went down through a love story that moves everyone who sees it characters that are diverse and fascinating and probably the best cinematography ever put on screen it makes you feel about this story in a way youve never felt before and thats what makes it so amazing it changed the way people looked at this story forever it made them truly understand the tragedy of what happened that nightthe acting is fantastic leonardo dicaprio does a fine job and was very underappreciated for this performance however the reason for that is because no one could take their eyes off of kate winslet this movie made her what she is today her performance is still fantastic as you watch it even now the movie was hers from the moment she came on screenits true that it is at heart a love story but its not only about the two central characters of jack and rose to me the real love story is about the itself before i saw this movie it was an interesting story and that was all because of this movie and the vividness it portrayed it is a story ill never forget its become a story that will never die in the hearts of people and the movie is what truly did that it changed the way that people thought of foreveri think bill paxtons character said it best right at the end all my life ive thought of nothing but but i never really got it until now i understand mr paxton i feel the same way an absolutely fantastic film and probably one of the best ever made 910 stars jay addison,sad
i saw this movie when i was very young i wasnt old enough to appreciate it but when i got older and i saw it again i wish it was the first time it was so moving i swear i can watch it over and over and over again i showed this movie to one of my very good friends and she said she cried so hard she bought it the next day my mom when she went to the movies to see it for the first time she thought it was going to be bad she saw at the theaters literally 20 more times when it came on vhs we bought the full screen version and the wide screen version when it came on dvd we bought it the day it came out 10th anniversary edition bought it the same day it came out thats how much me and my mom love,sad
when i saw james camerons on its opening day in 1997 i remember overhearing a woman explaining to her 2 daughters the was a real ship and real people died on it so they would not become totally caught up in the love story of jack  rose i had first read about the legendary when i was about 10 years old but i had no idea just how horrible the real disaster has been until reading walter lords a night to remember and seeing the 1959 b  w movie based on that book when dr robert ballard found the resting place in 1985 the worlds interest was reopened in the story and camerons massive undertaking to retell the story of that fatal night in april 1912 was a success on any scalei was mostly interested in the historical aspects of the story and was not disappointed camerons research into the ships design the passenger list especially 1stclass the costumes right down to the last detail on the 1stclass china is minute it was so close to the historical accuracy as detailed by walter lord and later by robert ballard that one could have easily believed they were actually therecamerons use of a love story featuring people at opposite ends of the spectrum rose the dignified 1stclass girl and jack the impoverished steerage passenger makes for an interesting element in the story though the story focused largely on their own experiences i dont think it detracted from the movies historical accuracy we often see rose  cal hockley interacting with such reallife passengers as jj astor ben guggenheim molly brown  the countess of rothes it also focused well on jacks experiences in steerage which were probably similar to those of many steerageclass passengers who often found themselves trapped below decks in a ship that was rapidly filling with watersome of the more interesting historical elements were cut  later released on the deluxe dvd edition one shows capt smith calling for the boats to standby close to the ship and qm hitchens in molly browns boat ignoring the order also missing was the wellknown scene of macys department store owners isidor  ida strauss which showed mrs strauss insisting on remaining with her husband right until the end they are seen while nearer my god to thee is playing in their cabin as water rushes in on the floor another missing scene which was understandably cut showed little cora caldwell jacks dance partner in steerage and her family trapped by a locked gate with water rising behind themjacks ultimate fate was that of most steerage passengers he died of hypothermia well before the arrival of the only rescue ship rose only survived because she managed to improvise a life raft on a floating piece of the grand staircase she could have become one more of the small number of 1stclass women  children who did not survive the only others were mrs strauss mrs hj allison and her little daughter lorrainedepending on how one wants to see it this movie is either a grand love story against a backdrop of imminent doom or a historically accurate movie with a love story as the background either way jim camerons masterpiece will long stand as one of movie historys greatest achievements it could have been a colossal flop but because so much planning had gone into it to make it as historically accurate as well as creating a story people would want to follow it has succeeded beyond even camerons expectations well done james,sad
james cameron the writer and director is truly a ledgend in himself the is a breathtaking movie which covers just about every aspect of what a film should have in it the is immensely sad and will tug at the heart of even the most stone hearted of people and what makes the movie just so much more tragic is the fact its a true story based of course on the 1912 voyage of the ship which tragically sunk taking more than 1500 passengers down with it the 194 minute movie captures your eye heart and imagination in so many ways a three hour movie probably has put of a lot of people but honestly you do not feel that in this movie its a perfect length james camerons choice of actorsactresses is amazing the gorgeous fresh faced leonardo di caprio shines brighter than the sun in his role as does kate winslet who plays the posh upper class rose perfectlythe only flaw i could attempt to pick out of the is the effects of the ship sinking in its last moments they could have probably been better but for a 1997 movie i dont think we can complainthe has won an incredible 11 oscars 76 other awards and has had 48 nominations and that just proves the movie truly is a masterpiece which will never be replacedi can guarantee you really have not lived until you see james camerons,sad
thank you very much for all the staff for this unforgettable and very special movie director james cameron delivers an example how a deep and perfect developed story takes your breath away with high emotional elements its not the usual love romance film but it has some of its magic moments at the end i couldnt avoid tears in my eyes and wished really another end leonardo di caprio will remain for ever in my heart with the sweet soundtrack and i dont understand why he didnt get the oscar for his outstanding performance anyway di caprio counts no doubt as one of the best actors in the present at least won 11 oscars and i am not surprised because everything is perfect the scenery on the was wonderful done and the special effects were great the dvd will take a great place in my best of dvd collection my wife and me rate a solid 810 a must see for every cinema fan,sad
i know there are a lot of people who like this film and a lot who hate it i dont hate it but i am disappointed in itwhen i first heard that james cameron was making a film i was so excited as i am a buff also one of my ancestors was on the ship when it sanki eagerly awaited its release however when i saw it i was just do disappointed is not and was never meant to be a romance story why james would turn it into one is beyondhe missed the point totally on what was a story of disaster that could have been prevented i dont know about other people who had family on the ship but to me his film was disrespectful of there memories i know that people will disagree with me on this pointto those who like the film i say good on you and i am happy for you i have my opinion and you have yours for me one who has studied and read just about everything there was on this movie just lol missed the boat,sad
remember when a film that ran over two hours was a shiny beacon among film that exemplified greatness extended length represented importance and we all had to stand up and take notice to its magnitudenow add into the mix that we all knew what the ending was going to be a very long story that history spoiled the ending to made fools out of all the naysayers millions upon millions have seen this film and we all know the outcomebrilliant where does that brilliance come from is it the acting well nobody i know didnt want gloria stuart to walk home without a best supporting actress oscarafter all we got her all dolled up and made her stay out latebut it didnt happenand why didnt it was it the writing well what can you say about a film that for the last hour at least consisted of dialogue no more monumental thanrose jack jack rose no gentle readers its the special effects that kept the crowd there as much as i hate the fact that i hate this film as much as i do on an intellectual level i cannot deny that no matter how many times ive seen that ship sink im always mesmerized each and every time it does jim cameron has indeed gone out of his way to stupefy us with his endingand i bought it hook line and sinkeralthough it took us almost two hours of banal dialogue to get there the ending is absolutely spectacular in its delivery no awards for acting or scriptobviouslymay sink but the ending is not to be missed,sad
as a married man in his early 40s i must say i have seen this movie at least 6 times before today i had the chance to enjoy this movie with my wife and two teen boys their first time i am so glad they could appreciate the romance of the movie as well as deal with the length of the movie both of my boys have loved the music since it was released but never watched the film because of the chic flick image it made me proud that they could appreciate such a film i agree that kate winslet deserved an oscar for her performance which seems the majority of opinion james horners music is considered one of the greatest soundtracks of all time and rightfully so i just saw the deletedextended scenes from the 2005 dvd and they were great the commentary is dry at times but i recommend that you give it a chance if you can,sad
i cant understand why this film has come high in polls for the worst ever film it is very well made and won 11 oscars it is far better than the old films about the disaster the acting is excellent and the effects take your breath away it wouldnt have been any more realistic if james cameron had commissioned a shipyard to build a fullscale working replica of the ship the film is very authentic with just one minor lapse namely the american locomotive and rolling stock on the dockside railway seen in front of the in the view from the pub unlike previous films about the there is no sense of impending doom throughout the film there is a good feeling in the first half of the film with scenes like jack and fabrizio at the bow watching the dolphins while captain smith looks on paternalistically and the ceilidh in steerage that jack takes rose to james cameron conveys the sheer size and stability of the ship very well and the audience is drawn into the very deep security that the passengers felt everybody on board is very friendly apart from certain individuals in first class cal hockley is a violent overgrown spoiled brat monster child in a lot of scenes particularly where he shoots at jack with a handgun he is reminiscent of the caddish upper class villain in a silent film jack has been criticised for being too 1990s but the rest of the cast look and act right for the period the crew talk authentic sounding edwardian english james cameron has caught the feel of the period very well and he has said that the people in the film are in many ways not that different from us today its fair to say that jack and fabrizio are like a couple of gap year students hitchhiking round the world kate winslet with her full curvy figure which has got her a lot of period roles and the nickname corset kate is spot on as rose the scene where jack sketches her nude is very touching and the piano music that accompanies it is lovely when they run past the stokers one can feel the scorching heat of the furnaces after the ship strikes the iceberg the audience has much the same incredulity as the passengers and most of the crew that there is a possibility of the ship sinking the sinking as it was in real life starts very gradually and becomes progressively more terrifying although there is no blood or gore shown it still is horrifying the only blood during the sinking are the scenes where the stewards get punched there are some really sad scenes during the sinking such as the drowned woman floating in the water and the irish mother telling her children the old celtic story of ossian and niamh it is sad when fabrizio is killed by the collapsing funnel and when tommy ryan is shot by first officer murdoch in the heat of the moment incidentally 20th century fox sent one of their executives over to scotland to apologise to the people of dalbeattie murdochs home town about the way he was portrayed in the film one really feels the freezing cold when jack and rose are in the water and i felt sad when i saw the dead baby in its mothers arms when i saw the film in the cinema i can remember hearing a couple of girls crying during and after the sinking james cameron says he deliberately made the ending ambiguous and his answer to the question of whether rose dies or is dreaming at the end is you decide i think she died and went to heaven and was reunited with all these people shed known on the ship it is a beautiful scene where shes reunited in jack and shes all in white like a bride hey im going against my own principles im one of the most unromantic guys in the world im not supposed to like these scenes,sad
as a young child i was always fascinated with the when this movie came out i was a mere toddler i was only 2 so there was no way that i was able to see that movie at that time in the summer of 2004 i saw for the first time i was only about 9 and i didnt totally grasp the concept my mom soon got me the movie and i finally got it the movie is so powerful and it makes me cry every time i watch it it is my all time favorite movie the storyline is wonderful and i love the relationship between rose and jack so innocent but so restricted at the same time 2 thumbs up to james cameron who made the effects so wonderful that i feel like im in the water with all of the dying people the total peril was trenching if thats how you spell it i love that movie 333,sad
i watched this film in 1997 or 1998 i dont remember and after watching i wanted those hours of my life watching this film backi mean the had the right idea to make a film about the but for gods sakes to make it film about two people who fall in love on the titantic was just plain bad the movie is not very accurate and their are a lot of historical mistakes which really bog down the movie the only reason i can find for watching this film is to see kate winslet who is very prettyi was upset they made a love type story based around a disaster if you want to watch this movie due it with all due caution as you may find yourself hitting your head on wall after watching it,sad
many say redefined the romance genre of films others say its a masterpiece for our generation i ask them how  i first viewed this movie when i was a child of 9 years old as you may have guessed i hated it now i know what youre thinking what does a nine year old kid know about romance  funny that you ask that because i didnt know a thing about it i was a child who still believed in cooties then at the end of november this film came on tnt i viewed it and still hated it im 17 years old now the thing that i hate the most about this is its crappy dialog its as if it was written by a 6 year old kid a womans heart is a deep ocean of secrets this is one of the worst quotes in any movie i have ever watched im the king of the world um who still says that  the other thing i had a problem with the actual story itself to me they james cameron just took a true event stuck a soap opera into it filled with mediocre acting and one dimensional characters and said hey lets see how much we can rob from the public with this they accomplished their mission they robbed 600 million from the public i dont even want to go into the times where rose broke her accent all the characters in the film can be described in a couple of wordsjack poor artist rose spoiled brat cal snob ruth snobetcsee what i mean  the only thing good about this movie is the visuals they were surprisingly good the ice berg looked cool and the ships sinking was over par as well this movie couldve been excellent if they just upped the acting alittle made some deep characters alast this film was made the way it is every time i see it i hate it alittle more,sad
let me start by saying that how could you not like the script so what if they pretty much never call each other darling or honeybut so what rose was in love with jack and he made her a free spiritnot a boxed in girl trapped to a boring life she didnt want to have class by having to say darling like she did to cal but anyway the movie has the best special effects and ending ever this end was the only movie that has made me cry if a movie can make you cry emotionally how can you say it has a bad script exactly the acting is excellent also this movie gives an excellent feel for the peoples lives lost on it is as if you can feel the disaster happening i love this movie my all time favorite movie the music by james horner is alos very goodmy heart will go on in particular,sad
i enjoyed this film even at the young age of 22 i enjoy comedies science fiction dialog films classic bogey films  and this one is a great film as well to all haterslook at the scoreboard buddy 600 million game over also of course this film cant have an original plot or story  it was almost completely based on fact obviously rose and jack and that story were fictional but many of the characters time line and details were fact or presumed so after finding at the bottom of the ocean it is impossible for a horrible film to make such an impact at the theaters a movie like da vinci code only made money because of the media  but there was no such scandal with it was liked for the character development and obviously the touching way the story was told it really made you feel for the victims that night not only the fictional characters jack and rose,sad
one of the best movies of all time how anyone could give it anything less than a nine must have been watching something else comments made about the love story been over done has got to realize this is a movie not a minute by minute detail of the sinking of the yet a movie giving us a beautiful story that fitted perfectly with actual accounts of the disaster i have watched the dvd 5 times so far and many more to come if someones wants actual details of the sinking of the there are other fantastic dvds available which give absolute details of how and why the great ship sank but enjoy the for what it genuinely offers which is a beautiful story on board one of the all time greatest disasters of all time,sad
this motion picture is beyond our time and for everyone who has not seen it but hears it is great your thinking of the movie is only a whim of your imagination for all of the films that try to obtain such power and emotion as this film can only be brought to sorrow as i must say nothing can uproot this film from our minds let alone the great performances of all the actorsactressesthe plot the picture the script the whole movie let it be is something so mind blowing so full of love it beats your heart and deepens your compassion something that keeps us going something that captures us with such a hearty grip that can only be shown in this once in a lifetime major motion picture film,sad
i think i summarised it quite well i know most people have a terrible tendency to mock you for enjoying it but i dont care because the majority of the world has seen it and everyone must have cried i mean that beautiful ship just sinking under all that water ah amazing its that whole feel good thing about a ship and the freedom it allows it has those incredibly heroic moments and the amazing lines that no one could forget im flying jack im the king of the world whoop whoop the stuff that people take the mick out of but as soon as they get onto a ship attempt to fly it gives the sense that there is love out there for everyone its got a sort of modern day romeo and juliet sense except not completely modern because it was like 94 years ago but its the feeling that you can be happy whatever cage youve been trapped in and only the stoneist of hearts could fail to cry at this amazing breath taking brilliantly uplifting film that promises love conquers all,sad
let me start off by saying that there really cant be any spoilers about this movie as anyone who knows anything about history already knows how this film will end the is going to sink what a surprise there are three major reasons why i dont like this moviereason 1 we know how the film is going to end before we even see it the ship is going to sink if filmmakers want to make a movie in which the audience already knows what is going to happen they need to do a better job than to simply turn it into a sappy love story which brings me to the second reasonreason 2 this is another historical event turned into a sappy love story blended in which a whole lot of hollywood inaccuracy the acting is terrible and the characters are very uninterestingreason 3 time this movie is more than three hours long is that really necessary no it isnt it is a three hours of my life that i could have used way more productively it is a three hours of my life gone forever wasted and i can never get it back i was thankful when dicaprio died because i knew the movie was almost over i cant believe this movie got so much praise its right there in the same league as pearl harbor pure unadulterated junk i gave it a 310 only because they did a pretty nice job reviving the ship itself dont watch it if you take my advice you have just saved three hours of your life,sad
i didnt find this movie that horrible however i could have edited half the stuff out this movie was just too long the parts that i would have kept are the beginning kate winslets suicide attempt her nude scene and the sinking all the rest was completely unnecessary i didnt understand two things why didnt dicaprio get on the door with winslet and why did she toss the 30 million dollar diamond over board in the end like the words of jim carrey to winslet why did you let leo dicaprio drown while you were safe on the big door would you have taken turns or were you just afraid to freeze your fat ass offi knew there was going to be a love story but it was a bit cheesy i personally favot the love story in pearl harbor i think that james cameron should stick to science fiction movies its what he is best at i am also hoping that in the near future there will be a movie that will beat this one at the box office lord of the rings came close,sad
this movie illustrates very effectively what is wrong with most of major american cinema in the past 1520 years it can be summed up this way it is the triumph of spectacle or style over substance way way way too often hollywood relies on special effects attractive actors and flashy clothes and explosions its not that is a bad movie by any stretch but its certainly not a great movie either the primary flaw is in director james camerons attempt to write the script i agree with most of the critics ive read that cameron has a great eye but a somewhat defective ear the characters are clichd poorly written and in many cases the acting is quite subpar all of this goes unnoticed by most people of course because of the fact that most americans dont read enough to know what good realistic wellwritten dialog sounds like not to mention the fact that character development is all but completely overlooked by most major studios these days so most people arent routinely exposed to truly welldeveloped interesting characters all this adds up to the fact that while an entertaining and welldone picture hardly qualifies as the best movie made in 1997 and definitely not one of the best ever as so many people would care to assert i think that the provider of the overly praiseladen commentary displayed on imdb for this movie should a graduate from high school and remember that people who dont think this movie is superb are actually in the minority and b watch a few more older movies particularly those made with great scriptslike the godfather chinatown the usual suspects casablanca any tarantino or hitchcock movieand those with some great actorslike cary grant kate hepburn laurence olivier ed norton cate blanchett jimmy stewart daniel day lewis and angelica huston lets stop relying on the box office and the lame academy of motion pictures who somehow felt that braveheart shakespeare in love and yes julia roberts deserved oscars to tell us what is a quality product,sad
in 1912 humanity cried that not even god himself could sink the the ship of dreams the indestructible symbol of mankinds modern achievements in maritime and industrialization in 1998 celebrity cried that not even god himself could sink the academy awards and hyperbole of fame and recognition that was the film about the events 80 years earlierwell look at it this way not even the divine and mighty god himself needed to sink the ship nor the film both the ship and its eponymous film representation sank after strong initial hype due to their paying comeuppance for pride and folly and getting found out of their own excesses in the long run to begin with the true story remains tragic because of the very fact that mankind overlooked arrogantly so the realities failing to prepare lifeboats a waste of deck space class struggles racism rich  poor divides in the end mankind regardless of whether the rich or poor caused the problems paid the price of collective follythe film likewise pays the price regardless of whether the executives who forcesold the distribution and caused the film to gain such unprecedented hype and reviews at first seemed so successful really cared about more the bottom line the film may have succeeded financially but to me it still sank in the longer run it made for a great emotional journey at first but really as we have to critique it at the level given its accolades is nothing spectacular compared to something capracorn its a wonderful life which is emotionally powerful yet never gets cheesyand just like the real ship on her maiden voyage it started off to controversy followed by fanfare and then tragedy the reel version nearly collapsed in budget controversy and then was bolstered by the biggest pr campaign complete with criticswooing parties in the hopes of buying it around thrusting the film as the most overpriced and embellished multimillion hollywood machine which turned off many and caused many more around the world to realize it for what it was commercialism granted that its also a movie that because of its fame pervasive invasion on pop culture caused and still causes many to have an opinion about it ie herd mentality discreditingaccrediting of the film along the lines of majority sentiment ill suggest that these ramifications of the film do not determine the films genuine buoyancy by buoyancy im talking about the films long term standing in the realms of other all time accredited films the test if it really is a masterpieceof course my entire dialogue here is based on the premise that because it swept awards it has been rated a great film of which i disagree with i think the movie is found out upon repeat viewing and i think even the majority of its fans again remember to strip away the hype and the leo mania dont really rate it as a great film per se plus even here in the imdb why is the movie not recognized as a great film years after the initial awards fever because it has been found out over time for what it is a decent film that stood out for its historical recreation not facts in its entirety and weaved alongside a trite love story on board the ship of fools albeit being panoramically beautiful there are strong positives of course special effects as well as sound and editing but as you can see they are all technical aspects not in terms of classical film artthe film is a meticulous recreation and that is why i gave it 710 but it is not a great film as say an intellectually challenging fellini satirical commentary like and the ship sails on it was panoramically beautiful and had great costume design but it did not have say brilliant mise en scene that gives it nuance in that sense it is certainly not deserving of all of its accolades and accreditationnonetheless i do not dispute its garnering gargantuan box office revenue worldwide as that was foxs ultimate goal even if cameron had a personal crusade of submarine discovery essentially when you wash away the dicaprio mania not to be discounted because it tied in substantial box office receipts the hullabaloo of oscar accreditation  aggressive marketingadvertising campaigns successful from bangkok to rio dejaneiro or hongkong might i add youre left with a film that got found out as a victim of its own showy hypethus film critics could never call it anymore than it was popcorn fodder and once teenagers outgrew their crushes and people had witnessed the beautiful recreation of the illfated voyage that declared its pomp 80 years earlier there was nothing left of this ship it lies at the bottom of the sea save for nostalgic divers who yearn to return to their old sentiments have issues to deal with or are disillusioned by the hype of past tragedynot even god himself needed to sink the ship or the film there wasnt anything in it unless people take the real message of what we can learn from respect god be prepared love and treat your fellow humans as equals fight oppression class segregation battle the rich poor divide celebrate freedom and above all to not get caught up in the excesses and hype of initial success what we can learn from is that as pirated copies of the film are sold in afghanistan or cambodia by child slaves the real tragedy in the world today is that we should focus not on the 1700 people who died but turn our attention to the millions dying annually of inequalities marx or kafka could probably tell us that you dont need god himself to remind us of that by sinking ships and or mass marketed popcorn billion dollar filmsby stephen thanabalan,sad
ok this movie was out for two months when i saw this so maybe my expectations was a little high but with all the hype and money spent making it it should have been high this movie would have been better if it was just about the sinking i like love stories but sticking in corny old love story  rich girl doesnt want to marry rich jerk but instead falls in love with the bohemian artist  boy how original it took away form the great sinking i got tired of them running though the water cameron does not have a knack for writing good dialogsome other parts made no sense  why would billy zanes character go through this whole thing about stealing the diamond the boat is sinking and they locking him up in a room what is wrong here and the worst plot twist that will forever make me hate this movie is the diamond she keeps the diamond all these years and decides that tossing it into the ocean 70 years later was the right course of action what the beep first of all it was given to her by her fianc he was a jerk but if she didnt love him she should have given it back instead she hides form everyone and pretends she dies and hold onto the diamond why throw it in that diamond had a long history long before she ever got it and she just got the thing now it will forever be trapped at the bottom of the sea it might have made sense if it was dicaprio who gave it to her but it was billy zaneoh man i can go on and one about what annoyed me about this moviebut this is just my opinion i know there are many who loved it but tossing the diamond is not an opinion its just plain wrong,sad
im guessing that the cost of this movie made it imperative that it succeeded at the boxoffice hence virtually every paid movie critic in the world giving this a thumbs up when you know that some of them did so with both arms having to be tied behind their backs we all know the story what happens to the ship how many die what band members were still playing as it went under and the water was bloody cold yippee the plot is thick with predictability loose on plausibility and low on imaginability the acting was ok nothing more true the effects sequences were pretty impressive and if youd heard celine dions song for the first time you may have liked that also 1200345 times later and it doesnt half get on your bristols i can tell you this film had to bring in the money or many companies would have gone under so the hollywood publicity machine worked harder than ever before and got the job done creating never before seen box office returns personally id sooner have gone and watched costners the postman or tommy lee jones in volcano equally bad films but at least people were honest enough to say so,sad
the story of the has been told many times on television documentaries and almost all of them  especially thomas lords a night to remember  were better than this filmthere must have been a sale on stereotypes in hollywood because the producers of bought them all up by the bushel full the people up in first class with the exception of the one real life character portrayed in the movie molly brown were all fully stuffed shirts they were so starched it is hard to believe they were able to bend over on the other hand those poor folks down in steerage  sailing to their doom  were just the salt of the earth happygolucky fun loving free spirited some 200 million was supposedly spent on this movie the special effects were indeed impressive if they had only spent a little of that money on the screenplay even including some intelligent dialog think what a movie they could have had,sad
i remember being of the antibunch when the film was released would i have to go and see the movie at a theatre it was simply impossible theatres were full at each session even if the movie was on heavy rotation all over paris france one day i just thought to myself that it couldnt be that bad if so many people after so many months were still going to watch it if not rewatch it or even rererewatch it i gave in one day and i can assure you that the theatre was still full i must say i really liked it the first time like in the old times big fat sumptuous cinema now having seen it several times on a format that should be excommunicated tv i found a lot of annoying if not irritating things in it i still like the film globally but there are real spoilers first once someone made you aware that some parts of the movie have been made using a computer you cant help spotting them and thinking that navy crew in the background at the beginning of the film have a funny way of walking a bit like playdoh men other stuff bothered me a lot eg rose doing a finger when they take the lift to go to a lower level of the boat was it necessary is it plausible at such a time in the history it kinda makes you think oh man they cant be serious,sad
as a doctor i quickly realized that the role character rosemary kate winslet simply represented a mentally unstable personality disorder borderline histrionic you decide as such i can not find it appropriate to romanticize such characteristics thus glorifying mental illness also the male counterpart played by leonardo dicaprio is very shallow and with unimpressive efforts is given too much space in this movie somewhat of an antihero got lucky to meet the personality just mentioned i guess another way to say it is that she did all the work for him in double sense this time beneficial is the special effects and all the work on the set in fact this is the main reason for seeing this movie of course the connection to the spectacular historical event is another reason to see it kate winslet despite above mentioned deficiency in the character is a beautiful face and well acted so for that reason it may as well be worthwhile,sad
i would say that this is truthfully one of the best movies i have ever seen it came out when i was only 7 and of course i was not mature enough to understand what was going on watching it now i cant possibly imagine how anyone could not like this movieevery time you watch it it just gets better the movie is incredibly layered and you always see things you didnt the last time you watch it i definitely would give this movie a 9 out of 10 stars because it honestly deserves it a good movie to watch to anyone who hasnt seen it although that is something else about this movie everyone has seen it which just goes to show how good it truly is,sad
i saw in a firstrun theater in 1997 and loved it i had not watched it again until today because i had made the mistake  and it was a mistake  of believing that the enthusiasm for the film came entirely from teenaged girls and desperate housewives bzzzt wrong i am a man of ahem mature years and was deeply moved both in 1997 and again todaythe drama of this wildly romantic tale is greatly enhanced by the presence of the ominous tragedy that was the disaster nobody uses visual images enhanced by special effects better than james cameron and is his masterpiece it seems to me every frame of the film is beautiful and reflects the 200 million that were spent in making itnow lets talk about why i think that this film should work for everyone first there is no reallife disaster that was more poignant than the sinking so the movie rises far above the romantic disaster genre because it tells much of the real life story of the tragedy second the movie is simply awesome to both look at and listen to my enjoyment was enhanced because i got to see it on a big screen high definition tv and listen to it on a first class 51 home theater sound system finally just works if you pay attention and think it will break your heart i promise,sad
truth i did not see first run admittedly i was turned off by all the hype everyone was talking about it and how many times they had seen it and i could not go anywhere without hearing celine dion lol i finally gave in to curiosity and watched on its first video release i fell in love with it so i mostly just shake my head and chuckle people still come here to bash this film it has had loyal fans for the better part of a decade out of all the films in imdb some of which truly are bad why not go to those boards why do people keep coming here to bash not the film as much as its fans it is very perplexing and a little amusing are they hoping to change the minds of loyal fans do they also go to the boards of gone with the wind the wizard of oz star wars harry potter lord of the rings fans of these films also have all collectors editions and vast collections of memorabilia film makers will create what they think will sell but ultimately it is we the fans of film that decide there are many really wonderful films that are not big money makers this does not mean that a top grossing film is not good at the core of this film is the importance of the historical event human ego and arrogance will always be our downfall as a species when we begin to see ourselves as untouchable and invincible the result is always tragic yes there is a love story painted all over the surface of this film cameron even admits that this is as a technique to pull the viewer in it is the ship that is the star no pun intended of this story he had a burning passion to tell her story harry potter has 3rd graders lined up around the block to read a novel true fans more proudly announce how many times they have read the books as much as seeing the films now while harry potter is obviously not based on historical events j k rowling pulls in elements from classic literature and mythology shindlers list is extremely important both historically and cinematically it brought renewed attention to historical events that we should never forget history only repeats if we dont learn the lesson the first time whether or not a film personally appeals to me i respect any cinematic work that gets people reading talking thinking about things that they wouldnt normally who cares if some fans are wrapped in the love story cameron accomplished his goal people will not forget love it or hate it i have yet to meet anyone lukewarm about this film love and hate are both passions this film inspires passion if someone is going to come here to post about what they didnt like about this film then please do so lets hear what you didnt like lets hear a critique but just to come here to make eloquent enlightening and intelligent comments like this movie is dumb or play name calling at the fans is just bewildering to me,sad
i can not quite understand why this movie is rated only a 70 it is worthy of so much more i did not know what to expect from the movie when it first came out for viewing other than it being said to be terrific superb and heartmoving from classmates and friends when i finally saw the movie in the theaters i was left speechless that was the best movie i have seen the is more of a fairytale a movie that keeps you at the edge of your seats until the end of the movie it was a movie that displays the social classes the untroubled life of the low classes and the superficial life of the rich ones a part of the movie was a love story between two young people the rich and misunderstood girl played by kate winslet and the poor young man played by leonardo dicaprio when destiny brought them together on the voyage of the they faced many troubling events in order to pursue their prohibited love another factor that everyone should absolutely go see this is because of the platinum and oscar winning soundtrack it was simply wonderful it sounded like an angel singing and it really helped when it was played during the sad moments in the movie celine dion did an excellent job in singing my heart will go on and james horner did the terrific job producing the song james cameron the director did an unbelievable job in transporting the audience back to 1912 the misfortune of the sinking ship and the special effects for this movie wow it was jawdropping the computergenerated ship was flawless  i didnt even know it was computer generated until i watched the background scenes for this moviethe performances of leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet were absolutely breathtaking it almost felt as if the audience were apart of their love their love felt so real it is no wonder that they were nominated for academy award,sad
this is one of those films that was so overrated when it was first released it is not even funny it is very interesting to note that even though this film garnered so many academy awards you dont see it on any critics top ten list and its not even in this sites top 250 how could this be you ask the answer is that this is a classic example of people over reacting to the greatness of a film before really looking deeply into it this is not even a remotely accurate portrayal of events that occurred during the tragic maiden voyage instead it is just a bunch of tripe put together by an action director you can tell there are many out of place witty moments that simply do not belong in a film such as this the characters were annoying and two dimensional and you felt no compassion at all when these people were sinking out at sea actually these people were a bunch of arrogant jerks that deserved to die the film simply did not show enough of the poor people in the under decks to even give a damn about them they just showed far too much of jack and rose in all their silly blue lagooninessthis film really did have potential it really did and its not even all bad the second half of the film with the boat sinking is some of the best action ever to be put on film but this was not enough to save this film from sinking into mediocrity i have to give james cameron props for trying his skillful hand at drama but man go back to making action filmsthat is definitely your strong suit,sad
is hollywoods biggest moneymaker in history and for good reason  it is a great movie this movie is about sacrifice selflessness love devotion joy passion all occurring on a doomed ocean liner that suddenly and without warning sinks resulting in one of the worst maritime catastrophes in history kate winslett is magnificent as the young girl rose barely a teenager who is being pressured by her overbearing mother to marry cal a nasty brutal man who has only contempt for his unwilling fianc that cal is rich just makes his behavior worse rose by nature a gentle spirit is angry and desperate to escape so much so that she is about to commit suicide when she is saved by a young man jack who despite his shabby appearance is a welltraveled sensitive and upbeat artist who treats the troubled young lady with gentleness and respect and she responds their love for each other is instantaneous and unconditional and they are willing to die for each other this is not such an implausible scenario and there is absolutely nothing immoral about their behavior rose willingly gives herself to jack out of love for him and even decades later still thinks of him as her one and only true love the man who died for her so she could live that is love that is sacrifice that is life that is christian that they were not formally married is a mere technicality given the circumstances of their meeting a loving and understanding gd will forgive them now regarding the diamond that was given to rose instead of cashing it in like she could have she kept it as a memento to her one true love that is called character nothing unchristian about that indeed the movie is actually about how rose undergoes a complete transformation from a passive unhappy moody adolescent into a composed mature independent and beautiful woman even changing her name now prepared to go on to live a long and active life that is she experiences an epiphany that is called personal growth which is quite christian and most exemplary as for jack he is with rose in spirit and she lives her life accordingly knowing that if it were not for him she would not have survived jack gave his life for rose so she could live that is powerfully compelling and completely consistent with christian teachingsmaybe i shouldnt say this but i will i was waiting for the ship to sink because i was hoping that when the ship sank the movie would end  but it didnt and for that i was disappointed to me the story of the the is what happened to the ship not some contrived fictional and highly improbable love story between a little miss rich girl and a mr nice guy neer do well the movie is weak for two reasons first the movie is asking me to believe that a young lady would dump her handsome powerful influential and aboveall wealthy fianc who has her mothers approval in favor of a noaccount nobody who didnt even belong on the ship second since we already know whats going to happen to the ship much of the excitement is lost nevertheless the portrayal of how the ship actually sank and the resulting pandemonium was effectively done so if the movie had gotten rid of the love story and concentrated instead on how the passengers and crew coped with the impending sinking of the ship that could have been the basis for an exceedingly dramatic story but hollywood being hollywood if the story doesnt include at least a smidgen of sex and a big dose of sentimentality no matter how contrived then that story wont be the one that makes it onto the screen and this movie is proof of that statement as further proof of that statement consider the final scene in which little miss rich girl whos now something like 100 years old and a greatgrandmother tosses a multimilliondollar diamond overboard in the name of love even for a movie thats unbelievable it would have been better if she had used the diamond to pay for a salvaging operation to recover the divan on which she had posed nude for her boyfriend mr nobody who by sheer coincidence also happened to be an accomplished artist duh now that would have made for a good story the movie could have been entitled the  the story of a woman and the divan that made her famous now if somebody out there would like to advance me 50 or 100 million dollars to make this movie then well be in business,sad
spoiler to followall i could think through the agonizingly typical first two acts was sink the freaking boat already in my opinion the sappy overdrawn romance between two strangers who become so in love with each other over the course of two days that they are willing to throw away everything up to and including their lives for each other is not only corny and unbelievable but disrespectful to the real people who died aboard that shipthe special effects were brilliant the attention to detail in designing the sets and costumes was brilliant the screenplay was terrible this is a chick flick disguised as an adventure film all we heard about in the months prior to the film was the historical accuracies and the amazing special effects and 80 of what we got was a formulaic love storyand oh yeah theres a historic shipwreck in there too which is prety cool,sad
this is the best movie ever made in the whole movie industry why would i recommend anyone to watch it cause in one word  youll stay breathless this movie is incredible ive loved it in every way  the scenes the script the picture the clothes the music  its all so magical i really enjoyed watching the actors are amazing  handsome leo and beautiful kate which is by the way one of my favorite actresses did fine job and i couldnt picture anyone else to act instead of them there is some kind of power some kind of joy which can be seen in every second of this movie and that is what makes it so great love between rose and jack is so amazingly expressed in that free innocent way of their talking and just looking at each other and i dont want you think that im one of those types who are pure romantic souls and instantly watch soaps im in fact opposite of them maybe not entirely but i am thats why i dont think rose should be criticized for letting jack go into the water that is the thing that makes the strength of this movie the freedom of expressing cruel reality of todays world it cant everything go well and as the way we want it i really loved the fact that movie did not end and they lived happily ever after and it would be stupid if it ended like that this movie shows that you can at least once in a lifetime experience pure true and free love that can lead you to the most secret places in your mind and you can be saved by that person in every possible way that one person can be saved just as rose has said with these i words i leave you think about what i said and i recommend you to watch this movie cause those three are hours youll never forget just like i never will,sad
its been 6 or 7 years since i last watched and i liked it even better now than i did then this is mostly because im older and more mature i found that i could read the characters emotions better and guess what they were thinking and feeling even when they didnt say it or show it in an obvious way i have to also give the actors credit for performances that gave me subtext to readin a movie acting choices are filtered through the director and editor and i liked what they chose it would have been so easy to show characters strutting around in fine clothes or running wildly around in lifejackets but the film goes beyond that for example one strutting gentleman provides thirdclass passenger jack with a convenient model of how to carry himself like a gentleman some of the most poignant shots in the chaos of the sinking ship focus on crying children many of these shots are only seconds long but carry an enormous weight of emotion and storytellingi generally prefer linear stories without distracting literary devices like stories within stories the notebooks use of this device was almost too much is an exception its clever integration of a modernday story with the main story of the sinking impresses on us that this really happened in the opening scenes the modern story smoothly feeds us the necessary technical and historical data to give us a context into which we can place the drama that follows as the movie ends two stories blend together the modern story is really a continuation of roses story that begins when she boardsanother common device in movies although this one is born out of necessity is to have the same character at different ages played by different actors in many instances im not convinced that these two very differentlooking people could be the same person rose at age 17 and age 101 is utterly convincing in a modern bigbudget movie in case you were sleeping in 1997 was at that time the most expensive movie ever made i take for granted that the hair and makeup will be styled to emphasize the similarities between the two actors as far as casting lookalikes that also shouldnt be too hard considering all the aspiring actors there are out there where this movie really goes the extra mile is in the acting old and young rose share so many facial expressions vocal inflections gestures and movements that i never once thought of them as different peoplewith all these fine actors and the obvious ability to capture stellar moments im surprised at how much screen time director james cameron allows for shots of inanimate objects as the front end begins to sink in earnest tilting the ship up on end there is a famous shot of dinner plates falling off a shelf and smashing on the floor this shot is famous because people like me who were obsessed with the movie when it came out know that these plates were exact replicas of the plates on the actual made by the same company that supplied the ship of dreams with its tableware i admit that one could hardly make a movie set aboard the sinking without somehow showing the ships dramatic death throes but there were just a few too many shots of furniture floating around or wood splintering that distracted me from the incredibly intense human story being played outmay not be a perfect film but it certainly was aumwatershed jurassic park showed the world that computer animation could do amazing things quietly and for that time period innocuously used this tool to create shots on a scale as grand as the ship had been cameron pulled out all the stops when it came to getting the details right while the average film viewer might not have noticed this had it not been so hyped it impressed people on an intellectual level and helped set standards of realism and integrity in hollywood won 11 academy awards and it deserved every one of them,sad
a beautiful heartwrenching tale of love hope and tragedy is a timeless movie that will move you inspire you and bring you to tears this movie has all the elements needed for an epic film characters that get us involved in the story a wonderfully dramatic score fantastic technological achievements and a reallife tragedy that tugs at our heartstringssome people feel that the love story between rose and jack detracts from the real story of i however think that it greatly adds to it by following these two characters and their brief yet passionate love affair we get more involved in the story so when the ship finally sinks it is all the more heartbreaking when we see so many people meet their tragic end and the love story isnt the only reason we feel so moved when the ship is sinking the various scenes of the doomed third class passengers break your heart as well among other things as the ship sinks we see a mother singing her children to sleep an elderly couple lying together in bed and people desperately trying to get in the boats or jumping off the ends of the ship all these scenes made me cry i actually found myself in tears through almost the entire second half of the movie though the real sinking is terrible in itself this film emotionally moves us because we actually know people on the ship making this movie succeed where other films about have failednot only is the plot moving but the technological achievements in this film are ahead of its time james cameron was able to realistically recreate the sinking of and it is absolutely astonishing he is able to add amazing detail that had me utterly transfixed throughout the entire movie james horners score for the film is also spectacular it is haunting and wonderfully dramatic and completely suits the filmi never saw while it was in theaters as i was under 13 and my parents had this rule about not seeing pg13 movies until i was 13 in fact i didnt see until a couple days ago when it was on tv and even then i only saw the last half of the movie but that half had me so transfixed that i drove over to target right away to buy the dvd because i just had to see the entire thing and i am very glad i did truly is a timeless movie because even though it came out 8 years ago i absolutely fell in love with it it is now one of my favorite movies everis the kind of movie that people either love or hate and to give the haters some credit this movie does have its faults the acting is shaky at parts and some scenes and lines are a bit cheesy all movies have their shortcomings and is no exception but in the end none of that matters the good points far outweigh the bad making one of the greatest films of all time,sad
judging by some of the comments i have read about this film from others i would say that the makers of this film cannot win if they did not try to get the get the actual historical facts right i would be complaining if they do then the scriptwriters get it in the neck for not being imaginative enoughfor my part i thought that the rich girlpoor irishman story was wonderfully woven into the plot through the eyes of these two lovers we are given a wonderful history lesson we are introduced to the british caste system we know that there were motor vehicles aboard because they consummated their relationship in a car when the ship is sunk we know that people were stuck in the water for far too long before the lifeboats came to rescue them and that as a result survivors at that stage were very rare people who castigate all the literary devices used in this film should really lighten up they are educational devicesthere may be a few things about this film that are historically incorrect for instance in the trick photography scene where the captains cup of russian tea turns into the ship itself there is smoke coming from all four funnels even though everybody knows that one of the funnels  presumably the one that capsized  was a ventilatorthe only bit of real criticism would be the music it might have been better if the music were more timeless rather than the transitory voice of that canadian singer whose name i have forgotten already,sad
mildly entertaining at best at least a 6pack is needed to enjoy this film if you take a drink every time leo dicraprio screams rose youll be drunk in no time the only conceivable reason to watch this film a second time is to check out kate winsletts delightful headlights in full bloom but she can be seen in all her birthday suit glory in holy smoke now so its really not necessary at allother then that its pure hollywood big budget rubbish james cameron is in the same class as jerry bruckheimer  micheal bay who annually churn out the most redundant  unbelievably unbelievable crap which caters mostly to the masses of braindead followers who would eat a poop sandwich if they heard it was cool,sad
alrighti can watch over and over againand it never gets boringi thinkmy friends think im crazy bc im always talking bout how great the movie is the passion the love jack and rose had for each other i just wish i could find that ever since 5th grade when we were asked to write a paper story what ever about the you were able to be be a passenger or a reporter on the i chose to be a passenger and kinda of followed the story line of the movie i was a girl on the ship and it was the diary of my time on the ship it was the longest paper i ever wrote even now as a freshman in high school it was about 5 12 pages long both front and back of lined paper one day i told my mom i was going to go down and see the it seems so unreal i wanna see it live in person i dont think anyone understands how much that movie means to me or the itself hopefully someone out there does if you feel the same way email me dancinbabii010aolcom stephanie,sad
was an absolutely excellent movie it was is the greatest movie of all time those who laugh upon it know inside that they as well loved that movie and in most cases still do the entire world loved whoever dares to jest at this marvelous film is purely lying to the world and themselves the acting was excellent the effects were for that time excellent and as well by todays standards acceptable will never cease to be the greatest films of all time it won the most academy awards it had the best acting the best effects the best of everything it will always be one of the top love stories ever written it is famous worldwide and we all know so it is the easiest movie to crack in sherades if you just make a gesture referring to the movie even the little ones will respond with the correct answer to finalize is an excellent movie we all know it was great accept it,sad
i think that is a really good movie and leo  kate are great actors the only thing is that it is a love story up until the last hour of the moviethen its more of a drama but i personally like love storiesso this obviously was a plus for me but i can understand the people who dont like love stories might not like this movie as much anyway i love this movie and it makes me sad if not cryevery time i see it i think the heaven part at the end is very sadwhere everybodys clapping for them but its not just a love storythe ship sinking has very good special effects but the main thing i find not believable is that the love story goes a little too far for example in real life there wouldnt have been one person handcuffedjack and have another personrose come and get him but to me it made the story more interesting because their love gets me more involved in the story since you start to care more about the characters overall the movie is great so go see it and girls grab a box of tissues i really liked the movie and that is my opinion,sad
warning spoilers included will always remain one of my favorite films i have seen this movie so many times you cannot even imagine most people hate this movie now and make fun of it for some odd reason but i dont care everything in this film is perfect and flawless the cinematography art direction costume design visual effects performances music you name it once we go back to the time was to set sail for the first time magic takes over the film but of course we cannot deny that the ship is doomed in 4 days and 1500 people are going to die the sinking of the ship and the death of the passengers is not easy to watch but it is part of what made the film a great epic the final scene where roses spirit goes back to on the ocean floor and joining jack and other spirits is powerful and moving the love between jack and rose none of us can ignore and feel believe it or not roses fianc cal also did love rose but not the way jack did and i could see why rage took over him and tried to kill them with a guni would like to thank james cameron for making this film and the cast of doing such a great job and to the crew,sad
first of all i cant understand why this movie is rated with only a 69 it deserves much more it is a superb movie and really underrated hereit is a movie that makes me cry every time i see it and ive seen it lots of times but i found it never wears out with the timewhat can i say about the plot that could be new absolutely nothing i think everybody has seen this movie and everybody knows the plot it really deeps into the times of the and shows us all the social classes the unworried life of the low classes and the shallow and repetitive life of the high oneseverything rose wanted was to scape from that life that keeps people chained to the protocol and it shows us how was the mentality of that times it was all about the division of classes aristocrat people only cared about having a luxurious life not to be happy only to show off and all that shallow stuffit is quite impossible to say that story could happen in reality because a high class lady would have never looked at a poor guy but as for the movie it was something that you can really feel related to and thats why you cry when rose or jack cries or laugh when they laughwell and what can we say about the music simply wonderful really sad in moments and that really helps the movie celine dion did a great job singing my heart will go on and james horner producing the music one of the greatest of all time i have to sayand the special effects wow if you didnt know that the ship was computergenerated you would think that the was rebuilt for this movie i found no flaw in thisand wait im forgetting something really important the performances of leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet they were nominated for the academy award and they should have won it it was a job wonderfully done from them and with total justice they became superstarsif i must resume this i would say that nobody with a heart could say that movie didnt really touch them it was really tender and sad and a masterpiece which has welldeserved the 11 oscars it won and if you live in some other place of the universe and you didnt watch it yet go to your closest video store and rent it or buy it you wont be disappointed despite all these coldhearted who say it isnt a worthy movie of what has achieved dont listen to them,sad
is the best movie that i have seen to this day i was nine when i first saw the movie and the only reason why my mum let me watch it was because i had done so much research and written my own stories based on the the cinematography did the ship justice and the movie made the look just as good as the luxurious lineri remember sitting in the movies and crying but i also remember seeing everyone else in the cinema crying the movie touched so many people even though others more than some im sure that if i hadnt known about the previously i wouldnt have cried mainly because i was youngthe acting within the movie was some of the best i have ever seen leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet are my favorite actors many people do laugh at me when i say that but i dont care because they are the only two actors in history that have moved me to tearsi would recommend to anyone it truly is a work of art,sad
this movie was awesome this movie begins as people were hoping to go to america to be us citizens and were boarding on the biggest cruise liner that would take them to america was known as the ship that would would never have the problem that developed along the way to america this starts as leonardo decaprojack dawson makes his way on the ship by a lucky business everything starts off well on the ship but when jack falls in love with rose things did not start off right because roses parents were favorable about them seeing each other roses fianc tries to make things very complicated for jack but jack keeps trying a few weeks into the cruise the liner develops that horrible nobody can imagine while trying to make it safe off the ship roses fianc tries everything to stop them from getting off the ship together i enjoyed seeing this movie to see if jack and rose make it safety stay tuned,sad
i give this movie a rate of ten because this movie was and is the best movie i have ever seen in my life this movie is the top of my top ten list of favorite movies and i know that no other movie would ever replace it this movie is a love story and thats one of the things i love about this movie it shows how love could be found then lost but also last forever it also shows how keeping a promise could make your life worthwhile and how making each day of your life count as if that day was your last this movie shows how strong a love can be even if one lover had perished this movie shows that no matter what happens or no matter how hopeless their love will last for an eternity and it did this movie has taught me how to make each day count and that someday i might find my own jack dawson but most of all this movie has taught me that love could happen in a matter of days and last for an eternity this movie has always been my favorite and always will bei strongly recommend this movie if you havent seen it but then again its impossible that no one has seen it because im sure that everyone has at least seen it oncethis movie has touched my heart as well as the hearts of many othersi just hope that this movie has touched yours too,sad
when i first saw this movie way back in 1997 i was in awe at the ground breaking special effects this was the most expensive movie done up to its time im not sure if it is anymorelord of the ringsbut it definitely stands the test of time there are scenes in this movie that are timeless and unforgettable who can forget leos king of the world scene or kate winslets never let go scene no one at least no one who has seen the film the acting in the film is spectacular and kate and leo are the perfect pair there are certain things in the film that movie buffs like myself might find a little displeasing the dialog has been dumbed down so that people of this day and age could understand what the characters were saying secondly the title may be a little misleading this movie though based highly on the ship cant help but steer away from the point of the movie no one can disagree that is in most part a love story and stories about people sailing on the but even with these minor follies it never stopped me from buying the tape and watching it countless times to buying the dvd and watching it countless times this movie hit me into a four year obsession with the all i read were books and watch movies i know anything and everything about the ship and this movie surpasses my expectations it is a must see filled with action romance comedy and awesome special effects is a must see,sad
the visual effects were unlike any ive ever seen it combined a great story line with a stunning performance by kate winslet leonardo d was not at his best i liked him better in catch me if you can billy zane gave a great impression of seeming truly evil bill paxton was a great archaeologist i think deserved the eleven academy awards it received the scene that got me going was when rose had to get the ax to free jack from being locked in handcuffs it seemed so sad that rose only knew jack for five days before he died the costumes made me think i was in 1912 the only downer was the length of the movie other than that it was one of the best movies ive ever seen,sad
where ever do i startlet me get this right a story that everyone knows the end of is made into a film again and the entire world goes to see two million times despite the fact that they know exactly whats going to happen and then to top it off they praise it like its the best film ever madeok so the main point of the film is the love story between jack and rose even thats crap does the word cleche mean anything to anyoneso in summery its a story which has been told half a million times too many the acting iswell there isnt any and as for creativity the only word that comes to mind is yes its that badi suppose you cold say that i didnt like this film very much,sad
i watched with an open mind choosing to ignore my friends comments that this film was utter tripe however several minutes into the feature i realized they were correct and that is indeed a dogs dinner and a poor one at that the central characters were wooden and impossible to like with a real lack of depth and a feeling of complete improbability about there situation one thing that struck me was the terrible casting with a voluptuous and mature kate winslet being wooed by what appeared to be a underage teen punk waiting for puberty leonardo dicapriobilly zanes quintessential english villain was hysterical for all the wrong reasons with an over the top accent and a mustache and demeanor that made him as camp as you could possibly get however many historic hollywood flicks of the same decade feature similarly ridiculous english villains braveheart and the patriot other big culpritsit is not until the monumental vessel is struck by the treacherous iceberg that the epic jolts sluggishly to life as much as i dislike the film i can not deny that certain aspects of the true disaster scene were tense and exciting with a smattering of touching moments although like all hollywood flicks these occasions are hammed up with such vomit worthy sentimentality that you become nauseous just watching themi can sum up by saying that this is the usual corporate hollywood trash that brought us other such astronomical turkeys as pearl harbor and troy,sad
its hard to add a lot to what over a thousand people have said before so ill keep the comments short this is a fantastic movie the effort that james cameron put into filming the sinking ship is mindboggling and it works well worth seeing a love story an actionadventure disaster movie and a historical epic set on the high seas accurate down to the smallest detail all in oneits hard to imagine this movie ever becoming a classic of the gone with the wind type though because of the casting great classic films have great classic personacreating performances and this movie just doesnt have that leonardo dicaprio in particular is a very talented engaging young actor and its not his fault that an extremely ambitious epic movie like this was simply too heavy for him to carry but unfortunately thats the case i cant say that he was too young for the part but the character of jack was definitely too young for the movie this film needed more substance than he could give it dicaprio is simply too close to being a teen idol at least a 1912 version of one of course thats precisely why so many teen girls flocked to see this film multiple times and is a big part of the movies huge successkate winslet also is an endearing young actress and you really felt for rose in her bravery throughout all of her trials and tribulations but even after the megasuccess of this film winslet still doesnt have a clearlydefined persona maybe the problem is that we dont have oldschool movie stars anymore we have actors now and most of them are better at acting than the classic movie stars ever were but the oldstyle stars had personality plus and thats what this movie needed to make it a true classichaving said that though i really dont mean to be negative this is a grand story told extremely well and the sinking of the ship has the advantage of being a true story as well never was this tragic event duplicated on screen so well so accurately or so effectively by the way the music was awesome,sad
according to me this film is a total disaster not only because of the naive and cheesy dialogs but also for bad acting and for wasting peoples money and thought into this unrealistic middleclassy romantic drama 11 oscars and tons of other nominations for what what were these people thinking about if this film is so great how come 82000 imdb users think it is below averageis it because 20th century fox knew that all the time spent on lowering the viewers standards and ideals finally would pay off i do not know but something that i do know is that almost everyone that likes this film are totally uneducated in life and the art of projecting it in on a filmscreen,sad
what a travesty of justice any movie that this one was up against in 97 was better the real crime was la confidential not winning this movie sucks if anything it showed that mr cameron could organize lots of people nothing more than that predictable bad acting boring story line wasted dollars even good will hunting was better than this piece of trite filth the full monty was better than i would challenge anyone to dispute this fact i can easily dispel any non beleivers i havent watched the oscars since this terrible evil happened i mean if you want to watch a good ocean going movie try master and comander,sad
is an awful movie i watched this flick for the first time in years the other day and it really is the worst movie ever the script is ridiculous i mean come on put you hands on me jack please the acting is some of the worst acting i have ever seen kate winslet  jack  jack  jack  jack x 10000000000000 the only good thing about this movie is perhaps the direction i give cameron loads of credit for keeping that many extras under control i also like his camera work and the special effects however the absolute worst thing about this movie is that stupid song if i hear my heart will go on one more time i will puke in conclusion is over rated and did not deserve 11 oscars it deserved direction special effects and maybe sound thats it,sad
apparently i think this is the movie with the most people only dislike it because its cool to reviews ive ever seen unbelievable is this the way grown people are supposed to act when faced with differencing opinions i dont bash people who like it and excuse their opinions as meaninglessi was 12 when this movie came out and of course although i dont like to admit it had a small crush on leo dicaprio this was a internationalintergalactic maybe even phenomenon in 97 it was on every mans lips and everyone seemed to love it  i even remember a particular episode of the oprah winfrey show around this time where she had the actors and such from the movie and actually condemned people who hadnt seen it yet calling them crazy this was funny to me because i hadnt yet seen it when i finally went to see it people were bawling their eyes out all over the place with the occasional odd comment from the younger audienceone small child said it sounded like dicaprio had the hiccups as he was laying in the freezing water dyingeven then i didnt see what all the hype was about of course i didnt say this to anyone fearing for my life this movie was as someone said bigger than god although in my innocent opinion it was a solid flick the main theme the love story on the other hand hated it i would have much rather watched anyone else on the ship than those two and yes this despite my little crush it was just very nonsensical and uninteresting in my preteen mind i just didnt believe that these two could evolve a relationship like that in what 2 daysseeing it again a few years later ive come to see how terribly flawed the writing is above all else and plot wise especially that which involves the two love birdslike theres much of anything elsethis movie isnt a masterpiece in my opinion nor is it the worst movie ever made,sad
may contain spoilersis clearly one of the best films ever made  i first saw it in theaters when it came out back when i was 10 years old actually i saw it twice in theaters since it was that good  now i am 17 and i still love this movie and never get tired of it told the story of a poor man named jack who won tickets for the ship about an hour before it sailed falling in love with a very rich first class woman named rose together they experience many adventures on the ship including the sinking of the shipi believe this is one of the best films ever made  the acting is good the special effects are great the music is beautiful i love the song my heart will go on and the plot is wonderful  im glad this movie won all of those academy awards because it really deserved them  the only complaint i have about this movie is that its a little to long even tho every second of it is enjoyable  other than that this movie is great and it deserves a full 1010 stars,sad
without a doubt in my mind is easily one of the best movies i have ever seen if not the best it is moving each and every time i watch it it takes this true and tragic story of the and adds an amazing love story to it it is beyond a mere romantic movie it sets a standard winning eleven academy awards it is most definitely a masterpiece and shows the brilliance of the art of filmmakingjames cameron the director of the terminator movies really shows a soft and compassionate side in this movie the direction and production of this movie is incredible it is very craft fully done the synchronicity and very smooth transition from scene to scene makes every moment of this movie worth while this movie is over three hours long but it is the most easily spent three hours not at a single moment did i consider this movie to be dragged on or any other such nonsense the acting in this movie was off the charts this is the movie that sent leos career sky rocketing it really shows his talent as an actor the on screen chemistry between leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet is superb extremely believable i honestly can not see anyone else filling the shoes of these two anyone in the movie in fact what really makes this movie is the story it is taken from the true story of the but there is a fictitious love story the movie is focused around it adds a romeo and juliet scenario where the rich and poor are separated and can not be together it is a very romantic and captivating tale throughout much of the movie i would be sitting there with a grin on my face in owe of how much chemistry these two have also the humor which is not found much in the film is very classy and elegantly handledthe most memorable factor of this movie is the soundtrack at any moment in time if the music from the picture were to come on anyone can easily distinguish that it belongs to this movie though not heard until the titles celine dion has sung such a beautiful song the music from this movie really entrances you and hold youthis movie is easily a work of genius,sad
possible spoilers aheadthe ship sinks well then i saw this years ago and ive seen parts of it since it still sucks every time first of all does anyone else think that rose was quite whorish for those times i mean sure women were i guess starting to be more experimental but hell she stripped for him so he could draw a picture then they had sex in the car then she was so in love with him that she jumped back onto the ship so that she could be with jack ridiculous now heres the part where i actually give some credit to james cameron the film was beautifully shot and i consider that one of the only good reasons to see that film unfortunately leonardo dicaprio crapped this movie up real goodif only they went with one of their original choicesmccauley caulkinyea thats right the kid from home alone seriously he would have made that movie a comedy and then u could salvage that piece of crap i would have totally bought a ticket to that movie if i heard that when mccauley found out the ship was sinkin he would slap his cheeks and screampriceless moment right there,sad
in an entire lifetime their will never be another film to equali saw it 14 times and never missed a frameit was a masterpiece of hard work and the results showedi traveled to mexico to see where the film was shotand walk on the same ground those wonderful performers walked oni thought about the long hours of shooting and the hard work all the actors put inleo and kate were unbelievableshould have won oscarstheir performances were very realand the scene where kate is going for help and the light flicker on and off was one of the best i have ever seen in my lifetimei thought about what i would do in that terrible situationwherever their lives may go in life this film will be the triple crown in their lives i hope someday the entire film is released on dvdevery scene that had to be cut for time a masterpiece that i will never forget as long as i live simply the very best film ever madein my mindon oscar night when won 11 awards i felt greatbut it should have won 13well we dont always get everything we want in lifedo wei know that their were millions of souls on earth that felt the same way i did and still do about this masterpiece called in my eyes the film will live foreverfor many generations to comei hope someday they will rerelease the film so i can marvel at the awesome scope on the big screenmaybe in 2007 on its 10th annv im hoping it happens,sad
i have not seen this awesome movie before it has a nice setting all over the movie is the huge ship which has never been made before and will not be made after thats just my guess when jack is trying to save rose and her leg slips down was the scene which would not have been imagine if some one fall offs from that one is simply dead goes on with friendship  later on love within jack and rose the part which i keep wanted to look at is when the touches the iceburg and started getting crack from middle and then it goes down all the way to 2 and a half mile the said part was that jack diesgreat movie ever seen before and would like to see each and every movie which would probably release in future,sad
rarely has a film as long as kept my attention span for the full length of the filmi didnt even want to go see this movie in the theater  my sister who could not drive at the time and her friend wanted to go and offered to pay my way in  i figured what the heck a free moviewithin the first 10 minutes of the movie i was hooked  the scenes between rose and jack were very well written and everything about the movie was great  jim cameron truly showed what life was like on the with the steerage people 3rd class being the low men on the totem pole  the tear jerking scenes between the irish woman and her 2 children and the elderly couple in bed towards the end were probably some of the best scenes ive viewed in a long timegreat movie,sad
spoilers though if you havent seen this movie like it or hate it youve been living under a rockok i was 9 when i saw first and maybe i was born wrong but i was able to see as a good piece of film making if you get past all the oscars and the media hype and how many times they played that sodding song on the radioits just a good movie with great performances and after we all realized that leonardo dicaprio isnt that good lookingwe sort of forgot about it and of course we got sick of it but nowadays we find ourselves dusting off our vhs copies of just to see if it matched the calibur of return of the king because they both have the same amout of oscarsthe first two hours are pretty happy and if youre a tough critic youd call it mediocre but that last hour and a half are phenomonal as soon as the ship hits that iceberg were ready for it after being subjected to kate and leo making love and the special effects and the story in those last 15 hours are so tragic and so sad i found myself caring more about the other passengers than rose and jack because you know one of em livesid say the best performances in the movie is a tie between kate winsletrose and billy zanecal leo is good not fabulous but good and when he uses what hes given he does fine kathy bates is awesome as molly brown ive seen the deleted scenes in and they shouldve kept em in because it gives you alot more about the characters then we get bernard hillcaptain smith is pretty good and so are frances fisherruth dewitt bukater and gloria stewartold rose i love victor garber as mr andrews danny nuccifabrizio and jason barrytommy ryan are pretty promising actors the dialogue is pretty goodoverall is brilliant visually and beautifully heartbreaking mentally the high note of the whole movie james horners musical score that man is a musical god listen to the soundtrack folks i recommend s 1351215 15 especiallyis a goods movie people get over it,sad
an exciting story about the sinking of the unsinkable titannic on february 4 1912 with the loss of over 3000 passengers  the story is viewed by 95 year old rescued woman played by gloria stuart her viewpoint of her love affair with jack dawson who gave her strength to carry on  jack dawson is played by leonardo de caprio and his lover played by kate winslet  she tells of an exciting escape from the vessel on that dark cold night  the film lasts 139 minutes with an intermission  fine acting music and some very intense moments  john cameron is the director and he and the film won several academy awards for 1997   this is one of leonardo de caprios best movies  710,sad
how does one describe the perfect film in order to answer this question one must watch the perfect film in this case is the perfect filmhas the perfect cast perfect script perfect scenery and the perfect director these are only a few of the many reasons the 1997 version of owned all the qualities that make an outstanding film furthermore has great action sequences dramatic moments suspense and romance is the personification of excellence and perfectionit contained brilliant performances by kate winslet leonardo dicaprio billy zane and kathy bates i was truly impressed by the performance of billy zanes cal who was the jealous fiance to kate winslets rose the casting director knew what he was doing when he chose zane because the role was played with such ease the set design and costumes that overseen by director james cameron was done with careful attention to detail the accuracy of the set and costumes was superb it was not easy to tell the difference whether or not it was made or reali have seen many many times and will continue to see as long as i own the movie because it was that well done it continues to hold a special place in my heart and will for as long as i livethis continues to be one of the best films i have seen everyone should see it again and again,sad
would have made for a perfectly acceptable hourandahalf film the set design and costuming  all the period details really  were fantastic and the plot albeit formulaic at least held to hollywoods general standard of mediocrity and no worse than that but where is it written that the length of a movie has to be relatively commeasurate to the vessel on which it is set what this movie needed was a good editing  preferably by an editor armed with a chainsaw instead of settling for a passable 5star yea even enjoyable 6star historical romance they shot for the moon  and produced an exercise in tedium and selfindulgence i find it most noteworthy for the fact that it is the only movie in film history that ever managed to make me root for an iceberg an unusual sensation and no mean feat,sad
when looking back at you spot many faults with it and it doesnt seem as good as when you first watched it or you look back and think how cheesy a lot of the scenes were but at that first time you see it i think everybody who watched it was completely embraced into the life of jack and rose  i was so excited seeing for the first time as it is the gone with the wind of our generation but with more special effects and more disaster like the gone with the wind was   if you ask someone to this day what they think of then you will probably get the response you might expect and that is it was rubbish or it didnt deserve the success that it got   i think what annoyed a lot of people about was leonardo di caprio because of the teen madness that surrounded the movie at the time but that doesnt make it a bad film and it certainly doesnt make leonardos performance any less convincing than it was because he was top class and nothing more   when i was going to see gangs of new york i asked friends to come along but they didnt want to because of di caprio and if that is the reason why then they are without doubt narrow minded its not his fault that my friends girlfriends would rather sleep with him and not them but lets talk about the filmas soon as the film starts its pretty obvious how the ending is going to turn out but its just not a story of jack and rose its about everybody that was aboard the  these characters become more important obviously when the ship is sinking but it doesnt stop you caring and wondering about who these people were   the scene where the young irish mother is telling a poem to her children when they lay in their whilst the sea water over runs there deck just shows how cruel was for sinking for letting that happen to people especially when there is nothing you can do about  it reminded me of how somebody is drowning but is not actually underneath the water but is waiting to die  and i think thats what makes such an important movie about struggle and the strength to continue and fight for survival  these are hidden messages but seem obvious once you have watched so many times like i have and james cameron maybe a lot of things but a bad director he isnt as every film he has ever made apart from piranha 2 have been masterpieces even true lies can be seen as a comic action masterpiece as it has your villains your heros and the love interest  is the most successful film of all time and there is no reason i think of why it shouldnt be,sad
what a dreadful piece of crapapotheosis of the hollywood blockbuster insipid story line bigname stars major logical lapses and stunning special effects  if you want to see this subject matter treated intelligently and movingly see englands a night to remember,sad
the visually enthralling film expressed a sadness that absolutley overbeared me i recently broke my tape and went out and bought the dvd in hadnt seen it in theaters and it amazed me on tape in the ending i found myself surrounded with tissues and drenched eyes kate winslets performance as rose was beautiful and intelligently written so she danced onto the screen with grace i wish that gloria stuart got more publicity with her perfect role as the older rose telling bill paxton and others her story but on the dvd there are no special features except for a well edited trailer some love itsome hate itchoosemovie grade five stars out of five special dvd features 12 half a star out of five,sad
ok the biggest film of all time  let us remember that it was good  it looks astounding even now  it takes the already good a night to remember and improves upon it  the muchderided love story works for me im sorry in fact the one bad thing anyone had to say about this in 1997 was that the dialogue wasnt up to scratch  excuse me  how many quotable lines shes made of iron sir  i assure you she can sink im the king of the world we are dressed in our best and prepared to go down as gentlemen but we would like a brandy you unimaginable bastard  this film is a true classic in the oldfashioned sense of the word,sad
i absolutely loved this movie  it had everything a movie should havedrama romance action and even a bit of humour from time to time james cameron did and outstanding job  is in my top five fave movies of all time,sad
this movie had to be one of the best movies of all time spoiler when the two of them are in love regardless of social class and hold on the very end made me cry until i couldnt cry no more leo dicaprio did an outstanding performance as jack since i really couldnt picture him being that outstanding of an actor after i saw romeo and juiletenough said for that and then kate winslet breaks in being the opposite leading lady and made herself known in my opinion as a good actress i hope that this movie will let others see social standing are no barrier for love since love is the strongest element that i believe is needed  the man that played the supposed love interest billy zane did not a bad job himself he really had me convinced of having a jeolous side and had me wishing that someone would just kill him off or something but the love story appears to be the main focus of the movie the sinking of the ship carried thousands of souls and many of them probably had a love tale of their own the experience of the ship sinking was remarkable and truly made me feel i was there and seeing the spoiler old people on the bed and the children being tucked in as the ship sails away since they know that they have no chance of surviving since the first class had to get off first  that really triggered an emotion inside me that had me crying for a long time as the ship slowly sinks to the bottom of the ocean  appreciate the movie and enjoy it to the best of your ability a definite tearjerker with some of everything to offer the movie a a,sad
is one the weakest films i can remember seeing a pathetic mix of weak romantic plot poor acting and too much reliance on special effects if people want to see a film about the please watch a night to remember rather than this tripe and if you want romance watch casablanca just avoid this like you would an iceberg oops,sad
superficially the loss of the is a strange theme for a movie since we all know what happened before it even starts  but apollo 13 despite its faults showed that a story of this sort albeit one with a happier ending can still succeed through a lowkey focus on the human condition in a state of adversity  for however writerdirector james cameron has chosen to embellish the facts with a predictable and cliched romance in which kate winslets feisty intelligent and way too modern heroine overcomes the stupidities and rigidities of her privileged background to learn about herself and life through the love of leonardo dicaprio  boyman dicaprio appears hopelessly miscast playing a man of the world in the fashion of the lead in a high school romcom  in fact his role is a pretty straight reprise of his romeo in baz luhrmanns brilliant shakespeare adaptation  but whereas the whole of that film was imaginatively conceived so that this character worked in that role in he is desperately unconvincing in a piece of social commentary that prefers corn to meat at every opportunityyet oddly the film is compelling to watch at least until the iceberg hits precisely because you know what must come in the end  but when the boat starts to sink so does the film  when the natural drama of the situation begins to climax cameron focuses instead on the ludicrous personal melodrama of his leads and an extended action sequence that makes star wars seem believable by comparison  the final sinking by contrast is actually quite moving though needless to say presented with a minimum of economyoverall is a contradictory film  its massive budget shows in the beautiful attention to visual detail particularly in the mighty portrayal of the engine room and the bombastic force with which the director combines the private and the public sides of an unquestionably massive movie  but it also shows in the goodversusevil plotting the way that every scene is milked for more than its worth the need to tie everything up with a semisatisfying moral knot and the general violation of the principle of occams razor ie it is vain to do with many what can be done with fewer  both an awesome spectacle and a perfect example of what is wrong with hollywood is a true film of its era  but watch das boot instead for a real maratime epic,sad
i think is the worlds greatest movie or atleast it is in my opoion if you have not watched it please watch in now all of my friends love it and my family like it it is so beautiful so sad and so moving to me it really brings home the terrible tradegy of the unsinkable ship,sad
an awesome tourdeforce of confident filmmaking adventure story love story disaster movie and the mystery of the missing jewel running throughout the film this is entertainment of the highest order gripping and oh so emotional the story rocks along so tight that at no point do you feel that you are witnessing an accurate documentary of what happened the night the unsinkable ship went down,sad
titanica marvelous story captivating events and looking a the box office totals there were a lot of people interested in this movie  but why does hollywood have to make it into a sloppy love story  surely if they are going to stage a fictional story within one of the most famous events of all time make it a good onehere are some ideas  a oceans 11 style heist or a murder mystery or an espionage thriller oh there are so many possibilities why oh why a trashy love storythe effects in the film are brilliant the sets are great the acting is even ok  but the story is inadequate for such a grandiose settingit reminds me of pearl harbour  another fantastic event spoiled by a trashy love story  oh yes enemy at the gate another fascinating story ruined by a dubious love storyrant over apologies,sad
spoiler alert the first time i watched this film it was a highly emotional experience the second time ironically it bored me to tears i realise that it was one of the biggest movies in cinema history but after initially liking it i could see through its grandness and see that it had big faults the consensus of the general public was that the is a great movie however i am one person who disagreesone of the worlds greatest tragedies the unsinkable ship a most unimaginable human catastrophe the untold stories lay in mystery two and a half miles beneath the waves of the north atlantic now in a fictional romantic tale jack and rose meet aboard the illfated but their love gives them hope and courage as their trip aboard becomes a struggle just to survivejames cameron certainly had big visions when he accepted the directing role on i believe cameron wanted the to appeal to a certain audience perhaps young couples who have just fallen in love i do not know but what i do know is that having the love story in this film was unrealistic and boring for that matter however i did like how the film showed the events leading up too the ships demise and the demise itself as these had great drama and were what i was expecting from cameron in the directors chairbut the biggest fault in this movie came from its story which was also written by cameron firstly i did not like how the story started having it being told from the point of view of a much older rose gloria stewart instead i would have rather the story start with all the excitement of seeing the about to leave the doc then to write in a love story such as the one presented here was a typical hollywood move very corny and for me unappreciated i agree with the people who say that the love story presented here is most disrespectful to the people who lost their lives on board the ship but would have such a relationship ever have developed on board i say no because the very experience of being on the would have been very overpowering for many people then again when the story starts to show the ship in crisis that is when i became interested again as that i what i wanted to be told via the storyi will admit that there was some pretty good acting talent on show in the jack dawson leonardo dicaprio is men that you could call plain lucky or unlucky which ever way you look at his situation aboard the dawson is an artist painting many different things the only reason he is aboard the great ship is because he won a hand of poker at the local saloon he is now on the way to america little does he know what is about to unfold in his life on the he casually glances at a beautiful woman called rose dewitt bukater kate winslet while dicaprio and winslet are great in their roles i still find it hard to accept the love story the pair share as i feel it was only ever there as a device to help sell the movie even more however it did not work on methere are other roles i enjoyed in roses fianc caledon cal hockley billy zane was great as the mean and nasty bastard  he believes he can buy what he does not have and gives rose a necklace called the heart of the ocean a big focal point to the film i love when cal gets angry and aggressive towards other people on the ship especially jack how he escapes from drowning in the cold ocean waters was very clever indeed the other character i liked here was margaret molly brown kathy bates she is tagged as being unseekable molly brown with many of the 1st class passengers not liking her at all bates humour was a real highlight for me as was her help for jack and her compassion for the drowning passengers of thei also enjoyed the special effects of showing the ship both functioning and in demise especially the moment where the ship tears itself in half and start to sink the sets are also done in a grand way in this film showing how classy an experience it must have been on the the musicals score to is not bad as it makes for great drama tension and emotion the main song of the soundtrack my heart will go on sung by celine dion was a big song at the time of this movies release however when i hear it these days i cringe at how bad it really issure the is the highest grossing movie of alltime and winner of 11 academy awards including best picture and director but these facts do not change my opinion on how bad i think it is i feel it is a movie that has suffered hollywooditis with just too much of the standard movie formula done here too sink a ship i would have preferred to see a much more lowkey movie focusing more on what it would like to be on such a ship as the such as when jack is at the front of the boat screaming im the king of the world as those sections of the movie had me captivated i cannot say the same for its love story also running at about 3 hours and 10 minutes it was just a bit too long for my liking i am amazed at how nave the passengers were about the indestructibility of the saying that it was unsinkable because they were proven too be majorally wrongcmrs gives 15 bad  ok film,sad
i love absolutely love itits a film about a magnificent machine a triumph of human technology over environment that goes horrifically wrong when the masters of the machine become too prideful perfect filmmaking materialin some respects im surprised that its taken so long to make a block buster film about the im not counting the 1958s a night to remember which was a fine film but hardly a big budget production but with todays digital technology its been well worth the waitthe faithful creation of the is the most intricately beautiful machine brought to the cinema screen and james cameron uses the films human characters as camera guides to weave the audience through all the grand rooms and all the nooks and crannies of the immense ship brilliant brilliant stuffas for the characters in the story  handsome jack lovely rose her brittle mother her insidious fianc i love them all yes they are all representatives of class cliche from the era but every single actor injects considerable life and genuine personalityas my tag line states im a guy and i cried its very very rare for me to cry during a film but swept me off my feet ive seen it twice on the big screen twice on video and caught it on tv two nights ago even though i had the intention of channel surfing my heart and full attention were captured yet again by this magnificent lavish film and i couldnt switch channels even during the ad breaksyes deserved every oscar it won and yet im as cynical about the oscars as the next generation x dude 910,sad
of all the epics this world has seen is perhaps the grandest and most timeless experience weve seen not only is the story of the sinking told with great emotion and intelligence but the movie itself stands out as one of the greatest movies there has ever been11 oscars and nearly 2 billion dollars landmark this film in cinema history and its not hard to see why the script is solid the acting is great the visual effects are excellent and the score is perfect movies like this are rare and we havent seen films like this since the likes of gone with the wind there are only a few movies that can compare to these movies such as lord of the rings and i for one cant get enough of them these are the kind of movies that cinema was made for,sad
this is a beautiful love story set abord the james cameron is a genius a wonderful director and visionary this movie made me cry so many times i dont think i can count everything from the props the extras and even the ship is perfect i spotted few mistakes and the ones that i did i really didnt care aboutthe plot is perfect rich snobby british girl that wants to get out of everything falls in love with a poor class american who just happened to get a lucky hand of pokerthe acting is great jack portrayed by leonardo dicaprio is the perfect character leo played the character so well that i could almost believe the story was real kate jacks love interest  kate winslet was awesome and so beautiful the other actors including victor garbo and kathie bates were superbthis is a great movie i recommend it to everyone 12 out of  stars ,sad
i saw this movie in the theater before there was a huge buzz about how huge it was and so i had no notions of what to expect before i saw it and it blew me away  i honestly feel that a lot of the reason some people are so critical of it is as a backlash to peoples obsessiveness over it after it came out  there is a reason people obsessed over it though  never since have i seen a film that has moved me more emotionallyi think the acting is quite good especially by kate winslet and bill paxton somewhat less so by leonardo dicaprio and billy zane  the main things i think lacking are a really deep or philosophical message and real artistry to the filmmaking but then again it shouldnt have those  its an emotional movie not an art film  the soundtrack is one of the best ever made for a movie and the movie as a whole is just so grand and well done that it moved me to tears the first several times i watched it  i would rate it a 10 except that it just dosent have the depth and art and rewatch value of movies like requiem for a dream se7en or the matrix reloaded but the point is to get this movie you have to be willing to watch it when youre willing to be emotionally moved and without preconcieved notions about how its overrated or sappy if you do that it really packs a punch  best chick flick ever made,sad
when i watched the movie  i had very limited knowledge of what went on on that illfated voyage therefore i was definitely moved when james cameron showed in remarkable detail the tragedy which occured dicaprio and winslet gave wonderful performances no other actors during that time would probably have had the charisma and talent to pull it off like they did the film was impressive in the way it captures the look of old film and its overall epic qualityif you like love and romance and enjoy excellent filmmaking like the countless  people who made this the biggest selling movie of all time this is the movie for the ages on the other hand if you dont like romance andor the type who likes nitpicking every flaw in a movie as some of my friends and some of the reviewers who gave this film a one you probably wont10 out of 10,sad
this movie is excellent thats all i can really sayim not even going to go into the plot  there are thousands of reviews online you can see it theremy reviewwhen this movie came out in 1997 i was 13 years old maybe a year into pueberty at that time i had just discovered my passion for freeweights bench press was and still is my fav my hormones were in full swing producing more testosterone then i knew what to do withmy buds and i like everyone else in the bloody world had heard of the epic romance and laughed that it was a complete chick flick we boycotted the movie saying we would never go see it in a million yearswell after it had been out for about 4 months i went and saw it with my little sister and her friend who were 9 and begged to see it but my dad had been reluctant due to the pg13 rating i sat in the back row while they sat in the front there were still a fair ammount of people there 4 months after releasei sat through the 3 hours without even going to the bathroom i would never admit it to my buds but i cried at the end not weeping or anything just tears i quickly wiped them away before walking my sister and her friend outwhen i told my friends about it i told them yeah it was so fuing funny when that idiot jack died i laughed my a off of course it was complete bs but i couldnt tell them the truth but i bet that the first time they saw the movie they cried as welland that is the kind of movie this was it was that touchingi dont like romance flicks at all but i did this one i cant put into words why i just dida lot of people bash this movie even my friends and i now think of it as a great movie just as a great chick flick movie but i have no idea why some people bash the special effects please they were superb the plot it was great damnit or the historical relevancy it was very accurate except of course for jack and rose i say let em bash it why bother to try to change their opinions some people find fault with everythingmy favorite aspect of the movie would have to be the cinemetography the shots were just so damn goodmy 2nd favorite would be the soundtrack and let me tell you im normally a hard raphiphop fan i dont like celine deon but the theme song was excellentthe acting was a nothing much to say i loved bernard hill as captain smith especially tho probably because of his role in lotr i urge all of you to watch this movie it may be the best of our lifetimesjames black wolf johnston,sad
this movie is not great its just ok especially considering that it won so many awards and was directed by james cameron whose made several masterpiecesboth terminators aliens and the abyss which were all much much better than this  this film had several flaws overlength sucky actingleonardo thats you to name a few  when i think of a james cameron film i think of heartpounding thrills and a little bit of blood to add a little extra interest  it just annoys me how james cameron is known for this movie when his other movies were so much better especaially the criminalally underrated the abyss  this film is worth watching but it is no where near a masterpiece    out of ,sad
after seeing again just this past january after not seeing it in 5 years i must say this movie is still one of my favorite movies to this day  i still love the magical feeling i get when i watch this film  i really felt like i was back in the early 1900s about to take a voyage on that infamous ship  very few movies can actually make you feel like youre therebut did  i still love the performances from dicaprion winslet zane and bates  i think they did amazing jobs given the subpar script they had to work with  even the lousy dialogue as people say didnt ruin this movie for me  it more than made up for itself with costume set design historical accuracy and detail and special fxi think the main reason why people bash this movie is because it was so good and loved by many people  it didnt become the highest grossing movie of all time by people hating this movie lolalso the orchestra playing music on the deck is not a copy from monty python  theres actual historical truth to that  its a  fact that the orchestra played that night on deck to calm the nerves of the rich upper crusty people  one of the main reasons why i love this movie is because cameron really made you think about society and class even in our days today  the same thing goes on  the people with money make the rules and own the land so to speakalso im not so sure cameron wanted the audience to initially feel sorry for the rich upper class snobs  i felt sadder for the lower class people however in the end when all of of bodies are swimming and struggling to stay alive in the oceanit didnt matter what class ticket you held in your handyou were most likely going to die if you drowned or froze to death in that water  now its true more of the rich people survived but heythats life  it was still a tragic tragic event in history and i dont know why people love to bash this movie  because it was so successful   most likelysuch a  good moral,sad
possible spoilers is one of the most beautifully made films of all times  i am not usually emotional when it comes to movies but to be honest i found myself crying my eyeballs out when i first watched it is unquestionably a masterpiece every single part of that movie elegantly coheres with the rest of it  the love story occurring during such tragic event as the sinking of truly reveals the power of pure love and the risks one is willing to take in order to save it the acting was great  kate winslet is quite a dramatic actress and after this movie she became one of my favorites  personally i am not a big fan of dicaprio but i dont think he made this film worse in any waythis film is a phenomenal masterpiece but it was way to overexposed which caused denial in many people  i give it a 1010,sad
i managed to avoid watching this movie for years im surprised that its rating here on imdb is 70considering the rabid fan base and the fact that you could not escape that horrid theme song for forever i would have thought it was an awesome moviewhen push comes to shove its an ok movie but its neither awesome nor terriblein short it is a 70 movie i guessthe first half is the best the second half falls apart completely i guess it just goes to show that the more money you pour into a project the more you can get out,sad
many people like it many people hate it many people havent seen it many people wonder why it was made many people wonder what went wrong many people wonder how the money could have been spent on many smaller projects many people cringe at the over sentimentality that many historic stories gather in their constant retelling many people wish that the dialogue was written by a scriptwriter the acting was done by actors that the cgi was done by real artists the plot line was not overembellished the historical accuracies went further than the wooden staircase and the critics were braver than they were many things have been said about this film many in error many millions of dollars was spent in the making the marketing and the watching of this film many people wonder what makes millions of people watch this kind of film when so many other films deserve more attention and support many of the people went to see what all the hype was about but in the end the futility of these wonderings are many,sad
when i first saw this movie i totally felt like i was on the ship of i was having the feelings of those people that died in the ship i am still trying to get people into that movie cause i see that people are loosing the interest of these days theyre starting to be careless for it but i love that movie  the ship real people please let us not forget that tragedy that happened in 1912 and let us keep the spirit of alive thank you shylesh,sad
i saw the movie for the first time when it arrived on video needless to say that i had very high expectations for this movie because i heard a lot about it i watched the movie and i remembered my first reaction when i finished watching it my reaction was this is it dont get me wrong its not a bad movie not at all but i was disappointed about it all and it just didnt met my expectationseverybody knows the true story about the ship the and there are many moviesseries made about it already new about this movie is the love story its always dangerous to put a love story in a movie because if the love story doesnt work the movie doesnt work the love story does work for most parts in this movie except for some scenes in which i just dont buy italthough the movie is very long it doesnt really ever get boring which is of course a good thing the best part of the movie is the sinking and you can see that james cameron is really one of the best action directors in the businessthe acting isnt great but not bad either the special effects look good with the exception of a few needless scenes the movie is also full of visual mistakes for instance you can clearly see the camera in a scene which is a huge mistake that i noticed on my first viewing and the characters in my opinion arent really interesting enoughalthough the movie got more credit then it really deserved i can still recommend this movie to everybody good but not perfect710httpbobafett1138blogspotcom,sad
contains spoiler i dont understand how some people can say this movie is so bad and how leonardo dicaprio isnt a great actor  i think leonardo di caprio played his part in this movie very well there really looked like there was a bond between him and kate winslet  i am glad leonardo played the part of jack rather then brad pitt because i think brad pitt is more suitable for the action movies i must agree the last half an hour or so is very moving it brings a tear to my eye every time especially when rose kate winslet says to jack i wont let go jack then lets his body sink to the bottom of the ocean and for those people who say the only good bit in is when the ship sinks well these people are either in to modern day action thrillers and not into true stories or they dont relise how well the movie resembles the real story of this movie in my opinion should be at least in the top 10 movies ever made,sad
whats inexplicable firstly the hatred towards this movie it may not be the greatest movie of all time but gimme a break it got 11 oscars for a reason it made eighteen hundred million dollars for a reason its a damn good movie which brings to the other inexplicable aspect of it i have no idea whatsoever why this movie left such an impression on me when i saw it in theaters ive rewatched it on tv and video and it had none of the impact it had when i saw it on the big screen twice or maybe three times actually but that might be it the appeal of it its a movie yes capital m there its an epic its a spectacle in the order of gone with the wind or ben hur now ben hur and gone with the wind seem kinda hokey to me with the hammy acting and excessive melodrama not that has none of that well the acting was actually very good the melodrama was quite heavyhanded at timesbut the reason works is that its such an emotional ride i usually enjoy movies that stimulate the mind or give me a visual thrill this movie isnt exactly dumb but its not cerebral at all the visual thrills are simply means to an end to fuel the emotions of the audience i didnt cry when bambis mom died i dont react to tearjerkers but this is a tearjerker to the power of ten million an emotional rollercoaster that if it were a regular one would make buzz aldrin scream like a little girl and im sure that if you see it on video and have decided that you hate it and have a ready supply of cynicism then you can thoroughly dislike this movie but if you let that disbelief suspend just a bit if you give this epic melodrama the benefit of the doubt youll enjoy it completely and look at the top ten grossing films of all time is a single one of them bad is a single one of them worth a score of 1 out of 10 no not even the phantom menace and this movie made 18 billion dollars worldwide it cant be bad not possible 1010ps how can anyone even consider comparing this to spiderman spiderman was a fun movie but it was a total 911 kneejerk that caused it to gross as much as it did it simply wasnt anything all that special no one will remember it in 50 years but im pretty sure will be remembered,sad
why do people bitch about this movie and not about awful movies like the godfather is the greatest movie of the 21st centurywith great actingdirectingeffectsmusic and generally everything this movie is always dumped by all because one day some one said they didnt like it any more so most of the world decided to agree there is nothing wrong with this movie all i can say is that this movie not only being the most heavily oscar awarded movie of all time the most money ever made ever and sadly one of the most underrated movies ive ever seen apart from that it is truly the best movie of all time the only movies that come close to being like all the star wars and the lord of the rings trilogy or anything by the masters hitchcock or spielberg or tim burton these are all good movies and directors but none match up to james camerons masterpiece,sad
ive seen a lot of overblown films in my lifetime and i know that a lot of people believe the credibility of the oscars died when tom hanks won two best actor awards in sequential years but this film is what really killed the oscars the idea that ben hur could set a record for winning the most is hilarious when the story is taken into account but the idea that such a contrived load of nonsense like this could equal it while a really wellmade film like gladiator only gets four awards well you get the picturei wont bore you with a detailed speech about the plot because i am sure that anyone reading this will have been subjected to exactly that enough times already instead i will just go through some of the things that really stood out in this filmone thing that always bugs me about this film is how james cameron claims to pay attention to the most minute detail in his films and yet the pistol used by billy zane has pretty much been positively confirmed by numerous gun collectors as not having been put into production at the time the film was made it would have been more factually accurate to put a gun from the old spaghetti westerns in this film as a matter of fact another thing that flies right in the face of the facts is that a rich powermad family such as that which our heroine is from would basically beat it into their daughters from birth that they had to take any crap a suitor would dish out at them it might have been politically incorrect to put this on the screen but thats the way the society such websites as christiananswersnet wants us to return to actually functionedanother aspect of the film that bothers me is leonard dicraprio when we first hear his dialogue about his world travels well i was laughing because he hardly looks old enough to go to the coffee shop unsupervised kate looked like she outweighed him by a good fifty pounds at least and im sure the other passengers who were slumming it in steerage would have introduced him to the concept of how prisoners love each other theres nothing quite like a guy who looks like a girl after being locked in a dank smelly hole with your average underclass member of a repressive society for a few months naturally the film goes out of its way to make you hate the rest of the passengers so the proposed idea of having arnold schwarzenegger blow up the iceberg and save the day wouldnt have saved the film anyway unfortunately i also found kates character rather unconvincing a lot of the time too her behaviour just doesnt quite sync up with what youd expect out of a girl from a circa191x family of inbreedersin short this film was nothing more than james camerons cynical pulling of the strings attached to the heart of every 1250 year old woman who really ought to know better once the cinemascreen impact of the sinking is gone there is nothing to endear the film to anyone who either has a brain in their head or likes to be made seasick instead what we have is yet another marketing exercise from the mainstream media that pretty much proves ninety percent of people in the world can be told what they want instead of given it cameron just hasnt done a good film since aliens because his ego is way out of control and boy does prove that in a big way,sad
based on a true story the film relives the horrors of when the real sank as well as that a poor boy leonardo dicapriostrikes up a romance with a rich daughterkate winslet it was one of the movie that seemed so realin breath taking detail as i said earlier i thought i wouldnt like this film but once i watched it last night i cant blame other people for complaining about it only getting a 7 out of 10 on average billy zane plays a great role as the controlling boyfriend there is something special about this movie very special sometimes the special effects are a bit cheesy but its convincingly covered up by the extremely tense scenes this film made me feel extremely depressed but at the same time i couldnt look awaythe acting is marvelous as well as the make up trying to look like the clothes of oldjames cameron i raise my glass to you as although this story is based on a true storyit will be remembered for a very long timea classic1010,sad
sorry it was just plain bad  hollywood at its worst  the problem was the focus on the 2 kids throughout the entire movie the dialogue and the soundtrack doesnt anyone use real instrumentscomposers instead of cheezy popsynth soundtracks anymore besides spielburg  the best movie by far is a night to remember  you owe it to yourself to at least check it out if you are captivated by the story,sad
this movie was more like the than just a sinking ship it went down with the boat with numerous places where the fiction over road the fact and the history of the event as well as the design of the boat were forgotten ive spoken with many history buffs about this movie and they were all appalled siting instances when the movie was incorrect one case the director chose to leave out one of the smoke stacks for aesthetic appeal leonardo was charming and kate was beautiful but they were perhaps the only redeeming qualities of this movie a tragic event to make a profit from i think,sad
1st watched 861998  10 out of 10dirjames cameron excellent big movie for a big event involving a big boat with directing of proportionsstop me please  tremendous detail on sinking with a believable love story attached,sad
james cameron is a great director artistically speaking  this film was beautiful to look at it had great colors fantastic sets incredible costumes and great replicas of things however 4 hours of kate winslet whining about her poor pitiful life  arghhhh i wanted to pull my hair out  not to mention leo i mean come on who do you have to sleep with to get his name cut out of the casting call   the only thing that would have made me enjoy this movie more would be a few extra minutes of footage showing leo sinking to the bottom of the ocean or being eaten by fish  the supporting cast was great though  i loved billy zane kathy bates victor garber and frances fisher  overall i think that the was best left at the bottom of the ocean,sad
if that doesnt say it then let me share one or two thoughts as to why this should never have been made firstly what drugs does one have to be injecting to be able to take one of the worst human tragedies and make a lovestory with the acting equivalent of twinkies as the leadsi mean they were nice and sweet to look at but just like hostess most famous product one is always left with a few lingering questions 1 is that it 2 whats this nasty aftertaste 3 whythis movie was the cinematic equivalent of elective plasticsurgery pointless painful expensive and it leaves scars that may never quite heali know for an absolute certainty that my views will be frowned upon by the clueless who still think that leonardo was on the boat when it actually sailed and also by the educationallysubnormal among the moviegoing public who seem to think that any old garbage will do as long as it has great sfx and a chick with a nice chest to look at i know all that i am also aware that this selfindulgent piece of garbage was one of the biggestgrossing boxoffice movies everit still doesnt detract from the fact that it was 3 hours too long and makes a mockery of the awful deaths of 1500 people whats nextmaybe james cameron will get ricky martin and christina aguillera to star in belsen the musical ,sad
to watch is not simply to watch a film about a love story on a sinking boatit is to experience the horrific tragedy as if you were on the ill fated voyage in 1912  i marveled at grandeur i was inspired to dance by the rousing celtic music at the 3rd class party i felt their terror at the ships impending demise i despised the builders for the lack of life boats i felt the mothers pain as she tucked her children in bed for the last time i shuddered at the icy cold waters short of turning back the clock to 1912 this is the closest any of us are going to get to the unsinkable shipmr cameron has done an impeccable job recreating the and it was the effort that went into that alone which earned him the oscars for best director and best picture  the visuals were stunning from beginning to end and when watching the film on the big screen it truly was a sight to behold as for the fictional part of the story in spite of what many of the films detractors had to say i thought it was beautifully done  decaprio and winslet turned in brilliant performances and made the characters of jack and rose into people that we cared about  we rooted for these star crossed lovers even though we all knew the fate of the ship  i am not a fan of long movies and usually lose interest sometime after the second hour but here the 3 plus hours simply flew by  the movie draws you in and rivets you to the screen until the credits are rolled  i cant remember a time where i have cried so earnestly for movie charactersnot only for jack and rose but for all the lost souls in the north atlantic i have rewatched this film several times and it has not lost its impact a truly masterful motion picture  an effort that all involved can be proud of,sad
i saw this movie during its original 1997 release and i vowed never to see it again not because it was a bad movie but because it was the most incredibly moving film i had ever seen  i couldnt bring myself to cry at the theater for fear that i wouldnt stop  so i went home and cried for two hours after the late show  i found this film riveting not just for the story itself but for the brutally honest imagery james cameron used to depict the tragedy and torture of death and dying  granted most of it was special effects amazing special effects but i couldnt say that the trauma of the sinking could have stayed with me had they spent less money and used a cheaper outlet of film making  in the end i wasnt thinking about the money the commercialization or the pretty face of leonardoi was aching inside for the 1500 needless deaths cast out to freeze in the icy water of the atlanticone last thing  about a year after i saw this film i attended the exhibit in minneapolis and my eye happened to catch something on open display in what appeared to be a large sand box  i walked over to it and there was a sign on the front which said please touch  so i reached out and put my hand on the large spatula shaped object rusted from years of decay  it was then that i realized i was touching a boat davit recovered from the wreckage of the and in unison with this realization a man came over to the display and put his hand on the davit next to mine then he looked at me and in a very small voice said may god have been with them  i burst into tears,sad
everything a girl could ever want is contained within this film weve got romance suspense thriller action and a cool soundtrack as wellleo dicaprio plays a reasonable part as the poor kid who manages to convince rosekate winslet to is charmsof course you just know that disaster has to strike but it all adds to the convention of the filmcameron has really rocked the boat on this one haha in the biggest film made ever which got 11 academy awards which i think are thoroughly derserved,sad
you know  if you were stuck on a desert island and could only take one movie  what would it be  thats what i mean by desert island material id take this one  romance adventure heroism betrayal lust history laughter tragedy grandeurperfect in its idea and execution  a fictional romance intertwined with the most famous of human tragedies  unparalleled attentiontodetail sparkling cinematography  a soundtrack that draws you back to the ship every time your hear it  just a breathtaking filmthe only reason it is not in the top 10 alltime are the bogus voters who gave it a 1 out of 10 rating  obviously they cast retaliatory votes retaliating against the oversaturation of memorabilia hype etc everyone has their own opinions but they should really just rate the film and not the hype  the most awarded film in academy award history  the highest grossing movie of alltime  top selling classical soundtrack in history  rates a 1 of 10  of course not  its a treasure,sad
i can see how a lot of guys would not want to watch this movie i took my stepmotherwho does not understand englishto watch godzilla and she fell asleep through the movie i took her to see and she stayed awake throughout the three hours and twenty minutes that says a lot to meafter watching this movie i realize how imperfect it is some of the dialogue is unrealistic did they really say damn and cop back in those days it is almost a shame to see cameron pay attention to so many details in this movie and miss thathowever that mistake is a small price to pay for what he really accomplished with this movie the realistic sinking of the ship and the devastating human loss as a result for people who went to see this movie just to see the ship sinking you missed the point just as brock lovett missed the point i never got it i never let it in innocent human lives were lost because of human arrogance and dependence on manmade machineslet me stray just a bit i recently saw a 2020 show on people buying their way down into the ocean to visit the i could only shake my head and remember something i heard james cameron say isnt it ironic how people are willing to pay to go into a tiny submarine two and half miles down into the ocean in total darkness to have to depend on a manmade machine to withstand all that pressure down there to keep them alive just so they could visit the very exact symbol of technological disaster how ironic leave those people in peace and go back home and appreciate your loved onesas boring as jack and rose might have been to very many people      they served a very important purpose they served as our emotional template it is because of them that we are able to identify hope despair and finally lost it is not only their struggle we sympathize with but everyone else on the ship as well especially the innocent victimsevery movie can be very different depending on the director cameron does a great job because he filmed this as an epic we have old rose as our narrator so that we are on solid ground in present time she takes us to the past so that we can feel as much as is possible how those people must have felt facing the last couple of hours of their lives the transitions between the different times are effortless and moving the ending was so beautiful and emotionalfor three hours and twenty minutes i was totally and willingly absorbed in another world this is what they call movie magic,sad
this is a really good that definitely deserved its best picture oscar  its almost bizarre when you think that this is a movie made by james cameron considering his other work  i was really surprised that i liked this movie since normally i would hate a romance movie but this one blew me away its a 10  its a lot like american beauty in that if you completely ignore its message its a masterpiece  just as american beauty glorified pedophiles and drug dealers this movie glorifies the idea that its quite all right to completely ignore the fact that youre getting married and have a fling with some guy you barely even know  i have no idea why the mpaa thinks its all right to make a movie like this pg13 with the message that is definitely not teenfriendly and the nudity but makes a movie like almost famous r considering doesnt have any more nudity than and it has a message thats great for teens  nonetheless its a really really good movie,sad
james cameron had already through such classics as the terminator and aliens proved himself to be the worlds greatest filmmaker but from the first bars of james horners beautiful and haunting sound track i began to realize that this one surpassed even those masterpiecesthe movies biggest problem is its popularity because so many people try to shoot at something when it gets too bigalmost everything about is perfect no one could call dicaprio and winslet great actors witness leos appalling performance in the man in the iron mask but they like stuart zane paxton and a host of minor players are perfectly suited to their roles the script despite failing to get even an oscar nomination is brilliant the direction is sublime the cinematography visual and sound effects are unequalledthe attention to detail is mindboggling despite the enormous effort exerted by some to find errors but for me what makes shine above every other motion picture i have ever seen is the unforgettable portrayal of the ravages of timemany people have commented on the famous poster shot of jack and rose at the bow of the ship but what makes the scene especially memorable is the end where the beautifully painted ship dissolves flawlessly into the presentday rusting hulk at the bottom of the atlantic this and similar dissolves are for me the essence of what filmmaking can achieve the one thing movies can do so much better than the written word the classic demonstration that pictures  especially moving pictures  can achieve more than thousands of wordsfinally the ending clinches everything endings have long been camerons biggest problem  especially the awful pseudospielberg ending of the abyss  but here he got it absolutely right after showing us so convincingly how easily nature and time can crush human vanity and technological achievement it is the human spirit which finally triumphs over all,sad
make no mistake i think james cameron is a great filmmaker anybody who can make aliens and the terminator is ok in my book but to say is a great movie is overstepping the line the effects were awesome and the attention to detail was great but the story was nothing but all my children on a cruise ship if i said it once ill say it a thousand times more boogie nights was the best movie of 97 not,sad
thats the question that dicapitatedlovelorn girls ask themselves when someone like me tells em that this movie really truly sucks i went with my girlfriend she is not a dicapriolovelorn girl she actually thinks hes gay to the theatre to see this movie i thought it would be a good movie to watch with her since its basically a chick flick and she would be happy after the movie and really happy with me for wanting to go with her i just wanted to make her happy but those three hours in that theatre seemed to go longer than any in school suspension that i have ever served in school and believe you me iss is the most boringest part of school i mean at least in class you got your friends and chicks to check out but iss is like a prison but anyway before i get completely off the subject is way way way stretched out 3 hours 3 hours is what they make you wait to see the ship sink and thats it in between those 3 hours all there is is two people that fall in love one being a poor boy and the other a rich easy girl i mean they just met and she already took of her clothes and even had sex with the guy aint that an easy girl so all that happens is the movie wastes 3 hours of our lives which i couldve used in other things and show us a really cool sequence of how the ship looks and how it sank you can see all that in the discovery channel or even in the internet the only reason why i dont give this movie a 1 but gave it a 6 is because it made my girlfriend happy who which in turn later made me happy  dont waste your time on this movie unless you wanna make your girl happy who if your lucky will make u happy,sad
i could not stand most of this film it is like attending a movie you didnt want to see but did see just so youd look hip theres plenty of movies that are no less hip but are far better than this onei dont mind seeing the female anatomy in movies but the way they did it was obviously economic as opposed to artistic and dont we have enough movies in the 1990s about the turnofthecentury with colorless settings i really didnt like tying myself down to this cinematic garbage for at least two hours just to be hip or to see the beloved shipsinking scene,sad
its a shame that this movie received as much backlash as it did  this movie showed exactly what type of effect a dedicated force can have for a movie and a dedicated force is exactly what james cameron was with this filmthe acting was quite wonderful  dicaprio did a wonderful job as the happygolucky poor boy  winslet was wonderful as the rich girl trying to find a way out  zanes acting was so perfect for the villian that i cant stand to watch him in any other movie not for his acting but for how brilliantly he played the evil rich snob who will use his power to get whatever he wants  yet all of these acting jobs were overshadowed by the boat itself as well as its tremendous supporting cast  the humanity that the actors and actresses brought to each character was amazing  i am still brought to tears every time i watch the musicians playing on the deck of the sinking shipcameron literally brought the old oceanliner back to life  the attention to detail of every part of was greater than in any other movie i have ever watched  the cinematography was outstanding  the entire sinking of the ship was brilliantly done and completely hammers home the fact that so many people died that didnt have to simply from humanitys own bullheadedness that we are invinciblea wonderful movie that people need to stand up and recognize as one of the greatest movies of all time,sad
no is not one of the worst films of all time but perhaps the worst big production in fifty yearsjames cameron is obviously suitable to direct cyborg and action films and such since the unbelievability of this films characterization never rises above a tv daytime soaper dicaprio a considerable talent is wasted here as he plays his role like a spoiled 90s megastar winslet is slightly better though she also has a thin role to playlaughable situations abound when the ship stands upright and people fall to their deaths the main couple discussthis is where we first met awful the dimwitted young generation to whom this film is directed is simply informed who the villains in the story are they speak with british accentsthe honest ones speak with american of irish accentsinside the ship during the sinking the lights keep constantly fluttering as in other action films set in dark places i wish i could continue further but i have to sum up the point this socalled film is actually a machine whose sole function is to churn out money and more money sadly it succeeded,sad
i dont like movies that are made by the rules of hollywood filmmaking what i mean by that is the way to make the audience sad happy worried thrilled are all the same way that all the same in all big budget hollywood films is another one of those films so it didnt give me anythingjames horners music sucked and i was so mad at him getting the undeserved oscar for original score that year the statue should have gone to jerry goldsmiths original score for la confidential the popularity of shows how easily entertained the average movie going audience is,sad
i will upset a lot of people with what i am about to say i gave this film 3 out of 10 and i have to say that the computer effects were amazing it is just that it is a shame that the money was spent on that and the stars and they forgot to have any researchers or actually bother with the history books i am very interested in what happened that night and so imagine my surprise when i watched this film to see rose spitting over the side of the ship and being very friendly with someone from third class when she was travelling first what was going through peoples minds as they wrote this this would never happen at that period for those of you who are interested in what happened and not just leo these books have been bought for me and are a big must by leo marriott the riddle of the by robin gardiner  dan van der vat  survivor the memoirs of violet jessop stewardess introduced edited  annotated by john maxtonegraham the first have the most amazing pictures the second lists the survivors and not just first class as this film would suggest and the third are the words of someone who was there that night unlike this film it tells you what happened and the courage and bravery of those people not a person who is a hero in scotland killing himself and definitely not locking the third class up until the last minute there was also a fourth book that i cannot remember the details that was about people who foresaw the disaster a film that had a basic story and ruined,sad
i have seen approx 1000 films in my 35 yrs  i am a movie buff  i have a video collection of over 500 films  and never has their been a masterpiece made better thanjames cameron has got to be so proud of this film he worked so hard on for so long  this film won 8 academy awards including best picture 1997leonardo di caprio and kate winslet gave great performances as well as every other actor and actress in this filmthe special effects in this film were the best i have ever seen  the soundtrack was wonderful this is a film not to ever be missed ,sad
ill admit it if i want to or not was a decent movie overall and on the surface its worthy of a five rating however once you calculate for bad acting performances the worst scriptlines from a 1998 oscar nominated movie and the shadowy feeling of the overbearing heavy hand of cameron and his action film special effects you get a three furthermore because of the mediahype because of young girls and because the academy is a sucker for epic classic movies the real best picture of 1998 good will hunting was lost in the swell i mean come on youre going to tell me that there is a scene between leonardo and kate that is half as powerful as any between matt and driver let me just remind you of a scene between robin and matt robin confronts matts character with pictures of his body badly bruised by the abuse he suffered from his father matt says something like this is bs this is not important to which robin keeps repeating its ok its ok eventually matt falls weeping into robins arms now that scene was powerful moving and lets not forget cheap basically won movie of the year because it was prettylooking nice and shiny and was terribly expensive what a waste when compared to good will hunting,sad
im not really sure why so many people hated this movie but ive got a few theories1 leonardo dicaprio i can agree but he wasnt that bad2 jealousy against leonardo dicapro guys cmon admit it3 it was a drama some teenager probably hated it just because it was a lovestory i know a few4 they dont want to get swallowed by the hype5 theyre against hollywood6 they cant stand too long moviesor maybe its the classic one they hate it just because everybody else did itwell heres my comment and i am a guy and im not fagfinally a big bang here from hollywood a 3 hour epic with remarkable special effects another example is benhur hey same amount of oscarswell now i first saw this movie when it came and i was amazed i mean wow it was entertaining thrilling and even though you knew the plot and storyline the ship will sink hope thats not a spoiler you were kept at your seat because you didnt want to miss a thing and you just had to find out what was going to happen and what about this crankiness against the script it is a classic setup three acts the story actually stops at about every hour so im not that out of here  the beginning with the proud ship and the glorious first class and some characterpresentations the middle where the ship hits the ice and the worrying starts while some characters gets developed and the final act wich is an hour of thrilling action and glorious special effects i have never in my life witness such a simple but so genius storyline and i cant understand those who wasnt impressedok the acting might not be as great as it maybe should dicaprio is the obvious choose to get money but hes not the right kid and the worst part is he fits in might sound a bit strange winslet was good but billy zane was the best i just loved that character i almost laughed in every scene in he was in james cameron here shows that he can make any genre but the action is his top and of course bill paxton hangs along toothis might not be the best movie ever made but it is definitively one of my semifinalists 910,sad
i saw at the cinema and although it is worth watching i thought that it could have done better james cameron is a great director but the special effects on t2 were much better on you could see that they were just effects and didnt quite fit with the film with any effect you should not be able to see it to make it good the actors were good despite the poor story line and while the ending was sad it could have been better i would only recommend this film to ship or leo fans,sad
as a long time buff i have spent a lot of time reading up on the events that occurred that night or that whole week for that matter  i went in pessimistic but was impressed with how accurate it was  this movie deserves 710 stars simply based upon its historical accuracy  it earns the rest for cinematograpythe problem cameron had to face is that the story of a sinking ship itself is not enough to give a movie a plot to follow  jack and rose and cal were placed on camerons merely to give cameron an excuse to show you the ship end to end top to bottom without boring you completely  sure the acting could have been better from the principles but they were not the point of this moviemerely a subplot as i see it  by the way i felt the supporting cast was wonderfulthey played their reallife counterparts with accuracyif you didnt like this movie try reading about a little bit and then watch it againpsi am a star wars fan and i liked this moviego figure,sad
yes it does entertain and doesnt feel like 3 hours plus however this film is pretty poor some of the lines like that picasso will never amount to anything and im so lucky to be on the are crass beyond belief billy zane is like a baddie out of a bad episode of scoobydoo why didnt the salvage crew tell the old dear to get on with it and just tell them where the necklace was script over special effects please,sad
only a film this popular could have a line divided so sharply between those who love it and those who detest it i tend to not only discuss a films technical and artistic merits but its impact on society as well and i find to be very rich grounds for both i find it to be a beautiful film in nearly all directions and though it has some flaws in it it is for the most part a thoroughly engrossing emotional goldmine of a story some find this to be a negative marki however see james camerons film as perhaps one of the most honest epics of its kind the affect of the film is amazing in scale if you let it in many especially those who ignored it while it was in theaters and waited for the video tend to say how banal the dialogue is how poorly written the script is or that its only reason for success was the millions of leofans and fx gurus who lined the blocks to see itmy take on this latter hypothesis is that these people must have sleepwalked through the six months the film was in the top 10 ignoring the fact that something extraordinary was happening in not only america but the world as well millions wanted to embrace something they felt true to their hearts look in the history of box office hits and i can guarantee youll find a difficult time locating any film people went to see four or five times because their favorite actor was in it or they loved the special effects and nothing else and for the leoexcuse did anyone ever take into account that no other film starring this magazineseller even surpassed 60 million in domestic receipts ten times less than made johnny depp and jonathan taylorthomas are living proof that a handsome actor can sell those teenybopper books but their battle to sell tickets is more often where they lose outyep that 13 year old worldwide female economy is sure booming these days granted those girls made up for a reliable portion but come on people 18 billion throughout the planet thats a lot of dough the reason a film like this works well not just with teens but with senior citizens who havent been to the theater in fifteen years is because it resonates with them in a deep emotional waysets up a great historical tragedy with a traditional love story probably not all that different than something demille or zanuck wouldve cooked up in the 1930s it is very easy to see as another zanuck technicolor production starring a teen clark gable and vivien leigh someone told shakespeare while he was writing romeo and juliet that a teen love story cannot be written because teenage love emotions is not real shakespeare did not listen to this garbage and neither did cameron we should be glad that both of them kept their ears pluggedi wont even begin to go into all the reasons why this is a masterpiece i will go so far as to say that i am happy it did not start immediately with the iceberg collision the whole point of the love story which precedes it is to make the disaster of the sinking all the more enormous when it hits because we care for the lovers jack and rose so much some say this is the part of the film that suffers that the setup is not believable and cliched i think it works well beause dicaprio and kate winslet are both terrific actors and while the dialogue is a couple of times hard to bare the structure of the story is so well filmed and paced that it is hard to care some even argue that the love story is pathetic because you cannot really fall in love with somebody over a period of a few days this is probably the worst reasoning i have heard anyone who doesnt believe in this type of love just has not experienced it it does exist though and it is a beautiful form of it because the developments of lack of trust were not the first things to enter the relationship its called wild romanticism not lust and it is something we all need to feel at one time or anotheri cannot convince why worked so well with so many millions of people i can only say for sure why it connected with me it hit me in the heart and while it felt good to feel for these lovers it also felt horrible to see where it ended its terrible to see 1 500 people lose their lives on a cruise to new york and its more so when you learn of the extreme dedication that was made to accurately portray the sinking that is something i find difficult not to connect with,sad
is absolutely the best film ive ever seen it has great direction james cameron is one of the very finest of his kind a great script again thanks to jim but there were a few flaws of course although less then in any other film ive seen the acting is superb from the main characters to the smallest supporting roles and thanks to james horners music its an even more wonderful experience one of the best soundtracks ive heard among the one for schindlers list and a few others and techically it was also a true masterpiece the effects are stunning it really deserved all the technical awards it received and all other awards too by the way a great film with very few flaws a 10 out of 10 from me actually,sad
there are some real hair brained idiots that have made postings on this site trashing this movie for absolutely no good reason to the person who thought it was unrealistichad lousy dialogue said dolphins dont exist in that part of the ocean and that theres no way people can survive in that cold of water for more than 3 minutes are you a scientist you know all of this for a fact you mean to tell me that every single film that you have seen every single secondevery frame has to be 100 realisitc or you give it a good dissing its obvious you have done no research on this tragedy before you posted your careless remarks first of allaccording to the dolphin research institute dolphins do exist in those waters according to records of the sinking some survivors in the waters lived for up to 15 minutes before freezing to death not the 3 minutes you claim and you actually think the dialogue is worthy of a kindergarden movie give me a break you can honestly say that the script didnt make you laugh or get a watery eye at least once you ripped this movie to shreds for no good reason you based your opinions on nothing but untruths the special effects in this film are phenomenal and its obvious james cameron did his homework before making this film the ship was reconstructed almost to a tee  perhaps you and wifey should rent ishtar or police academy 5 sounds like those movies are more about your speed happy viewing,sad
i hated this movie  i will be honest  i wanted to like it because james camaron is sooo cool true lies is one of my favorite movies  i gave this movie a three  the script was horrible  i was dying of laughter right there in the theater in front of all the teary eyed girls i mean the girl next to me was actually crying heroh not leo meexcuse me i am trying to nap here  it took like a whole day the watch the borefest 5 hours of crap before the iceberg hit  then when the boat crunched and cracked that was pretty good  the best part of the movie takes about a nanosecond  that is when some guy falls and like hits his head on a boat propeller and starts twirling around  i was rolling with laughter  other than thatzzzzz  and the crap with that old chick was played out  who cares about these uninteresting people  i wanted them to crash into the iceberg and then have polar bears leap out onto the deck and start mauling people  then arnold would show up because this is james camaron and like take no prisoners or something  i dont knowanything to end my suffering,sad
i only went because my wife wanted to see it  however at the end i clapped and cheered with the rest of the audience  it was a great movie right up there with star wars and gone with the wind,sad
the first half of this movie focused on a romance that i did not care about and yet i was still somehow engrossed by it all  rationally i can understand that the story was fairly ordinary but somehow i was riveted this is something that i cannot explain  for every scene after the iceberg is first spotted however i can fully understand why i loved this movie so much  the action scenes in this film are absolutely jawdropping and this fact is the primary reason why this is one of my favorite films  however i can certainly agree with those who found this to be a real tearjerker seeing so many innocent people preparing to die is heartbreaking in the extreme and these scenes will always stand out as some of the finest that i will ever see  but make no mistake about it i view this as an action film first not as a emotional drama  and since i view it this way i strongly encourage action fans who somehow avoided this movie to give it a chance because heartpounding entertainment doesnt get any better than this,sad
first of all im a guy and was not even close to the worst waste ive seen in my life  granted la confidential in particular was totally robbed of the awards it should have gotten if the oscars arent so discredited by now it should be disassembled anyway but what you have is a pretty decent moviefirst of all some say leo cant act  well he can but he wasnt handed much of a script for this onesecondly the romantic story has been done before and better in some disney movies pauper marries the princesstype storiesthere is a lot to say in its credit  the message is very antimaterialistic something the us desperately needs  the fx and detail that went into the sinking of the ship was also very good  it seems like those that totally oppose this movie are doing it for one and only one reason star wars  i like star wars more than but in the end both movies were very successful in their times so whats with the bitterness  also if you consider the star wars films as being one since they are continuous then it kicks the tar out of any movie ever made so enough of the bad blood between sw fans and fans  they are both good movies totally unlike each other  gets 3 and 12 bloops outof four,sad
this is truly the greatest film ever made  it deserved all awards and it was better than any other 1997 movie la confidential etc  the special effects were spectacular much better than a night to remember i know its old but still  people think it has better effects the music was the best ive ever heard  it made me cry every time i saw it and no one is a moron if they think its the greatest movie ever because thats their opinion  it doesnt matter if it didnt follow the real story so what it tells the tale of two people in love that would have been amazing if it actually happened  watch antr if you want the real story,sad
this film insults the intelligence of the viewer set both in the present day and more obviously in the past the movie somehow manages to fall into the trap of over sentimentalising in both time periods worse however are the shocking amount of cliches that litter this film take for instance the nerdy computer programmer who forgets that he is being insensitive to the survivor of the when he recreates the accident on his pc saved by the bell had more subtle moral storytelling than this so called film if special effects no realistic characterisation or accents and a poor script are your ideas of fun then watch it otherwise dont touch it with a barge pole,sad
this is a film which relies entirely on the fact that it is about something very sad that really happened  if the didnt really sink everyone would see how poor an attempt at a film this is  the script is laughable it is obvious that much more time went into the authenticity of the cutlery and so on than the characters  james cameron did not deserve an award for this,sad
comments like this is the best film ive ever seen etc are very often heard but i think that such opinions are very shallow as is this love story about winslet and di caprio people who say that this is the best movie theyve ever seen cant have been seen lots of movies has great special effects but the story itself is very predictible and the characters are very vague and undefined and they dont develop at all during the film characters dont live through the movie the best film of the 1997 is of course la confidential and it is shame that it didnt get more oscars but thats life experience says that most oftenly the best movies of a year dont get so many oscars,sad
i am getting physically ill sitting here reading what you ignorant people are writing about this film  everyone is entitled to their own opinion of course  but you people are slagging off a film based upon one of the most tragic nights in history  you may not have enjoyed the script  you may have thought it was too long  but you are all hiding from the fact that this film is based on something real  and it was documented very well in this film  it gives us an accurate portrayal of the events as they happened  and i happen to know that james cameron is almost correct in his timeline of this film  my grandmother survived the sinking of this ship and i dont give a  whether anyone believes me  she lost her husband and her son who would have been my uncle and escaped with only my mother her daughter  she relived that awful night many times for me and i still cry when i think of her you rude ignorant fools  have some respect for the brave souls on that ship and in future keep your unwanted opinions to yourselves,sad
i feel compelled to be the 900th or so person whos probably commenting on this movie  right now this movie is about as popular as the saturday night fever soundtrack was in 1981 and to this i say  hogwash  no one seemed to mind in 1997 when people were lining up to see this movie three or four times  now the same people are trashing it  urgh  but it doesnt surprise me  when it comes to movies we tend to get brainwashed by other movielovers and critics and if they imply we made a mistakethis movie is really awful we tend to believe it i watched in its entirety again the other day and i must go against the current grain and say that it is a great movie or should i say still a great movie  people who have not seen this movie on a large screen cannot say that theyve seen this movie  period  so go away  i will agree with most and say that the acting is pretty bad and the movie did not pick up any oscars in the acting category  james cameron may be an arrogant jerk and the screenplay is corny  but the sheer awesomeness of the film is what i remembered when i saw it on the big screen in 1997  cameron despite his personal faults took us on that doomed luxury liner literally transporting us back to 1912  yes it could be argued that movies like a night to remember were better examinations of final hours and imax productions likea had better footage of the ship at the bottom of the atlantic  but camerons kitchen sink approach to telling the story which includes a trite but still rather sweet fictional love storyis what captivated audiences in 1997  give this movie twenty years  people will rediscover its magic after the predictable backlash has worn off  hey even alice cooper is admitting today that saturday night fever is a great album,sad
jack dawson leo dicaprio plays a 3rd class passenger that wins his ticket in a lucky game of poker rose bukater kate winslet plays a troubled 1st class girl who is forced into a marriage because of her familys bankruptcy but when her troublesome explodes she finds herself on the back of the ship preparing to jump as a witness jack comes up and persuades her with sarcasm after that night she got more then a rescuer she found her love and he will go with her all the way to the bottom of the sea,sad
get it everyone voted for reagan twice then made fun of him for eight years and only now are people beginning to realize what a phenomenal president he was i say reading these lackey poohpooh reviews that slam cameron for his ego slam the script and slam dicaprio that you all are just repeating history you cant stand it when a truly great cinematic opera is placed before you go ahead pan it now that the hype is all over shoot the wounded have your funbecause history will cast in its true form  a modern day operatic romance for the ladies and girls telling the historically accurate tale of the famed ship for the guys by weaving created characters through the events that changed the modern world at the timedont like dicaprio  go get a job acting and do better winslets boobies and sex scene immoral  dont watch it then camerons ego  you are just jealous of his bank account the man oozes talent cheezy lines  find a movie without them or better yet then you try to write one without them oh and everyone else gets to judge your work so shut up if dont like now you did then and your grandchildren will later deali was in 4th grade when i learned of the i read books built models saw all the crappy movies about it and there were many have every possible coffeetable book about her and cried when she was found by ballard in 1985 a guy i cried now along comes cameron using a vehicle near to my heart using modern effects better than the original star wars and faithful to the events of the night by 99999 percent do i try to find fault no i simply wept throughout the movie the tragedy the loss of life yes sometimes i see the nerfing of the deck and the dummies cgs etc but i still cry every time i watch it its so emotional an experience for me i have to limit myself to once a year just to take it all inyou panners of you are missing the point of the tragedy a true tragedy worse than most any modern day loss of life event except sept 11 yet james cameron brought love renewed life spirit and passion into it the man is a master the movie a masterpiecestill dont believe me go watch raise the compare then come tell me was overblown trolls,sad
from reading most of the comments on this site about this movie most of them seem to be against it  most everyone that wrote a comment said that this movie sucks  i also notice that most of the comments are written by guys  being a guy myself i am going to have to disagree with everyone and say that this was a great movie and say that it deserves everything that it got  im not saying that its the best movie ever made but i am saying that you cant deny the attention to detail in this movie  everything about what went on when the ship was going down was absolutely on key  the whole time i felt as though i was going down with the ship  the problem i think people have with this movie mainly the guys is that every girl in america went nuts for leonardo  all i seem to hear when people trash the movie is how much they hated him  i think that picking leo as the lead was genius i mean think about your making a love story so why not pick the one guy that all girls are crazy about already  i think the director took advantage in a lot of points  i mean lets face it when youre making a movie like this youre not going for the artsiest approach or going for originallity your going for whats going to attract the biggest audience  at the time there was already some hype about the with the reunion of some of its survivors  the movie couldnt have come out at a better time  plus what other kind of movie is going to attract the sort of people that are going to go see it over and over and over  a love story  the characters and storyline couldnt have been any more conveniently picked to make a movie that people are going to go nuts over  i just think that a lot of people were largly disappointed when they found out that this highly anticipated epic movie turned out to be a love story  which in my opinion is the one of the best love stories ever told  with one flaw which lies in the age of the lovers which makes it hard for me to believe that they could really know anything about true love  but still excellently executed nonetheless i think that this was an excellent film with an excellently picked cast  it couldnt have been done better  and a lot of you out there are probably thinking man this guys gay  well im not  i can just recognize when someone achieves something such as james cameron hasrating 810,sad
while this picture continues to hold the record as far and away the highest grossing world film of all time over double that of its closest rival and when released received rave reviews from over 85 of the most influential north american film critics who saw it and tied the record for most oscars ever awarded to one film it cant seem to make the list as one of the top 250 imdb films of all time something must be wrong with the rating system  not the movie many critics seem to concentrate their scorn on the love story between rose and jack while others expressed boredom with the special effects and other elements associated with the actual sinking of the ship to them i can only say that they must belong to the school satirized by john candy on the old sctv series who could only get enthusiastic about something when he got to blow it up real good no sadly im afraid nobody gets blown up but there is plenty of drama and tension as we await not the fate of the ship but of the passengers and of course the lovers cameron has proven himself capable of balancing an intimate love story with an epic event while keeping everything in perspective if nothing else the movie represents an incredible logistical achievement and a special effects tour de force i first watched it in a crowded theatre and all around me i could hear other viewers sniffling blowing their noses and going to the washroom when the ship finally went down and the true magnitude of the human tragedy was driven home when was the last time you were at a movie that had that type of emotional impact on an audience a true 10 out of 10,sad

i find it so hard to believe that this film has done so well the film shattered the box office within a week and only spiderman thus far has even been able to come close the film forrest gump had brought in the most with over 300 million until this film came out when you look at the list for highest grossing films now shattered the numbers of gump this film is about a sinking ship and how there was only a few soul survivors i mean come on there have been many great movies in this span of time but when you look at the numbers it kind of surprises you a little bit the film was made by a brilliant director and a wonderful cast and won many awards within the first couple of weeks reached over 300 million which really is amazing still i wonder why own earth that this film did so well now in my opinion i do not really like winslet or dicaprio aside from films like departed i will say that they worked very well in this film another thing is the length of this film the film is very long and winding did you really sit through this whole film when it was in the theaters again this is my opinion but personally i really had no interest when this film came out and had no interest in seeing it i thought the original film is better not what you see today all of the special effects graphics etc etc i just find it so hard to believe that this film did so well and no other film has been able to surpass it now when you look at other lists for movie production companies you will see that movies such as star wars pirates shrek 3 come to mind this film really brought in a lot of money and in todays standards when so many films are losing their shirts this one must have its own special touch give me feedback thanks,sad
i see a lot of comments on here talking about how rose couldve easily moved over to allow jack a spot on the door however to me i saw much larger problem with the movies plot there is no way that ship that large metal ship that large could have been sunk in by a measly iceberg its unrealistic why are there even icebergs were not sailing through antarctica if the boat was hit by the iceberg it should not have sunk how are you going to tell me in the beginning of the movie that you were on in unsinkable ship just to show me three hours later that it did indeed sink and killed many people i feel deceived by this movie completely unrealistic horrible,sad
this is probably the worst film i have ever seen the plot lacks direction the film is too long the acting is poor its too slow its pathetic however all the girls i know love the film they say its brilliant perfect etc etcmy advice if you are female go watch it if you male do anything to avoid seeing it out of ten i give it zero but then thats from a male point of view,sad
i have a lot of respect for this movie and not because of the love story or the actors the level of detail cameron achieved is truly amazing the opening sequence is footage of the actual wreck and the ship was recreated true to the original plans tho scaled down of course interiors are exactly how the real rooms looked in 1912the sinking sequence have the best special effects ive ever seen so seamless that you unaware of them youre just watching the ship break apart and go downthere are only two historical mistakes in the script minor things really have you spotted them these days its considered cool to be cynical about this movie but i consider it cooler to make up your own mind perhaps watching it again will convince you that cameron did an amazing job not only for lovers of romance but for anyone fascinated with the historical event itself,sad
brilliant film billy zane deserves more credit than he gets i cant give this a 10 because the stupid old woman at the end throws the diamond into the ocean her daughter must of been fuming whenever i watch this film i turn it off before the end im fuming with the old tart,sad
had good memories of this movie when i watched it years ago but was sadly disappointed watching it again great costumes great directing etc but such a sickening romance in my opinion too fake quite comical its definitely worth watching if you havent seen it before some movies age well some dont this being one of them,sad
titanicis james camerons finest work till date whether it be cheeky or flirty lines grudging emotions a large scale execution stunning background score tiny implanted humor or character development this is one of the finest example of everything going perfectly in a shape of cinema or entertainment,sad
the best movie i have ever seen its my biggest love since 1997 i dont believe that some other movie will make me love it so much until ill die  i have the original movie on every type like vhs dvd dvd collectors edition bluray  3d xvid the soundtrack is perfect too,sad
a lot of people like seeing it won 11 oscars and grossed over 1 billion dollars i really did not care for this movie it is long boring and takes around 2 and a half hours for it to get goodis an ok movie leo does a good job like he always does portraying a poor man who falls in love with a rich girl kate winslet in my opinion was a bad choice she tries her best to act rich and proper but fails in general near the end she improves her acting but still is very stale billy zane in my opinion really shines out of the two leads he does a good job portraying someone who is very sophisticated but also shines in all the other parts when he is jealous of leo and kates characterswhat did i have wrong with the movie it is so long 3 hours and 14 minutes it takes 2 12 hours for it to get to the iceberg alone the first 30 minutes of the film is bill paxton and his crew trying to find the blue diamond whatever its called then the next 2 hours are back and forth between leo and kate while watching the film i found myself tapping my foot in boredom and wondering when is it gonna get good i really could have cared less for the first 2 12 hours sure there are a few good scenes here at there but it takes so long for it to get to the good sequenceseven thought this picture is long i should give credit where credit is due the visuals are stunning after watching this more then 10 years later i still cant tell that the ship and the scene where it breaks it in half to be fake where i can when i watch things like the matrix and toy storyalso the last hour of the film is really good i really have nothing to complain about cameron did a good job the ending is emotional but a little stupid he could have fit on top of the wood he did not really have to dieanyway is long boring but gets good near the end 610,sad

is a true story about the disaster of the who sunk in 1912 directed by james cameron the movie starts with a guy who is looking for a treasure a diamond neck less which would be hidden in the when he goes searching he finds a safe but only with money and a drawing of a woman rose whos wearing the diamond neck less she sees this on tv and contacts the man then she starts telling her story  rose took the boat to the us with her family and fianc caledon rose isnt happy and wants to kill herself but jack is the one who saves her thats the moment that rose and jack meet for the first time roses family forbids her to have contact with jack but rose refuses and falls in love with jackthey said was the best romantic movie of all times and i cant deny it the movie has broken all the records in 1997 and won 11 oscars its a really spectacular movie one you must see at least ones its a story that everyone likes you have romantic parts but also parts who are very exciting with a little bit action like the fight between jack and caledon one of the pluses of the movie is the cast leonardo dicaprio kate winslet they are one by one great actors and actresses the movie is based on a true story most of the movie is historical correct and thats what i also like about the movie you learn something about how it would have been and the actors represent it very well at the end i really didnt doubt that rose and jack were truly in love james cameron made a movie with really great shots and special effects in the beginning you see amazing shots on the bottom of the ocean from the real as well as the break up of the ship and the interior shots in the giant flooded tanks those shots make this movie so great you can see where they putted so much money in is a masterpiece that tells the almost impossible love story of rose and jack but also one of the worst disasters of all time its understandable why so many people watch it several times i would definitely recommend it to other people,sad
fantastic film it deserves all the awards that it received james cameron at his best writing up such a fantastic film based on the true story of the wreck it shows all of the actors in this film at there finest that made them of what made them where they are today with all of the oscars eleven of them and forty eight nominations and with the spectacular music from james honer it is a truly and spectacular film and with a massive amount of money brought through of the box office and being a highly rated film in the late nineteen nighties and came in trough until the early two thousands just after the millennium and being rated seven point seven on imdb this truly is the best score for this film,sad
short one this time might happen with movies that arent on my top 30 favorite movies of all time listplotif you want a historical representation of the story just go watch a night to remember the whole movie centers around a fictitious love story used to give the movie its core appeal its whats used to connect the audience to the historical event however the story has gone beyond that its amazing to hear how modern teenagers and stupid children didnt know the was a real shipcharacterscardboard cut out representations of real people on the and 2d personality characters fictional thrown in for drama i think jack is the most bland character ever written in a motion picture cal hockley is the star of the movie yes hes the hero of the film i was rooting for him not the bizarre couple who acted like aholesvisualswhere the film shines easily james cameron labored to make the movie as historically accurate as possible its actually mindblowing how complex and faithful the sets are to the real ship the dresses suits attire and objects used in the movie are key perfect for a period piece the effects of the ship sinking are also very nice the fact he used a real set and not computer generated images is a good enough reason but it looks great in the final picturesoundthe score by james horner is also very nice its a great mix of triumph sadness happiness tragedy and hope the different tracks sound right for the situation some musical tracks that are used for example in the beginning of the movie are interjected later into the movie to give the score a mix of again happiness and tragedyenjoymentthe movie had sellout crowds for a year it made over one billion dollars and was at the time the most successful film ever made what else can i say it was pretty great,sad
it isnt the romantic tale of rich girlpoor boy ingrained into many hearts due to kate  leo and it isnt the recreation of history with poetic license its making me believe im seeing that ship sink every time i watch kudos to james cameron with a nod to the frightening francis fisher as the aristocratic mother pimping out her daughter and billy zane whom without his sneer wouldnt have sailed so far ill put up with leo calling out rose rose another thousand times to again watch this disaster movie with the romantic hook a night to remember tells the straight tale but is certainly personalized with camerons storytelling,sad
i watched the movie eight years agowhile i was watching the movie suddenlyi began to cryperformance of actor or actress impressed mespeciallyi have impressed love of jack and rose music of the movie was impressivethe movie is telling story of reality lovei watched the movie last week again and i began to cry againi have felt some sense againkate winslet and leonardo di caprio was star fromeveryone have impressed the their performancei have impressed at the kate winslets beautiful and leonardo di caprios handsomei hope i can watch them in the same the movie gainin my opinion everyone should watch the movie,sad
i love this movie so much i remember watching when i was 8 and i cried so much james cameron did a perfect job just seeing how much effort he put into this film is crazy like who has this kind of mind to think a perfect plot relating to our history its just too amazing leonardo dicaprio was damn not just his looks but his acting was too perfect his depth his love for rose is just every girls dream the other actors did amazing billy zane so believable including frances fisher gloria stuart and kathy bates and of course kate winslet was just so beautiful and so likable in this moviethis movie shows that anyone can love it doesnt matter what you do or who you are,sad
james cameron reinvents the epic big cast disaster films of the 70s with grand style to begin with as a buff since my early childhood i was astonished the first time i saw this film the extreme accuracy and detail of the ship is extraordinary the original shipbuilding firm harland and wolff participated in the construction of the sets and models used in the film when you see this film you are seeing the as it was on sailing dayas for the story both dicaprio and winslet provide excellent performances as jack and rose their star crossed story is deeply interwoven in the mythology that is both fact and legend through their experiences we are allowed to explore the in ways never presented on film many of the ships iconic locations are seen in the film and the recent bluray edition brings the film into glorious high definition 1080hd formatcamerons excellent use of lighting camera angles and visual effects allow us to feel almost there both visually and emotionally during the final phases of the film that come close in timing to the actual sinking the film leaves us both sad and hopeful at the same time and few films provide us with such dual emotionsif you like love stories this film is for you if you have any interest in the or disaster movies then the film will appeal to those audiences as well most importantly it is a entertaining ride by one of the best film makers of this generation and i recommend anyone to give the film a try and judge for yourself,sad
i avoided watching this film for the longest time long before it was even released i had dismissed it as an overhyped overblown overly romanticized piece of hollywood schmaltz and i wanted nothing to do with it i never watched it in the theatre i shook my head in disbelief at the 11 academy awards  even though i had never seen it then i was asked to be a judge at a high school public speaking contest one of the girls spoke about this movie it was so great she said you really felt like you were on the ship nonsense i thought i shared my feelings with my fellow judges one looked at me and said you might be right but if she liked the movie that much maybe shell want to learn more about the realrandy welsh the movie must have done something right to get her so interested well maybe thought i then it finally appeared on pay tv ok i thought ill give it a look see i didnt want to like it  and i didnt i loved it what a great moviewhere to start first  the directing my high school public speaking contestant was right james cameron does a superb job of creating an almost you are there type of atmosphere the gaiety of life aboard the most elegant ship in the world the nonchalance as news of the iceberg first spreads then the rising sense of panic you dont just watch it you really do feel it then  the performances the lead performances from kate winslet as rose and leonardo dicaprio as jack are excellent  winslets being the superior i thought but both were good they had their rich girlpoor boy randy welsh characters down to a perfect t i thought in my opinion though stealing the show was frances fisher as roses mother she was perfect as the snobby aristocrat and you could feel the fear and loathing she randy welsh felt every time she looked at jack then  the details im no expert on the sinking of the but i have a reasonable general knowledge and this film does a super job of recreating the historical details accurately and then weaving them seamlessly around the fictional romance very impressive indeed then  the song who can watch this movie and not be taken with celine dions performance of my heart goes onproblems well the romance was perhaps too contrived in the sense that i just dont accept that jack could have moved so effortlessly from steerage to first class i know he was invited the first time but he seems to keep getting into first class without being stopped until hes been there for a while the realities of the separation of the social classes were much more realistically portrayed i thought when the steerage passengers were going to randy welsh be left locked down there after the ship hit the iceberg while the first class folks got to enjoy half empty lifeboats,sad
i think is the best moviei can watch it umpteen times is very old movie but this movie is very exciting and you can watch every timeits very successful moviebecause took a lot of prizesis telling a love storyrose will marry with caledonbut she doesnt want to marry with caledonthen she wanted to diebut she loved jackjack is a poor artisthe is selling his pictures everywherethenwent down and jack deadyou can understand the story finished but it isnt love story will continue if you want to learn what will happen you must watchi hopeyou like and i hopeyou suggest to everybody,sad
was a heartwarming true story that touches the chord of your heart and feel sympathize for those thousands of innocent people killed in one of the most horrifying accident a young aspiring painter meets a high class rich girl on the deck of and falls in love with her unfortunately  their love story is short lived as they face off the illfated disaster when their ship struck the iceberg and slowly sinks in the sea reviewing would be a little absurd for me as this one is a masterpiece by legendary director  james cameron i just came back after watching the 3d version of the film and i felt that ive seen the flick for the first time even though ive seen it 14 years back when it broke all the records in domestic as well in international circuits i have always been an immense admirer for camerons work right from terminator series till the visually enthralling avatar he not only gives his best shot but also works on the minute details to make his film a must watch similarly  he directed and gives a detailed level explanation of what really happened on the tragic night of 14th april  1914 the screenplay and writing should be given full marks the cinematography and art direction are grandeur giving a feeling of living through 194 mins background score by james horner is so intriguing that it gels well with the mood of the film performances by leanardo dicaprio and kate winslet is worth mentioning they were young and relatively new when they did the film but i must tell you  they were superb overall  very emotional and hearttouching film in every sense that has rewritten the history and will be immensely liked by people of all ages watching it again after 14 years in 3d is liking icing on the cake a masterpiece in deed ,sad
james cameron really knows how to tell a story and make an amazing moviethis film holds up brilliantly 15 years after its initial release the new 3d version is fantastic  especially the shots of the ship the underwater scenes are stunning it is all done masterfullyhow they go back and remake a live action film into 3d is a mystery to me but the magic works in recent years i choose to see most films on dvd or bluray but this one was worth a trip to the theater i never left my seat onceseeing the film again since the real life passing of gloria stuart old rose and seeing it on the 100th anniversary of one and only sailing made it that much more poignant,sad
this is one of my absolute favorite movies of all time i first saw this movie in theaters when it first came out in 1997 i was just 7 at the time but i fell in love with this movie the characters and the story of itself i remember seeing this movie once with my mom and dad and then my mom and i loved it so much that we went to go see it for a second timei just recently saw this movie again last week as it was being rereleased in 3d i never thought i would see this movie in the theaters again but im glad i got the chance to see this movie again on the big screen and better yet in 3d as wellthis is such a tragic love story i cant help but cry every time i watch it its just such a sad story and im pretty sure it will always get to me leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet were perfectly cast as jack and rose billy zane was also an excellent choice for the evil calim 21 years old and i know is going to be considered a classic in the years to comei dont know why some people wouldnt like this movie i think theyre insane this movie introduced me to the true story of a horrific event that i had personally never heard of before seeing the movie ever since ive seen the movie ive become interested in the history of the and i love learning as much as i can about this historic eventim a huge movie person but i have to say this is probably my favorite love story holds a special place in my heart and it always will in my opinion its one of the greatest films ever madefor you music buffs out there the score for this film is absolutely beautiful and i highly recommend you listen to the soundtrack,sad
i just came back from watching it in imax 3d the movie stands classic and timeless if anything with some revealing mistakes digitally modified eg the visible strings that pulled the cups off the fireplace where mr andrews stood during the sinking they re colored the upper half of the funnel that fell upon those poor people the metal reel that crinkled when it was hit by a man the famous milky way shot where rose was lying on the wooden plank and the image enhanced it looked better than ever and felt extremely intimate because of the subtle 3d conversion the colors simply looked beautiful and bright and the change between blue and red intensified the drama and viewers emotions very effectively the im flying scene at the bow worked as if you were actually there with seawater going by underneath your vision the most wonderful thing was that as the movie went the 3d effect gradually became invisible because all viewers got so deeply drawn into the film and they just got used to it you will find yourself laughing at the cheesy jokes in the cheery and glamorous first half of the movie and quieting down and grieving for the tragic loss of so many lives as the ship sinks with the whole audienceit lived up to what they promised it to be it is just such a wonderful thing that so many people are willing to go back to the cinemas and share the experience with all the other audiences there again and again even just for the old times sake the watching of the movie itself is just so pleasant emotional and nostalgic it is definitely worth watching again on the big screen,sad
is the best 3d movie ever and also the best true story movie ever it was just a outstanding movie that everyone will enjoy i like this movie a lot and i think you will like it to in 3d if you liked it before than you will like it even more in 3d this movie is ok for the kids it is the best drama movie and the best movie ever created i hunk that when you see the in 3d you will say wow that was the coolest 3d movie i have ever seen that is how good this movie is i was about to cry in this movie this movie is a winner this movie is 100 percent the best movie ever oh when you go see this movie in theaters you may want to get a large popcorn because this movie is 3 hours 14 minutes long but besides that it was a wonderful movie this is a must see movie for everyone i give it two thumbs up for sure it is worth seeing you have to watch this masterpiece this is a movie that is going to be hard to get in 3d you just have to go see this movie in 3d have a great day,sad
ever since left theaters i avoided it watching it on television doesnt work this is a film of such magnitude that anything smaller than a theater screen degrades its vision now the film is right back where it belongs in theaters in an effort to jump unnecessarily on the 3d bandwagon i can grouse about that but just having the film in theaters is good enough for me there is just no better venue for the ship of dreamsdoes what great movies do creating a sense of time and place cameron takes an event that we know about and brings it close enough for us to understand as a storyteller he understands that our minds are likely to get lost in the chaos of the sinking so his remedy is to stage a computer simulation at the beginning of the film in present day that explains exactly how the ship was damaged by the time we get to the disaster were oriented in that way we can focus on the human elementto get to the cameron gives us a modern foothold framing the film with an expedition to the ship still sitting at the bottom of the atlantic forever halted in its maiden voyage to america the expedition is led by brock lovett bill paxton whose interest in is procuring a 17th century diamond that belonged to louis xiv nothing turns up but what he does find leads him to a 100 yearold woman named rose gloria stuart one of the last living survivorsthe story that she lays out is a reminder that wasnt just a curiosity but a reality for those who were there roses story of how she sailed home to an arranged marriage set up by her destitute mother is a window into the painful struggle of being a young woman in the early 20th century for rose she is sailing home to a life of marital imprisonment initially describing the ship as the ship of dreams she laments that it was the ship of dreams to everyone else to me it was a slave ship taking me back to america in chains we see the young rose so depressed that she considers suicide she is saved by jack dawson leonardo dicaprio a traveler who made his way onto the ship through a poker game jack is everything she wishes to be he opens roses mind to what life has to offer they develop a deep passion that builds ironically it is at the moment that their passion reaches its peak that the tragedy strikes with that we understand their motivations as they try and save each other as the ship goes down the actors have such a lovely chemistry together that we want them to be together roses fire and spirit are still there even as she crossed the century mark in agethe best performance in the film comes from gloria stuart as the elder rose stuart was a veteran of the golden age of hollywood 84 when was made and 100 when she died two years ago  plus she was 2 yearsold when the sank stuart plays rose a centenarian who becomes the modern link with the tragic events of that night it is in her eyewitness testimony that tragic story is brought to life her eyes are those that have borne witness to history her soft ancient voice humanizes the storyif the human elements bring us closer to the characters camerons special effects team does a masterful job of bringing the disaster to life the tension of the last hour of the film is as agonizing for us as it must have been for those involved the passengers slowly begin to realize what is happening and only come to the full realization when it is too late camerons staging of the event is a master craft of special effects but also of pacing and tension we know early on that the ship doesnt have enough lifeboats for all of the passengers it had a smoking room a swimming pool and a squash court but not have enough lifeboats and that makes the calamity all the more senselessas i said puts us frontrow to this tragedy we stand back and look at it clearly from a 21st century perspective and understand time and place even when the architect thomas andrews victor garber lays out the inevitability that the ship is doomed ismay is aghast but this ship cant sink the architect is clear shes made of iron sir i assure you she can and she will it is a mathematical certainty ismays thinking represents the view of the times was a marvel of the early 20th century industrial age a ship so glorious that it was mistakenly thought to have been unsinkable the tragedy was a grim reminder of the dark decade to come within two years the same industrial might that built the ship would be used to build machines that fueled the slaughter of the wwi in that way sinking represents the end of the 19th century and the wwi represents the beginning of the 20thbut thats history lets get back to the movie revisiting is to find that it is a view of history seen through the vision of a cinema artist at the top of his craft that craft hasnt aged one bit but now it comes with 3d as with all 3d presentations the picture is dark and the images are often not in 3d there were times when i forgot my 3d glasses except for a few occasions where i could see the depth of the 3d image that happened maybe six times in a three hour picture thats not worth the upcharge but i will say that the experience of seeing the film again in a theater is worth the inconvenience,sad
i finally got around to watching this film and while is not a horrible movie it really has no merit to be dubbed the greatest movie ever the love story is corny the action sequences are mediocre and to really believe that a homeless man can get a woman from an aristocratic dynasty is frankly just laughable aside from all that the computer graphics were ok given the 200 million dollar budgeti just dont get it john carpenter can make a cult classic like assault on precinct 13 or halloween for a mere 100 thousand dollar budget if you care to make the argument that well that was in the 1970s well youre wrong take for instance richard rodriguez 1993 hit el mariachi he made the movie for a mere 25 thousand dollars and went on to earn more than 20 million what i am afraid of is the sort of dismembering of the real creativity of writing story script plot acting directing that really make watching movies enjoyable if you wish to add to the overblown hype to this mediocre trillion dollar production shell out your hard earned dollars and buy the video buy the soundtrack buy the posters dvd etc,sad
when i first watched it i wass11 and just now i finished watching it as im 24 and i must say its not a bad movie but not a realistic one either why would rosy rose fall in love with someone she barely knew why was she so ungrateful toward her own mom why was she willing to let go of everything and run away with jack what was with that ridiculous nud scenei really felt sad as i watched the ship sank an all people froze to death but then rose could have given the poor guy some room couldnt she i mean the could have taken terms but nooo the hero dies and the old lady states the womans heart is a deep ocean of secrets and the that awful cheesy song my heart will go onnnnnnnnnnnnnn and the old lady and all of those pictures did she have to bring them on board well sank allong with90s and thats it,sad
just as the ship that couldnt be sunk sank in 1910 the movie which should not have failed went belly up and fell to the bottom of the sea i seem to be going against the grain here and maybe i was the only one seeing this movie who didnt get it i readily that there are great moments in this movie the dramatic sequence where the titantic ship becomes flooded with water and eventually sinks to the bottom is brilliant what director james cameron also does very well in exposing the sheer unfairness that some were allowed on the life boats while others were not in that connection there was a emotive scene with a navy officer who often against his own will enforced this unfair system to the letter not because it was the right thing to do but because there were only so many life boats to go around and the prevailing view was that the few life boats available should go to the rich  with the result that the rest were in effect left to die what is also very good is that scene where some of the passengers are floating in the ice cold water clinging on to whatever they could get their hands on and quickly freezing to deathyet the film still does not quite work because of what preceded this sad dramatic tragedy that was the sinking of the leonardo dicaprios jack and kate winslets rose were plausible characters but they were very annoying to watch some of their lines were so out of place and absurd that i felt deeply embarrassed watching these people the love story seemed rather contrived and unbelievable finally james horners music in the background just made the whole thing worse in short i did not feel anything for these characters or identify with their love story and that more than anything else was what dragged this movie down,sad
is really two movies one of them is an exciting james cameronstyle action film the poseidon adventure with better special effects the other is a dull as dirt period romance so simplistic and clich it seems like something conceived in the mind of a twelveyearold girlleonardo dicaprio and kate winslet became household names because of their performances in this and they do invest the film with a great deal of spunk but theyve got absolutely terrible material to work with cameron is clearly no writer but he is a good director of action so just tune in to this one once the big ship has actually hit the iceberg and youll save yourself a lot of timethe supporting cast includes kathy bates as molly brown frances fisher as winslets uptight and aristocratic mother victor garber as the skipperercaptain and billy zane in an embarrassingly awful role as the movies villain the character as written is like something out of a silent movie and zane plays him as such  if he had a mustache hed be twirling it too bad his performance is completely at odds with the totally contemporary performances of just about everyone elsecameron reveals an almost fetishistic obsession with recreating the glamour of the famed ocean liner and the glee with which he then goes about demolishing it and the people on it borders on the disturbing its like watching a little boy build an elaborate train set just so he can have the pleasure of blowing it up with firecrackersgrade b,sad
wow just wow its really the biggest movie of all time and it deserves the academy awards that it receivedamazing scriptdirectingspecial effectsvisual effectscgioh my god jim you are a perfect director i love you and i love your works especiallyjames cameron you are really the biggest director of all time you are a legendand im waiting for your next epic avatari dont think that there will be a movie like this one even after 11 years this movie still the greatest movie of all timewell i love you jim i really do and i think that you are going to get your fourth academy award on avatar i heard that you are using some great 3d techniques and great computer generated imagery in avatarwell i think that avatar is going to be a great success in both the box office and the academy awards thanks jim for this masterpiece and for all of your movies and upcoming moviesthank you,sad
this has got to be one of my all time favourite movies gosh not only has it got the gorgeous leonardo di caprio but it is just awesome ive seen this film a billion times before and never get bored of it i watched it last night and it made me cry and cry and cry for ages i love this film i recommend it to anyone im a fan of all sorts of movies and i think what ever type you like this one you will like as well even if your into war films or comedies this is great 10 out of 10kate winslet is beautiful for all the boys if anyone watches this and says oh it is not that good then they are lying although it is a remake of the older films it is great because it has a love story in it i love romantic films without this i believe it would not be half as good as what it is this film is incredible great actors and actresses to play the parts great,sad
this move was one if the best i have seen do farthe sound track the acting the scripteverything just fitted like a jigsaw puzzle the outcomeabsolute perfection i mean kate wilson acted beautifullysame goes for leonardo dicaprio their chemistry was astonishing the directer did awesome takes of the sinking he made it sadyet horrifyinghe showed us the true picture he showed the atmosphere which was intense and hopeless he showed it exactly what it must have been at the time of sinking all in allthis is one of the greatest movies ever made and which i can still not forget to mention between great movies after even twenty years or sothis was an unforgettable movie 1010and i dont care what people say,sad
i found this movie to be absolutely wonderful it is my number one favorite movie all of my friends know it whenever i bring it up they make fun of me my brother and dad mock the characters for repeating jack and roses names so many times in my opinion though they did not give this movie a chanceit is a beautiful love story the historic details in the movie are also fairly accurate i have seen this movie many times and can quote word for word during about 85 it that is how much i love it i recommend it to anyone who loves 2 watch a good love story a love story,sad
ive probably seen this movie about 1415 times so thats 45 hours well spent i think everyone has seen this movie but if you havent heres a little about it is a tragic love story of a 100 year old woman description of her love and loss on the fatal crash the movie is beautifully done the dialogue is believable and this is by far leoranado dicaprios best movie i wont reveal the story or the ending but i will say this its sad trust me men you will be crying when my heart will go on comes on well i know i did no other love story or comedy will ever come light years to this movie if your in to violence and dont watch a movie for its dialogue go ahead ignore me and rent a b movie horror movie but this movie will touch you and its worth a try bye everyone ill see you soon,sad
it seems to me that 11 oscars for this film is appalling for some reason the nomination board have agreed that is one of the most revolutionary films ever madelittle seems to be asked of when watching this film never really challenging the viewer and ensuring that there is a distance kept between the film and the audience at all times whilst there are strong acting performances in it seems to drag on with a short period of concentrated action and meaningcould this be the most overrated film in history it certainly seems that although winning 11 oscars only second my lord of the rings return of the king doesnt appear to earn more than about 3 of these with a vast amount of money poured into a film that nominators seem obliged to award oscars to for me however what seems to be the most disappointing thing is the apparent agreement of the imdb public not seconding the oscar polls with the film not even entering the top 250,sad
the first time i watched this movie i just got so emotional id always liked the whole idea of the and i really enjoyed the film i love the costumes and the set and i really fell in love with kate winslets acting leonardo dicaprio too did a great job and the special effects seem pretty good for 1997i cant however really seem to understand how people can hate this movie its people hate the because it sank failed when it was supposedly unsinkable get your facts straight none of the builders at harland and wolff white star line anybody called it unsinkable practically unsinkable yes plain unsinkable no and it was the name unsinkable that caught peoples imaginationsits just so horrible to hear that people watch it and sometimes like it but dont want to admit it its childish stupid and utterly pointless to waste that energy you could be using for something elsegreat movie definitely worth watching for 3 hours,sad
it is 10 years now since the was first released i watched fully over 20 times and each time it touches me like no other next to brave heart i believe this is the best movie ever made from casting directing music story graphics script and the attention they pay to each and every detail is just a wow everything in this movie was almost perfect this is a movie that touches your heart but like the discovery ship captain said in the end of the movie you have to let it in in order to feel it if not you will never find this movie as great as many people think it is i dont mean to be aggressive here but i do believe you can know much about people from the movies they like and people that didnt like the or even think it is not watch worthy should look at the mirror and try to reevaluate themselves because if one of the best love stories in the world or one of the biggest dramas the century witnessed that is perfectly performed didnt move a thing in you then there is something wrong there somewhere and you should stick with watching rambo terminator or ricky balboa movies is just a level higher,sad
when i was a kid my sister forced me to watch with her and i heard about it every ware everyday that it was good and amazing and people loved it i wasnt one of those people well the only thing i liked about the movie when i was a kid was the sinkingnow 10 years later i watch it now and i was amazed on how good this movie is its so incredibly made and put together i fell in love with this film leo displays jack dawson beautifully and same with kate with her character rose leo and kate make a perfect chemistry for a love story which is injames cameron did a very good job directing this movie by having both a love story and a disaster at the same time which is very hard to do i was also shocked on how underrated this movie is 7 out of 10 come on people this is easily one of the best movies ever made it was very powerful and emotional i am very picky with movies so i give it a 1010 perfect movie folks,sad
an excellent version of the 1953 original as well as the 1956 a night to rememberwe really have character development in this fine picture leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet shine as our doomed hero and heroine in a comeback performance gloria stuart does very well in the part of winslet as an old womanwhat is so enjoyable about this film is the sociological depiction of the upper and lower classes we can see from almost the beginning of the disaster the lower class will be doomed to tragedyfrances fisher gives excellent support as kates upper class mean mother this is a mother so mean that kate went through life never revealing to her that she had surviveddi caprio it has been argued looked too young for the part he really seemed to mature as the film went on his scene before his demise was well done and memorable,sad
i dont know where all these people get off defending this movie i think most would agree its not a bad film it is simply not anywhere near good enough to warrant the hypeaccolades it achievedhow this movie set a record for oscar victories and gross sales ill never know its a story everyone already knew they thought the ship was unsinkable it sunk a lot of people on board died ive known this since 4th gradei think the world has know since 1918the angle of approach is equally unoriginal and not clever a story of forbidden love wow i had never heard a story of forbidden love before because i live in a hole on saturnwhen you take a well known story and focus on an over done plot line within that story naturally much of your audience will be bored if you enjoyed the movie thats fine but dont tell me that this is one of the best of all time cause youre only lying to yourself,sad
the passion of the christ is better than this crap and why you ask this movie was boring stupid and anything else that is stupid every scene in this movie is stupid and dull and boring a 1 is the lowest i can give for this web page my real vote is a minus 5 i never need to see this movie again my better movie is what i mentionioed its the passion of the christ also tombstone fahrenheit 911 into the west jesus christ superstar misssissippi burning mash billy jack wyatt earp is better than jack dawson and michael moore is better than james camron in closing i think this movie sucks whenever someone want to watch this movie i leave the room to watch something else,sad
when this film came out in the late 90s i made a vow that i would not see it in the movie theatre i kept to my vow but god in his infinite wisdom made sure i saw it on a transatlantic flight the feature presentation was i took it as a sign and i watched the film i was preparing to be whisked away into the film but i was only slapped by it i found the acting to be dreadful and the dialogue between the characters was awkward at best i used to be a fan of james horner but listening to the soundtrack i was torn was i listening to braveheart or snippets from apollo 13which was a reconstituted score of sneakers nearing the end of the flight and the film during the promise scene between rose and jack with the line ill never let go i mumbled let the buggar sink a little too loudly and was shushed loudly and got dirty looks sorry but the line was so corny and the delivery was not believable the reason this is being written nearly 8 years later is that fact that was on today and i wanted to give it a second chance with this viewing i was again struck with the herkyjerky dialogue bad acting and continuity problems galore with the tagline of being the biggest budgeted film of the time where was the money for continuity and anachronisms a ten minute search on the internet would has solved many problems artistically this film is good yet when i pay my 89 well earned bucks for a film i want to be transported away for 23 hours with this film i was not transported anywhere i sat in my seat and i was aware of my seat and that i was rolling my eyes,sad
im sorry but why why why would anyone like this movie its an okay rental to watch one night with your sweetie but best picture im sure there was something more worthy that year the acting was fine and all it just didnt seem to be that special i mean does anybody remember anything from this movie in my opinion the only good part in this was when the boat split down the middle pretty good cgi there but the love story was so cheesy jack im flying jack oh please and the sex scenestupid as for the endingill never let go jack and then she just lets go good job plus im sorry but that was a big door she was floating on im sure they couldve come up with some way for both of them to balance on it instead she took it all the selfish brat she was shone through she didnt even try to figure out another way she mustve known that jack would die in that water otherwise she is selfish and stupid i dont see how anyone couldve fallen in love with her its okay to see this movie once the sets are really quite amazing but otherwise i wouldnt bother seeing it again,sad
the is an excellent movie set on the worlds most famous ship it is a movie that has helped shape the future of hollywoods movie style  the movie that set the box office on fire the greatest movie of our timenot only is the movie in itself great but there are many other redeeming qualities to it for example the lighting and color contrast it superb just watch the scene when kal billy zane presents the heart of the ocean to rose kate winslet the color in the room and the colors used on kates character are simply inspiringthe story is another excellent quality of the the way that james cameron makes you feel watching it you can lose yourself in kates character she is being pushed into so many things she is on the edge of giving up and at the last possible second leonardo pops up and saves her its brilliant and not necessarily expectedfinally the has an awesome air of having fun and breaking free this is especially shown in the third class party scene below the deck when kate dances with leo it is also shown in the scene right before the collision with the iceberg when kate tells leo that when the ship docks im getting off with youso there you have it an excellent movie i give a 10 out of 10 the lighting and color contrast are great the story is excellent and the air of fun is evident add in billy zane with eyeliner and the modern day heart throb leonardo dicaprio and whats not to love,sad
what an exceptional movie no one will ever compare to this not to this the fact that james cameron was willing to create a huge ship all because he was that committed to this film and he exceeded with fireworks jack and rose they are the epiphany of what we call true love no couple from any movie has shown us such love passion and will to risk anything just to see their faces one more time rose played the kate winslet who is basically a woman who doesnt approve of her mothers choice to marry because her husband died and no money is around so rose is forced to marry kal kal a conceited man who thinks nothing of the poor and or third class hes the type where he thinks hes gods gift to the world what a lousy giftjack leonardo dicaprio is the person who flys at the seat of life his life completely changes all in a card shuffle but he never thought of meeting a woman like rose as the film moves on rose and jack meet at a very weird situation and soon trying to be torn apart by kal roses mother and kals man servant even as the ship sinks into the cold atlantic their love is still binded through the will to live no matter what happens their love will always be one this movie shows us how long and destined love can prevail even in grave peril this movie will send your heart to the skys and never displease you a,sad
for us this is one of the best movies in all the times the acting is perfect and such realistic we can see a perfect love story that has a sad ending but we can see that the force of love is very strong only a woman who is in love can put her life in jeopardy for the man she loves that in this case was jack the tragedy of the is well performed in this movie it really caused lots of deaths and in the movie we can appreciate them we can say that the power of love is stronger than the tragedy and we can see a movie with a big quality we can prove that with such many oscars this movie won also this story contains a little kind of history of the real than sinked a lot of tears ago and this movie can explain us how was the life in that times and how did the people suffer in the ship and the movie has great special effects that make it believable tragic that keep us in suspense during the movie also this story contains a little kind of history of the real than sinked a lot of tears ago and this movie can explain us how was the life in that times and how did the people suffer in the ship and the movie has great special effects that make it believable tragic that keep us in suspense during the movie,sad
this film i loved it people should go and see it because its entertaining and the acting were really professional from both parts even though it is long it doesnt bore you because of the content it has this movie made leonardo di caprio become a superstar and put kate winslet into the stardom and in every single magazine they appeared such a great romantic story that gathered lots of money and had 11 oscars nominations fantastic performances cool the director james cameron made a great job guiding this fabulous characters in such a real story great directing and art direction kate winslet show everyone she can actually act and being a real professional she lost weight amazing no words to describe how i felt china sursa fanny,sad
an awesome movie all around and excellent fusion of the fictional with the historical it gives a great insight of how tragic this story was and the toll of lives that were lost back in 1912 a movie like this that makes you feel like you were there even though something like this happened 90 years ago it exceptional movie making impossible to top no wonder james cameron hasnt made another movie since the story of the vanity and the old ways of classes and how things were in the 1900s before the upheavals that took place like the russian revolution ww ww2 etc shows how things were back then a great and timeless movie,sad
this film will go down in history as just a groundbreaking film aside from anything else when it came out you wanted to see it the way they advertised it how could you not were all guilty of morbid curiosity and love the irony of a ship so grand in scale and deemed unsinkable to so many could actually do the unthinkable and pretty much capsize it fascinates all of us james cameron did an excellent job of pulling this together they wasted a lot of water that some 3rd world countries could have used but still a good job i liked the flashback idea but its pretty obvious the chick woulda been dead in most real life circumstances and kate winslet doesnt play a convincing 17 year old girli liked the true ending of the ship it actually went down in 2 pieces rather than in all one form as other versions have implied it kinda makes this movie the definitive version in a way because it broke the standard the climax was for the men to this day all my boyfriend talks about is the guy hitting the propeller and spinning madly to his icy death but the love story was definitely for the women it was a little pretentious to think that she would have followed this man in the 4 days that she knew him but hey thats hollywood rose was a nice insert as a person in history but it seems fairly fantastic today that this story would ever happen jack was a stupid twit of a man that had no prospects and were supposed to believe that she would run away with this cat oooh rich bastard whos hot or poor twit whose only appeal is that he lives under a bridge oh the choices his nomadic existence was suppose to charm us but all i saw was a bum and look what happened to him he was supposed to be so used to cold water and whatnot and the boy froze like a fishstick if i were her i woulda went back to cal and said my bad about that spitting thingi loved the character of mr andrews a little stupid for wanting to die with his creation but to each his own i cant believe that people actually wanted to go down with the ship and kept playing music and whatnot absolutely saddening that they were missing the big picture ship sinking need to get off i found the music inspiring and well always have celine dions song to drag us back to 1997 the year it wouldnt stop playing i never really felt the terror of being on this ship though i found that people had plenty of opportunities to get off but they were just too damn stuck up to try anything only the 3rd class folks you felt sorry for they actually tried to keep them on the boat you felt bad for them because they were the ones that were gonna die because of their low station however i didnt have sympathy for first class folks and where were the 2nd class people it was like they didnt exist i guess they werent instrumental to the plot but i wouldnt have minded seeing them at timesand of course were all a little mad at the old lady dropping the necklace in the water i know its supposed to be poignant but give it to the granddaughter or somebody brock should have gotten it i felt bad for him because he was like the rabbit from the trix commercials just let him have it for goodness sakes hes only devoted his entire adult life to it no little old crackpot decides to toss it overboard i woulda made her go in after itanywho good film over all well all remember it when were old as that film,sad
ok i have a confessioni was one of the fourteen year old girls who sobbed through many a viewing ofpaid to see it at the cinema more than once bought the video the day it came out and spent many evenings rewatching it i read books about the film and about the actual history of the ship in short i became obsessed sadly or rather thankfully i was not alone looking back now at the ripe old age of twenty i cringe at the memory of those days and although having only watched the film once in the last four years truly i still regard the film with affection of course now i have distance to actually pick holes in it yes the writing in places is slightly glossy shall we say the story is rather predictable and the whole rich girl falls in love with poor cheeky chappy has been done a few times before the run up to the sinking takes one and a half hours and the sinking takes that time again some would say it moves too slowly and for the action loving filmgoers out there i certainly take their point the film does tend to take stereotypes to the max for instance the treatment of thirdclass passengers and the snobbery of firstclass this said i was not alive in 1912 and perhaps this is a completely justified representation of how things were to me though i would never have admitted this six years ago the iceberg never looked very realagain having not seen many big icebergs i may be mistaken however the film has something very rare it has a certain kind of magic a soul to it that makes fourteen year old girls sob into their pillows after watching iti never actually did thatit was just an example the love story although predictable and almost sickening in places has an innocent quality awakening in the audience memories of their first loves and the naughty glances across rooms and boat decks true this is not leonardo dicaprios finest hour anyone who has seen him in whats eating gilbert grape will testify but then the story does not demand an awesome display of acting qualitiesjust that he be lifeloving with a boyish charm and be able to hang onto the side of a ship for long stretches of time kate winslet plays the sheltered highsociety darling to perfection and the rest of the cast slot into place of course the real lead character is the ship of dreams herself and the art department certainly came up trumps there as did the special effects team turning the cinematv screen into a porthole peering into the pastexcept for the aforementioned iceberg but then that always posed a problemthe whole film makes 1912 come alive for a modernday audiencejames cameron certainly did his research and carefully intertwined established and accepted to a certain degree fact with his fiction his film may have many faults but if you just sit back let yourself fall in love with the ship the characters the romance and grandeur of the age then the magic may just take you if not then just fast forward an hour and a half and see in my personal opinion one of the best historical recreations via special effects ever seen on film so if you havent watched the film for a while or hated it when it was surrounded by excessive hype revisit it not with the cynical air of a serious moviegoer but with the innocent easilypleasedbystunningvisual eyes of a fourteen year old and go on sob like a baby as rose lets go of jack dropping him into the atlantic for ever its all too much,sad
is an amazing epic of love and nightmares i dont really like romantic films but this was great and pulled it off the acting was decent but that doesnt really matter in this movie this film launched leonardo dicaprios career james cameron did great in directing this movie and the rest of the creators the music made the movie the theme music of james cameron and the song by celine dion was perfect that song is extremely famous and i sure like it a lot the movie was beautiful and very realistic i havent seen it in a while but since ive been writing all of this i might just want to watch ithedeens outlook 1010  a,sad
painful is the word that comes to my mind when i think of camerons why because such a budget such magnificent special effects  so much of everything  was shamelessly wasted on a fifthrate plot that mocks the magnificent true stories of the it could have been the film of the century instead its a colossal monument to hollywoods dementiasomeone on this forum asked how could anyone hate this film all those who have read the true accounts of what happened on the cannot but hate it the sinking provided a stage for acts of incredible heroism and cowardice it became the catalyst and a showcase for all the highs and lows of human nature an example for those who absolutely need a love story there were 9 newly wed couples aboard the ship only four or five of the new husbands survived why not base the main story line on one or two of those true tragedies would they be perhaps too boring for hollywoods target audience whatever and wherever it is i think not but even as a work of fiction which it is this film leaves a lot to be desired in real life  even in 1912  not all the poor are a priori merry and goodnatured and not all the rich are narrowminded and snobby as they are portrayed in this film as far as the characters are concerned this is very much a black  white movie and the dead  the real dead  of the are merely a backdrop for the directors seethrough shallow unimaginative egoshame on you cameron,sad
this film is pants three painstaking mushfilled hours of some of the poorest film making ive ever witnessed  and the sad thing is this is james cameron  he made aliens  he made terminator and terminator 2 these films are classics undoubted classics butit smells  bad dont watch it ever  and if you do see someone actively wanting to view this film shoot them  its for their own good  end ofavoid like the black plagueavoidavoidavoid like you would avoid sexual intercourse with a saggy old womanjust avoid,sad
was the best movie ever made the acting was very good it was well organized also if i could meet 2 people in this world it would be kate winslet and leonardo dicaprio they did the best acting the movie was just great all around definelty got 10 fingers up from meis not only a true story but it also has a little extra added to it the love story was fantasticit was very dramatic and romantic if i could be in a movie like that i would may be long but its definetly worth watchingi wish was still as popular as it was at firstanyone out there who thinks it is dumb is dumb thereself it is my favorite movie and it was overall very goodi wish more movies would be like it,sad
pure unadulterated 100 american baloney this movie shows that europe must not fall for the allpackaged marketed american soap dramas that we think represent movie creativity this proves that the golden days of hollywood are numbered foreign movies including those made in europe only britain considers europe as foreign must rise to the challenge and raise the intellectual stakes so that we are not forced to watch this new form of tripe only jack nicholson is worth savingthe rest of hollywood can slide into the ice cold atlantic with the special effects department,sad
in my top 3 worst 3 films of all time just beating king ralph into 3rd if i were you i would take yourself outside rub a cheese grater on the side of your face for 3 hours then come back inside  believe me you will of had much more fun,sad
i dont get it why would anyone spend time to watch this movie over and over and over and over again my girl friend watched this movie for 3 times my god in theater it drove me madthis movie is boring dumb and irrational why would a rich girl fell for a poor theif it just doesnt make any sense,sad
common decency prevent me venting my true feelings about this movie and i had to see it twice it is undoubtedly the most overrated movie ever how can it possible beat la confidential to the oscarawful awful  reasonable effects and awful,sad
it pains me that this is the top grossing film of alltime and im shocked at the lead it has over second place  it was awful  the music was terrible  the plot was terrible its fiction remember  the acting was terrible  leo is just not believable as the leading man in my opinion its entirely too long  i will grant that the sets were fantasticbut then i dont like michael jacksons thriller either,sad
when this movie was released just about everyone loved it it beat all the records and cemented itself into movie historysomehow the cement has worn off some time after the oscars became a cool movie to bash and dismiss as just a love story everyone started jumping on the bandwagon hence the number of 1s given by imdb voterswhile its not one of the greatest movies ever made its a damn good one and deserves better than its received the love story is there to make the disaster more personal to the viewers and this disaster is not a sudden one it starts out as the ship just skimming an iceberg and ends with the ship being torn apart in half and sinking into the sea its shot so well that we feel like were a part of it  as the ship is vertical on the water its so tense because youre not sure if its going to fall backwards or forewards and if it does youll be going along for the ridei also liked the ending a lot the assumption is that rose dies in her sleep an old woman in her warm bed and in heaven returns to the and to jack and its brilliantly shot in that we see everything through roses eyes the passengers all greeting us and the looking so beautifulits not a movie i own its much too long for repeated viewings or even love but i can see it for what it is powerful wellmade and epic,sad
im sorry folks  you cant rate a movie based on teenage emotions  yes the special effects were great but thats where it stops  awful soundtrack awful acting and much less a story that should remain in the history books only  this movie is much like a camaro mustang or cavaliermaybe it wouldnt be so bad if it had anything unique about it but oh well it didnt,sad
possible spoilers ok im not really surprised it sank i thought the film was horrible i did like the detail on the boat somewhat but the only part of value was when you saw all the dead bodies floating in the icy atlantic ocean 2 out of 10,sad
james cameron really knows how to put on a show t2 the abyss true lies and aliens all of his films have been hugely enjoyable rich in epic scope and emotional flavor whether it be science fiction or in this case an historical disaster film he really knows how to create rich epic entertainment and with he has probably made his finest film artistically sure there are  many who dont like the film  historians will go tuttut which they always do anyway at any film based on historical fact but cameron makes his interpretation of the disaster work so well mainly because he knows how to tell a story really well and he is a master at creating suspense in his action sequencesthe first half of in undeniably moving the love story between jack and rose may have every cliche in the book the jealous fiance the evil mother in law the tug of love between lover and family but let me tell you cameron can make these cliches really work here the epic scale puts it above sheer soap opera and with fantastic performances from winslet zane and even dicaprio cameron really makes the love story work from a story telling point of view and a visual one the way he presents the first kiss on the bow to the drawing of a nude rose through to the love scene cameron makes his finest film and if this were just a period love piece it would be enough but as this is about the sinking of the he has more aces up his sleeve and he creates the most moving motion picture in many a decade not since the days of david lean has a love story been presented in such a way and when that iceberg comes cameron mixes love story and historical disaster in the most fantastic way which ensured that audiences responded in their drovessure this is not great art it is a hollywood blockbuster one like gladiator it too a fantastic film that takes the audience back to the good old days when big budgeted blockbusters had a great plot as well as superb special effects and with cameron at the helm we are getting the best of both worlds all of this culminates in some of the most moving scenes in a mainstream hollywood film i have ever seen they are not manipulative they are well writtenthis is a superb film on every level well done james you have done it again,sad
reading through the comments i see alot of people saying stuff like i wanted to see a ship sink so shallow characters did not matter come on people sitting through 2 hours of poor dialog just to see 10 minutes of nice special effects is no excuse for giving this movie anything more then a rating of 2 or 3 4 if you are generous a movie should be judged on the sum of all of its components while the special effects in this movie would warrant an 8 or 9 the characters sucked the plot was quite lame and the movie was slow up until the boat sank i regret wasting 2 hours of my life on this movie and wish that i could have walked in on the last 10 minutes rather then sat through it the things men do for our girlfriends,sad
may include spoilersthe movie 1997 is an outstanding example of something old brought to life again james cameron writerdirector gives us the story of two lovers rose and jack fighting to stay together and eventually fighting to survive camerons wellwritten and well thought out script went on to become one of the most admirable films of all time also winning eleven academy awards camerons playwriting talent shines from the moment we see the submersibles diving down to the wreck to the moment rose is rescued this story will leave you sitting on the edge of your seat till the very end if you are not interested in romance the amazing special effects and the actionpacked second half will leave you loving the movie from right after the moment it ends this movie will make you laugh and cry it will leave you angry awed and perhaps even frightened but most of all it will touch your heart you will feel as though you were there on that night as you watch the ship from the time it hits the iceberg right until it slips beneath the waves i strongly recommend this movie for anyone who wants a romantic movie and a heartpounding adventure,sad
spoilersi just watched the movie  even though i have seen it maybe sixty times no kidding it still took my breath away  amazing thats what it is  i was torn to tears when jack slipped beneath the icy black surface of the sea rose and jack shared a kind of pure love we all hope to experience  the very end was like a little taste of heaven itself leaving me with a longing feeling to see what was next  it was wonderful  the love story the tragedy the true facts  all perfectly shown  if you think that this movie is a flop read some of robert ballards books about his expedition to the gravesite  see the pictures of the debris of the shoes where bodies once lay  then watch again  i swear you will never have felt so moved in your life,sad
this film is truly a masterpiece its wellacted historically correct welldesignedand the special effects my goodness you cannot help but cry at least once1500 innocent people died why cant you appreciate that i wish everyone would stop bashing this movie and open their hearts to this golden film,sad
i think that the fact that this movie has received so much bad talk only strengths my belief that it is an emotionally solid film with an excellent plot sweeping love story heartbreaking tragedy great dialogue and a hang on ending  it is wonderful and romantic and fantastically played out i am obsessed with the movie i can recite any line and god darn it im proud of it,sad
i saw this film twice in a week at the theatre there was just too much beauty and detail on the ship to absorb in one one sittingdespite its overall running time your attention is maintained for the most partpartly because the film is split between present and past timesthere are just one or two moments however that seem over longon the whole it tells the sad story in a novel way with a fine and haunting scoreenjoy it,sad
spoilers contained if you want to see a film about the watch a night to remember the idea that kate winslett would have ever have met let alone fallen in love with decaprio aboard an edwardian ship such as the is absurd the fact that she then makes out with him in the back of a car aboard the ship just adds to the feeling that somebody at the studio has finally given up all hope of making a realistic story its overly long hollywood twaddle of the highest order hopefully it will hit an iceberg and sink without trace soon,sad
i try to watch this movie i really do  ive tried to watch it six times each time i fall asleep because of its prolonged story line  yes we know they love each other but i think they could have done the movie in three hours,sad
hey ill take a cheesy but well done romance story anytime  you see thats what is so good about hollywood  hollywood tries to make movies for everyone  if hollywood only made the same historicalfactualdocumentary type movies that could get boring  so hollywood likes to spice things up a bit  sure the romance between jack and rose may have been unrealistic but that doesnt mean it could never have happened  ive seen stranger things believe it or not  plus we have to remember that no historical movie not even the good ones are 100 factually accurate  sure some are more accurate than others but thats not necessarily the case in most movies  most movies add more drama or romantic stories in them to make things more interesting how interesting would the 1997 version of had been if all you saw was the ship take off and then sink i like to know the background stories of the people in the movie even if it is a sappy cheesy love story  otherwise it might be a bit boring who would even care about the characters if we didnt know at least a little about them  and a tragic love story is the best formula  lovely  james cameron was smartvery smart to add this in this film he has something for the men action special fx and stuff for the ladies some goodlooking guys and a love story  theres nothing wrong with that sure the dialogue wasnt oscarcaliberhahayet it won 11 oscars out of 14  a new record go figure  besides it seems like most of the general public enjoyed the movieso who cares what the dialogue was likei didnt see much wrong with pearl harbor except for the fact that the dialogue was very weak 10 times worse than ever was and it seemed to me like the main goal was to sort of recreate anotheresque film to garner the same success had  not many movies can touch a wide ranging audience like did  it might be some time before another movie does  its the highest grossing movie to date another one of pearl harbors weaknesses aside from the elementary plot and lines was that i feel like perhaps maybe this historic event hit home to many americans and perhaps it was a little too closetohome to make a shody job of a movie about pearl harbor  maybe in 30 years people wouldnt care if this movie had come out then but there are still veterans still alive from the war and although im not sure what most of them felt about the movie from what i heard a lot of them enjoyed it,sad
someone needs to write a dissertation on the audience reaction to this movie  when it came out almost everyone loved it and many people saw it multiple times yet after it won the oscars suddenly you werent cool unless you hated with a passion  i dont understand this at all maybe it was too successful for its own good or maybe it was just camerons ahole acceptance speech but the way the audience has flipfloped on this film is amazing  personally i think its a great movie  the dialogue is bad but otherwise theres nothing terrible about it  if you dont like it i can see rating it at 6 or so but how could over 7000 people truly believe deserves a 1 on a scale of 1 to 10  i mean come on,sad
its a good film the first time you see it ive personaly seen it loads of times now and i feel asleep after wacthing it 3 times it got borring so my adwise dont see it more than twice its a love story with a sad ending 5 stars of 10,sad
the best part of the movie had to be when leo went under the water at the end i dont have anything in particular against him as an actor and i think he was great in basketball diaries but this film was terrible and there was no excuse for the terrible acting within,sad
it still bewilders me why so many people appear to like this movie  from a special effects point of view fair enough the ship sinking was impressive however the claims made for its sense of romance and the emotional force of the storyline leave me cold  this is a childish foolish movie where we are somehow expected to care about the adolescent cravings of two cardboard characters  i put the word characters in quotation marks as the reality is that anything approaching a realistic person is sorely absent from this picture  types and stereotypes are all we get and a lot of hammy acting  billy zane stick to tales from the crypt demon night please your overthetop posturing was perfect in that not so in this  prior to its release there were rumours that was going to be a turkey doesnt anyone see those rumours were proved correct  if you want a real filmic account of the sinking of the full of real characters real intelligence and real feeling and made with a tiny fraction of the budget of camerons bloated epic just watch a night to remember 1958  of course you wont have that hilarious scene where the kissing kids distract the night watchman from the iceberg but you might see a more authentic account and a truly memorable movie,sad
first off this was a rather good flick for me  nothing to greati have seen a lot of films since i have seen this one that i like a heck of a lot more but this was pretty good  a love story set on the is basically the story with a few plot points about class  seeing the ship sink of course is the highlight for me cause it really did look good  i saw the actors did alrighti wont badger leo i dont hold anything against a guy just because lots of gals like him i just call him a lucky bastrd and be done with it  kate looks pretty good in this flick and does a rather good job as well  like i said though the boat sinking is the highlight and one complaint i have is that there wasnt enough character developement of other characters besides leos and katesi have posted some theories on why i think it grossed so much on the message board here because frankly i think it was a fluke it did gross so much but i am not saying it was a bad flick,sad
i give james cameron credit for being an accomplished producer but he and george lucas have one unfortunate thing in common they both can write a good story and are capable of overseeing a project but james and george are both subpar at dialogue and are terrible directors from an actor standpoint  that is what kills  the movie is visually stunning and the story moves along fairly well but the acting is just not up to snuff this surprised me a bit because dicaprio and winslet have been good individually in other movies but here they seem wooden and constrained by sappy dialoguemy other major problem with this movie is the predictability inherent in the story  i will say that i am prejudiced against movies that dont contain some element of surprise  because this is a movie about the you know the boat sinks unless you slept through elementary school  it makes the end rather anticlimactic so why is this the highest grossing movie of all time  because apparently 14 year old girls will pay again and again to watch a tragic love story on the big screen  it only took me one viewing to realize i dont ever need to watch this movie again  210,sad
this film must only appeal to a person with the mentality of someone who has gone as far as the 8th grade  if you want to see real film watch shawshank redemption or the godfather  the dialogue in this film is an insult to anyones intelligence who has went past high school educationwise  the most terrible line in the film  jack im flying  i felt like saying great keep flying off of the bow of this ship so this movie will end you obese sow  this movie was very painful  by the way this film was and is not awesome or way cool as some have stated  the approving comments below and their lack of grammatical accuracy just proves that people who like this film are trailer trash who do not have a good grasp on the kings english,sad
obviously made merely because special effects had advanced to a level to do justice to the sinking of a huge ship alas no thought about plot dialogue cinematography historical accuracy and so on a plodding cliched madefortv doublecheesetogo fast food film with some good special effects but deserving of no oscars as time will tell,sad
a 70 are you kidding me i have read all the comments on this movie and let me say there is just absolutely no need for them isnt it funny how in the winter of 1997 everybody was going to see this movie some multiple times helping it become the highestgrossing movie ever and now they all hate it i feel bad for cameron hopefully he never gets on this website and reads this crap because he is very talented tell me what exactly is bad about this movie every single excuse ive heard for people hating it are biased opinions based on stupid things they say they dont like it because of leo okay there are about a dozen other actors besides leo here and he wasnt even that bad come on get a freakin grip a little note to people who get on here and try to be movie critics you dont rate a movie on the likeability of an actor thats a selfish opinion its like saying i hate pretty woman because julia roberts wears a red dress and i hate red please sure i get the fact that the love story is somewhat cheesy but thats only in certain parts of the movie and the movie is over 3 hours some more advice dont rate a movie in pieces commenting on the beginning love story and the end with the sinking what is that all about a movie is one whole piece of work how can you just show a ship sinking and not set it up first with a beginning everything about this film is spectacular the music the sets the effects the themes it shows how not only changed the world but the very lives of the people on it if youll notice at the end none of the characters ever really recovered from it the love story is essential to take you on the inside of the tragedy and see it how people that were actually there saw it from a victims eyes and if you laughed at this movie then your heart is as cold as the iceberg that sank this ship do you laugh when a bomb goes off killing people i hope not 1500 people died on this ship many suffering one of the most horrible deaths drowning and never even getting a chance to save themselves those that didnt drown were tortured by freezing to death stick your hands in ice water and tell me how you would feel being totally immersed in it slowly dying children and babies died think about that and tell me how cruel someone has to be to laugh at that cameron makes you feel for the people on the ship something other movies failed to do by creating characters we care about and ripping them apart he creates a true tragedy its not a comedy the last hour is one of the most exhilarating movie experiences of all time and so is this movie this is possibly the only case in which a film once so popular will go down forever as being gay and a piece of trash i guess its a good thing reviews like these arent published leave that to the professionals who by the way liked it,sad
is a comercial movie who couldnt be worst in a film making all what james cameron searches is showing leonardo di caprio in all the ways possible to make a calendar is a too simple story for such a good theme and such a good budget i hate simple words and simple stories,sad
judging by the grammar of the comments by the people who like this film on this board all i can say is that these film critics must be 13yearold females  its a sad commentary on our society that most people who watched this film need a simplistic dialogue to understand a film  the dialogue left nothing to the imagination as it was trying so hard to stereotype everyone in this film  heres a clue rich people are not all bad and poor people are not all beerswilling drunkards  the other stereotype you had was jack the typical poor starving artist  then you had billy zane the villain who was i assume was supposed to act and look like snidely whiplash dark hair dark clothing from a dudley doright cartoon  im surprised they didnt put a moustache on him  and lets not forget roses rich uptight mother the rich are all uptight and snobbish you know who is automatically supposed to allow a gambling low life starving artist delve right into the family fortune the effects were in fact good but if you need your movie dialogue spoon fed to you then this is the movie for you,sad
there is a backlash brewing especially amongst imdb fans who suddenly brought down from the 1 ranking to out of the top 250 fine you win the film will just have to settle for the all time box office record and tied for the most academy awards it is interesting that most of these haters did not see the film when it first came out and didnt even see it in theatres at all the longer you waited to see the film the more difficult it would be to watch it objectively many of these haters never wanted to see the film to begin with and went out of their way to tear it down when given the opportunity to finally see it those of us like myself who saw the film in theatres during the early weeks were able to watch it more objectively i expected it to be well directed and technically impressive james cameron directed the terminator the most intense and relentless thriller i have ever seen aliens redefined the sci fihorror film what i was not expecting was that i would be crying at the end of the first film to make me cry since ghost as a man one who loves pulp fiction reservoir dogs la confidential etc i was caught completely off guard and became very emotional during the last half hour of the film i cannot explain it and dont want to explain it but i will never forget this film because it somehow got these feelings outside of my otherwise stoic self kate winslet and gloria stuart broke my heart and james horners score perfectly set the mood for me i paid to see the film several times and sneaked in to see the ending many more times  the total amount of time and money i put into watching this film is a bargain compared to the many hours of therapy sessions i otherwise could have had the feelings the film inspired in me normally well hidden has since enabled me to become a more open emotional giving well rounded person that is the highest praise i can say of this film it changed my life,sad
i am sorry but i believe that this film was way over rated it was too long  and really put myself to sleep to really put it simple the boat sank get over it ,sad
big sinking boat is a great movie i saw it 3 days after it came out and couldnt believe how well it was made the scenes on the bowim flying as the boat chugs into the sunset probably what helped put the film over for me as much as anything what puts up there with the other great epicslawrence of arabia gone with the wind etc is that cameron knew knew that to get you hooked he needed characters people cared about felt for and wanted to see more ofthe movie has heart excellant performances the best of fx it pulls you into its world and doesnt let go until it wants to wrap that up with the most haunting theme music this side of field of dreamsis it any wonder it made so much  in 9798 a deserved oscar winner an old fashioned epic done the right way for once outta  of course,sad
if you are into nothing but fx then this is your film but if you value multi dimensional characters  with a good story lines then this going to be a total waste of your time its too long of a film just to look at pretty pictures,sad
first im gonna admit that for 4 months i was ranting about this movie from ocean to ocean  telling people that if you want to see a ship movie that is worth it go see das boot  well april 19th i finally went to see the movie  i went in thinking maybe 2 12 3 star and came out emotionally spent  im a guy and when a movie hits you that hard i end up liking the movie so much  what really made this movie worked was james horners score  only he could have done it  im not one of those obsessed people who decided to see the movie 90 times couldnt afford that even if i wanted to i dont go out and buy the calendars puzzles shirts diamonds related to the movie  i do like reading about history  i like to take photographs seeing old photographs makes the feeling the more real   contrary to many people i think kate winslet is the star of the show and not leo  hes almost a non issue except that if not because of leo kate would be wandering about god only know where or dead already i hope kate winslet gets some movies worth her talent  i know leos man behind the iron mask was less than expected so hes not perfect either when i watch a movie i try very hard not to think about the politics of a movie  want a good way to ruin a movie thats a good way how  its hard to believe that someone who completely hated the movie decided to see it which is dumb anyway you cant complain until you see it then you have every right to  this is only the second time since i began watching movies that my opinions about a movie have changed so dramatically  the other was the highly controversial movie last temptation of christ for which for over 5 years i refused to watch it  well i better quiet down  and go back to reviewing movies just for friends its a hobby of mine this wasnt a true review anyway  just defending against some of the comments ive seen so far on this page thank you,sad
i wish someone would tell me what made this such a box office hit with its rich people bad poor people good theme  i would also like to know why it took 3 hours to tell this story the movie was outrageously slow in most parts  the acting was also terrible and there was no visible chemistry that existed between dicaprio and winslet  i have liked dicaprio in other works ie man in the iron mask and i think he has a bright future the only decent character was kathy bates playing the part of a nevus riche socialitethe scenes where they show the boat on the water look very fake  i would hate to see what cameron paid to make these scenes  also how did dicaprio survive for that long in subfreezing watersthis movie would be great if you were a 13 year old girl who has never had exposure to good film  on an adult level however i am surprised at the fact that many people liked it because there are many more films out there that are much worthier of praise than this piece of fluff,sad
there are movies that you dont care for the first time you see them but when you think back it grows on you so you see it again and realize that it is in fact a great film then there is this overrated piece of drek now i will admit it was beautifully filmed but it was so overblown so drawn out that the more i think of it the more i hated it it was unrealistic to the point of just being impossible for me to enjoy the characters with the exception of jack molly brown and thomas andrews were impossible for me to like and therefore care about i know that rose was supposed to be the heroine but she was just a spoiled little rich girl its a shame this tripe won an oscar for best picture,sad
horribly flat characters laughably pathetic dialogue  only the impressive big budget scenery saved this from being a total shipwreck of a movie,sad
i have seen about a million times and i have to say that the movie is a very entertaining and sad drama film james cameron did a wonderful job in being a director and the acting was great i give a 10 out of 10  ,sad
when premiered in 1997 i remember my first reaction to it i was very moved and couldnt remember ever seeing a film on its scale after a bit it seemed everyone agreed with me and i watched as it broke box office records and took the academy awards by storm then something interesting happened very quickly it became fashionable to dislike the film the backlash became very strong i have talked to people who bragged that they never stooped so low as to actually see were the box office receipts just hype did the academy awards bow to the pressure of the money the film earned that seems to the the current opinion no one wants to admit to ever having liked the filmrecently i watched again on dvd i watched it alone so that no one elses reaction would infringe on me my final reaction is simple i loved it i loved it just as i did the first time i saw it everything about the film holds up just as it always did my final opinion is that people who brag about not liking it are bowing to the pressure of negative backlash watch it again see what you think not what your friends think and decide what you think i think youll agree with me,sad
at least not as bad as the english patient but pretty much right there go see a real love story like the lobster instead of this trash,sad
while cameron the director felt a love story interspersed with the human loss would be essential to convey the emotional impact of the disaster both the romance and the disaster failed i loved the first part of the film but my interest quickly lost after the second part beganthe power of the first part of the film lies in its exploration of social class  my heart melted upon seeing how jack attempts to behave like an upperclassman and how rose enjoys jacks company and his surrounding i agree this kind of story sounds clich and the encounter between rose and jack is unlikely but this love story realizes the fairy tale that everyone of us deeply relates and dreams to become truehowever the second part of the film immediately feels fake kitsch superficial and classist it is lengthy and even melodramatic for one thing the most dangerous moment happens probably where cal goes after rose and jack the film abstains from any realistic and profound depiction of deplorable living condition in light of a disaster focusing on rose her family and her love interests the film stages other common people as mere backdrop of the love story of an aristocrat in the end it becomes evident that rose would survive and live a happy life anyway which promptly overshadows the very existence and sacrifice of jack,sad
this is one of the best movie ever made classy direction by james cameron incredible story jack and rose everyone should watch this movie in once in a lifetime,sad
after i have done my research about the all i can say is watching a movie is a story and knowing how it was made and the effort ideas techniques and technologies that was involved in making the movie is completely another storyi was amazed when i read that in order for james cameron to shoot the scene of the real under the water he built a miniature that replicates how the ship looks like under the water the reason the miniature was built was to guide james cameron while shooting under the water even though some scenes of the miniature was used in the film since shooting the real was done using a submarine it was hard for james cameron to move the cameras to get the angles he wanted and it required to move the submarine in ways that it was not capable of doing so they had to attach movable cameras to the body of the submarine which in turn reduced the total available shooting time because of the pressure on the cameras so they had to train everybody who was involved in this shot including the submarine operators using the miniature to utilize the shooting time under the ocean,sad
well 15 years after first seeing this at a second rundollar theatre that i worked at when i was living in jacksonville fl i finally decided to watch again in 3d at the place my movie cinemaworking friend is now employed at once again we experienced the romance between leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet as the latter wants to escape the more controlling billy zane despite the dialogue between them verging on the melodramatic director james cameron also thought up some truly witty lines that especially suited kathy bates as the unsinkable molly brown and yes its still very touching seeing jack and rose willing to stay together during all that chaos as the title ship keeps sinking and how cool is it seeing golden age veteran gloria stuart as the elderly rose recounting how it was during only voyage and not to mention james horners iconic score and while i thought celine dions oscarwinning song my heart will go on was overplayed on top 40 radio stations then i actually enjoyed hearing it again during the end credits though we only stayed through the cast list and of course cameron keeps things exciting enough during the climatic sinking though sometimes i thought he piled it a bit much when he showed a young boy crying just standing there as jack and rose were running it felt a little more contrived than usual though i realized such a scene could have really taken place in summation james camerons is still a very entertaining picture worthy of its oscar status enhanced a bit by the 3d experience though it wasnt really necessary imho,sad
is a sad movie and a love storyi liked the move because its realistic its based on a true story in the beginning of the movie there are some documentaries added you can hear the real rose telling us about the accident there are also very good actors in the moviethe negative with the movie is that they faked with jack he didnt exist in real life they tricked meit was based on a true story it was a good love story and it was realistic the actors were also excellent it was in some scenes very touching,sad
alleged period love story in which the big budget and special effects ultimately win over the human characters the recreation of the era and the enactment of doomed fate are all carefully and meticulously crafted which is the least that can be said about the corny romance between the two principals which feels and looks like a cheap paperback written by an amateur cameron is primarily a hollywood technocrat and his films have never had any great demands on intellectuality as is the case here which on its own merits is still decent pop entertainment that said this has to be the most overrated movie of all time,sad
when i first saw this movie i didnt like it maybe because i was too young to understand itbut when i saw it again a few weeks ago i was blown away the special effects are amazing even after so long ago its still right up their with the rest james cameron has made great movies aliens the terminator2 the abyss and this is one of his bestall the actors do a good job the leading characters a people you want to fallow and you want them to make it its funny to see that the movie only gets a 72 while it made over 18 billion and it won 11 oscars for me its a 10 and 5 starsgreat job cameron and a must see,sad
james cameron as is well known stood firm not long after he finished work on this his most audacious and confrontational film yet even the most casual viewing of begs the question  had he not been lauded would he have kept it real anyway every sequence every shot and practically every moment of this film is so burdened with despair barely concealed rage and a towering disgust with the human race one gets the impression that cameron was barely hanging onto life  and any attendant shreds of hope  by his fingernails although ostensibly an adaptation of one of roger hargreaves most depraved works channeled through the horrifying excesses of the oxfordcambridge boat race with the fascist ruling classes as its authentically vile villains also contains a lot of contemporary criticism  cameron hated the modern world and explained the stomachchurning sinkageisms as a nonetoosubtle attack on the encroaching global domination of the fast food chains the scenes of sexual excess can similarly be read as a despairing attack on the permissive society  those who come to expecting titillation or bmovie sleaze will be sorely disappointed beyond the nihilistic content which has been well documented elsewhere the film has an overall mood that seems to have been engineered to make the viewer thoroughly depressed shot on washedout faded film stock using primarily static cameras long shots choppy editing and very few cutaways has a visual style reminiscent of cinemaverite documentary add to this the unnerving use of big band music piano dirges and the intentionally scrappy postdubbed dialogue and the distancing effect on the viewer is complete comes across as one long primal scream of rage designed to shake the viewer out of his complacency and in this respect the film succeeds unequivocally whether or not you would care to watch this more than once or indeed for entertainment is another matter but is an important film that demands a careful viewing only by those prepared for it,sad
this is a bad film when i say bad i mean it in a whole range of senses just a few of them the fictitious love story is anachronistic exploitative and implausible he gets a monkey suit and gatecrashes the first class the way a modernmoviestyle sex scene is fitted into the film just stinkseven the special effects  so highly praised  are suspect in my book the ship gliding through the water does not look real it is somehow flatthe scene where jack dies in the water is nearly as laughable as the unforgettable death scene in love storyeven calling the ship instead of the is wrongit just goes to show what hype hype and yet more hype can achieve,sad
this movie is sh1t 1 billion dollars worth of sh1t i hope you enjoy your billion dollar sh1tmorons people are dying of diseases you cant pronounce and thissh1tmade 1 billion dollars im going to kill myselfsh1t10 lines of text 10 lines of text 10 lines of text 110 lines of text 10 lines of text 10 lines of text 1000000000 worth of sh1t10 lines of text 10 lines of text i hate this movie this movie is crapdont worry about how many lines of text there areits okjust dont see this moviepooppee,sad
questionis this site full of earlyteen boys with middle class anger issues who raise their hoodies when they meet up down the rec and highfive that theyve stuck the proverbials up at the establishment they too will quickly join when leaving skool come on seriouslythis film was a masterful tug of the emotions its the equal of the best epic tearjerker perhaps they should constrain people whove not lived and loved to only vote for kiddie filmserrlike sin city i rest my  experienced and objective  case  ,sad
the film could have very easily been as big a tragedy as the ship a threehourplus period piece that couldnt make its original release date july 1997 and still ranks as the most expensive film of all time seemed certain to sink when it was finally released in december of 1997 its opening weekend was unremarkable it barely reached the top of the box office and made just 10 of its budget back in that first 3 days but then something amazing happened wordofmouth has never been more explosive than in the case of for four straight months the film dominated the worlds box office as audiences everywhere young and old male and female were swept up by a perfect juxtaposition of adventure and romance by breaking every box office record and sweeping the academy awards was bound to garner a backlash which may explain why many people seem to write this film off but try to remember the first time you saw that cgi iceberg hitting the deck before the celines theme song saturated the radio or leos face covered the magazines and you have to agree that is truly breathtaking,sad
though the script leaves something to be desired the use of color and music and cinematography all combine together to provoke wonder and emotion of every kind throughout the film james camerons direction led this movie to become visually astounding but also emotionally heartfelt through the actors and the musicfrom the first scenes of the eerie wreck to the grand hopeful life of the ship to its painful horrifying conclusion it is obvious that this movie contains nothing but cinematic beautyas far as the actors go i personally think that all around the cast did a good job i thought dicaprio was the weakest but winslet was extraordinary but the actors had a lot to work against because the script was so tried the story is a simple love story unoriginal but still effective and entertaining if anything is to blame in the movie it is not the acting it is the scriptthe music and no i am not talking about the celine dion song was one of the best scores in years it was fitting and emotionallyintouch with the film itself is about pain sorrow hope love excitement beauty grief peril courage tragedy romance and so much more and it does all of these well with excellent music striking visuals great use of color epic cinematography and intimate acting is simply brilliant the reason why it is so hated by some and loved by others today is because was so popular and successful when it came out that naturally some people hate it just for that like any popular fad will stand the test of time after all with a combination of the most oscar nominations and wins i dont think anyone can fairly call this movie bad the movies music visuals use of color cinematography and acting is simply incredible in short it is flawlessly crafted intelligently constructed strongly acted and spellbinding its quite possible that is one of the greatest romantic epics ever filmed  entertainment weekly,sad
is one of those films that you love to hate but honestly there is no reason for hating this movie yes the movie is long yes is commercial yes is an oscar movie and so what is a movie done with a lot of spirit with energy a magnificent movie leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet were amazing and look where they are now they are two of the best performers of our generation and all the supporting members of the cast kathy bates frances fisher billy zane  are respected actors that have given the world great performances james cameron had the vision and knew exactly who was right for the roles and in that same way he did the hole movie the songs the score the make up everything is where it belongs is a great movie that only future generation are going to appreciate the way it should be is one of the most amazing shows that has ever exist in the story of the cinema the script is good the direction is wonderful and the hole movie is majestic 10  10,sad
ok so everyone knows the story of boat hits an iceberg many perish this movie is an amazingly well done movie although many bloopers the acting and graphics are outstandingleonardo dicaprio in my eyes one of the most amazing actors on this planet when i first saw this movie it made me cry like there was no tomorrow kate winslet and leos love really blossom throughout the movie amazingkate winslet im very upset she didnt not receive best actress for this movie i really think she deserved it extremely convincing she is a very beautiful person and a perfect match to play a rich girl trying to break freeyes i have seen about 100 parodies of this movie and rightly so that what you get for doing a movie in the 90s it may come across as cheesy to some people but to me the total opposite we need to look past the cheezeyness and realize how these people really made it feel like we witnessed the horrible tragedy that is the,sad
this movie make you crymake you happymake you proud and wake your mind up to admit this the best movie ever seen in your lifecameron make an unforgettable movie in his careerbetter than aliens and true liesdicaprio and winslet play their exciting acting and very good chemistryno one would deny it the special effects are greatcinematography is beautifulart direction is outstandingscore is wow no woman doesnt cry after see the ending this movie was very recommended11 oscars and over 18 million dollars global gross is guaranteefeel the movie sensation and never think youre a moviegoers if you dont say this movie was greatbelieve me  1010,sad
i am simply amazed that such a popular beloved critically and audience acclaimed film favorite as could sink so unseemly in the minds of so many who shelled out heavy sums of money and lauded it heavily at the time of its tremendous popularity while is hardly as fresh riveting and entertaining as it was when i first viewed it several years ago it still certainly retains a special distinction in the realm of cinema at least in my assessment perhaps the screenplay is overly blase full of clichs and historical blunders and the spectacle and sheer horror of seeing hundreds plummet to the bottom of the atlantic is not as harrowing as it seemed in theaters yet is still a fine worthy and sensational cinematic triumph technical aspects its impeccable mix of sound and visual effects dramatic and potent musical score detract the obsolete my heart will go on ingenious costume design absorbing cinematography and of course the gorgeous stupendous design of the ship still stand well above many efforts in cinematic history today and are plenty appreciated and admired the romance between rose and jack is perhaps the most clich and nauseating aspect of the film which despite the films perception as being extremely overrated might be primary detractor and that would be fully understandable if these same critics werent the ones who rushed to the cinemas to embrace the romance in the film overall is a leviathon of a film boasting popularity and critical acclaim and some really brilliant cinematic aspects where it somewhat lacks in the script and the romance i have probably viewed over 100 times and though its value and enticement has been compromised through numerous viewings it still retains a laudable important distinction as providing both rocksolid entertainment and brilliant cinematic quality and these features are too complimentary for such a film as to sink through history 12 out of ,sad
this movie was way too long i have seen leonardo dicaprio do better acting when he was a kid on growing pains there were so many unbelievable plots in this movie why would people bring guns on a ship and shoot people there are so many unanswered questions in this movie why were the rich people so mean and snobby this movie won eleven oscars 1997 must have been a very bad year for movies who did the extensive research for this movie how do they know what happened on the very few people if any that were on that ship are alive today most of the actors did a very good job however  i havent seen many of them in other movies the ship did look luxurious for 1912,sad
is easily the best movie ever madesurpassing all the great films of yesteryear director james cameron proves in this film just why theres only one james cameron this film is so good that i hesitate to call it a movieits an experiencea very emotional experienceanyone who wasnt emotionally moved by this movie must really be emotionless hearing celine dion humming the song towards the end of the movie just added to the emotion to describe the people who hate this movie i can say thisyou could give these people a brand new bmw m3 and they will find faults with itthat is what happens with a film as brilliant as thiskate winslet and leonard decaprio are in top form and deliver a performace straight from heaven i dont know how they did it butwow this film is just something else thank you james cameron for making this film and thank you to all the people who love this movietrust methere are lots of major fans out there of this film,sad
ive looked back through the other comments posted here and cant believe i saw the same film some of these disgruntled critics are talking about whats so wrong about telling a love story against the background of a reallife historical event since when is there a restriction on poetic license get real is an extremely impressive movie from every standpoint in recreating an actual ship disaster that took more than a thousand lives told in a flashback technique it focuses mainly on jack and rose and their unlikely meeting when she attempts suicidebut also draws in a number of other characters that are equally well integrated into the plot the class distinction that existed then and now is shown with claritymaking complaints from previous commentators meaningless when they say that the film doesnt even deal with this factor the snobbery was there and is most fully exposed in the depiction of roses classconscious mother will go down as one of the greatest recreations of an actual event ever attempted on screenmasterful in all departments the performances from leads to bit players are uniformly excellentbut no one has given enough credit to billy zane hes the perfect villain and plays his juicy role with incredible skill and zest all those protesting that this film is a disaster are simply mouthing hollow words all sound and fury signifying nothing if its cool to knock this movie so be it but their appraisal of it is far from the truth and they are quite clearly in denialthe jackrose love affair is the weakest development in the script but at least it does point up the class distinction that played a large part in this human tragedy,sad
ok here are some of the reasons this movie receives so much negative feedback1  people are very jealous of the fact that a seemingly little twerp of a human leo d has all the glamour and fame that comes with being in a bigbudget movie like2  people also hate movies that force them to think about what is going on or feel emotions during the film3  people are just mad that they dont have a meaningful life and the will downplay anything that does have meaningi would like to see those who badmouthed this gem of a film even try to come up with a meaningful story line because according to them the movie did not have oneone of the reasons this movie made so much money at the box office was the fact that it appealed to the masses the teenagers had leo and kate to stare at for 3 hours the elderly people have the emotion and the memories of the tragedy the terminator 2 lovers had the special effects of a huge ship sinkinganother reason this movie did so well was the fact that it received so much repeat business people felt something when they saw this movie and thats what brought them back and pay for another ticket a movie that can do that is a very rare treat and does not come around very often,sad
james camerons is a masterpiece this is a brilliant film from start to finish its exciting romantic and never boring im usually not a fan of movies that run over 3 hours long but this is arguably my favorite 3 hour plus movie because it goes by fast a year before this movie came out cbs aired their twopart movie based on the 1912 sinking of the ship that was dubbed unsinkable it was ok but the 1997 theatrical film made the tv version look real flat by comparison ive always had a fascination with the disaster and this movie presents its depiction of the doomed ship in a frightening way when i saw this movie the first time at times i felt like i was on the its that good splendid acting remarkable special effects and masterful storytelling this is a movie that ill never forget out of four,sad
well im a star wars fan so naturally im going to hate yep i gave it a 1 out of 10 all i have to say is rerelease in theaters for its 20th anniversary and well see if can make 130 million dollars in that run alone like the star wars special edition did that willwill not have a lot to say about the longterm value of this epic,sad
looking at other viewers comments i see someone called this the greatest motion picture of all time   in capitals no less  although i wish i had roses wardrobe hanging in my closet and i thought the detail was exquisite i have to firmly disagree  the script of this film is one of the dullest sappiest and most uninspired i have seen while kate winslet and leonardo dicaprio are both talented thespians these cardboard characters leave them few options  the patter between jack and rose do you trust me i trust you you have to trust me rose etc and the melodrama made the length of the film unbearable  i have heard this film referred to as epic  if you want to see  a real epic rent lawrence of arabia instead  it knocks the socks off ofreal acting believeable gunplay taught emotionalism and a powerhouse performance by the incomparable peter otoole,sad
one of the worst movies ever made yet one of the largst budget ones a cheesy love story no effects worth mentioning except for one where the boat sinks there is one surprise in the movie  the boat sinks could anyone have guessed it awful soundtrack there is absolutely no need to see it,sad
whats there in this movie to make it deserve 11 oscars i mean it has grand sets great soundtrack so those awards r ok but then 11 oscars ,sad
ruined what could have been a very good film  every time we are drawn into the mood we are forced out with a ridiculous statement from one of the characters  the best such example is when jack and rose are together reaching to hold on to the railing in what could have been a beautiful symbolic moment but no rose says this is where we first met in a cheesy little voice  moment gone  killed by stating the obvious,sad
like i said not a bad movie but i just couldnt wait for the ship to sink,sad
definetly not one of the best movies ever two hours and nothing happens,sad
this movie had so much potential and yet it was wasted it was wasted on a pointless madeup love story that only prepubescent teens and emotionally immature adults would enjoy its completely disrespectful to the actual tragedy and its victims just because the movie made a lot of money does not reflect the quality of it someone should redo the film without a james cameron or michael bay perspective,sad
i simply hate this movie like pearl harbor it takes a lifeworld changing historical event and waxes it with stupid unnecessary pukey love stories,sad
the movie is so historically inaccurate that it should be considered a satire its extremely disappointing and the acting is subpar hopefully theyll do a remake of an actual story that occurred on the,sad
james definately hit the mark on this to me the love story which is superb takes a backseat to the chaos and variety of ways people would have behaved in it,sad
review was written so poorly by james cameron that it felt like a comedy i dont want to be rude or anything but it was just so horribly written that i couldnt anything in it seriously including the sinking and i might have bin laughing dont take me for a nasty person its james camerons fault one part that really annoyed me was the fact that cameron tried to makes us cry and be dramatic by sticking a dead baby in the water it made me say what are you trying to do james i mean he was purposely trying to be dramatic and when you do that it fails it failed for me it was just a dumb thing to do and i really thought it was a horrible movie if you think the screenplay in this movie was good then you really need a doctor,sad
from 1997 is a wonderful movie it really is for me its such a guilty pleasure because even though its good it is definitely clichd and the love story in it is so ridiculous but how can you not love this film this movie has everything violence nudity sex a love story romance disaster and special effects the story line is pretty simple its about the the unsinkable biggest ship in the world at the time on the morning of april 15 1912 it hits an iceberg in the north atlantic and sinks to the bottom of the ocean in less than three hours over 1000 of the 2000 passengers on board are killed pretty simple right well to add to the drama theres a love story involved rose dewitt bukater played by kate winslet is a wealthy young heir who is engaged to the handsome and rich but arrogant and controlling cal hockley played by billy zane one night she decides to try and commit suicide by jumping off the boat a poor loner named jack dawson played by leonardo dicaprio sees what shes about to do and coerces her into aborting her decision as shes climbing back over the railing she slips and nearly falls into the icy ocean jack grabs her arm and pulls her to safety but two of the ships crewmen hear her screaming and come to her aid they see jack on top of rose and think he has done something awful to her he is about to be punished until rose convinces cal her fianc that jack was only saving her after she slipped while looking at the propellers and from then on jack is infatuated with rose she has stolen his heart even though jack has no money and no ambitions rose cant help but fall equally in love with him he is sweet and charming after a sweaty fling in a car at the bottom of the ship the couple go up on deck and embrace it is then that they see the iceberg and the ship hits itthe first hour of the film focuses on the budding romance between jack and rose it is somewhat entertaining but for me the real entertaining part of the film was the second half which focuses on how the ship sank after hitting the iceberg there are plenty of breathtaking special effects and of course you have to have a clichd out of place scene mixed in with it including roses fianc cal shooting a round of bullets at jack and rose after seeing the two kiss and hug but then again its kind of exciting to watch these scenes because they make you think oh my god these events are happening while the ship is sinking this movie was very sappy at times but it is still a great film to watch this movie will make you cry laugh and keep you on the edge of your seat all at once there are moments where you will get bored with the love story but its worth sitting through to see the carnage of the ship sinking im glad this film was a hit it is definitely one of the greatest films ever made and its so hard not to love it all the actors did fine jobs im glad i have this movie in my collection thanks for reading my review   ,sad
is probably the worst movie ive ever seen now dont get me wrong i thought the special fx were great but the acting was cheesy and laughable i laughed in this movie so much from the horrible acting and sappy cheesy dialouge the lenghth of the movie was crazy it dragged on and on i actually fell asleep the music wasnt so great either that crappy celine dion song adds to the cheesinest this movie also won waaaaaaaaaay to many awards then it deserved it deserved all the technical and special fx awards but the other ones no pretty good cast kate winslets a babe  i wish mystery science theater 3000 would have made fun of this movie it would have been a great episode,sad
the acting and the screenplay were horrible and dicaprio sucked so badly dang my brain hurts just thinking about how much this really really really sucked its the worst movie ive ever seen except for batman begins that is oohhh god this really really sucked and i hated this so much i saw it one time and then i got it as a gift on dvd well guess what i burned the dvd jesus this is definitely the worst movie ever to disgrace the freaking planet i wish the entire crew had blown up in some fuel explosion accident dicaprio should be dicapitated also the romance was so stiff and the dialogue was so horrid that i cringe just thinking of a single line why doesnt everyone who worked on this film get lined up and shot i mean seriously how can someone make a movie this bad,sad
what happened how could the father of terminator and the guy who made a brilliant sequel to the alien direct this sentimental and poorly acted piece of trash thres no argue about the special effects  theyre excellent and its ok to show a tragic story like that but why put a dumb love story in front of it its modern versions of romeo and juliette like this that made the original story stereotypical theyre just too manyand whats with the casting first of all theres dicaprio  oh boy second of all there kate winslet  shes a good actress but all the time i thought that rose was like 20somethingm and then i find out that she was 17 excuse me but kate winlset couldnt possibly pass for 17 she didnt look like 17 at all therere plenty of other good actresses who could be 17 back then take natalie portman shes both talented and very beautifulits disappointing to see what james cameron did this timei give it a 3 for the visuals,sad
the perfect disaster movie just think about all those movies that have great effects and then try and through in a love story then think of which is first and for most a love story surrounded by amazing effects sure the movie isnt perfect the dialogue could have been a little better the movie starts a little slow but then at some point you are drawn in and the characters become real and the terror they face becomes real by the end when rose dies and meets jack on the staircase and everyone cheers it is impossible not to feel sad this movie could had been horrible but it pulls it off it was a real risk to make and it worked wonderfully the reason this movie works is hard to describe maybe its the slow beginning that does it we start to forget that this ship is destine to sink and just watch what is on screen then when they finally do hit the ice berg the viewer feels that this is an interesting plot turn rather than the payoff the movie has been building to,sad
this is an excellent movie if you are trying to go to sleep  the real ship took much less than three hours to sink  why suffer through over three and a half in a remake  the movie travels slow and seems to take forever to get to the next scene  so much of the dialoge has nothing to do with the plot line of the movie and the rest of it just repeats what the audience already knows  the love story is very typical of every movie and offers no difference to any other love story out of hollywood these days  it has a very cookie cutter story line  as for the acting of dicaprio if his character was supposed to be so sappy and pathetic you just wanted to pull him out of the movie and give him a good flogging then he did a wonderful job  however i seriously doubt that it was intentional in any way,sad
an appalling galling spectacle and slapdash mix of effects melodrama and romance is utterly misguided shamefully populist and hoist by its own focus group petard this is not showmanship of the grandiose and warm kind of a selznick it is the cold mechanical assemblage feat of a bragging cameron it is far from unique and much in the usual hollywood action vein with undramatic noisiness prosaic lighting and faceless actingeven our kate cant save it the busty miss winslet puts a bit more presence into things initially but she cant truly work within the confines of such a dire nonentity of a script her rose just becomes irritating and strained in effect as the film wears painfully on di caprio is awful a rubbery glib little presence who increases the quotient of dull artifice  that this film is already unduly well stocked with indeed this film may as well not have included any actors as cameron seems so entirely disinterested in them for all the pretence of this being a human story there is precious little humanity in this film an outofplace love story suffices actors like bernard hill are left adrift with little to convey  even in a film stretching past three hours a problem is that the effects are flashy and thoroughly incongruous to any image of the historical event crucially there is no dignity to this film where it should have used gavin bryars poignant cavernous driftwoodepic soundscape the sinking of the for its score instead we have james horners parodic cliched john williamsesque bluster and blandness telegraphing every emotion and example of pyrotechnics its an awful score instilling a very familiar action moviemoronic ethos this sense of the events being sold short comes across equally in di caprios pipsqueak playing and winslets rather ungainly starry turnhow much better would the historical events have been served by bryars music dignified still and unusual camera placements and a depersonalized sad grandeur a semidocumentary in grainy mournful black and white would far better suit this subject think wisconsin death trip and youll be understand in part how i envisage it i want to shut this awful james cameron white elephant out of my mind and let a more graceful film play thererating ,sad
i am disgusted with this movie firstly i admit that the special effects are extra ordinary but what would you expect of james cameron terminator and aliens speak for themselves and when it comes to movie making mr cameron certainly ranks in the top 10 of current film directors thus being based on historical events the special effects cannot save this movie because how more earth shattering can a sinking ship be than well a sinking ship what really made my mouth bitter was the vacuous script i got the idea that mr cameron enlisted the help of all the daytime tvsoap writers to write the most vapid script ever it would have been appropriate if the movie was released with written boards which states at 30 minutes cry et al  the thing is this is a just add water script literally it is so innocuous that one can place it on any setting even sabrina the teenage witch unfortunately i disagree with the fact that this movie had broad appeal if you take into account the general sample of viewers on this board have seen the movie in excess of 5 times in the cinema it whittles down the number of actual viewers considerably furthermore with the current crop of cinematic wonders being released it is obvious that directors do not need to underestimate their audience as they are more intelligent than they get credit for case in point the name change of harry potter and the philosophers stone to harry potter and the sorcerers stone so that american audiences would know what it is about instead of dumbing down audiences directors should inspire audiences to understand the world better  i truly believe that will over the next 5 years be push down the list of greatest movies to the bottom 50 as the egeneration likes more mental challenges written sign clap here,sad
this movie is absolute garbage from beginning to end i lost all respect for james cameron after this i cant believe anyone would rate this movie high at least 3000 people with sense including myself have rated this as 1 awful a trite story bad acting a bad script and a horrible performance from dicraprio and winslet to those who accuse people who rate low of not rating this movie honestly i question whether you have rated this movie honestly if people were honest with themselves and werent drawn in by the hype of this movie they would rate this no higher than a 6 by the waythe mpaa rated this a pg13 female frontal nudity hello did the person who rated this take a bathroom break during the part when kate took her clothes off granted kate winslet nude is about as attractive as that ugly nude granny in the shining at least they still had enough sense in the 70s to give that one an r rating,sad
this movie was boring and a complete waste of time instead of spending more time about the ship they wasted the movie with some stupid dumb love story this movie was pointless dull and a waste of 3 hours and 14 minutes of my life this is for everyone who hasent seen yet dont waste your time overall 110,sad
the only thing i got from this movie was a frightful headachethey couldve made it one tape and it wouldve been good but they had to drag the stupid storywhich wasnt much of oneout watch the first tapebut forget the last oneits really not worth the headache youll more than likely get the stupid flashing lights really get to you after the first time you see thembut after the second you want to scream and then they have to drag the sinking ship out for one whole tapereally a dumb movie and i dont know why everyone raved about it unless they liked staring at kates boobsthats the only thing i can figureand the old women was really stupid leos acting really stunkand it seems to me they couldnt make up their mind on the millionares role in the whole dumb movieif he so cared about himself he wouldve forgot about the slut and left really a stupid movieone word describes it welldumb,sad
ok i was forced i should not have submitted and realised the messenger spoke with forked tounge expletives of animal toilet habits will not suffice james cameron if you read this please be aware that this is junk aliens 2 was great but this takes the cake in sick inducing nonsense in a historical retelling even u571 pulled it off better and they brazenly lied nope sorry if ihad a choice between watching this again and malaria the malaria will win hands down billy zane how could you,sad
i dont know what idea of great movies does the academy have movies like this one are about the same soap opera story that we have always seen in tv for years with the only difference of good special effects nothing else the oscar shouldnt be given to movies like this but to innovative way to tell stories and for sure is not one of those,sad
i thought this movie extremely disappointing the characters were not very motivating and the acting was horrible  i was not convinced of their roles at all  the story line was also very poor and unrealistic  i would not recommend this movie to anyone instead i suggest the older version made in 1953 although it isnt recent the story is very moving and the ending quite touching,sad
the most overblown pathetically schmaltzy waste of money to come out of hollywood kate winslet was tolerable but she has done better so many times billy zane was unconvincing as the baddie it takes more than a raised eyebrow to convey malice bill speaking of bills bill paxtoni just cant think of any suitable adjectives for his role but all the ones i cant think of are not compliments ok kathy bates is likeable but overacted as molly brown and not as much fun as debbie reynolds 1964 version de caprio should have been decapitated i loved him in basketball diaries and baz luhrmanns romeojuliet but i could not take him seriously as an impoverished artist and it was all i could do not to stand up and scream push that damned fringe out of your eyestoo much money an egomaniac directing and a storybynumbers poor boy meets rich girl about to marry rich thug followed by disaster that tests everyones humanity  followed by audience throwing up shows just how awful hollywood can be when it tries i wanted them all to drown sorry if i sound like sourpuss but i hated this film like i have never hated anotherthe only thing worse was james cameron getting an oscar for this drivel having the audacity to call for a minutes silence for those who drowned after he made millions out of them and then hooting king of the world,sad
i apologise to all or any who read this is a muchloved modern classic and considered a masterpiece of cinema but to me it is just a piece of 3 hour cameron twaddle with no heart that will go on and cringeworthy on many levels yes the visuals are striking the cast is impressive and cameron knows how to make a big movie but the details are so dreadful in their error it brings the experience down for those who have a brain from some of the clothes to a lot of the surroundings and equipment note in 1912 hand lamps had yellow bulbs not white and then to the biggest joke of the lot those involved who spend their time on screen running through rising water on the sinking ship whilst being shot at do not seem to be bothered that the water is really rather effing cold as in freezing cold hypothermiainducing freezing cold this small point doesnt seem to be of interest until leonardo crappio buys it when hes not allowed to share the debris flotilla that winslet has selfishly claimed and by the way people over 1500 innocent people died in a horrendous way that night including women and children yet we are supposed to feel all boohoo when crappio buys it and they say romance is dead think carefully folks,sad
is a fictional take on the tragic maiden voyage of the rms the events of the ill fated journey of the ship is told in the midst of a beautiful love story between two people of differing social backgrounds  how they overcome all odds to be together jack dawsonleonardo dicaprio is a man who boarded the by chance it was a gamble which had a third class ticket to the at stake rose dewitt bukaterkate winslet is a woman of the royal family she is one of the first few people who got a first class ticket for the very first voyage of the along with other famous wealthy  important people so it was fate  fate alone that brought jack  rose together this is the synopsis of the moviethis is my review of the new 3d version of that released in 2012 first off what a beautiful story sure its predictable but the way in which its written ensures that you dont get bored even for a single second the way that jack  rose fall in love is one of the highlights of the movie leonardo dicaprio  kate winslet share great chemistry together not to mention that theyve acted brilliantly both oscar worthy performances unfortunately only kate winslet won the award for best actress the supporting characters are impressive as well the way theyve shown how the ship first hits the iceberg starts flooding tilts at a 180 degree angle  finally snaps into two makes the movie all this looks even better in 3d the best conversion from 2d to 3d ever so grab your 3d glasses popcorn  soft drink  be prepared to witness a once in a lifetime experience all over again james cameron take a bow a must watch,sad
this is not to say that this movie is terrible it does have a good story line and it is a good romantic movie as a guy i do refer to it as a chick flick but that does not necessarily mean something badthe problems with this movie1 too long it could have had at least an hour taken out of it with creative editing2 the boat sinking that scene did not need to be dragged out for so long 3 the celine dion song too muchthis movie was mediocre i do not think it deserved the amount of press it received this is especially true when you look at how often people then had to throw the word around the following year,sad
james camerons is one of the best movies ive ever seen the costof this movie was 285 millin and a 18 billion  at the box office russell carpenters cinematography conrad buffs richard harris and camerons editing camerons direction peter lamonts set design deborah l scotts costumes digital domains visual effects and james horners score amazing as the title reveres to the story takes place in the grandest ship of its time an american boy jack dawson leonardo dicaprio and his friend fabrizio win a ticket in a poker to go to america with shortly after the launch jack sees rose dewittbukater kate winslet a spoiled girl engaged to caledon hockley billy zane a man of big wealth later that night jack saves roses life the rest is history,sad
ok seriously this film chewsblandboorishstaledulleffortlessskip it see a decent film insteadjust brutaland clearly the moment in time when leo jumped the sharkon the other hand   the film could be used to torture prisoners of waralways a silver lining,sad
as much as i wish i could hide the fact that i saw thisthingthat passed for a movie i just cant  proved that james cameron should never try a movie with depth or plot or a good script because this effort failed miserably  it will be a cold day in hell before i ever admit this movie deserved any of the academy awards it got especially considering its competition  la confidentialone of the best movies ever  good will huntingan excellent movie  as good as it getsvery funny and well writtena boat  the awards it got are the reasons that i no longer respect the academy of motion picture arts and sciences  anyone who thinks that the lead actors in this movie were good well all i can say is especially if youre a guy i feel sorry for you  an unoriginal story poor poorly acted and far beyond any reasonable budget the success of this movie really is beyond me  i dont think it would hurt mr james im king of the world cameron to refund my matinee ticket price,sad
bad script with a plot patched together from the earlier films bad performances  special effects unimpressive  sets no better than the ones in the far superior a night to remember  a theme song capable of stripping the enamel off your teeth  this movie sucks  one can only conclude that anyone who really loves films will hate it,sad
there are few films that elicit in me such passionate loathing as this piece of utter rubbish this is lacking in practically everything that ought to be in a movie no aliens no graphic scenes of cannibalism no serial killers monsters spawned by nuclear power special effects obviously made from random objects found in the directors office or surrealistic body horror also no werewolves i suppose the title should have given me a warning it doesnt contain the phrases blood invasion of the cannibal walks among us massacre  meets frankenstein or from outer space all of which are generally good indicators of quality cinema its also filmed in this weird artificial style which i hate mainstream cinema fans might like this style i prefer my films to look like they were made in someones garage back in the 70s and then theres that awful theme song if you want a good movie theme song listen to surfing dead by the cramps the theme from return of the living dead by one of the finest bands in history there is absolutely no reason to watch this it essentially summarizes why i only watch bmovies you could probably make 100 bmovies with this budget and all of them would be more interesting just watch the astrozombies instead now thats a good movie cameron has sunk far from his days doing special effects on galaxy of terror his best work by far who could forget the infamous worm scene also does anyone else think that decaprio looks like a giant hairless squirrel,sad
so this is the master of filmmaking james cameron yep hes back when you hear about a movie i would think it would be around 80 minutes but we have a 2 hour plus running time with an old woman telling about does everything seriously have to be melodramatic this is honestly the least we actually care about the characters when they are dying than michael bay movies and based on the script theyre easily mistakable yes you read that right james cameron can make an abomination ok the plot we have jack and rose theyre very different people and theyre on they start seeing each other and then the iceberg hits and it sinks ok now with that anyone can type up a 1 hour script with the same story but what we actually have is 3 hours the iceberg doesnt come on until the 2 hour mark oh what a pity we have characters which youd be bored with them by the hour mark ok flaws how exactly did the lifeboat return and if someone can answer this then why did it come back for rose is that it now the music score im actually surprise the soundtrack was more than my heart will go on now with these people digging up we have an 85 year old survivor telling the story in excruciating detail now i know how the kids from how i met your mother feel but this is all melodramatic how i met your mother is not so you actually care about the characters in some fictional show rather than this abomination people call filmif you want a good version to my heart will go on try the rock version it might serve good places in this movie,sad
okay i really dont understand what teenage girls see in this awful movie anywayfirst of all rose is nothing more than an overweight selfish insecure suicidal bratty girl looking for attentionshe is engaged to a proper gentlemen cal who is wealthy and can save roses familyinstead of thinking about her family rose becomes selfish and undresses for a penniless artist jacki really dont see what all the fuss is aboutcal was right to slap her in the facethe movie is completely awful there really isnt any point to this nonsensei was hoping that rose would have jumped off of the ship that why the audience wouldnt have to endure three hours of her constant whiningthis movie is just plain terrible even though i saw it on television thats three hours ill never get back overrated and pretentious i didnt care one bit about anyone on the dreaded skip and find a much better movie than this turkey,sad
titanicone of my best favorite movie of all timesi watched the movie so many timesthat i couldnt count it anymore i just love the moviei like the love story of iti can watch the movie over and over and over againi just cant get over iti find it very sweetromanticbut yet very sadi like every part of itfrom beginning till the endjack and rose never left each other no matter what they stick togetherbut the thing i hate bout it jack diedthats the only part i didnt like its too sadbut other than thatits the best its very touching storyevery time i watch iti feel like im part of it or somethingi find it very goodi got nothing else to say bout itbut it is the best,sad
this is a film that has everything from the undying love between rose and jack to the devastating historical reenactment of the tragedy that overcame the on its voyage it has it all the romance of these starcrossed lovers cannot help but touch the hearts of all who watch james cameron did a fantastic job on this masterpiece the costumes were beautiful the acting took you back in time to the beginning of the 20th century i urge anyone who likes films in any way to see this heart touching piece it is stirring to the soul so unplug the phone put in the movie curl up on the couch and prepare to be amazed this is a motion picture not to be missed,sad
if you like really really bad acting then this enormously boring film is just the film for you the plot is tedious and obvious the film technique makes it difficult to tell what the special effects are  this is achieved by making everything look as if it is a badly executed special effect you could cut two and a half hours from this film and though it still wouldnt be any good it would be a lot less bad,sad
spoiler alertspoiler alertthe greatest epic ever the love story of the centuryblaa blaa blaais completely overrated film from james the terminator cameron it tells the love story of rose and jack whose love is doomed yep youve guessed it because they are from different social classes who hard was that to guess they still try to make it happen and their hearts will go on for too long you just wish that the legendary iceberg would hit the damn boat so you dont have to hear this everlasting dialogue which has nothing to do with sex as you might think of its simplicityjackrosejackrosethe film doesnt completely stink only the most of it the love story is as fascinating as toilet paper after rainin few words overdramatic overrated,sad
yes i have seen this film and it was a plasticpathetic semilovestory the only things worth seeing are the computer animations but ive seen better i more lowbudget movies the three hours the film lasts seem to go on forever and ever i wouldnt recommend anyone to go and see it youll just loose three hours of your life you could spend picking your teeth or anything thats more interesting,sad
this is an extremely trite and boring movie the acting was much too melodramatic and although it had astounding special effects i can not believe that they marketed it so much to the point where there was no escaping from it the terrible marketing made a bad movie worse and i have only seen it once jan 11 2000 it was my first and last time watching a movie where i sit through 3 hours of bad acting and then watch the boat sink terrible and highly overrated,sad
i cant understand why this movie is so big was the american public asking itself well i love cliched tragic love stories and i love cliched stories with lots of water in them why cant they combine the cliches of tragic love and water into one bloated overblown blockbusteri myself never pondered this question and thus i did not enjoy,sad
i really enjoyed this movie its definitely worth the ticket price the movie does a great job showing what life was like on the the actors even looked like the people they were playing another thing i liked was the scene where the little boy is spinning a top on the deck its from a famous picture taken aboard the ship the actor who played captain edward j smith did an awesome job thats a very important role in the story of the i quite a few people went to see this movie just because leonardo decaprio is in it i was not one of those people ive been reading about this ship since third grade and when my dad offered to take me to see it i couldnt pass up the offer any buff should see this movie its the best depiction of the illfated maiden voyage ive ever seen,sad
a good movie but whoever made up this story did not try to make it the least bit believable who would actually believe that the worlds biggest ship would sink because it hit an iceberg its just not realistic and the name what does that even mean what idiot thought it was a fitting name for a giant fictional ship all around just a bad movie and too long,sad
the most egregious aspect of this overblown cinematic vessel is not the cloying dick and jane script the vulgar modernday prologue the primitive cgi effects painfully obvious on the big screen even in 1997 the fact that dicaprio looks like a thirteen year old who hasnt yet reached puberty or the unfathomable eleven oscars it snaredno the true crime here is that the perfect movie about the sinking of the had been fashioned four decades earlier in a night to remember which managed to break your heart with the genuine passenger list in its genuine predicament the tragedy of the sinking and the core of the 1958 film is the arrogance of the masters of industry who propelled the industrial revolution this was history there was no need for a fictional plot no blue diamond no celine dion no cartoon villains with twirling mustaches no frances fisher spinning the same holierthanthou act shes still doing on the hallmark channel and no 250 million budgetwatch a night to remember then curse james cameron for rightly assuming that modernday audiences have no memory of their own cinematic heritage,sad
this was a really difficult movie and not for your average movie goer im surprised its had the success its had at the box office because this movie is a thinker i thought this was suppose to reimagine what 3d in the movies would be like with new worlds with animals flying and blue people connected to everything i missed all of that all this is is about the boat and i didnt finish it but it seems like it was just an excuse to look at leo and kate kiss each other nice soundtrack through,sad
if you watched this movie on blueray you know why i give it 5star,sad
garbage film leos career will never be the same absolute tripe,sad
first of its kind to cross the magical one billion dollar frontier of admission splendour to audiences around the world starting from middecember 1997 when writer producer director james cameron unleashes the ultimate sacrificing love story portrayed by academyaward winning actors kate winslet the reader 2008 and leonardo dicaprio the revenant 2015 on the infamous liverpool cruiseliner ship sinking on april 12th 1912 into the atlantic ocean due to hitting a toolate foreseen iceberg collision as director cameron holding all the strings over splendid cinematography with over lapping onhand liveaction footage in an 200milliondollar production the first of its kind coming in with an approximately 222 billion us dollar in box office revenue in spring 1998 after winning eleven academyawards at the oscars accept recognizing supporting acting bliss by katy bates billy zane and bernard hill as the legendary ships captain,sad
i have a personal reason for disliking the grand epic that swept eleven academy awards but for the purposes of this review ill remain as impartial as possible it wont do anyone any good to know that watching this film on the big screen as a child resulted in lifelong hydrophobiafrom an artistic standpoint this movie is flawless the research and replication of the illfated rms resulted in an identical duplication peter lamonts production design michael fords set decoration and martin laing and charles lees art direction is breathtaking if you spend the entire three hours starting at minute details like dishes wallpaper and chandeliers youll feel like youre really aboard the ship the beautiful fashions designed by deborah lynn scott are authentic looking and gorgeous most of the movie is very beautiful to watch including the famous dissolve from ruin to reconstruction in the beginningthis wasnt the first movie about the and this versions storyline isnt very interesting kate winslet stars as a highclass lady travelling with her mother frances fisher and her fianc billy zane she meets a lowclass american leonardo dicaprio who won his passage in a card game and he shows her how to really live and fall in love parts of the story are rather weak and feel like they belong in a disney movie rather than a dramatic epic but im sure the love story will please youngminded teenagersthe beginning of the film recreates finding the remnants of the at the bottom of the ocean and a very old woman gloria stuart tells her memory of the voyage there are a few cuts back and forth from glorias story to the 1912 timeline but once the iceberg is hit the rest of the film is shown in realtime which is an interesting touch and a great feat accomplished by director james cameron and his coeditors conrad buff and richard a harris however during the last portion of the film there are a few flaws that arent hard to catch the most obvious being a lack of foam in the seawater the literally freezing water doesnt make anyones teeth chatter until theyre submerged but if enclosed in iceberginfested waters up to ones thighs symptoms of the cold would absolutely be seen in a romantic gesture kate winslet is seen trudging her way through the water in her extremely heavy petticoats but she wouldnt have been able to move so quickly if her legs were being frozen and the weight of her thick dress material were added to the mixso depending on your point of view you can fall in love with this beautiful splendor full of iconic moments and a memorable theme and song you can lose yourself in the historical replications or spend your time searching for flaws which youll find i wont ever watch the movie again but let me know what you thinkkiddy warning obviously you have control over your own children however since there are scary situations that scarred me for life i wouldnt let my kids watch it,sad
this movie will never get old it is more beautiful every time i watch it,sad
is one of the best films that attracted my attention it was produced by james cameron in 18 november 1997 in londres it is a romantic film is one of the most expensive movies ever made it has grossed over 1 billion world wide at the boxe office making it one of the highest grossing films of all time it received 14 academy award nominations and won 11 of them including best picture of 1997 and best song for celine dion perfoming my heart will go on the movie tells the dramatic story of the with leonardo di caprio and kate winslet as the main actorsduring 197 minutes tell the story of a young poor guy jack leonardo di caprio who travels by the gorgeous ship from london to new york with a big dream on board he meets a fabulous wealthy girl rose kate winslet he fells in love with her as soon he sees this gorgeous girl however after a few days the ship hits an enormous iceberg and the tragedy begins to unfold the starts sinkingto sump it up i really find that this movie shows a beautiful love story with an extremely sad ending moreover the story of the film is very amazing and also the performance of both actor leonardo di caprio and kate winslet was so brilliant i personally recommended to see this film because its a beautiful movie,sad
my life and my family would world need to gather some time draws customers from miles around because of its amazing offers and range of brand new exhigh street clothing footwear and accessories ,sad
the problem is it is too long i like the ending but overall just too boring,sad
there is not one movie james cameron makes that is not worth watching he is the second most perfectionist director that ever livednobody will probably ever beat the undisputable number one stanley kubrik,sad
this movie is about a love story that ends by the hands of an evil icebergwas more about romance then about tragedy the old lady and jack are pure fiction only the iceberg was reali say enjoy a good hour of watching people suffer because of an iceberg,sad

an entertaining movie that everybody seems to have seen and i admit the film has that somewhat nostalgic atmosphere in it but has simple characters with a simple predictable cliche love story i dont know what the huge fuss is about there isnt that much special about it other than that the movie is way too overrated,sad
liked the music of this movie so much unfortunately this all the good thing can say about it dont like romance movie usually but this is not the reason my main problem with this movie is the ending two hours from singing music and love and after all that the dead scene is joke the coldest dead scene ever no emotional at all if i loved some one so much i never left his body in the ocean to eat by fish i prefer to die with him andnot do this but this is just me and will not asked people to be perfect but if you will throw his body in the ocean to eat by shark please show us some emotional no love no crying no influenced awful just awful,sad
for those who were of serious moviewatching age in 1997 was more than just a movieit was a cultural milestone in an era before the internet was as omnipresent as it is today still managed to transcend its celluloid and become part of pop culture lore it easily vaulted to the top of the alltime charts though has now been passed by avatar and star wars the force awakens however along the way gained a bit of a reputation as a chick flick what with dreamy leo and the somewhat schmaltzy romance between him and kate winslets character fortunately what ive learned after a recent rewatch of the film is that it still manages to hold up as an epic for allcomers at least for the most part despite its branding as sappyfor a basic plot summary tells the story of rose kate winslet and jack leonardo dicaprio both passengers on the maiden and obviously final voyage of the rms rose is a member of the upper crust first class pledged to be wed to the stodgy controlling cal billy zane jack is a freewheeling vagabond who wins his ticket in a poker game just minutes before the ship departs on the first night of the voyage rose has a breakdown and is about to jump from the bow of the shipuntil she is stopped by the charming jack a romeo and julietesque romance begins coming to a head when the great boat strikes an iceberg and beings taking on waterthe main reason i can appreciate is because i like films that really go for it so to speak is meant to be an epic and directorcreator james cameron pulls out all the stops to make that happen the visually sequences are stunning the cgi is a bit visible by todays standards but not terrible the scope of the project is momentous and the romance is just as overthetop to match had a lesser film tried to get away with some of the jackand rose cheesiness pulled here it would have been a disaster but for some reason it just works in again i think because of the epic nature of the whole projectcameron also could not have picked a better setting for an epic we are now over 100 years removed from the fateful sinking yet it is an event that still carries a high level of fascinationthe unsinkable ship sinks to the bottom of the atlantic i think cameron also makes a great decision to go the highdrama route as this easily could have been turned into an ultrarealistic pseudodocumentary of the event im sure that knowing camerons style much research was done to make things as accurate as possible but the fictional presence of jack and rose adds that layer of high drama that turns the whole production into a prestige eventthe only reason i cant give the full five stars well theres two actually first cameron really lays the class differences stuff on thick in the latter stages of the film it is set up perfectly in the beginning but as the film drew to a close i wanted to be enthralled by the sinking visuals or swept away in the sheer emotion not be constantly beaten over the head with the first class are conniving snobs while third class are the unsung heroes trope i know from avatar that cameron has little qualms about obviously sticking his own beliefs into films and doing so quite heavily so maybe thats just par for the course for his films secondly i honestly believe that better casting could potentially have been done with the rose character in no way do i wish to demean the talents of kate winslet as i know she is a wonderful actress in her own right but i never felt like she was right for this part she is great as the uptight rose but i never really bought into her as the mooneyed lover of jack it felt odd to me luckily dicaprio is a joy to behold on screen in the film so some of the chemistry issues are solved by his sheer enthusiasmi think that is one of those movies that got so big so fast that now its reputation proceeds it a bit i found a similar thing happened to the film dead poets society whereas now standing up on a desk to make a point is old hat there was a time when it was truly riveting that same logic must apply to too whether you are watching it for the first time or rewatching it for the umpteenth time this is a flick where the slightest bit of cynicism can ruin the entire experience you have to clear the slate of the mind every single time and enjoy the epic experience for what it is if you can do that is truly a treasure,sad
i saw 4 times when it came out  still in theaters ive never done that not before or since it is not just the story of the sinking or the loss of life i meantheres that story welltold but the love story of jack and rose told against the backdrop of an epic disaster is so poignant it was a phenomenonthe movie was i watched it again tonight  20 years later and it holds up even now is james camerons mona lisa his free bird a masterpiece dont listen to the naysayers and haters commenting here on imdb that its overrated if anything a film that garnered 11 academy awards rated a 77 on imdb is grossly underrated its a beautiful film still,sad
is a film that caught my emotions the very first time i saw it it is one of the most successful movies ever made as well as one of the most beloved the plot describes how two young people rose and jack meet each other abroad the atlantic ocean and fall in love the way that this movie portrays the tragedy is so beautiful and eye catching it is filmed with such color that the audience is just drawn to it right away the acting is another strong point of the film it gives the audience almost an outofbody experience as it takes you through the plot it is as if we are living the events on the screen in a sense they are happening to us the title automatically gives off a tragic tone everybody knows what happened on the ship however the many different shifts in tone make this film that much more enjoyable it connects to the audiences emotions in such a way that they see all the different perspectives of the movie,sad
is one of the best films ever made i love the plot and never get bored of watching it the actors fitted into the parts perfectly my favorite part is when jack and rose got together i dont like the park when jack is stuck handcuffed but it adds suspensei also think that its funny when he goes to diner with rose and her friends as he doesnt know what to do the saddest part for me is when jack dies at the end of it i think that he and rose would have made a really good couplethey could of got married in my opinion a squeal needs to be made to find out what happened to rose and her necklace that she drops into the sea,sad
then i finally watched it and discovered a masterpiece hands down one of the best movies ever madei wanted to keep it at this but the review requires more lines sofirst of all this is what a 200 million dollar movie should look like amazing set pieces and camerawork which genuinely immerse you and take you to another time and place top notch special effects a brilliant castand to me to this day a still very important reflection on our priorities in life decency vs winning one way or the other appeasing and preserving privilege or freeing yourself from a golden cage security or real love without any material guarantees and for the love of god jack died in the water lets save dicaprio and ourselves from actual flooding and no i dont agree saving our planet isnt a political statement its absolute insanity to not see that as at least kinda important so i am not going into any arguments about technical inaccuracies however valid they might be its a damn movie hobbits arent realistic either your argument is invalid if you cant enjoy this movie honestly you are probably spoiling many movies for yourself,sad
i remember seeing this movie a few times when i was only 7 years old i didnt understand much of the romance but i do remember the ship and all the water and especially the ending its been almost 20 years since i last saw and after seeing it for the first time as an adult wow what a ride im not sure even with todays visual effects and so forth if a remake would be able to do any better in resenting the liner and capture the feel that james cameron did i really enjoyed and happy to give it a 910 the dialogue in some places is a little unconvincing along with some of the choices made haha some things seemed ambit rushed but with such a small time scale to work with rushed in probably a unavoidable aspect bar making a 4 hour long film very cleaver writing to make a love story upon such a tragic event no doubt just a story about the event would have been tragically boring so i enjoyed having something to keep me distracted heros and villains while the  did its thing i recommend this film today and for the next 20 years and would be very interested if anyone would like to try and top it with a remake,sad
this movie is so well done the quality is amazing and both actors did a super great job what i like most about the movie is that the rose and jack were friends and lovers at the same time the love theme in the movie is great and there are a lot of hearttouching moments that you have to see this movie will make you capable of falling in love again and again nice romantic vibes and leo dicaprio is gorgeous and kate is beautiful as well if you are so into romance i am sure this will be one of the best romantic movies youll ever see get ready for your heart to beat get ready to get goosebumps get ready for super chilly feelings youre about to watch the great movie enjooooy,sad
have to say this is the best movie of all times if you are a future filmmaker you should see this movie and the making of witch i think is powerful leonardo dicaprios performance was incredible kate winslet was phenomenal these two actor had a big responsibility they proof themselves they were ready for this challenge james cameron his vision since day 1 was incredible he took a big risk in hollywood some people in the industry doubt about the success of the film but he believe in himself the project and vision he had for it till today is the best movie in history hard work paid off great job james cameron,sad
james camerons is a film that everyone knows about and one that every movie fan will have to watch at some point and its worth such praise as i found this to be a fantastic film with one of the best romances ever put to screen by far the most admirable thing about this movie is the fact that it never drags despite being over three hours long that because they use every scene to fullest to either increase the chemistry between jack and rose or to get attached to the characters you know are doomed the title ship looks incredible in this movie everything from the lower cabins to the luxurious cigar rooms look nothing less than life like this first and foremost is a love story and that works for this movie it helps to give the eventual tragedy more weight to it and theres not a single second where you dont believe either of these to people arent in love you just feel like they belong with each other and need each other and it takes two exceptional performances to capture that leonardo dicaprio is just perfect casting in this films hes incredibly likable and entertaining and hate to see him trampled over by the first class passengers kate winslet though gave the best performance in this film you feel that despite the fact that she has infinite riches she feels completely alone and she portrays that perfectly and her final scenes with jack are absolutely heartbreaking to watch the final hour of is centred around the sinking of the ship and never have tension and desperation been captured quite like this every single scene brings a new obstacle or challenge and just gradually seeing the water rise adds to the tension all the more theres a lot of scenes in this film where characters are only looking out for themselves and are leaving others behind to die but you dont hate them for it except cal you understand their desperation and will to survive and the viewer has to face the fact that they would likely to things very similar in the same situation this is however not a perfect movie it does have some flaws for one a lot of the side characters specifically the first class passengers just have nothing to them their just their to be hate able and to give more obstacles for jack and rose to cross and more could have been done with them i also think that their was no need to focus so much on the present day storyline it takes up to much time toward the beginning and should have kept all these scenes until the ending of the film and couldve still had the same impact dont get me wrong this film is a commitment its not a causal watch but is still a unique one its got an amazing central romance and had some excellent directing and some of the best production design ever put to film 86a,sad
is the best movie ive ever seen in the theater it just blows you away with how good it is the romance the special effects the action and the drama are all amazing the movie is phenomenal theres a group of a research ship in 1996 or 1997 exploring the wreck of the and one who is obsessed with finding a diamond that was worn by someone on the ship they recover a safe that they think it might be in it isnt in there but there is a picture of a girl wearing a necklace with the diamond and this is shown on the news the girl in the picture named rose sees it recognizes herself and calls them and tells them the girl in the picture is her they have her come there and she tells a story of being on the and the movie switches to the day the left on the trip where it sunk it goes back and forth from 1912 to 1996 or 1997 the 1912 part focuses on rose and a boy named jack who out of luck in a game was able to get a ticket to the they meet on the ship when rose attempts to commit suicide and after a number of events fall in love leading to fantastic romantic scenes the movie is incredible,sad
the famous story of the is toldso much has been said about this movie what can i add i guess the first thing that springs to mind is the timeless appeal of the film when i saw it a few times in 1997 there was question in my mind about the timeless element of the flickwould i still love it so much 20 or 19 years later well guess what i doin fact in some ways i like it even more now since 1997 has there been a movie where the production crew have actually built large sections of a massive ship just for a movie and what about the wonderful musical score do we get scores like that todayis a movie everybody must see before they die as i dont think hollywood will ever make a movie like this again,sad
even though i have watched this movie couple of times in my childhood one must give such a masterpiece another try when grown up poisoned by the memes and comics shared on facebook showing how rose was such a scumbag who couldve saved jack at the end thats simply not true trying to be classy here any dumb ass with a little common of understanding how buoyancy force works will tell how it couldve not been possible for that piece of debris to take them both regarding weight it was even showed in the movie jack tried to get on the wooden thing but it sunk not to mention how rose was such a decent person through out the movie she freaking blew my mind firstly choosing real love instead of money and going back for jack in the freaking middle of a catastrophe surrounded by water and then refusing to jump in a rescue boat with women and children and stupidly stayed for him oh well closing off this stupid facebook argument i have to say that the acting in this movie was stellar everything was on point each character was unique on his own way and of course dicaprio never cease to impress me especially in this movie he did it perfectly by portraying a poor likable person with huge confidence and that showed during the scene of the dinner when he sat with bunch of rich highly regarded people and shut them up with his views of how to live your life a scene that left my jaw opened not to mention i was blown away by the graphics and camera work of the massive ship going down the only thing that made made give this masterpiece a 9 out of 10 is because how selfish their love story seemed in the middle of such a disaster they only seemed to care for each other i wouldve have loved to see them try to help passengers they were even hesitant to help the little child who was completely alone overall i think cameron did a great job to balance the story line between jack and rose love story and the disaster happening but couldve been better,sad
this film focuses on the tragic first voyage of the british luxury steamer rms which sank in the north atlantic directed and written by james cameron the film features leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet the soundtrack one of the most iconic of cinema is james hornerwill always be the icon of the golden age of maritime passenger transport the biggest of steamers the most luxurious of luxury ships it was the largest ship in the world at the time and it was said that it was unsinkable unfortunately everything is made of iron can sink the negligence of the responsible for the ship which ignored all warnings of ice and never prepared it with enough lifeboats to all the people inside it led to a huge and unnecessary tragedyin the midst of all we have the unlikely love between rose a rich girl and jack a young who grew up in the streets its the classic clich rich girl loves poor boy or in this case adventurer eager to make a fortune loves rich and bored girl who wants to feel strong emotions their story is similar to many others and in addition to never be credible enough it quickly becomes cloying and boringly predictable and gives voice to the preconceived ideas of cameron showing social barriers richpoor  symbolized in the film by locked doors between the ship classes as if they were divisions between good and bad world is not so simple so darkandgray and divisions like that still exists today in other waysthe choice of the two main actors was excellent although still young and not well known they have become stars dicaprio was the pretty face of the girls wet dreams for a long time thanks to this movie and even had to take off the heartthrob image later to diversify his career in fact he is a talented actor as kate and both worked well in the romantic scenes the film also contains stunning scenes of the ship whose interiors have been carefully re created and then destroyed during the scene of the wreck the details are excellent they were in the collective memory for the quality that was achieved special and sound effects are also excellent,sad
this film is based on a real occurrence in the story appears a poor boy who is called jack and rose who is only 17 both have a romance on the ship while its being destroyed and sinking only some of the crew survived on the one hand i think that the theme is good and very interesting as it is based on a real event but on the other hand in my opinion its too long and it can be boring but if you like this type of film you will enjoy it all the time in 1h 18m a servant from rose is brushing her hair while they are talking and this moment is very tedious although in 2h 30m there are the best minutes as jack and rouse have their moment alone and they dance,sad
is a 1997 american epic romancedisaster film directed written coproduced and coedited by james cameron a fictionalized account of the sinking of the rms it stars leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet as members of different social classes who fall in love aboard the ship during its illfated maiden voyagei love the film very much every time i am moved to tears i am filled with heartrending sorrow however the heroine live strongly after the parson who she loves so i am encouraged the music of the film is also good i love the song my heat will go on sung by celine dion the film contains love story element and panic element so we never lost interest in the film the film is loved all over the world so i want you to watch it,sad
is the second film to win 11 oscars  before only ben hur classic had this done is a great movie  more will it deserved both oscar  the film photography is beautiful  the costume is also good the performances are very good and the cast is good the couple kate winslet and leonardo dicaprio works  the more the film has some unnecessary characters  the soundtrack of james horner is excellent  and the script is well written  the film is too long has more three hours and the pace leaves the film through tiring  the direction of cameron is great  is a great film with good performances and a beautiful soundtrack with a slow pace that leaves the tiresome film i do not particularly give 11 oscars i believe that the film deserved a maximum of 6 oscars  note 83,sad
ethan wright mrs plant film review 09 october 2015 revieweven though everyone knows how the movie will end the movie keeps you on your toes and never loses your attention it focuses on a love story more than the massive tragedy there will probably never be a movie that matches the creativity and wittiness of the if you didnt enjoy this movie then you mustve been in a bad mood while you watched it for fell asleep halfway through if you paid attention then you will no doubt love the moviethe movie is an epic action packed romance with a few comical scenes tossed in here and there the beginning and the end of the movie was beautiful minus the massive tragedy that ended in painful deaths for most of the passengers one of the main characters rose was slowly converted from the rich snobby lifestyle to the poor having fun lifestyle the shots and special effects of that which was in the were unmatched be the movie that has ever been seen at the time the camera angles are the excellent and the sound in the background is excellentthe won several oscars all of them well deserved the most prestigious award was the academy award for best picture it also won an academy award for best director a kids choice award for favorite movie and an academy award for best cinematography the line jack ill never let go was brilliant and ended up being one of the most famous lines in movie history for good reason there were numerous lines just as clever and meaningful as that line many went unnoticed but they were there,sad
directed by james cameron earned a whopping 11 oscars in one night those oscars include best picture best director best cinematography best art directionset decoration best costume design best film editing best effects sound effects editing best effects visual effects best music original song for the song my heart will go on performed by cline dion best music original dramatic score it also earned 77 stars on imdb public voters in my option was one of the greatest movies of all time because of the great acting scenes and the emotion bond connection i am able to make with the characters and with leonardo dicaprio staring in the film was just the icing on the cakeis a movie about a rich girl rose kate winslet and a poor boy jack leonardo dicaprio or helplessly falls in love with each other but rose winslet is engaged to a rich business man named cal hockley billy zane even though rose winslet doesnt want to marry cal her mother wants her to marry him because they are in need of money while on the flip side jack dawson dicaprio is a poor floater who moves from place to place looking to make quick money so he can survive when he first sees kate it was love at first sight for him but he doesnt know she is engaged later in the film kate and jack fall in love and spend as much time together of course roses fianc finds out and like any normal man gets extremely upset and jealous when he tries to put a stop to it it backfires in his face meanwhile captain edward james smith bernard hill gets a message that there is an ice burg ahead but he ignores it so he doesnt upset mr ismay who wants to keep the boat moving in full speed he has people on the lookout but they dont see the ice burg until the last minute the hits the side of the ice bug causing a big hole in the side of the boat as the boat quickly fills with water people start to freak out and many lives will be lost as the water engulfs the unsinkable boat to me the second best aspect of the film would defiantly be the music the first being the characters but well save that for another day the music in the helped build the suspense and also add to the theme my heart will go on performed by cline dion is one of the best songs in the film when they added the song to the background the ship was sinking and you saw the fright and terror in everyones eyes it made your heart fill with sorrow and turned on the waterworks it was a strong scene with little action but it spoke loud and clear and at the end became of the best scenes inmy overall opinion of the movie is it was one of the best movies i have ever seen if you want to see a classic movie that will make you cry this is the first movie i will suggest to anyone even if dont like some of the actors or actresses you will inevitably fall in love with them through the if i were to give this movie my own personal rating it would be a trillion times infinity,sad
the longawaited advent of the most expensive movie ever made the reportedly 200 million brings history to mind and not just the legendary seafaring disaster of april 15 1912 think back also exactly 58 years ago today to the dec 19 new york premiere of another grand transporting love story set against a backdrop of prideful excess cataclysmic upheaval and characterdefining trial by firea film that sweeps us away into a world of spectacle beauty and excitement a realm of fantasy unimaginable without the moviesjames camerons 194minute 200 million film of the tragic voyage is in the tradition of the great hollywood epics it is flawlessly crafted intelligently constructed strongly acted and spellbinding if its story stays well within the traditional formulas for such pictures well you dont choose the most expensive film ever made as your opportunity to reinvent the wheel,sad
there are three stories here all very well written and produced we all know the basic story of the ship the but camerons depiction of the actual events is so much better than any written accountwe see the captain we see the doubts as he weighs up the pressures he is under from the ship owners and the publicity people then later he has to face the reality that his ship is going to sink and he is probably going to die probably unpleasantly and we see the ships designer and builder we see the officers and the crew and all the problems they face and how they react sometimes well sometimes not we see the wealthy firstclass passengers and their life of luxury now they face death and cant do anything about itthe production of all these events is impressive walls bursting floods of water people sliding down the tilted deck falling off then we see the horrible sight of the lifeboats as they search for anyone still living in the freezing water so graphic as is the first scenes of the modern attempt to recover items from the wreck especially the way they explain to rose what physically happened cleveri suppose most viewers will concentrate on the story of jack dicaprio and rose winslet but this part although very well done is quite ordinary just another lovelust story he saves her life she saves his later not many standout scenes or dialogue for either of themthe third part of the story is rose 84 years later the casting by mali finn is great gloria stuart is a recognizable older version of rose and including her joins many of the events throughout the film very clever well done mr cameron,sad
one of the fine movies in the world it was so impressed me love has no borders hierarchies one of the most touching scenes from the movie was the band members playing their instruments to calm passengers even as the ship was sinking and the ship was sinking more and more faster its a tragic event and story but many people may felt it was beautiful story even if it is so catastrophicthe collided with a glacier and sank to the bottom of the ocean when i was a little kid i really hated the glacierand i cried with my brother this was so special gigantic movieand even now i cant forget about the last scene many dramas and films copy that scene in the last scene they were living and smiling because of the end of the scene i cried a lot this movie was so beautiful and touching,sad
being seen as one of the greatest movies in hollywood this film deserves well over ten stars the cast members perfectly match their historicalfictional characters leonardo dicaprio as jack dawson kate winslet as rose dewitt bukater billy zane as caledon hockley and many more the storyline is epic and romantic at the same time and the script is very well written james cameron has done a great job bringing the disastrous story of back to life and giving it a romance between the two main characters i must say leo dicaprio has perfected his deaths a good movie for the modern day teenage girl to watch,sad
is for sure one of the most beloved films ever made especially by the academy in the year it came out i believe it is very deserving of the many praises it has received over the years i know there are people that claim its terrible and i think its mostly guys who roll their eyes at the romance involved ok so i think the acting from the very talented cast is well done winslet and dicaprio are both doing their absolute best here which is great because they really are two very gifted actors i believe their love story because of the chemistry between them i think the drawing scene and the car scene are both very beautifully done handled well the expressions on their faces portray real love and affection but they both at the same time show a sense of vulnerability too the other actors are very convincing as well one that deserves praise is kathy bates who plays molly brown she had a great believable energy about her and she provides some fun comedic relief too gloria stuart is so amazing here she might be my favorite member of the cast it may be a tie between her and dicaprio because theyre both so great the visual effects in this film are just flat out incredible they still hold up today and they are so realistic and breathtaking to watch the soundtrack is great and i think it fits the films tone overall james cameron knows what hes doing and he has people around him who also know what theyre doing so it results in a wildly entertaining smart film one that i will forever call a masterpiece,sad
we all know what the film is based of off and we expected that but what im sure that audiences didnt expect was a plot as deep as it gets with an amazing and large cast offers more teardrops then a funeral one thing that stands out over everything else is the fantastic musical score by james horner and celine deon possibly the best since hans zimmer in the lion king in 1994 released in 1997 changed cinema as we know it offering a deep and emotional story with performance you will enjoy with your eyes and music that you will be humming for years to come leonardo dicaprio kate winslet billy zane and kathy bates are amongst one of the largest cast in film history up to that point it is a film you will have to see to not only believe but enjoy as well this is james camerons,sad
leonardo dicaprio is an amazing actor he did a great job in this film he is my favorite actor ever and hes just great he has talent and puts his whole self into his career he doesnt just go halfway he goes all the way he is a very inspiring person i would like to meet him one day he has 28 great films although i havent seen them all but hes in them so they have to be great haha ever since he was little he knew he wanted to be an actor and now hes living his dream and he is doing a great job at it every movie he does hes great its not something he takes lightly thank you leo for your great work   keep it up never stop wonderfuljust wonderful ,sad
many love stories have the same plot they are predictable and boring and by the end of the film viewers are done watching the couple kiss and be cutesy however the ties in not only a love story but an adventure an intense inner battle and a mortifying loss from the beginning of the film viewers are attached to jack dawson feeling like they want him to succeed so when they see how how happy jack is that he won a ticket on the rms viewers want nothing more for the poor and extremely attractive boy to be happy jack and rose have a love that is almost sickening but the affection they show each other makes viewers want to experience a crazy love story of their own it is nice to see a rich girl let her guard down and be herself around jack something that is lost in the craziness of every day life and the fact that it is human nature to try and impress people we like when watching the everyone i hope knew what would happen at the end but it was heartbreaking to see roses lovers life come to an end honestly i think they both could have fit on the old door when they were waiting to be rescued but there had to be a heartbreaking tragedy that leaves one crying on the couch wanting to dive into the ocean to bring jack dawson back to life kate winslet and leonardo dicaprio are phenomenal actors and they have amazing chemistry together on and off screen,sad

is now a film which people go out of their way to dismiss being contemptuous towards the film is the fashionable thing to do admitting you like the film marks you as being desperately uncool yes themania of 199798 was a bit much the box office records the 11 oscarsat some point people said enough was enough but this is a film not so easily dismissed perhaps it was not worthy of the unprecedented frenzy which surrounded it but it certainly does not deserve the derision it has received it is a very solid film a compelling story beautiful visuals stellar performancesthis film has much to recommend it james cameron risked a lot to bring his vision of to the screen the risks paid off is great entertainment truly captivating at times legitimately thrilling its not a perfect movie maybe it falls a touch short of true greatness but only by the thinnest of margins all the hype and all the eventual backlash cant obscure the fact that this is indeed a very good movieof course this film is ultimately destined to turn tragic but the film is not so much about the sinking of a ship it is a love story a very unique heartwarming love story a story about a young woman who found the love of her life and found herself all in the span of a few days aboard the illfated part of the films charm is that this woman rose tells us her story herself 101 years old when we meet her rose takes us back to the and with her words she brings the great ship and its passengers back to life one of those passengers is cal an arrogant man to whom much to her chagrin rose is engaged her family needs cals money rose does not love him but family and society dictate she must marry this rather reprehensible man but then things take a turn rose in unusual and potentially embarrassing circumstances meets jack dawson while rose enjoys firstclass splendor jack is a man from another world a thirdclass passenger no money to his name no standing in society jack has no place in roses world but rather inevitably rose decides she wants a place in jacks world yes it is one of those scarcely believable stories in which a woman falls madly in love with a man she just met but in her heart rose knows jack is the one she must follow her heart she will throw away her privileged life to be with the man she loves unfortunately cal is not going to give her up easily but before this conflict can play itself out an iceberg intervenesthe love story of rose and jack is easy to embrace especially when you contrast jack so goodhearted with the vile cal leonardo dicaprio performs the role of jack very well making you believe there is so much more to this guy than is readily apparent jack is no ordinary thirdclass nobody and dicaprio captures this unique individual wonderfully but for as good as dicaprio is it is kate winslet who is the real star here rose goes on an incredible journey of personal growth and winslet nails it every step of the way rose is radiant smart witty and ultimately heroic winslet brings all those characteristics to the screen perfectly rose finds she is stronger in so many ways than she ever imagined it takes a great actress to evolve along with such a character and winslet is clearly a great actress for as good as dicaprio and winslet are in the two key roles the performance of billy zane as cal the main antagonist leaves much to be desired zane takes cals villainy to cartoonish levels by the end its impossible to take the character seriously spitting his lines rather than speaking them zane seems absolutely desperate for attention unfortunately the attention he brings upon himself is that of sticking out like a sore thumb in an otherwise stellar cast cal had to be evil to make the films story work but zane overplays it so badly you half expect to find out that it was cal who steered the ship into the iceberg and that he did it on purposezane aside the rest of the supporting cast is excellent while the lead characters are fictional there are many truelife figures aboard the ship some such as ship builder thomas andrews come across very well others such as white star line managing director j bruce ismay do not whether those they portray are ultimately heroic or quite the opposite the cast by and large do an excellent job bringing these historical figures to life and cameron with a great visual sense beautiful sets and state of the art effects brings the ship to life sails again for the film to really work you had to believe you were really aboard a ship steaming across the atlantic cameron makes it happen were right on board right there with the passengers as they embrace the ships majesty and right there with them as the ship sinks to the bottom of the ocean it is the love story which is at the heart of the films success but the sinking of the ship is spectacular both haunting and thrilling perhaps the most fun sequence in the film comes when rose wanders down to thirdclass where a raucous party is in full swing we know that nearly all of those passengers are doomed but rose ensures they will not be forgotten in telling us her story she tells us theirs as well through her cameron has given a voice to all who were lost on that tragic night is a film not without its flaws but it is a film journey well worth taking three hours fly by as we follow the first and last journey of the great ship,sad
james cameron is an amazing filmmaker he made terminator ii abyss and aliens and he has made this movie one that is going to require some absolute brilliance to beat what was i thinking when i wrote this at the end i just sat in my chair and did not say anything there is nothing that can describe this movie this is how a love story should be madeis a tragedy pure and simple right from the beginning you know that the ship is going to sink we the audience knows what is going to happen but we watch the crew and the wealthy wonder around fully convinced that the ship is invincible all the problems with the ship are not known until after the ship has begun to sunk the important part is the iceberg they could not see it until it was too late to do anything aboutthis movie really brings out the contrast between the rich and the poor and brings out the idea that they seem to be two different people who live in two different worlds on the carpathia the ship that picked up the survivors of the when the wealthy fianc is looking for his beloved he comes onto the deck full of the survivors from third class the sailor says to him there is nobody of your kind down here the distinction is purely artificial though when jack is invited up to dinner in first class he is dressed up and the comments are that he is like one of them the only difference between the two is the money one has it while the other does not but is having money all that good the movie seems to say that it is not we see rose attempting to commit suicide yet she has everything she could hope for as she is to marry a wealthy steel magnateyet rose finds more interest in the young bohemian artist named jack dawson she is willing to throw everything away just for this one young man of course this makes her fianc extremely jealous but deep down she doesnt want him her continual snide remarks at the lifestyle of the rich shows that she doesnt want any part of it neither does jack for he refuses the caviar traditionally the food of the rich and is in quite a hurry to get out of the first class dinning room and back to steerage where the lower classes arethe distinction is really brought out when the ship is sinking the third class passengers are locked below while the first class passengers are piling onto the lifeboats their belief that they are above the others goes to the point where they take off in lifeboats without the full capacity the utter despicableness of this is fully realised when one sees all the dead floating in the atlantic afterwards the rich are only concerned for their own lives and the others just die for all they care only those who have money are importantthe true evil of this comes out with the idea of women and children first even though they say that there are men climbing onto the boats and looking for a way off the ship these rich people are not interested in sacrifice but in preserving their own lives cal roses fianc comes out even more wicked as he takes a lost girl only to use her to get onto a lifeboat and when it looks as if the lifeboat will sink he throws her away he even beats people back into the ocean so as not to swamp his boatsacrifice in love is one that comes in through this movie not greatly but it is there true love is when one is willing to sacrifice their lives to save others we see that jack constantly orders rose onto the lifeboats but rose more so will not let him die alone and keeps on coming back to him there seems the idea that love comes out of wanting to die together but even so we see an act of love or sacrifice at the end the real idea of love as serving the one you love does not really come out but that is an americanism love is a special feeling so they say that happens between two people still there is a lot of putting ones life on the line for the other in this movie which is what love really is aboutmy only real gripe is the final scene in the movie but that i ignored it was just a stupid americanism to give the movie a happy ending if i were to rewrite the ending then i would finish it with the heart of the sea sinking into the water,sad
brock lovett bill paxton is searching for a legendary gem called the heart of the ocean presumed lost on the when he finds a drawing instead rose gloria stuartkate winslet comes on board and tells her story of and her love jack dawson leonardo dicaprio shes a wealthy girl destined for a loveless marriage to the hateful cal hockley billy zane hes a wandering artist who won his ticket in a poker game he would save her in every way that a person can be savedi have often railed against the insertion of a love story unnecessarily into a historical event like pearl harbor but i think james cameron made the right decision here the story is compelling by itself leo has that boyish charm kate and leo has become a legendary hollywood big screen pairing this time it works because its well written and well actedthere is the great cgi its relatively seamless and ahead of its times the engine room is magnificent even better than the boat itself the iceberg hit was very convincingthen there is the sinking for something that is absolutely expected it still shocks the suspense of it all holds my attention every time the last hour of the movie is perhaps one of the most tension filled sequence of all times it is the incredible cgi as well as the amazing stunts it marries the real world with the computer world and have rarely been exceeded even to this day it is more harrowing than all those 3d superheroes smashing into skyscrapers for its iconic status i have to give this 910,sad
i know that nowadays is seen as kind of a clichd romance movie but thats just not the case yes romance is a large part of the plot but it is tasteful and very well done i really dont understand why people knock this movie down not only is james cameron a master film maker dicaprio and winslett are both excellent actors in fact everyone in this movie down to the extras make this film a completely immersible experience as for the cons there really isnt any unless youre a history buff in that case you should be reminded that this a very theatrical film and the creators took certain liberties anyway beyond the review yes this movie did move me to tears and yes i am a man for petes sake my nickname is burly for a reason and i shed tears if that tells you anything about how this movie can rouse your emotions what else is sad is that this movie at the time of this review only has 7510 on imdb its not even on imdbs top 250 advice for movie lovers if you havent seen it see it if youve already seen it watch it again if you have the time gets a 1010 in my book,sad
james cameron directed this massive blockbuster hit about the illfated maiden voyage of the in april 1912 among the many passengers is drifter jack dawsonplayed by leonardo dicaprio who meets unhappy heiresstobe rose dewittplayed by kate winslet and fall mutually in love as disaster strikes the ship resulting in its sinking and the loss of many lives an old version of roseplayed by gloria stuart recounts the romance and tragedy to treasure huntersled by bill paxton who are looking for a fabled jewel aboard the wreck which rose does indeed know something about hated by some resented by others i still love this film which works magnificently as a tragic love story and as disaster picture with outstanding fx that are still realistic the full extent of the tragedy is not overshadowed by the romance at all which is put in proper perspective some dialogue could have been better its true but compelling drama at its best leading to an emotionally devastating end deservedly won many academy awards including best picture director and song my heart will go on,sad
this is an epic tragedy movie about aristocrat rose dewitt bukater falling in love with poor artist jack dawson aboard the doomed it is a beautiful but typical love story that captures the audiences hearts providing a compelling subplot among the more tragic main story of the illfated voyagemany of the movies element was directed with excellence the actors provided a solid and believable performance the cinematography was beautiful the music score was moving and the sceneries and settings aboard the ship amidst the flashy and famed lifestyles of aristocracy and amidst the poor but carefree lives of the townspeople and artists were brilliantthe scenes of each characters fate after the started sinking is extremely powerful haunting and sometimes disturbing the film quickly shifts from an emotional love story which i thought was unfortunately pretty boring to a heartwrenching tragedy that cannot help but send chills down your spine where most of the action liesthis movie is a little on the long side though with several filler scenes that drag away from the main plot some sequences of jack and rose were pretty clich  reminding you too much of a teenagebop love story while i am not a big drama fan this movie is a good exception for pure dramatic entertainment but not one i would watch over and over againgrade c,sad
thats a movie of real beauty of real love and of the real hard life running over three hours became the most successful film of the history of cinema extravagant inspiriting astounding poetic romantic and totally unforgettable enormous emotive power its a terrific balance of realism and romanticism every time i watch it there are tears in my eyes the story could not have been written better  the juxtaposition of rich and poor the sorrow and the increasing fear in the eyes of everyone on the board the hidden message that life is uncertain you dont know what is ahead of you and you have to live every single moment while you are still here on that planet with that masterpiece mr cameron proved that he is the king of the cinema,sad
what more could you say about well maybe a 100 million things more about it when it comes to youll always think of the vision and directing of james cameron and even though the whole story upon the disaster isnt 100 accurate i still think james was able to give a beautiful and strong directing not only the suffering and fear of the sinking but the love with leo and kate too basically is a more adventurous and maybe a little modern look on shakespeares romeo  juliet and i think it worked good to show the beauty of the ship and the lovethe acting is beautiful i didnt see any actors who felt forced or even ignored the ways how james wanted to do as he visioned they take it seriously without anything that seems like they didnt wanna do it leo gives a very good performance as the unknown boy who tries to help the desperate girl to feel more alive in my opinion leo does not look too boyish on this performance no in fact he really showed to be like a man i still enjoy his acting to this day now when he had turned more macho than ever kate gives a good performance that shows the feelings from someone whos rich but still theres many things she can do in her lifethe special effects are gorgeous they dont look fake at all and even looking on blu ray it still looks realistic with a little improvement on certain scenes dont worry i dont think james cameron will be the next george lucas because these changes are very minimal on some material that were unnecessary to have or something that was missingsure is long and does not exactly have the most original story but everything else is just perfect for its recreation of the ship the special effects and the acting and yes its true that there are still many people who dislikes or even hate this movie many people these days seems to forget that the word hate is much harsher than dislike the movie is certainly not the worlds greatest film of all time is it the worst no but certainly very overrated and even though i have heard many of my family recommending it i wanted to take a look on the movie on my personal vision and take a calm moment and concentration if the movie really delivers and yet it didbut in case for those who are wondering i like or love many other movies than this i understand that people who had heard from the positives that you really need to see this and the result for them they become flabbergasted or annoyed but then why should we always manage to see a movie that won for best picture when there are hundreds of other great movies out there so dont feel so forced about seeing see it when you really have time to see the whole of it but ignore also those who praise it or hate it thats what i did and it felt better,sad
is one of the most popular movie when you watch this movie for the first time you are probably going to be sad its been created in a wonderful way and im sure that if james cameron has the same equipment that helped him to create avatar he would have created this movie in an incredible way the only weak spot is james had not given a space to talk about other people who had died in that disaster he had concentrated on rose and jack in my opinion if he did not do that mistake this movie was going to be better than the shawshank redemption which is the best movie i want to talk about the music it was really awesome and what made it like this because he chose one of the best composers who is james horner another strong point was its plot it was organized correctly the greatest thing in movie was its end a protagonist who is jack had died and he chose that to save his lover it was the first time that i saw the end like this,sad
movie review is in my opinion an amazing movie it exposes the true definition of love leonardo dicario fearlessly takes on the leading role as jack dawson and in the end sacrifices his life for the woman he falls in love with captivates the audience using agape love to connect with the audience and exciting real life situations for the audience to relate to this movie shows loves greatest attributes those attributes being sacrifice youth beauty humbleness and endlessness the beginning of the movie allows the audience to get to know and understand the characters that play significant parts in the movie jack and rose are casted as the leading actors and do a tremendous job in delivering the directors message with their skills yet there are a few other important people that play imperative parts as well victor garber who plays thomas andrew acts as the captain of the ship he brilliantly portrays himself to be a dedicated hardworking man that is emotionally connected to his ship as it sinks to the bottom of the ocean the director sets the movie up chronologically but reverts to everything as a flashback which is creative genius bernardo bertolucci is the director of the film and directs this movie in such a way that the world now has a romantic novelty that can be used to show what true love looks like between a man and a woman throughout history as well as defining true artistic and creative ideas that will forever have an effect of the audience that watches it leonardo dicario and kate winslet who plays rose dewitt bukater have so much chemistry on the screen the way those two connect is as if they have been passionately in love before in a past life the climax of the movie is without a doubt the sinking of ship from the time the ship hits the iceberg until the time jack drifts off to sea action overtakes the movie and real life thrill pops out of the screen as far as the directing during these scenes the angles in which the camera records are very effective and essential to the overall perception of the movie the way the camera zooms in behind and around rose and jack as they do the balcony scene allows the audience to experience that very moment as well and examine how rose and jacks bodies reacted to each other the moment he knew he had fallen in love with her the ending of the movie is where the audience pushes to the edge of their seats and grabs their tissues and the arm of whomever they came with after seeing jack sacrifice his life for the one person in the world he found to love more than anything brings tears to even the men who watch this is one of the most heartfelt profound films ive ever seen its jam packed with emotion love experience knowledge wisdom hope and action that is the reason this movie is still a phenomenal hit in 2013 the is truly cinematic genius and is in my opinion one of the top three romance movies of our time,sad
one of the latest inquiries about this films rerelease was how it is in 3d pretty damn dazzling i would say the details are more enriched dark scenes are surprisingly crisp  clear and the entire experience is unforgettable remastered right from the ground up in 3d is a much more intimate experience the visual effects are still better than most cgi films that comes out these days featuring epic depiction of disaster that very few movies can match exceptional music by james horner that today is easily one of the most recognizable scores and last but not the least james cameron who has always pushed the boundaries of technology in filmmaking to new levels for crafting it with such care and dedication that it made the whole world fall in love with it again so take the journey fall in love and experience like never before,sad
the is a movie reenacting the historical event of a ship that was heading towards america and hit an iceberg and sank in the movie one of the main characters rose is narrating and telling her point of view of what happened on the almost 80 years before rose was a young upper class woman on the ship with her aristocratic family on the ship she soon meets a lowerclass man named jack dawson they met when rose was considering jumping of the ship and he had no choice but to save her if she did he ends up talking her down and that begins their relationship they had many other encounters together where he was in her world and she was in his throughout their many events together they soon realize they are in love and they cannot spend the rest of their lives together without each other this dream soon comes to a halt whenever the ship hits an unexpected iceberg at first it just felt like a bump but then slowly the ship started to fill up with water and begin the sink and the chaos became greater as everyone tried to get off the ship or to safety there were rescue boats on the ship but the amount of extra boats compared to the amount of people was extremely different the first people allowed on the safety boat were woman and children but in reality it was the upper class people who got to get to safety first while the lower class passengers were still stuck in the lower deck of the boat rose refuses to leave jack so she stays on the ship with him all the way until it plunges into the ice cold water rose finds a piece of wood to lie on while jack swam beside her in the water more rescue ships came but it was already too late for jack rose was on of the few survivors after the ship completely sunk and was able to tell her story to anyone who would listen in the movie special effects had to be used to make the ship sink the quality of special effects used made the sinking ship in the movie look like what was described to happen in the actual historical eventfor a movie made in 1997 i think the special effect had very good quality for that time the movie showed very big details of how exactly the ship sank and how it even broke in half and started bobbing until it was completely submerged in water the was said to be called the ship of dreams and the way the movie made the ship look it really did look like the gorgeous boat it was described to be the wellknown and respected critic robert ebert talks about the special effects and the animation of the movie and says you know intellectually that youre not looking at a real ocean linerbut the illusion is convincing and seamless the special effects dont call inappropriate attention to themselves but get the job done ebert 1997 i completely agree with eberts evaluation the special effects were not way too dramatic to draw away attention to the underlying story of rose and jacks love but they were also done well enough that it actually looked like a sinking ship if the special effect were not in the quality they were in the movie would probably not have been as big as a hit if the sinking ship looked extremely fake and not believable last year they turned one of the greatest movies into a 3d movie since the movie was not originally shot in 3d it is much harder to turn a 2d film into 3d only certain scenes were actually 3d opposed to the whole movie ebert does another review on the new version of the movie and goes on to say i know why the film is in 3d its to justify the extra charge thats a shabby way to treat a masterpiece ebert 2012 the movie did earn a lot of revenue after it came back into theaters 15 years later and in 3d which costs more than a 2d film i agree with ebert making this timeless movie 3d almost ruined the entire quality of the movie this movie was set in 1912 so keeping it in 2d gave it more of the vintage look making some scenes 3d really did take away from the overall story of the movie this was a poor use of special effects in my opinion because the original movie already had so much character to begin with i feel like one purpose of making this movie 3d was to make the audience feel like they were actually on the ship though it was interesting to see certain things pop it really did draw attention away from the original special effects that were already done so beautifully when looking at the originally movie the special effects and animation used to make the look like it was actually sinking really made the movie just so much better the story line of two people from different worlds on the same boat falling in love alone was already a hit but the way the movie reenacted actual events really dramatized the importance of the story line and how the characters had to fight to survive without the special effect the movie would not have been the same and it probably would not be as popular is it is the movie was made in 1997 and it is still talked about and played on television today also in 2012 in was remade in 3d and brought back into theaters making in popular all over again some critics may say that the 3d version was better but most critics will have to agree that nothing is better than the original,sad
was a big departure from the previous films director james cameron had created films like the terminator terminator 2 and aliens are all scifi action classics and are some of my favorite movies he had also directed true lies a solid action film but not quite as intriguing creative or original as the other films i mentioned he also made the abyss which was enjoyable yet forgettable in my opinion overall cameron really shines and delivers when it comes to making sci fi action films that take themselves seriouslythen came along it was his first major film that was not science fiction nor action related in a sense tries to be to cameron what schindlers list was to spielberg this was camerons opportunity to show he had matured and can make a sophisticated film a film based on a historical event without any elements of fantasy with great performances and emotional depth unfortunately does not quite reach the levels of greatness that schindlers list hadsad to say after seeing this movie it is clear that cameron isnt as versatile as spielberg and should stick to a specific genre for best results not to say is awful it is by no means a bad film however its not quite a classic because it suffers from being generic at times everything relating to the special effects the sets the costumes etc are not generic they are all incredibly done and clearly overseen by a great director what makes the movie generic are the things that separate it from camerons previous films the love storyif you took away all the thing mentioned above the great sets the great visual effects and so on and took everything away from the movie that had to do with the you would have nothing left but very clich by the book characters plot and dialogue jack and roses relationship had nothing particularly new or innovative about it at all two people in love separated by social class is a story thats been told over and over again ever since romeo and julietweve seen this story many times this would be forgivable if it wasnt for the fact that its the core of the movie star wars in a way does something similar it takes a story that everybody is familiar with and puts it in a bigger larger than life setting however what gave star wars more of a punch than was that the characters were far more unique and memorable take darth vader for example and compare him to caledon hockley from cal is a character that weve seen in many silly high school comedies the douche bag with a broom up his ass that we all want to see get his comeuppance at the enddarth vader on the other hand was nothing like any villain weve seen before and became a cultural icon im not saying every character has to become a part of pop culture for the movie to be good im just saying that thats whats keeping from being a masterpiece in my opinion i will say however that the film is still really shines during certain parts the sinking of the was emotional yet jaw dropping to watch the sets were also great and although i think jack and rose might be a bit generic and even a little boring they are still likable overall and its sad when jack dies at the endoverall the movie is over rated however i still consider it worth watching and entertaining its just destined to be compared with other films that reach a higher level of originality and storytelling because well its the second highest grossing film of all time as far as avatar is concerned that film even suffers from generic storytelling even more than this one and i feel that its a bit of a shame that cameron had clung to closely to clich characters and plot lines,sad
is about the idea that love conquers death it demonstrates this idea with a love story between jack and rose that has its ups and downs but is sealed with roses decision to stay on the sinking ship and risk death rather than escape the alone jack returns her love in kind by saving her from freezing but dying in the process rose remembers her love for almost 80 years and returns to the spot sank to throw a priceless diamond into the ocean in memory of jack the main plots of their love and jacks doomed escape from are supported by additional plots of hockleys escape from the ship and the treasure hunters search for the diamondthe storys focus stays true to the main love and escape plots that constitute the idea that love conquers death love endures despite and because of jacks death the side plots provide fuel for the main turning points and add the final clincher of rose remembering her love for decades by throwing away the diamond in memory of jack james cameron really knew what he was doing with the story and it shows in the story chartmy story chart of the movie is at storychartsca,sad
is not what you think it is you think its a flimsy love story about a skinny lad and a dumpy girl set against the background of an historic event in 1912no its an experiment in megaviewing its the gone with the wind of its day both of them smashed box office recordsthis movie is about getting bums on seats just as gwtw was so how did they do it i wont tell you because its a global trade secret in human psychologynah ill tell you its the script they did it by making every word every line of the script fail at the beginning of the movie when you heard di caprios friend say he was going to america lamerica you knew he would fail when the owner of the liner said the ship was unsinkable you knew those words would fail when billy zane tried to bribe the crew member to get a seat on the lifeboat you knew his words would fail every line of the script ok not absolutely every line but most of the main character lines resulted in failure that ladies and gents in a nutshell is how you make a blockbuster moviein gwtw scarlet says to rett butler where shall i go what shall i do he replies frankly my dear i dont give a damn scarlets words fail in jacks final words to rose as he dies of cold are rose listen to me listen winning that ticket was the best thing that ever happened to me errthats nonsense hes dying he even jokes i dont know about you but i intend to write a strongly worded letter to the white star line about all this errfailif you want to know more and there is more just send a blank check tome,sad
one harsh film critic memorably called this film in his opinion a wet blanket in my personal opinion james camerons at the very least borders on a great film a great love story is intertwined into the tragedy of this longish but never boring film all in all it is not only an excellently entertaining film but probably both kate winslet  leonardo decaprios finest hour whether or not a rich highsociety woman would be capable of falling in love with a poor steerage passenger who won the money to buy his ticket playing poker in real life is debatable but i was able to suspend my disbelief leonardo decaprio plays a young man called jack dawson who is an aspiring artist  is excellent although from a workingclass background he is worldlywise  has been around he meets rose dewitt kate winslet after he saves her life when she attempts to commit suicide she is intended mainly at her mothers insistence to marry a man named cal hockley played by billy zane rose doesnt really love him  things have started to get on top of her mr hockley is rich but such an upperclass scumbag that you cannot really blame rose for contemplating topping herself the courtship on board the ship between rose  jack is great  often done to the haunting theme music in the background which adds to the romance the cinematography by russell carpenter is absolutely beautiful  is probably the single best factor of the entire movie the filming of the ship striking an iceberg  eventually sinking is particularly well done my final comment concerns the closing credits as celine dion sings my heart will go on everybody it seems from the films smallest bitplayer extras down to mr camerons tea lady gets a mention in the credits which really do go on  on  on the number of people listed but not credited in the cast list is utterly astounding  i couldnt help wondering what if anything they were paid,sad
a friend asked me will the movie look exactly the same as 1997s version  i spontaneously told him well the ship will still be sinking ha ha but seriously its an unforgettable experience and definitely worth seeing james cameron invites us to revisit the rms and thiz time in 3d and you know what i still get goosebumps ever since the first 10 minutes i saw thiz movie i admit that everyone can make a review on surely everyone has something to say about thiz movie its not just that the ship is gigantic but also literally big as a movie the director james cameron did explore almost everything the real tragic event with the latest forensic science and one of the most beautiful stories ever told thiz is the man who brought you aliens 1986 terminator 2 judgment day 1991 and avatar 2009 a simple adventurer jack leonardo dicaprio won a ticket in a lucky hand at poker for the journey of a lifetime where he meets a desperate aristocrat rose kate winslet who suffers anguish after being forced to marry a rich steel tycoon cal hockley billy zane the journey is going to change their lives forever the other cast members are kathy bates bill paxton frances fisher victor garber and bernard hill as captain edward james smith the cinematography is splendid what i do remember is the dynamic camera movements the afternoon sunshine the wind the wave everything im always impressed by how they capture the moment of im flying scene when jack teaches rose how to step over the big ships prow and spread her arms wide the chemistry seems so natural and sincere the love story is compelling in every possible way its like romeo and juliet kind of thing you jump i jump is also one of my absolute favorite moments yes we do care about jack and rose the elderly rose who is played by gloria stuart also deserves mention for her memorable performance stuart successfully brings the story alive with her powerful storytelling the song from celine dion my heart will go on is not just great but its legendary once again it is worth watching in 3d although thiz rerelease version is the conversion result from 2d standard material to 3d but its your best chance to experience the magical wonder which feels like youre actually standing on the deck of one day you can proudly tell your kids or even grandchildren that you saw in the theater yes thiz will be a historic moment i have to say i love the ending its one of the greatest ending scenes in cinematic history spoiler alert after the elderly rose passes away in afterlife somehow shes young again and meets the love of her life jack at staircase in the main lobby of the then theyre just kissing its so sweet and overwhelming the movie reminds us that nothing is eternal but still a specific moment can be eternal in our hearts so are you ready to go back to visit my blog on jonnys movee httpjonnyfendiblogspotcom,sad
after all the hype some friends of mine did about this movie and considering i saw only the last scenes a couple times i did everything i could to get this movie on cinema sadly it stayed in my city for only 2 weeks and i could see it only today i had to go to a city 2 hours away from mine to catch this in the first scenes i could see some cheesy lines and overacting mainly from dicrapio and paxton after the first hour the cheesy lines became less aggressive and i could stop remembering all the time that it is just a movie the story is so well done that you feel inside the ship they made a 3 hours plot so interesting and entertaining that you feel the movie just ended too fast the relationship between the main couple although repeating the same old formula from romeo and juliet seems so realistic that we get jealous and want to have the same feeling they have unfortunately its not that easy to find someone you truly like in real life one remarkable quote is when jack says winning that ticket was the best thing that ever happened to me you see jack was suffering with cold and about to die but he still thought that dying would be worth it after the strong love they had which is in my opinion one of the most emotional lines in cinema history special effects are also quite good some scenes are impossible to explain how theyve been built 3d or not the story is all completely sad and painful to imagine and youll probably be very sad after seeing the whole picture but will make you cherish your life even more people can say whatever they like about but this is still a beautiful movie to enjoy and comment with your friends for the rest of your life do your best to catch this on screen,sad
the recent trend of converting old films to 3d and rereleasing them theatrically has kept me in an almost constant state of recollection the experience of seeing james camerons 3d has put me back into that state and for the time being it ranks as the most vivid the most powerful and the most personal of any 3d rerelease ive seen it called to mind my days as a teenage historian very much of the amateur division and to an even stronger degree my talent for drawing which i sadly gave up on most of all it called to mind memories of seeing the film for the first time in december of 1997 and watching it win the oscar for best picture and become the most financially successful movie ever made  only to be surpassed twelve years later by avatar again directed by james cameronfifteen years have passed and my interest in the ship itself has dimmed for the purposes of watching the 3d rerelease this is actually a good thing i was now better able to appreciate the film on narrative and emotional levels as a fourteenyearold i responded mainly to its technical aspects not the least of which was the work that went into recreating the ship cameron strove for excruciating detail and it paid off with a combination of fullsized set replicas various scale models and computer generated imagery he brought the ship back to life i still respond to all this as a twentyeightyearold but now i see so much more namely how the film is a beautiful and engrossing romantic melodrama each character fits so neatly into an archetype that they all seem to belong within the pages of a beloved storybookthis is one of the few films ive seen in which so many individual shots resonate with power a few are sweeping and majestic as when the camera pulls back from leonardo dicaprio standing on the railing at the prow of the ship it rises up zooming above the bridge and the sun deck cuts through a plume of smoke billowing from one of the funnels and continues until it passes the stern at which point we watch it momentarily sailing off onto the horizon most are haunting as when the ship has already sank and kate winslet surfaces for air the camera pulls back from her gradually revealing a sea of hapless passengers screaming and fighting to stay afloat in the frigid waters of the north atlanticthe list goes on theres the moment when the camera quickly zooms backwards down a hallway as water rushes in casing doors to fly off their hinges theres the first shot of the massive rudder and propellers emerging from the water as the ship sinks bowfirst theres the scene where torrents of water finally break through the glass dome over the grand staircase theres the shot of a steerage passenger comforting her children with a religious fable as they lie in bed for she knows that they never had a chance at making it off the sinking ship alive there are the ships final death throes beginning when it dramatically breaks in two and ending with the stern briefly floating on the water vertically the passengers falling and bumping against railings and then theres the scene in which a lifeboat rows through a sea of frozen bodies we immediately take notice of a mother clutching her infant to her chestthat the film is a triumph of sheer spectacle there can be no question i knew that back in 1997 what i gradually picked up on over years of home viewings and what i finally realized upon seeing it once again on the big screen is just how good this movie is at being a love story is high romance in the best possible sense  a tale of starcrossed lovers and secrets that stay buried in time only to be uncovered by outside forces ive been critical of camerons screen writing skills specifically in regards to dialogue for which he has a tin ear in the case of part of the charm is that the dialogue is as overtly theatrical as the plot you listen to the characters talk and know youre being immersed in a style thats intended to be heightened and oldfashionedapart from the fact that weve now reached the centennial of the ships sinking the main selling point of this rerelease is of course the 3d the process has its moments of effectiveness the bestlooking scenes are the ones with rows of people standing at various distances from the camera but in general the new 3d effects dont generate a significant sense of depth and the brightness is noticeably reduced the most disappointing scenes in terms of dimension are the sinking and the presentday expedition of the wreck i understand camerons enthusiasm for 3d which he has been vocal about although i wonder if he realizes that he already had a masterpiece and that the conversion was unnecessary i didnt need an extra dimension to appreciate 3d the story the characters and the technical authenticity are more than enough chris pandolfi wwwatatheaternearyounet,sad
this movie in my opinion deserves nothing less than 8 stars because it is such a masterpiece it definitely showed the tragedy of the because the whole sinking of the in the movie was done in such detail that you really learned and could feel how tragic it was for most men to come on here and write bad reviews about this movie just dont because the romance between jack and rose was for girls and to make the movie a romantic tragedy making it a romantic tragedy made the movie more sad so we could feel even more how much of a tragedy it was men obviously dont like romance like that but the way the did the sinking scene was fabulous i am a girl so i loved the romance between jack and rose and i think that it truly added more to the movie because you have to have a story line for a movie that you dont want to make a documentary the story line was amazing because back then everything was about if you are 1st class 2nd class or 3rd class and you could really see how the 3rd class people were treated compared to the 1st class people because jack was a very very poor 3rd class man and rose was a 1st class woman engaged to such a wealthy man if you are a guy you wont really like the romance story line but that doesnt make it a bad movie if you are a girl i would definitely recommend watching this movie i did cry a lot so be prepared if you are someone who does cry during movies,sad
this is a great movie even though not all people agree i was lucky enough to catch a final screening in 3d on the exact month and date sank april 15th even though having rewatched the movie on dvd numerous times the ship and story never gets old to me this is james camerons best work yes better than avatari will leave the story and characters to other reviewers who can express more colorfully about how great this movie is no in this review i want to talk about 3d now note here that this is my first 3d cinematic experience so i cant compare with other movies however i have read a lot of articles concerning this issue and would like to express my own thought the 3d was okay it didnt leave me with headaches but it also didnt catch up to my expectation sure there was some wow 3d moments but it wasnt quite necessary i am sure that i would have enjoyed the same amount without 3dall in all great film,sad
well as the wreck i never planned to a night like this was released in 1997 and i didnt watch it in theater then i think i must have said something like this whats the point to see it as we already know how it ends not very bright but as shown in the movie thats what life is about to change for the better then i caught it on tv at its maiden broadcast in 1999 and i found it great indeed but seven years after when i began writing reviews for imdb in 2004 it wasnt still on my list because my first task was to review all my dvds so now seven years later i finally watched and reviewed them all and i intended that my 500th review marks my last ones to discover what they are just wait and read my 501th review coming nextbut yesterday saturday 14th april 2012 exactly 100th year after its wreck i admit that was heavy on my mind for us westerners was symbolic the biggest machine man built never made it i cant say if its babel tower all over again but all its story leads to the unavoidable meeting of this ship and this iceberg its thousand victims are the first ranking peacetime tragedy in humankind indeed was indeed the summit because western civilization never got higher later however i still didnt want to see it that day on 3d screen because i planned to see it with my family next week when we will be again together dont worry i will travel by train but as my fridge was empty and i had to go out my idea was to go in a bookshop before and buy one good book about and keep the ticket as well but there wasnt any special offers at the biggest one in paris hopefully i could try another one at champselyses that was also close to a foodstore  and a theaterincidentally i just took a look at the programing and see that 3d was on screen one hour later at 20h40 so if i would watch it now it will be nearly at the same time that it sank one hundred years before it was like all the victims resonated in me and i just bought the ticket and stepped into my first screen viewing of this titani think all the names the had can be also given to this movie wonderful modern outstanding and unsinkable as well its one of the best movie ever released and im sure it will be celebrated even a century awayi cant name another movie that blends so much history romance and technology cameron and his crew gives so much to get us on the boat and in the same time crafts a powerful love story if a lot have been said about dicaprio winslet is phenomenal as well in all cases its moving to see a such strong love and what they shared for hours in this flamboyant daylight before the wreck worths lifetime but the story is also a sincere classes critic and its good to have a writerdirector to give voices to the poors or the women conditions its also a formidable testimony of courage for all those braves who stayed on board to help and to finally wait for death her captain her designer gugenheim well theres a lot to experience in such compartmentalized place and it has been anointed with a last grace horners score is one of the best heard ever and really gives a beating heart to the moviethe final reunion with jack waiting rose at the staircase surrounded with all those brave souls is a definitive moment of filmmaking and its another memory of a vibrant final moment that i keep in mind among blade runnergodfather iii knowing and blood diamondswell i take a look at the hour 2h20 in the morning on 15 april 2012 at this time went exactly deep under and actually i must say that im all frozen as well because i wanted to write that review windows open to let the chilly april night enter my room and experience a bit the cold that they faced a century agowell i suppose i wouldnt be there for her 200th birthday but i hope that my heart will go on for hundred reviews like thoserip,sad
well nothing much as a review that i could write about the movie as i was too small too watch it the first time it released in 1997 when i first saw this movie i was aboard a cruise liner in asia pacific with my friends and fell in love with it completely i must say that we did try all the stunts in the movie on the cruise as well  when the movie released in 3d i could not give it a miss at all the drama and the story grips you completely when you watch it in a theatre you get sucked into the movie right from the scene when older rose starts with her story of the sound and scenes makes the movie a memorable one no wonder it won 11 oscarsthank you mr cameron for the wonderful experience in 3d,sad
never ceases to amaze the acting is incredible the scenery breathtaking the special effects especially how fades into life from a hulking wreck nevertheless its a difficult film to watch with such catastrophic and tragic loss of life unlike werner herzogs cave of forgotten dreams i do not think that 3d really adds anything to the film so much so that i barely noticed it at all except perhaps for the first few scenes except perhaps that it got people into movie theatres a second time only one scene in the film has been changed the star field that rose looks up at while floating on the driftwood has been altered to reflect the correct view for that date and time,sad
first of all i was overwhelmed with nostalgia when i learned that1997 is returning to theatres it is a favourite movie of mine hearkening back to those years when i was a relatively young unspoilt kid who had no idea what the big bad world was like i was an 11 year old boy when was released on march 1998 here in india i had went to see being impressed by the huge ship the story  my father had booked tickets at globe cinema hallesplanade kolkata now closeda week beforehand but my mother learning about certain scenes  persuaded my father to return the tickets but as desperate i was back then to see the filmi had quietly removed the tickets from his office bag and hid it when he learned of it instead of scolding me he decided to keep the tickets i remember feeling extremely awkward during the painting and the car scene trying to hide my eyes and still daring to peer through my fingers but moved me totally it was a wonderful romantic film and the power of love and the inevitable tragedy had brought tears to my 11 year old self back then and oh the music i remember when the movie had finished and the credits started rolling with the famous song everyone was exiting the theatre i was stuck there  with tears frozen in my cheeks unable to move unwilling to leave i felt so lost so saddened the tag line really hit home for me  nothing on earth could come between them some of my friends have found the movie to be nothing more than a disaster picture some have found it to be a moving love story that is universal watching the 3d version was reliving those memories it wasnt as affecting as it was back in 98 but it was surely nostalgic the 3d postconversion was brilliant i mean really good but i imagine it to look no less better in its original 2d version though the 3d was never distracting it felt almost as good as that of avatardepth was stunning and the newly 4k restored print sparkled with fine details but now my big complaint spoiler ahead  the nudesketching scene of rose was unjustly and badly censored any instances of kate winslets breast or lower torso was removed zoomedin panscanned even the kiss after rose says thank you and takes the painting was cut it totally put me off i lost my interest in watching the movie they raped the artistic integrity of the movie right there it was such a beautiful and sweet scene i read reports that the censor board of india passed the film uncut hence i was shocked to see such abominable censoring but then this is not just india this is a part of india the state of west bengal and anything can happen hereis a womans body still an object of shame well i dont know if the particular cinema owners did that or not which i doubt but still this is by all accounts unacceptable i guess most of you living outside india at least in the us uk aus eu are lucky enough to see the movie in an unraped form however in spite of all this the charm of the movie remains undeniable even after fourteen years98 release in indiai watched it on 10th april 2012 exactly a hundred years after the ship sailed from southampton april 10th 1912 and intend on catching it once again on the 15th a hundred years after it sankapril 15th 1912 may all the souls who perished on the night find peace and all those whose lives were changed forever after the disaster and rip gloria stuart ,sad
its a pretty good movie all around the story line is interesting and draws you in and make you think i love all the music and the actors as well the movie is just a little too long but still one of the best movies of all time 20 years from now it will still be worth seeing and still a tear jerker no one should miss seeing this movie it makes you want to know more about the and what happen all those years ago its a lesson teacher in so many ways not just a love story if you miss it then you have missed a winneri cant see why anyone wouldnt want to see this movie its far from boring just imagine thats you or your love one on that ship and what would you do would you be able to handle it as i stated the only downer was the time it was a little too long for my liking,sad
frankly speaking i wasnt a crazy fan of the film but its no doubt that titanis in 3d attracts everyones attention and im one of them no other film ever compares the story even though containing some clich and flawstouched my heart deeply and with the fantastic 3d effect i felt myself sinking with other passengerslove is eternal so many affecting scenes drove me to tearsjack hold rose on the board and made her feel like flying at the moment rose smiled so sweetly and sincerelyrose sat in the dinghy and couldnt divert her eyes from jackthey gazed upon each other as if no one else aroundand suddenly rose jumped back to the ship and ran to jackshe preferred to die rather than leave jack behindduring the last minutes of sinking an old couple peacefully lied in bed and held each other in handthere are untold impressive moments in this film they show us how beautiful love is and how strong humans heart iscritics may argue that the romantic story is far from realitybut we still believe in itour hope for love will never die,sad
i watch this movie with this with great enthusiasm in 3d but it dont reach that vigor and value of effects as in avatar 3d as i consider that james would repeat such great effects in this movie but it looks like same old movie well we are watching lot of 3d movies completely shot in 3d we always expect the thrill delivered by effects none of it meant as it on screen i mean may be james want to show this movie again under the name of 3d but my valued suggestion if anyone have not watched this movie go watch it now but for 3d dont go it will leave you faded faces and boring talks lets well i may hope that in future may be if jc is willing to rerelease any such kind of movies he better may think of effects side,sad
15 years ago when was released i was just about a 89 years old kid with no taste of movies mainly into comedy ones and the parental control of course so it was obviously i didnt catch it in cinema  years later i grew older and as it was the teenage days so watching it was mainly for the famous painting scene it was the first and only one time i ever watched regardless the countless repeating times on the tv besides the wide availability on the internet now with the rerelease of in 3d i decided to give it a shot although i usually hate the postproduction 3d conversion and let me choose my words carefully i admit this was the most immersive movie experience i had in a very long time forget about the 3d which im not a big fan of it but watching in cinema is beyond imagination i walked out totally enchanted and couldnt help myself from whistling james horners music over and over again this is definitely a mustsee in cinema,sad
ts very beautiful this film this film is actually watching i did not think any then i liked this film when i see the this film i actually do not know why but i never regretted any because its great i found very successful for all players and this film and and i also enjoyed watching the dubbing reality players event and everything else very beautiful really very creative i would recommend this film my friends i hope they are very like also i liked the films end because because the players showed individual and that love is  i impressed so that most the love by member,sad
firsti guess it was the best movie of james cameroons and i love and i love their big storywhen i saw this moviei excited because decaprio was at this movie also kate winslet was at this movietoo but i didnt know winslet when i watched but i impressed from her because she was great when i watchedi criedof course is the best love story i have ever seen the effects are perfectplayers and team are perfecttooi think it isnt just romance movieit is more than romance or tragedyand is going to be cinema at 6th of novemberim excited for watch againreallythe movie is a perfection,sad
is 1 all time at the box office for a reason what is that reason what is it about this film that makes three hours in a cinema pass so quickly its not the suspense of not knowing what will happen next after all history tells us in graphic detail the fate of neither is it what happens to rose i mean the mere fact that rose tells the story as a hundred and one year old woman tells us that she survives so what is it about this film that makes it so enjoyable well its five things really 1 the romance between rose kate winslet and jack leonardo dicaprio 2 does jack survive 3 the gradual realization of the fate of and how it takes place told with historical accuracy 4 the remarkably accurate detail of the ships whole interior 5 the special effects used during the sinking all in all forget about the films supposed lack of technical excellence poor storyline and trite dialogue and concentrate instead on the splendid entertainment on offer thanks to james camerons splendid direction the superb cinematography and the excellence of the two leads,sad
its been 14 years and i am still nostalgia with this love movieevery time when the prelude of my heart will go on played all of the beautiful scenes will automatically and slowly play through my mind it is like a story belonging to a very distant past and no longer exist any moreyoung leonardo and kate are really perfect couple jack and rose they are full of passionstrong and honestdare you chase for your love by losing your life dare you say to your lover that you jump i jumpthink it over dare you maybe we are looking for love or we have been engaged or married to someonebut most of us lost romantic sensewe seldom taste the favor that love brings to uswellthis movie really recall my memories about young loveso beautifulcant wait for 3d,sad
is by far the best movie i have ever seen it has something for everyone theres romance disaster art history and family all mixed together i first saw this movie a few years ago when i was home alone on a saturday night i was looking through my movie shelf and saw i had seen parts of it before and never thought much of it however do to my high level of boredom i figured id watch it i thought well it is the highest grossing film of all time why not i went into it not expecting much i knew it would be decent but i had no idea how blown away i would be from the very start i was sucked into it the music played at the very beginning was so sad and breathtaking that i knew this movie was going to bring me to tears i was blown away at the sets they looked so real and just like the real the dresses rose wore were so beautiful i thought the acting was good i have seen better but it does do a justice i loved kate winslet as rose and leonardo dicaprio as jack they work so well together the love story was unbelievably convincing i thought billy zane portrayed his character perfectly last but not least who could forget kathy bates as molly brown she stole the show for me next the music the music is by far the most beautiful score i have ever heard from the irish bagpipes to sissels stunning vocals you will be blown away if you cannot already tell i love this movie the romance was great and it made me tear up even before the ship hits the iceberg so naturally i was bawling when jack died kate winslets acting at that part was the best of hers in the whole film when she cried jack jack theres a boat jack i just lost it the sound of her voice told you that she just wanted to die the one good thing in her life had gone and she was devastated it was very convincing the sinking of the ship was great as well i like how cameron spent a good hour plus on the sinking he did it slow just like it should have been i have no problem with this movie being over 3 hours many complain but i think the movie would not be as good without that length cameron said himself he wanted to develop jack and roses relationship before the sinking to show people that the ship was lively and magnificent in order to make the sinking more devastating i never got bored throughout the film it always keeps me entertained oh and one thing i need to clear up jack could not have fit on the floating door with rose if you watched closely you will see that he tried to get on with her but it tipped over it couldnt hold their weight so jack was a gentleman and saved roses life over his in addition rose was not literally promising she would never let go on jack she was talking about how she would never let go of the promise she made to jack which was to go on in her life have children and die an old lady warm in her bed overall this movie is stunning and deserved all the awards it got dont let someone out there keep you from watching it because they say its overrated or because rose was a  you will not regret watching this,sad
i find it so amazing that even after all these years we are still talking about this movie obviously this movie wasnt that bad or else people wouldnt even bother to talk about it i personally enjoyed this film immensely and still do i guess this film isnt for everyone but it certainly did touch the hearts of manyas for those that think that this film is overrated or overhypedwell we only have the moviegoing public to thank for that lol you see its not criticsarticle writers that make a film huge or a hit with the general moviegoing public people make the film a huge success with everyone was in awe lets face it a film like this had never been made before at least not with the type of special effects needed to really capture the essence of the ship actually sinking this film is so accurate that even james cameron timed the actual sinking of the ship in the film with the real sinking that fateful day in april 1912 even the silverware for goodness sakes matched give this movie a break you guys the critics thought this movie would sink big time when this movie actually came out and people started hearing by word of mouth which is the best form of advertisement mind you that this was a gooddecentmovie worth seeing then everyone started flocking to the theaters in droves to see this movienot once not twice but maybe 3 times and more so i really wouldnt say that this movie was overhypedat least not like the buildup for the matrix reloaded or the hulk is being overhyped ha critics didnt even think that would make enough money to cover camerons gigantic film budget that it took to make this mammoth of a film however the films money took care of that 200 million budget and much more personally i love this film however this film might not be for everyone dont say that this film sucks just because of romance though that is the most sexist thing ive ever heard disliking a movie just because it has romance in it the story was sweet the dialogue could have been better but lets face itthe real star of the movie wasnt leo or kateit was that gigantic ship i think all of the actors including dicaprio and winslet did a fine job its not their best work ive seen much better work from both of them but it wasnt the worst ive seen on screen before give them a break,sad
to all the miserable people who have done everything from complain about the dialogue the budget the this and the thatwho wants to hear it if you missed the point of this beyondbeautiful movie thats your loss the rest of us who deeply love this movie do not care what you think i am a thirthysomething guy who has seen thousands of movies in my life and this one stands in its own entity in my book it was not supposed to be a documentary or a completely factual account of what happened that night it is the most amazing love story ever attempted i know that it is the cynical 90s and the millennium has everyone in a tizzy but come on someone on this comments board complained that it made too much money how lame is that it made bundles of money in every civilized country on the planet and is the top grossing film in the planet i will gladly side with the majority this time around okay cynics time to crawl back under your rock i am done,sad
that preposterously beautiful film made in 1997 with a very young leonardo di caprio and kate winslet james camerons magnum opus continues to impress especially when viewed yet again on new years day 2012  a fifteen year old film that remains one of the most impressive cinematic achievements from hollywood one of the many reasons it remains resonant is the manner in which the film addresses class systems  the wealthy versus the poor is a hot topic today and the film shows us why  and the extraordinary cinematic recreation of the sinking of that mighty shipbut for many the manner in which cameron sets the tone of the story the reminiscence of the elderly rose unraveling the tale to her granddaughter and crew of ship keldysh attempting to raise the now 84 years on the bottom of the ocean and carrying that theme through the course of the film seems more cogent today than even at movies release gloria stewart is radiant as the old rose and her rapt audience includes bill paxton suzy amis lewis abernathy nicholas cascone and anatoly m sagalevitch from there the opulence of the unsinkable unfolds and the gradual love affair between rose bukater kate winslet and poor artist jack dawson leonardo di caprio a relationship at risk from the brewings of roses mother frances farmer and roses intended billly zane the cruise lasted from april 10 1912 to april 15 1912 but it was a lifetime of commitment between the young loversin retrospect the performances by some fine actors who would continue to rise is of note ioan gruffudd victor garber david warner danny nucci etc the film could have used some editing to reduce the length and the presence of the unsinkable molly brown kathy bates in a wasted role though historically accurate ads very little to the film and even distracts a bit still is just that   and no matter how many times we see it it never fails to impress grady harp,sad
is a movie that will never happen again a love story that is timeless with some scenes that you will never forget the doomed ship called the unsinkable ship is the back drop for a love story that is unforgettable james cameron directs an amazing film which made stars out of leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet it is one you will not forget there is very little action but the social divide that comes between the main characters and one that they must overcome in order to be together is a movie that you will watch again and again and it will amaze you more and more each time the lovers come together and you know it can never last as everybody knows the fate of the a must see for romance adventure and history it deserves its place in movie history,sad
based off of the true sinking of the steam liner in 1912 james camerons 1996 is a tragic love story of two teenagers who fall in love on the tragic ship rose dewitt bukater rose is a firstclass passenger who is engaged to a wealthy man named cal while jack dawson is a third class passenger who with his best friend won his boarding ticket in a lucky hand of poker while rose tries to commit suicide because of her unhappy life jack stops her and from then their friendship begins it quickly turns into a romance after rose sees what an exciting life she could be living as a thirdclass passenger although her fianc tries to keep her away from him rose still manages to stay with jack up until the very end as hits an iceberg and slips away into the darkness unfortunately jack makes rose promise that she will never give up hope and he eventually dies from the extreme coldthis movie has gotten nothing but endless criticism but the fact is that it is a movie for the ages the movie has numerous messages but the central one is the ability to trust a complete stranger with your life even in the darkest and most terrifying of times the first time you see this movie it completely changes the way you perceive things about not only love but about life two strangers from different social classes fall in love on a ship after only knowing each other for a few days despite all their differences and difficulties they manage to stay together until the very end this movie proves that trust conquers everythingleonardo dicaprio and kate winslet fit into their roles wonderfully kate who plays rose is able to transition into the role of a damsel in distress perfectly leonardo who plays jack has a trusting face and charming appeal both are able to pull of their roles beautifully and are very excellent actors billy zane who plays the evil but charming cal puts some tension in the movie which makes the story only more suspenseful as it already itjames cameron created a film that is so moving that still to this date is one of the highest grossing films of all time only being beaten by the film avatar which was also a james cameron production there are a countless number of love stories that all have the same happily ever after ending but this story has a twist and it might play a part to the movie being so memorable this movie brought a whole new interest in not only the horrible tragedy that unfolded in that fateful spring morning of 1912 but also to romance of these two lovers who everyone believes are true historical factsevery time i watch this movie i see or learn something new it is the only movie that i will always remember about because it moves me in ways that words cannot describe james cameron makes us feel deeply about ideas and things we rarely dare to imagine and therefore i give this movie a 1010 rating,sad
i dont care what this so called critics think about this filmpersonally i fell that this is the greatest movie ever made in the entire film industry of this planeta touching and a memorable love story that every one keeps in their minds and a true incident of a disaster told in very heart full wayi think everyone watched dis movie will justify thatam just disappointed to see such a low rating given to this filmthere are many films imdb with ratings above 9 that doesnt come any where near to this filmi dont want to name those films but this a true injustice done to this film after giving a true film for us to keep in our minds for the rest our lifes,sad

there has been so many movies about the before but what makes this one stand so high above the rest is that it actually brings the audience in where it no longer feels like another fact based story that we all know about it becomes much more than that i can appreciate some peoples criticism over the movie being based on 2 fictional characters and that they feel it overshadowed the sinking of the great ship but in my opinion thats why we as an audience feel so overwhelmed with these 2 characters we get to learn what it was like for the poor as well as the rich and many people lost their loved ones that night so really i feel that the ship was full of rose and jacks i admit it really takes off when the ship hits the iceberg and it was great to follow these characters right until the ship sinks james cameron has done a brilliant job of bringing the audience in because you find yourself constantly asking what if that was me i feel that this movie certainly does the ship and all those actual people on it justice its a tragic reminder of what they actually went through fantastic movie and i dont want to spoil this movie completely but you really need your tissues at the end,sad
over the years many have tried hard to criticize this film but if you will give your naughty mind a little rest then you can easily accept that its a masterpiece james cameroon have done tremendous labor to make this film look so good and actors of course have done a mind blowing job throughout the movie lets start with leonardo dicaprio well everyone knows that he has got some serious acting skills because it wasnt the first film where he has given a outstanding performance and the same thing goes with the kate winslet she looked one hell of a beauty i know many of you out there would have thought how can anyone look so its tough to describe how well she looked in this movie anyways for those who have not seen this movie yet or who did not liked this moviethere is something seriously wrong with you guys,sad
spoiler warningsince watching avatar again recently its worth taking a retrospective look at some of james camerons other works most notably his previous record breaking filmnow being a wee bit cynical and not fond of romance my instinct would normally be to dismiss this movie as awful and condemn it to the lowest pits of hell despite this i wont i can see that there is some truly brilliant filmmaking that has gone onthe first and most notable example is the settingthe is recreated with incredible detail and attention to accuracy from the sets to the costume department the design team really outdid themselves working from historical records and photos produced from hours and hours of extensive research speaking as someone with an interest in history i can safely say that their homework really showsthe score does a good job of adding a sense of drama to the movie itself and against all the odds james horners celtic take of the hammy and overdone and celine dion track my heart will go on manages to work well the soundtrack does add to give a great sense of place and together with the visual setting adds some strong atmospherethe characters vary some being well portrayed others two dimensional billy zanes character in particular seemed the threatening villain but managed to bring a vague sense of sly charm to him the heroine of rose had the best character arc as her aristocratic identity is gradually pulled away coming to a head to reveal astounding bravery when she goes deep into the ship to rescue an incarcerated jack as it begins to sinkthe jack character however seemed more of an everyman but his romantic and artistic wandering drifter character seems to be something of a character that had been seen before despite that and his blatantly 90s boy band haircut he is well portrayedthe historical social divisions are well represented as the glamour and uptight attitudes of the upper classes contrast greatly with the boisterous and energetic lower class and not just with the passengers the contrast between the buttoned up officers and the coal shovelling stokers and engineers are only glimpsed but offer a similar picture in short a broad picture of the ship and everyone residing on board is well represented despite the focus of the romantically charged main storylinethe scale of the tragedy is also extremely well done as it builds up to the inevitable climax turning from an initial creeping inevitability to a raging force of destruction with people helpless to do anything to prevent itits also incredibly well shot many stand out in memory in particular the one where rose is standing alone in a corridor shouting for anyone to hear her others include the water beginning to creep slowly along the floor the smashing plates as the ship tips and a transition from her sketch being drawn back to the present day rose recalling the event all of which is evidence of excellent cinematography and filmmakingdespite the atmospheric and broad picture painted this is by no means a perfect film the melodrama of the romance and some of the more famous moments come off as cheesy and youre less likely to be moved by their romantic aspirations its most famous scenes having been parodied into oblivion probably adds to this this and the fact that it made a ton of money are two main reasons why is disliked as much as it isthere is also some corniness in the irish element of the third class while their dancing and partying shown part way through the film does add a sense of fun and relief from the stuffy upper class it comes across as a bit too cheesy at times as romanticised irish in hollywood had been done repeatedly many times before 1997 so by then it was an overused clichoverall this is a very well made movie and if you look beyond the clichs or the schmaltz then you will see that this is a movie does have a greater depth of artistic worthiness than youd expect,sad
okay so down to brass tacks this movie was awesome james cameron did pretty darn well with it really i dont know where to begin so this three and a half hour long movie is worth your while it contains superb acting from every actor in the move heck even the careerwasted billy zane did a superb jobthe historical accuracy was something i really liked in this movie although ive never actually seen any plans of the layout of the in this movie i have a feeling that the geography of the ship and even the decor was almost spot on with the originaland the plot was very good shakespeare would be proud as the man once said brevity is the soul of wit translation keep it simple a simple plot will almost always break through for you of course with cases like inception you can make a complex plot and still follow through but back to i know some might think well yeah its a solid plot it was based off an actual event well yes this is true it is based off an event but the ship sinking more follows the setting than it does the plot the first two hours of the movie is just about the characters and the developing love story the slow buildup causes tension and we really want to discover what happens when a crisis occurs making even the scene where everyone dies dramatic at its simplestnow if theres anything wrong with this movie its the length i know that every minute of the movie is vital to the plot this is true but at times you begin to really feel the length all in all this movie is probably the standard for where most movies should be at it was overhyped by my friends i just watched it for the first time but still was a damn good movie910,sad
i saw this movie for the first time when i was six years old and it has been a part of me since there was just something about that has stuck with me for the past 14 years the romance the excitement and the looming disaster still draws me in every time i know almost every line i still them recite to whoever im watching it with and even though ive seen it like 1000 times i still get teary eyes when rose promises jack that shell never let go i love the honesty in the characters fear it pulls you in until you can feel it yourself i love this movie it brings such a memorable and lovable story out of one of the saddest parts of history a little side note leo is totally hot,sad
i first watched this film when i was probably around 10 or 11 and it was the very first film that made me cry ill never forget it i would always wonder why people would get so sentimental over films i always thought its so silly to cry over a movie its not real however when i witnessed jack die and watched as rose watched jack her cold lifeless lover frozen over by the deep blue atlantic drift off and descend to the bottom of the ocean until he couldnt be seen anymore the tears just wouldnt stop the way i felt and the impact the film had on me all those years ago im 18 now was so significant that i havent forgotten the film if someone were to strike up a conversation about the film now i could join in and recall every detail of the lengthy film that i only watched once i got to see what real true honest fearless love was in this film leonardo and kate were superb this film is definitely a must see and was and always will be a true classic,sad
seeing as is one of the most financially successful films of all time and whose storyline is know by almost everybody i have decided not to base this review so much on the content of the film instead i would prefer to to look at how this movie is in fact something of a oneoff historicallythe uniqueness of in film history is down to a couple of interrelated things firstly it stands apart as being a picture that combines stateoftheart special effects technology within the framework of a romantic epic never before or since has this been done and it goes some way to explain the films phenomenal success this leads onto the other element of that is unusual  the fact that a megabudget blockbuster was quite clearly aimed primarily at women again in the age of the blockbuster this tactic is just not the done thing james cameron has always been an action film director who is very femaleaware from aliens through to avatar his movies always feature unusually strong women in central roles often as the main identifiable action figure so perhaps its not therefore surprising that with cameron should create the ultimate femalecentric specialeffects blockbuster this approach paid off of course women especially went in droves to see it and the film went supernova at the boxofficefor the first half of the film we have a romance a crossclass romance that is doomed from the start in the same way as we all know the famous ocean liner is the parallels between these two story lines ultimately compliment each other  the love story gives the disaster a personal edge while in turn the disaster gives the love story an epic tragic quality the first time i watched the film i thought the romantic plot was an unnecessary and annoying addition the second time i began to understand that it gives the film an emotional basis that it feeds off i now have a great deal more respect for this most unfashionable and often vilified of hollywood movies its uniqueness in film history too in terms of its approach and audience demographic is also something worth at least a little respect its unusual combination of specialeffects driven action with periodset romance is not likely to be repeated very soon and therefore will at the very least remain a oneoff in film history,sad
viewing james camerons film today i was six when i first saw this film i have mixed emotions about it when you look at it from an entertainment point of view the film fits the bill perfectly and offers both a substantial love story for the girls and a great build up of action for the guys that occurs around the last hour or so of the filmi also give credit where credit is due i do believe it does have a good fictional storyline full of emotion and cameron intertwined the factual characters in the story rather nicely also the sets are incredible replicating almost to a t the special effects were also incredibly well done and at times quite astounding cameron also does a fairly good job at recreating the atmosphere of that night with an excellent score to back it up composed by the very talented james horner from a critical point of view from someone who is quite obsessed with the subject the film is a tad unoriginal not because ive seen this story done before but because certain story elements just are for one the story itself is a standard hollywood formula possibly too hollywood for my liking repeating the tale of star crossed loverstwo people who can never be together because they are from different worlds two because it channels both the 1943 nazi propaganda film and the 1960 mgm film the last voyage maybe it was coincidental but nevertheless it seems to be a reimagining in the 1943 version henry must go back down to steerage to find his brother bobby who was arrested and imprisoned in a cell as the hallway continues to flood henry finds an axe to break down the cell doorin the last voyage cliff henderson and hank lawson are in the dining room as she begins to flood with wateri guess nowadays many film ideas are are recycled but at the same time some credit should be given to both these filmson another note entirely james horners score is quite possibly what makes this film so emotional unfortunately i feel that too much of this film rides on the coat tail of the love story and the music score what should be the main focus the story of the actual passengers and crew is too overshadowed by the love story you may want to ask yourself what is really moving me to tears take away the music and much of the emotional impact is gone as it is with most films personally i believe a film should be able to stand on its own by impacting the viewer without the accompaniment of music dont get me wrong i love a good score but the film should not have to rely on it like a crutch which i feel at times the film doesthe love story takes away also as it too overshadows the factual passengers and crew at times you get so caught up in the fictional storyline that you forget about the true story again the film should have been able to have stood on its own without the love story but it acts as a major crutch i know it was not their intentions to overshadow the true story but nevertheless it happened unintentionally however there are some very emotional scenes when james cameron does his tracking shots as you see all of the passengers running towards the stern and jumping off the decks of the ship cameron does this successfully and makes the viewer put themselves in a position to imagine what it must have been like for all of those people and what it would have been like to be on that ship yourself during the final moments aside from that i must point out that the last song the band played on the ship is debatable some claim it was nearer my god to thee while others claim it was a waltz known for short as autumn no matter what the final song was the fact that james cameron played the bethany version of this hymn is inaccurate cameron possibly used this because of how recognized this version is but if you are going to tell a true story i believe you should tell it accurately if anything the horbury version of this hymn would have been played as depicted in the film a night to remember as an eye witness vividly remembers this version being played sometime that night otherwise it would have been the propior deo version of the hymnlastly the final two things i have to mention one is the portrayal of first officer william murdoch he did not commit suicide as he was spotted in the water by wireless operator harold bride two the break up of the is a question of debate as new evidence and theories are arising which would contradict the portrayal of the break up in the filmin my final thoughts its hard to bring a true story to the big screen without having a fictional story to support it because lets face it for some the love story is the only thing that interests them when in all actuality this story has so much to offer without the use of fiction was a ship so technologically advanced for its time so big and powerful that man believed that they were victorious dominant and on top of the world however one night changed the fate of the world forever the tragic true story of the and its passenger and crew will forever be a story of morals including the ignorance of manjames camerons film is still a great motion picture aside from its flaws it may be overrated but you be the judge,sad
for as long as i can remember i have been fascinated with the story of the when i was a child i watched everything i could from tv documentaries to repeats of a night to remember i remember the excitement i felt when they finally found the sunken ship that had been missing for over 70 years so when i saw the first previews of james camerons movie about the in 1997 i was very interested in seeing it that was until i heard that it was going to be a love story once i heard that i was split on whether or not i wanted to see it however after reading more about the movie and the detail that was put into recreating the events of that fateful night my interest was renewed cameron did an excellent job of blending a fictional story albeit a love story with the actual stories of the his accurate use of facts such as a woman over hearing ismay suggesting to the captain to light the last boilers in that seen you can see a woman seated behind the two as she hears him tell the captain this another is the story of the chef who survived the sinking it is a well known fact that he was intoxicated at the time of the sinking and that witnesses say that he stayed on the ship until the very end but more importantly i believe that through the use of a love story that connects with the viewer cameron was able to tell the story of all the lives that where lost that night and the pain that they must have felt i know the movie made an impact on me and not because of the love story but because for the first time i saw the true story of the loss of life that happened that night,sad
the film is an american romancedisaster film created to bring attention to the untold stories of the passengers aboard the rmscamera angles used in the making put the viewer aboard the ship right along side of the other passengers the lighting and sound effects are used in a way that put the final touches on one of the greatest films ever made characters were chosen perfectly kate winslett playing rose dewitt bukater and leonardo dicaprio playing the drifter jack dawson the two play out a love story throughout the film in the midst of the tragedy of the sinking ship the director james cameron had his work cut out for him in making this film but he did a tremendous job,sad
let me start by saying that i watched camerons several times and each time with the same interest and feelings i am a male but this movie brings tears to my eyes every single time obviously not everybody is affected by it it as much as i was perhaps expecting to see a documentary rather then romance and a sad story wonderfully acted and filmed by the way one should realize that this is far from a clinical examination of how the most famous ocean liner actually sank but is really a story about love and devotion which just happens whether real or not to take place on a sinking ship i do not believe cameron intended to give an accurate account of an historical event here and i am surprised how some critics fail to realize thisso if youre looking for a historical documentary you wont find it here but if you like a very well made romantic movie some wonderful acting from winslet and dicaprio and a drama created by a sinking ship youve come to the right place,sad
was a movie that was based on the tragedy and a fictional love story the beginning of the film is interesting yet it lacks a little bit however as the film goes on and reaches the climax the film starts to make you feel worried and love the characters leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet did an awesome job playing the characters and james cameron really proved to be an awesome director the effects were so real and so awesome that there is no word this movie won the right deserved best picture title this is james camerons best film and the post converted 3d release in 2012 wont fail to capture the heart of fans,sad
is just fantastic everything about this film is just wonderful from the actors costumes sets music everything even the love story between jack and rose may not be true it just feels so real when watching the movie leonardo dicaprio is just wonderful his character jack is so sweet and lovely i am sure every girl wants a guy like jack who has it all kate winslet is just outoftheworld as character rose she gave an oscar winning performances in billy zane plays his character cal very well kathy bates plays her character molly brown who is a real character very very very well she was the right actress for the role all of the other cast members were fantasticmy favourite scenes are relives rose jumping off the heart of the ocean necklace 3rd class dance im flying rose drawing the sinking of the grand staricase the breakup of the final moments of the endingjames cameron did a very good job in making this movie for me it is his best film again for me avatar may be the biggest movie of all time but will remain as the biggest movie in my heart and head well is still the second biggest film of all time also the im flying scene is the biggest and best scene in the history of hollywood up to todayoverall a must see movie get the dvd now even the deleted scenes were excellentmy review 1010 excellent,sad
i watched this movie when i was 7 yrs old in a theater here in bangalore and  you guessed it  nothing went into my head i remember even asking my dad what the round thing was during the nude scene the only thing i remember was seeing my dad in tears when it endedi watched it again just yesterday and i was moved to tears by the end everything just seemed to fit with this movie the score the visuals the performances and the dialogue all seemed to fit smoothly like a glove ok some of the dialogue was cheesy and made you go oh come on but others were memorable even to the point of quotingthis movie was divided into two halves which differed so much that youd be surprised they were parts of the same movie but i have to say the second half showed a side of directing and storytelling i havent felt in the fifteen years since this movie came out it showed strengthjames cameron i know now kept avatar on the backburner completed and then continued work on avatar i mean what can i say you gotta hand it over to him for making two of the most popular movies till date and that too backtoback went on to sweep the oscars with 11 and although avatar managed just the 3 visually it was as stunning and marvelous as this one wasfittingly the movie ends with celine dions my heart will go on by then i was shivering and this song at the end brought all those bottledup tears out will be in my top 10 movies of alltime for years to come nothing can beat its sheer storytelling power must watch 910,sad
is without a doubt a great movie a lot of the haters are breaking down the movie for the wrong reason its not about bad acting or bad special effect the movie is an absolute masterpiece in that no question about itwhat is it about then the script and im totally agreeing on that the film is based on one of the biggest shipwrecks in history an james cameron is paying an utterly disrespect to make a romantic movie over a shipwreck that actually happened and it leaves a bit of a bad taste in your mouth but this is hollywood a fictional world and we always have to keep this in mindyes was the ship of dreams and had storys enough to tell on its own accord that james cameron didnt use this is a real shame but again this is hollywood the fictional world in my opinion it should have been the filming of futility the book that was written 14 years before sank and showed a striking resemblance to the events that really happened on then you dont have to worry if the events that really happened are filmed accurate but alas it isnt its a romantic story and a good one it is a story that could have happened on and you feel for all the characters and a film shouldt be utter rubbish just because the script isnt a replica of the real eventstherefore i dont mind it became a blockbuster but it suits that it isnt in the top 250 of best movies in the world which somebody else complained about when a movie cant pay respect to real events it shouldnt receive respect and it doesnt,sad
despite the fact that paramount and 20th century fox coproduced the movie in the usa and canada only the paramount logo animation is shown at the beginning of the movie and not the 20th century fox logo while in europe only the 20th century fox logo animation is shown at the beginning of the movie and not the paramount logo this may be due to distributing right deals also the lightstorm entertainment logo animation is totally absent from this movie wowwhat an amazing movie it waswhen i saw it fist time i felt so much wet feeling of deep love and one more thing i have found subtitles of this movie from some site httplearnfreelanguages110mbcomthtml,sad
it is easy to see why won so many academy awards the special effects are incredible i watched the movie on the tcm channel last week quite by accident i had told myself that i would probably never see it because teen girls were seeing it a dozen times and that made me a bit suspicious i asked my wife if she had ever seen it she said like me she had seen it on tv my friends tell me that it is best seen in a big screen theater but it is too late for that also it is getting harder and harder to find big screen theaters my wife a reader told me that it was not much of a movie her definition of a movie is one that fully develops the characters and in the case of the movie was just a vehicle for a love story between leonardo and kate i was told that you could see the plot coming down the pike and you could i asked if it was not also the role of a movie just to entertain and was told that that is not enough in thinking about what i was told i could appreciate that was not a great movie but it was sure entertaining and jaw dropping and i am not just talking about the sketching scene,sad
i saw this movie last night on tbs and i have to say i was impressedthroughout my lifetime i never gave this movie a chance i always had the dvd lying there and eventually i moved i would see my mom watching it when i was 5 years old which is when it came out i have to admit the hype around this movie is acceptable finally last night thoughi kept watching it till the end both actors caprio and winslethave done a great job its even pretty touching in some parts amazinghow much money went into making this movie it was worth it thedirection the epic scenes of watching winslet and caprio trying to survive throughout the whole ordeal was fun to watch i highly recommend this movie to those who havent seen it,sad
a poor young man named jack dawson leonardo dicaprio and a rich girl named rose dewitt bukator kate winslet fall in love on the the unsinkable ship but rose has a decision to make because she is actually on her way to marrying another man cal hockley who was jack locked up in a room when the so called unsinkable ship hits an iceberg and begins to sink rose now must find jack before the ship sinks and they drown and they must fight to stay alive on the sinkingone of the most impressive parts of this film was the fantastic visuals they were absolutely stunning and they really needed to be for the film to work the story was obviously very sad and probably most people before they even see the film can guess how it will end the story to the in general is just one of the most tragic events in history and james cameron did a very good job making it into a movie the direction was actually what i thought to maybe be the best part of the film it took a lot of skill on the part of james cameron to make such a realistic yet good movieto make a tragic true story such as this the cast is really a very important part of the film it could possibly either ruin or make a movie obviously in the case of pearl harbor many believe the cast could have very nearly destroyed the movie thank you michael bay however the i found the cast to be perfect leonardo dicaprio may not have been even so much as nominated for an oscar which if you look at who was nominated he probably did not deserve to be but his performance was still nothing short of excellent kate winslet though was easily deserving of her nomination her performance was brilliant the musical score by james horner was incredible he will always be remembered by me for the music to this film and a beautiful mindoverall the really was a great film with outstanding visuals beautiful acting and unbelievable direction i think a lot of people think this film is overrated and i do understand where they are coming from because 1114 oscars might be taking it a bit too far but the film really was good and it deserved many of the oscars that it won is one of the better movies that i have seen and will always be considered so by me,sad
this is an amazing movie plain and simple the acting is great the visuals are incredible its all good all of it i have one nag about this movie i have a hard time believing that jack and rose would be that much in love after only knowing each other for like 3 days seriously theyve known each other for 3 days and their having sex that really annoys me but other than that everything is brilliant the first half of the movie is well acted by everybody the cinematography is beautiful throughout its all great the second half of the movie is utter brilliance beyond belief i was almost crying watching that ship sink james cameron is a genius everything about this movie is awesome except the fact that jack and rose didnt know each other for more than 3 days the writing was a little clich and hokey but allinall this movie is beyond awesome and is one of my favorites,sad
we all know the story of telling it through the eyes of ordinary characters would be dull james cameron smartly decided to make this a movie about romance between two lovers jack leonardo dicaprio and rose kate winslet i think the strong romance actually works and makes the audience care more about what happens to them and of course to the ship this is a very sad story  as you might guess the scenes after the ship hits the iceberg and everything goes haywire are shot with cinematic excellence i believe this movie still remains to be the highest grossing films of all time and most number of oscars earned the only thing that bothers me every time kate and leonardo costar in a movie it is always kate that gets nominated and leonardo is always passed i hope his day will come soon,sad
its really only half a good film but then again its hard to make a romantic film that good anyway jamess carmons has obtained a place for itself in the history of film maybe because of its huge box office success or possibly its utter domination at the 1998 academy awards winning 11 categories including best picture the film has been recognized for its amazing cinematography and equally stunning visual effects as well as immaculate sound editing and an empowering musical score its quite an achievement and i have to give james cameron grabs for it and unlike most chick flicks cameron actually has something to talk about rather than just a touchy love story like for example the concurrence of rich and poor because in a disaster situation the amount of money you have in your pocket is not going to save you there are many classical moments in this film to be remembered theres three specific scenes that im not going to spoil for you that have an incredibly romantic yet tolerable essence to it but mainly because cameron delivered it in the very best way possible the bottom line is that is a film to be remembered we remember kate winslet and leonardo dicapprios wonderful on screen chemistry celine dions uplifting voice and james camerons exceptional take on the most famous shipwreck ever you can try and forget this chick flick like you would with any other but you will not succeed,sad
in the 90s and 80s director james cameron was king of the world next to steven spielberg he was a director that made groundbreaking motion pictures like spielberg but did spielberg make two of three of the top films ever made no though spielbergs films are a little better camerons films are timelesscameron who directed films like avatar terminator and t2 should be most proud of 1997s best picture winning though avatar was visually astonishing it was no both films are dramas both a little romance both epic but really can you top a film likeis one of the best films ever made it truly is something beautiful i know its a little late to write a review about it but i have never appreciated it til now i mean id always liked it but have never really loved it like i do nowim sure we all know how the film goes cause everyone has seen it a group of researchers are looking for a necklace callthe heart of the ocean the person who has it is a 100 year old woman named rose while searching for the necklace rose tells the story of what happened to her while aboard thewhat happened well rose at once engaged to a jerkplayed by billy zane falls in love with a poor boy named jackplayed by leonardo dicaprio the two of them experience tons of things even risking their lives for each other until the terrible crash on the iceberg is a sweeping epic its beautiful well acted romantic at first sad but now youll probably get over it the endingfor years has made people angry eventually now well have to accept it but that rose is kind of a double crosserkate winslet is a terrific actressdont get me wrong but she didnt deserve the nomination over leonardo dicaprio the oscars have cheated him many times he deserves something i think especially for gilbert grapesomeday he will receive somethingthe two actors had terrific chemistry together thats why when they reunited for revolutionary roadwhere instead of playing two lovers they play a couple that hates each other i was surprised i loved that movie toowhy did imdb give it a rating it the 7s i dont get it this movie is flawless i know its long but it doesnt matter my favorite film magnolia is 3 hours long too but i dont care all great films are long the best ones are long hence why is one of the greatest films ever made if you havent seen it theres something wrong with you sweeps you44note i have just seen 3d and it is still the spectacular film it was then but possibly even better,sad
im just a fifteen year old with a large amount of study behind myself i saw this movie at first when my dad purchased it in 1998 when i was three when i grew up a little i thought the acting was brilliant throughout i was completely mesmerized by the film when i was old enough to understand the movie and history behind i took advantage of the opportunity to study it i learned the true facts and i cannot get enough the event has been the focus of study time outside of school for about seven years this movie inspired me to go out and study the ship and time period in history yes its a romantic tragedy and leonardo dicaprio is quite attractive and kate winslet is so gorgeous im jealous but i dont think that they were the main part the disaster was the true focus in this film if cameron were to create a documentary how many movie goers would he get to see not many so throw in a heartwrenching romance for crying out loud its hollywood everyone knows it wont be completely factual theyre going to try to get as many movie goers as possible the movie was so greatly recognized because its a perfect ratio of occasional humor tension thrilling race of survival and the kind of love that everyone dreams of having that ends in this life with jack but continues in roses heart forever on that note of love continuing forever in a persons heart my heart will go on is my number one favorite song ever celine has got the most wonderful voice ive ever heard and she was definitely right for the theme song of the most moving movie of all time i live in a town that isnt too diverse besides money here youre wealthy or poor not too many in between and the 1st and 3rd class attitudes toward each other dont differ much from in the movie and in my hometown the part of that gets me besides the factshistory is courage in the face of danger as said on the cover of most copies of the bow scene when rose lets herself go into jack and soars into a night without fear on the script shows how quickly passengers and crew were taken by surprise as they feared nothing on the most glorious ship in the world the disaster of is something i view as a sign to not get too comfortable to never challenge nature justifies just this hitting back on the movie itself couldnt have been better casting was amazing effects were brilliant beyond belief and the story is a winner honestly if this movie werent made i would of recognized the study of as my first love but it wouldnt have been stunted as quickly as it was after seeing the film brilliant acting great casting amazing effects tragedyromance a little history what more could you ask for in a movie good job cameron couldnt have been done better,sad
an historical film to be sure it made history at the box office a classic probably one day i dont think enough time has passed to truly call this a classic just yet but of course it definitely has all the makings of one kate winslet and leonardo dicaprio shot to fame with this film and i have to say even though they are ok i dont think either of them struck me with their talent they are both marvelous actors but it wasnt until years later that i really believed that still they have wonderful chemistry and make the love story believable and heartfelt as for the film itself it is a grand scale film really something to enjoy on a big screen if possible although over the years it seems people have come to view this film with much indifference it is a film worth seeing if you havent already and if you have it is one to revisit every few years,sad
its been 13 years since james cameron award winning epic hit the theatres and took the world by storm even after all these years is just as impressive this is truly a film that will never lose its power easily on par with the classic epic gone with the wind and in my personal opinion it may even be betterthe romance between the beautiful upper class rose winslet and the poorcharming jack dicaprio is truly one of the most beautiful and touching ever put to screen theirs is a romance so passionate trusting and ultimately tragic is hard not to be moved rose and jack also happen to be one of the greatest and most memorable couples in cinema historya massive part of making this couple so memorable its the wonderful performances from leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet winslet is captivating as the spirited rose you really feel her inner torment at her restricted life her overbearing mother and controlling husbandtobe cal dicaprio lights up the screen with his charm easily one of the best actors of his generation he gives another strong highly natural performance as the free spirited jack as a character jack is also incredibly likable the ideal man in all respects its very easy to see why rose could fall so head over heels for this handsome artist winslet and dicaprio also have extraordinary chemistry making their performances even better as they play perfectly off one another supporting cast also do a great job kathy bates gives a great warmth and sense of humour to molly brown billy zane is brilliant as cal providing just enough to make him the perfect villain but there is a sense of humanity there to frances fisher playing roses cold and snobbish mother ruth is perfect in everyway simply put james cameron knows how to direct he has a knack for creating these thrilling visual masterpieces that rival anything we have ever seenavatar is an epic through and through the sets are incredible and the cgi is still highly impressive in fact it is miles better than 99 of todays cgi you actually feel you are on the yourself such is the care and attention to detail within this film the last act which involves the sinking of the ship is possibly some of the most thrilling pieces of cinema ever captured this is hollywood at its bestcamerons writing skills are less impressive this is far from a perfect mind blowing script but it is a good one nonetheless there are some wonderful exchanges between jack and rose as they begin their love affair and thanks to a mixture of talented actors and sweet dialogue it all works wonderfully my only very minor issue with the dialogue would be the overuse of jack and rosefor example i believe rose utters the word jack 78 times cameron seems to forget that we dont actually use peoples names 247however this is just a very minor fault and really does nothing to spoil the film whatsoever there are some cheesy lines as would be expected in a romance but they work thanks to the actors delivering them they are uttered with such passionheartbreakjoy that they end up sounding natural and in fact totally in placethe score by james horner is breaktaking a soundtrack of epic proportions to say the least horner succeeds in creating a score that is larger than life and at the same time highly unconventional he knows when to be soft and subtle which is hard to find in most soundtracks today arguably some of his best work this score only furthers this films breaktaking execution despite minor script flaws and some small historical inaccuracies is still in my mind a perfect film such is the level of care put into this film such is the level of talent from everyone to the stunt men actorsset designers etc that any flaw is soon forgotten or even better not even noticed this film is a touchingbeautiful romance its an epic thriller its a period piece and its an action filmthis film has everything any audience member could ever want and it strikes a perfect balance between them one of the greatest films of the 20th century is an epic like no other,sad
this movie is the best movie i seen in years this movie is about 3 hours long and it felt like the movie was only 1 hour leonardo dicaprio did an awesome job in this movie so as kate winslet james cameron is the best director ever this movie made me cry the very last part is very sad a very good movie about a ship and about a womens life all the people who think this is a f sh think again cause if you hate this movie you have no life anyways very sad and good movie this movie is very underrated it should be in the top 250 list i recommend this movie highly please go see it now my rating1010,sad
in this james camerons first masterpiece we see the like never before romanticized with a love story to boot when released in 1997 was expected to be a financial flop for paramount and fox studios who had put up a record amount of production money only to wind up with the highest grossing film of all time a record that was kept for twelve years until camerons next film avatar outsold ticket sales in 2009 we find leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet and billy zane in a love triangle to trump all love triangles prior the film although partially based on actual events and made up people was a hit with audiences in the summer of 1997 breaking box office records from start to finish a great cast and great direction along with the most upto date special effects of the time make for a splendid experience 810,sad
lets start with james cameron he made the greatest action movie ever made and also one of the greatest science fiction movies of all time the terminator 2 judgment day the terminator was excellent too but 2 surpassed even that by only these two movies he has become one of the greatest directors of all time dont you agree however it was really weird that he wanted to make such a movie thus does not look like a james cameron movie at all and additionally it is lack of creativity james cameron creativity you know by considering the terminator movies you can see how a creative director james cameron is is an ordinary movie a simple movie on all counts everything is simple that i will mention later at that time leonardo di caprio was at the top the beloved of teenage girls in fact young or not females were admirers of him i like di caprio and he is still liked may be even more because of the performances he gave in his recent movies but what i am trying to say is that i try to find out the reasons why a lot of people love the movie and it broke a record at the box office became the most watched film of all time it was owing to di caprio well i dont think so i mean not only owing to him which is sad because as said the movie is simple on all counts as for kate winslett as an actress she is one of my favorite actresses ever i just love her but players cannot save a movie this is what i believe the love story is simple let me summarize it one more time a poor boy a rich girl and the rich and black hearted fiance of that girl the family of the girl want their daughter marry him but she is not sure then the poor boy and the girl meet and fall in love with each other see you know james cameron is rather an action and science fiction director isnt he and this is a disaster movie besides romance isnt it but this side of the matter action excitement are simple either you expect the same masterful perfectionist and creative level for but it is not i did not get satisfy on this count because cameron does not focus on disaster he focuses on romance and this is weird this is a three hours movie but the disaster side of it is unsatisfying therefore the people who had expected an exciting suspenseful disaster movie disappoint like me as for the oscar issue yes it broke a record in the oscar history too 11 oscars to me there are two wrong decisions in the oscar history one is 11 oscar winning the other is shakespeare in love won the best picture oscar instead of saving private ryan i should confess that the other was much more painful because if you ask me to give the best picture oscar to shakespeare in love while one of the other nominees is saving private ryan is something like to give the best picture oscar to the notebook while one of the other nominees is 12 angry men returning to the love story in it is not heavy or dull at all like shakespeare in love by the way which is good news and despite i am not female it was real touching and at the end my ears filled with tears however unfortunately these do not make the movie great lets talk about the branches which won oscar by the way as for entertainment yes i was entertained but not very much the best editing well this is not memento or amores perros the editing was normal in this one the best cinematography if it is one of the bests then what is amelie then for example or across the universe the best costume design what were the costumes daily life costumes yes was not a period movie exactly wasnt it even if it was the costumes were ordinary daily life costumes the best art direction again is normal on this count amelie 2001 batman these are the examples come to my mind now if we talk about the themes of the movie it is seen that they are simple either as everything else follow your heart money does not bring happiness believe immortal love etc,sad
a true moving epic that quite literally moves you off your feet as you are swept into a class driven land of its own cameron will never better this film as it is the best hes ever made in my opinion the acting is top notch the script is even better and his use of colour fades and cuts make the movie a true work of art the storyline cannot be questioned throughout as it is 100 true which is the true beauty of this utter work of arti must have seen this film over 10 times and every time i watch it the music is outstanding and use to superb effect throughout the film this tear dropping epic should be seen by all and admired by all of us cameron avatar was amazing but this is better,sad
if theres any movie that will make you fall in love this would be it the setting is beautiful and the performances from the cast compliment the film nicely particularly the leading roles portrayed by leonardo dicaprio and the deservedly oscarwinning kate winslet the romance shown is one that will have you in tears and will make you fall in love yourself you do engage with all the characters nicely particularly couples watching who are in love themselves the story really draws you in and also the ending is almost guaranteed to have you reaching for the tissues as you dry your tears there is no wonder that this is considered possibly the most romantic movie ever shown on screen and the ultimate tearjerker,sad
the years past fast and i still remember when everyone talked about going to see the movie i dont like to go to the movies so i didnt care much about it however as the weeks passed my interest on going to watch the movie increased finally one day my family invited me to go see it and i decided to go to the theater the movie impressed me a lot it was sincerely wonderful i still remember the scene when jack took rose to the end of the ship and she opened her arms while a beautiful song played and the wind hit her hair the fact that the romantic story developed from a historical event made the movie more interesting the effects that portrayed the crash and sink of the ship were incredible finally the end of the movie seemed as sad as it had to have been when thousands of people lost their lives when the ship sank in 1912 good luck to james cameron director leonardo dicaprio main actor kate winslett main actress and all of those who made possible the production of this jewel of the cinematography world,sad
how long does it take until a passenger liner is gone under ten minutes half an hour no its almost incredible but it can take more then three hours a big passenger liner is on his way from england to the usa during the journey a rich young women called rose meets the young poor jack dowson after seeing the trailer you know everything what will happen its a love story with tragic end like you have seen in a lot of movies the plot is absolutely hackneyed the first two hours are terribly boring and kitschy a man meets a woman they fall in love thats all furthermore the move is accompanied by the ugly voice of celin dion with her overrated song my heart will go on which consists only few chords in short the movie is no worth seeing,sad
i love this move and after 13 years of movies that lost its sense in true love this movie was quite refreshing i must say that this movie is the best movie ever created produced imagined this movie brought me to tears i find that the movie avatar also one of camerons films of outstanding after the 4th time i have watched it but i must say that was by far much better kate winslet rose was a perfect woman for the job i only wish that i was in love with this person in such a manner but of course nothing like this happening lol might sound kind of creepy but i hope not in a negative way anyways this movie is by far my most favorite i think that it completely smashes every movie including avatar into little bits however i found that this movie will always be my favorite i feel like after watching this film that i kind of seek a love that is with a person like kate winslet in this film but as life is not perfect it will only be a dream lol i almost forgot that this was a review lol but overall this is a great movie to watch over and over and overi also believe that this would be a great film to watch over and over again 1000 years from now even 100 years from now i believe that this film will still be the best film ever created produced and imagined and like the love in this film i believe that the heart will go on i highly recommend that you see this film,sad
james camerons masterpiece a movie that has almost everything in it love romance heroism and sacrifice and unbridled evil and the best part most of it is true camerons is a fictional story told from the most part between two tragic lovers rose dewitt and jack dawson winslet and decaprio deliver career making performances here i had been impressed with decaprio from whats eating gilbert grape and discovered this young man can act he stole a movie from johnny depp not a easy thing to do but anyways rose is going to be forced into a loveless marriage to a heartless millionaire wonderfully played in a sleazy manner by billy zane roses mother was once married to a man who was once rich but spent all the money and died on them leaving them only a name some social connections and a mountain of debt so rose must marry a detestable man for his money in fact once they reach america they will be married jack dawson is a drifter and a dreamer who goes where the wind blows him and the wind gives him a ticket to the third class passenger section of jack is a artist who cares for the adventure of life things happen when he rescues rose from a suicide attempt and she introduces him to her world and discovers they will not make a place for jack in their world he is beneath them jack introduces her to his world and she discovers people who are dirt poor but rich in other ways they are so alive and vibrant and she discovers within herself the strength to move beyond matters of wealth and social standing however roses mother and her groom to be have discovered that rose has fallen for jack and all their planning in now in danger then comes the unthinkable the hits an iceberg and begins to flood the captain is given the dire news in an hour all of this will be at the bottom of the atlantic the news is met with horror skeptics scoff at the idea of the unsinkable sinking and the people are now drawn into battles of classes first class passengers first all others after jack and rose struggle to survive the death of and to try to find some meaning after the ship has died and gone down to the bottom of the ocean there is a beginning story that frames the entire movie involving men and women diving on looking for treasure and getting involved with old rose who tells the story but the real story here is camerons dedication to detail he spent fives years diving on the and interviewing survivors his quest for accuracy was an obsession that paid off big i took my wife to see this movie back when it had just been released and i groaned thru the romance and i laughed at the end when dicaprios heroic jack dawson makes a big sacrifice in fact my wife called me a caveman with no feelings however 13 years later i saw the film on tv again and watched it from the beginning and i caught all of it and i understood it better now that all the hype has died down and the cult of decaprio has quietly gone away that this movie is a human tragedy and that love knows no boundaries and that somethings should always be remembered no matter how painful james cameron created a masterpiece and maybe the movie by which he will always be remembered,sad
i find it so amazing that even after all these years we are still talking about this movie obviously this movie wasnt that bad or else people wouldnt even bother to talk about it i personally enjoyed this film immensely and still do i guess this film isnt for everyone but it certainly did touch the hearts of manyas for those that think that this film is overrated or overhypedwell we only have the moviegoing public to thank for that lol you see its not criticsarticle writers that make a film huge or a hit with the general moviegoing public people make the film a huge success with everyone was in awe lets face it a film like this had never been made before at least not with the type of special effects needed to really capture the essence of the ship actually sinking this film is so accurate that even james cameron timed the actual sinking of the ship in the film with the real sinking that fateful day in april 1912 even the silverware for goodness sakes matched give this movie a break you guys the critics thought this movie would sink big time when this movie actually came out and people started hearing by word of mouth which is the best form of advertisement mind you that this was a gooddecentmovie worth seeing then everyone started flocking to the theaters in droves to see this movienot once not twice but maybe 3 times and more so i really wouldnt say that this movie was overhypedat least not like the buildup for the matrix reloaded or the hulk is being overhyped ha critics didnt even think that would make enough money to cover camerons gigantic film budget that it took to make this mammoth of a film however the films money took care of that 200 million budget and much more personally i love this film however this film might not be for everyone dont say that this film sucks just because of romance though that is the most sexist thing ive ever heard disliking a movie just because it has romance in it the story was sweet the dialogue could have been better but lets face itthe real star of the movie wasnt leo or kateit was that gigantic ship i think all of the actors including dicaprio and winslet did a fine job its not their best work ive seen much better work from both of them but it wasnt the worst ive seen on screen before give them a break,sad
i watched this movie when i 6 years old giving me big feeling was this ship was really big because i just watched a part of this moviei rewatched this movie when i 18years old i touched by this filmleonardo dicaprio and kate winslet are wonderful i thought leo is one of the fine actors of his generation kate winslet was so strong in this filmalso she is very beautiful actressthe start and end of this film was very good i find it so amazing that even after all these yearstwo months ago i rewatched this film i thought differently from beforei think love is the strongest power in the world and people cando anything for their lover personally i love this filmthis would have to be one of the most wonderful films of the 20th century and one that will never be forgotten,sad
i think this movie is my favorite moviebecause it is very romantic and it has a great manufacturegreat sound effectsand almost made me crywhen jack and rose were in the seajack found a piece of wood and helped rose crawled onto the wood and in the end jack froze to deathit really touched my heartat that time i really liked leonardo dicapriobecause i think he is very handsomeand he is a good actorthe sets and the cinematography were amazing i can understand why this film won so many awards i think kate and leo were amazing on screen together and that this is why they have starred in more movies together,sad

the film starts with the search for a valuable diamond that is presumed to have been lost when the sank an old survivor rose gloria stuart contacts the team who are searching through the on the oceanbed she sits down and recounts her memories of the journey that she had and the love that she found with jack leonardo dicapriooh yeahthe ship sinksi began watching the film determined not to cry but it all got too much and i started to well up as the credits started and the film began although i think its a good film i feel i should mention the following points its way too long  scenes are drawn out and this had the effect of detaching me from the action and so lessening my emotional involvement i thought that kate winslet as rose and leonardo dicaprio were good in the lead roles but kate was too much of a woman she is meant to be a 16 year old she was far too mature this made jack seem a bit too boyish for her although his look is probably right considering that kate is meant to be 16 having said that winslets facial expressions are very good and she draws you in to what she is feeling  she conveys the despair of the situation very well shes also pretty good with an axe i felt that dicaprio was likable despite his constant optimism and the rest of the cast were goodthank goodness that the sank and gave us such a wonderful tragedy,sad
so this might be the billion review about the first thing i must say is about me being so irritated of this movie surely when you hear about one movie as the greatest know that it hit all the records then get to see it to discover that its another movie and how there were many better movies that didnt get 10  of the popularity that that one had then you must be as irritated as me most of the characters are fine but not in a capable drama lets face it james cameron wanted mainly a big production action movie not a romantic epic the start is too long and boring the womens heart is a deep ocean of secrets aside from being the movies only interesting line its not that interesting in the first place sometimes the mans heart is a deep ocean of secrets also i hated the nude scene its not about me despising nudity in the first place its about it as something that ruined the romantic sense of the movie thereafter talk about ruining then its more than clear that the chemistry between the 2 leads was missing a lot of viewers im one of them saw that kate winslet had more presence than leonardo dicaprio  and looked a bit older than him as well i cant stand the fact that rose is the one who killed jack when she left him in the icy water why she didnt give him part of raft or got to be on it for some then jack for some so selfish  and yes the tragedy of my hard will go on  for anyone who didnt live 1997 that was a complete nightmare pals this song was everywhere if you didnt find it in radio then it would meet you in tv and when you got red of it then it would hunt you down successfully from the cars audio system i didnt satisfy with the oscars too the hyped persona of the movie mirrored itself highly in the academy awards night but it didnt win the scripts award in fact it couldnt  if something about it is really great else the global mania so it is its cgi cameron dreamed and fulfilled perfectly in that area anyhow this is a very good movie after all an action fare a powerful disaster flick with some romantic moments it got an old love story yet with a lovely charisma as a whole but it only doesnt work for me sometimes its all the time you have another tastethough i liked some nice bits like how jack is the youthful lively modernism of this stiff world or the part of the musicians playing the music while everything dies simply because the artist the real one got no message in life but to play their music and to the end of life and i liked the final scene roses dream where her love goes on and on but to tell you the truth it was one of the excellent endings which you wish another more deep and satisfying movie for it if you looked to the whole history of cinema youll find many movies like or better whether they were meant to be big hits or just truthful works they didnt make it to be the most successful ever its just a certain moment when the audience needs all what one movie has however the audiences necessities remain vague unpredictable and change from time to time and whatever the intelligence of any moviemaker is no one will ever know what exactly these necessities may be in one moment on big scale or what the movie to fulfill them can be otherwise all the movies out there will be another  1997 is the absolute chance to explore the mood of the viewer of the twentieth centurys end it presented a love story in the middle of a fallen world  the ship itself as if the huge rich and proud civilization is in its way to a near inevitable collapse by hitting an iceberg where the coldness of all the humans aka  the icebergs will kill them eventually and the only survivor will be love so the necklace that somehow can survive too while representing all the material values will equal nothing in the end notice that the end isnt happy thats uncommon as this true lover got no place in our fatally hectic worldit wasnt a coincidence that made it big it is originally a smart movie that came in the right moment but in another moment that smart movie couldve made it to be a mighty flop it is the viewers heart whichs a deep ocean of secrets and some movies come in some time precisely in time to unlock it,sad
the special effects of this film are some of the best i have seen in a movie the great slipping under the waves the people staying aboard for as long as they can the individual stories of the famous people that were really on the ship molly brown for example the capitans refusal to slow the ship down due to iceberg warnings and so on most of us know the story of the great liner that sank on that cold april night taken as that alone james camerons film is a masterpiece you really feel like you are on the real with the people of the time the problem i have with this film is leonardo dicaprio say what you want but i feel he was miscast he does not even try to act in a way you would expect a man of 1912 to act with his squeaky voice saying things like horse and i know how the world works in other words he acts like he just came from a day at the beach kate winslet is better in her role as rose bukater but i would have preferred a different actress she plays the part mostly as someone who needs to grow up the love affair between the two main characters is not believable and serves only as a distraction granted just showing the history of the famous ship with the people who were really there would have been boring for most young viewers without some modern story they could relate to in this case a cheesy love story aside from that this film pretty much works i watched it for the story of the and the actions of the crew that night and the mistakes that were made that lead up to the disaster cameron crafted this part of the film so you felt that you were really there jack dawson and rose bukater seemed out of place,sad
this movie is great but its not perfect i think all directors are good at their certain thing cameron is good for big sets camera angles story development and cinematography but he lacks in character development and dialoguethis move was all around a great watch and it sparks interests in history i just got through watching a few hours ago and still feel mesmerized but it sounds weird coming from a guy but cameron knows how to strike a nerve i can see why a lot of people think its a 1010 i myself feel like giving it that just for the feeling i have right now but i know its far from deservedthe movie starts out with a team of explorers searching the sunken ship of they find a safe and think they hit the jackpot their search was for a necklace but all they found were old drawings but after cleaning them they realize that the lady in the drawings is wearing the necklace theyve been searching for so they show the drawing on the news and the lady in the drawing comes forwardnow this is where the story actually starts rose the lady in the drawing is from a rich family well you find out later that theyre broke and using their good name to get by but anyways rose feels empty inside i guess i can understand how she feels her mother is pressuring her to marry some guy just for his money she basically has to convince herself that she loves him but she really doesnt now jack the guy who rose ends up falling for is a poor guy who only got tickets to on a lucky hand at pokerso we all know the story rose feeling empty tries to kill herself but jack convinces her not to this is where the movie turned into a clichd the plot was executed very well but weve all seen the story before jack gets invited to a dinner party with rose and her rich friends where he acts like a fool so her fianc and mom forbid her from seeing jack but you cant stop true love can you i also said the dialogue wasnt good well other than the clichd love mumbo jumbo the lines didnt fit the times yes i know its a fictional story fit into a real event but its still a real event and you have to treat it like that i would think people wouldnt be saying yee haw in the 1900s theres a lot of dialogue that just doesnt fit the timesbut does that make it a bad movie not at all this movie makes you forget about all the hollywood clichs and concentrate on the subject at hand is a great all around film and for being three hours long it didnt feel that long it actually needed three hours to get the full story out but the movie makes you feel sad and scared it makes you feel happy for rose and jack why cant someone love me like that and it puts you at the edge of your seat the transitions are great to no choppy directing work james cameron always deliversso overall i give this movie an 810 it wasnt a masterpiece but its a great flick for anyone to watch,sad
sinks itself on technical artistic and ethical reasons firstly the script is horribly corny and tedious everyone speaks as though theyre one day out of acting school overemoting even the simplest most minor of thoughts i never felt anything genuinely warm or tender between the two stars for a 3 hour movie theres ridiculously little time spent on character development and the shallow clichd narration of the old lady gets extremely tedioussecondly the effects do not hold up today in 2011 you might say thats an unfair criticism to hold a 14 year old movie up to modern technical standards the effects it turns out are the only part i originally liked back in 1997 at that time i would have given the movie a 6 or 7 just for the visual spectacle it now looks dated and awkward and its just not enough to justify any effort to watch it today finally and most importantly the story just falls down by not playing up the doubts and fears that many people had at the time of the ships construction there were experts in maritime engineering that forewarned of such a possible catastrophe but neither the owners nor the public were concerned the notion of being able to safely maneuver such a leviathan was loudly challenged by nautical men but the great ship is presented as an unquestionably positive glorious achievement the film conveys that it was entirely the fault of chancean act of nature a freak accident a stray icebergthat downed the ship and not ignorance pride hubris as it is i was waiting eagerly for its inevitable demise i almost felt everyone deserved it james cameron should have gone down with his tremendous beautiful beastand it certainly is beautiful we are treated to near pornographic views of gleaming stacks sumptuous accommodations and throbbing mechanical drives the best of society are so eager to participate in this obscene orgy of excess but mr cameron wants me to feel sympathetic with these self important gluttons ok so leonardo and kate are different but still they are deluded their only crime perhaps is their youth so yes their story is a tragedy their standing on the bow of the mighty ship is an iconic image thats truly impressive but theres no underlying sense of conscience to give it high contrast it comes off as just a shallow slick promotional ad for the cruise line my point is that i feel its so sad to see how seemingly convinced people were that technological marvels were proof of mans superiority and divine place on earth we now know that such absurdly oversized endeavors truly only serve a very few at the great expense of very many and its happening today right now at an at even more frantic pace we are doomed if we stay the course but celebrates the choice to not reconsider our way by intentionally creating such a tremendous sensation in our culture this movie mr cameron and every one involved in some way took on a responsibility to reward our attention with something worthwhile and substantial it does not it purposely avoids any such responsibility or awareness it is pure escapist fantasy of the highest order that defies its viewers to question any of its splendor i find this insulting to be expected not to think for myself thats just so depressing and so tragic in ways which james cameron is apparently oblivious i feel that this film is just too much fluff and glitter not worthy of its efforts and costs we are supposed to be smarter today about not living for such trivial wasteful excess its exactly this kind of consumption that is accelerating our ecological decline and inflicting extreme hardships on so many millions of disadvantaged people the world over thats a very big heavy thought for sure but this massive movie is just asking for  demanding  this kind of consideration omits the most important compelling bit of the story the old ladys love may live on but her planet is sinking,sad
i absolutely adore this movie and it is one of my favorites of all time of course so many people love to despise this film because of its major success and a lot of people dont want to admit that they actually enjoyed it but alas i am certainly not one of those people i thought the movie was a beautiful testament to the power of true love and for those of you that thought this love story was corny fake or unreal than you obviously havent yet experienced the feeling leonardo dicaprio in the role that made him superfamous was fantastic even though it was not the best role in either of the main actors career kate and leo are absolutely my favorite actors the supporting cast did an excellent job especially billy zane and the fabulous kathy bates oh and one more thingi wish that people would stop with the agestereotypes on this film so many people say that only teenage girls would like this crappy movie im sorry but that is untrue when you say that it is like you are saying that teenage girls are immature and only went to see this because of leo i take offense to that age is a number not what determines whether of not you like a film i am a teenage girl but if you have read any of my comments youd realize that i am most certainly not immature so stop generalizing okay,sad
some movies dont live up to their hype some dont even live up to be movies but this this one does that and so much more james camerons tells the story of jack dawson a poor and down on his luck painter who scores tickets for passage on the unsinkable there he meets rose dewitt bukator rose is traveling to philadelphia to marry her rich snob of a fiance caledon cal hockley and on the way the two become fast friends and soon fall in love for those of you who have heard the story or havent heard of it at all this is the movie to watch all be it its not a hundred percent accurate but it does well with telling the tragic story of the the is a monumental achievement of film making at its best and also one of the highest grossing films of all time its a beautiful film with great heart and soul you feel every emotion thats in the film love joy angry sorrow fear and anguish is a romantic film that no other in the genre can follow or surpass its an amazing love story and tear jerker all rolled up into one james cameron creates a beautiful and breathtaking scenery and magnificent special effects in a film to end all films is one of the greatest films ever made and will continue to inspire people to believe in fate and in love,sad
this is not a groundbreaking film this is not even an informative film instead it is an ordinary clichd love story set on a boat it looks gorgeous its very well acted its only failing is in its false premise this is not a film about the this i found incredibly irritating as i was desperate for more focus on what was going on anywhere else but with jack and rose what is most ridiculous is that the film even makes point of introducing the captain and other historically accurate characters only to ignore them until the climax kate winslet and leonardo dicaprio are both very capable actors and i think they tackle rose and jack admirably in other hands they could have been very cringeworthy indeed for me the most interesting part of this film is bill paxton and his mates going to examine the ship in present day the rest of the story descends into a bloated overly sentimental blur of over dramatic emotions as billy zane suddenly goes loony and celine dions heart goes on and on and on literary critics said in 1912 that it took a vast amount of human vanity to create the and now it took another huge dollop to make this movie i didnt cry neither will you,sad
the person who hasnt seen this movie either really hates or is missing out on an adventure of a lifetime since this movie came out possibly a million has seen this movie and now whenever you ask hey you remember someone will respond with yes unless they happen to have witnessed the sinking they will respond with you mean the ship or the movie and by movie which one because there have been so many movies made about the but i think this one although none of the actors directors or screenwriters have witnessed the like some of the previous movies of the they have told a great story using great special effects that may be the closest to what this generation has to witnessing thei was born in 1993 so you can tell how young i was when i saw this movie most of my life i assumed that gloria stuart was actually an old woman who has been on the until i began doing more on the internet than chatting which must have been around 2005 i was an idiot and i found out there was no old lady on the who told her story to director james cameron and therefor this movie is almost completely fake maybe there was a jack and rose and an old painting that has been lost at sea but the chances that is true is no different than the chances of me getting a girlfriend this year which is low haha wahjack and rose two lovers from completely different worlds come on a ship that happens to be the biggest ship the world has ever seen at that time which is quite strange because just recently i have learned that since that time we have built bigger ships and hardly any of them ever got destroyed by an iceberg or our messages for help were seemed as a joke they dont love each other at first but they soon learn that they will love each other and one of them is willing to die just so the other can survive and leave the its a heartfilling story of the while leonardo dicaprio may suck at his other movies haha lol hes excellent in this movie which may have built his career also i dont think anyone could have made rose better than kate winsleti recommend this movie for the whole family just cover your eyes once you get to the nudity well cover your childrens eyes the only nudity there is is when jack draws rose naked which is a very romantic scene and which makes the picture that is found under the sea which brings the fake old lady rose played by gloria stuart who has never been on the to find the picture and come to the people looking to discover gold or whatever the hell they were discovering cover your eyes if youre offended too which i doubt it because that would be humiliating and embarrassing there is also a sex scene which you dont get to see the nudity so dont worry just enjoy,sad
i dont know why people complain about the affects they are wonderful and me i am a fan a big one not for the movie but for the ship i have done a lout of research before i saw this movie and when i saw the movie i was amazed of how well it followed the history i wish he showed what happened on the carpathia though because that was a battle as well as the night it sank but it was already a long movie so i cant blame him and if anyone thinks jack and rose were really passengers on they are wrong but that is ok i had that same question when i watched it but they did great what happened that night and it makes me fell apart of when i leave if anyone is interested in the the they can see ghoust of the abyss james cameron directed it and he is in it the movie is about him and his crew diving down to the ship and some of the history you will also notice some of the actors in the movie in that documentary but it is entertaining and funny in some parts,sad
the movie is an unbelievable fantastic lovestorythe famous actor appeared an actor and an actress in the moviethe movie is based on realitythe name of the vessel is and has two main characters a male and femalehe loves her and he won her loveso they fell in love with each otherthe suffered a unfortunate destruction and was broken by an iceberghe tried to rescue herbut the attempt was a failure so they are together diedi want to experience romantic love but i dont want to die,sad
ive now seen this film several times and it does get better i promise the first time i must confess i found it laughable the problem was that at times it appears to present itself as a documentarywhich it is not it is an epic love story which happens to be set upon the that is alland there is nothing wrong with that there are some good performances and room in the story for some engaging character development there are also great special effects and plenty of action scenes to keep your pulse up so in summaryif its historical accuracy you seek then rent a documentary if you want an absorbing if rather drawn out love story you could do worse,sad
holds 11 oscars the highest every grossing movie of all time and a critically acclaimed cinematic masterpiece it took the world by storm in 1997 and still values plenty of positive credit to this day to me is no masterpiece its a fictional love story on a reallife tragedy that struck in the youth years of the 20th century keep in mind there is terrific acting excellent use of cgi and effects and some very suspenseful scenes not to mention the grueling emotions throughout the movie created and extorted many famous memorable scenes to be remembered dearly in the future of the movie business james cameron directs a fine romantic movie that was executed fantastically the history design and feel was all accurate and thats one strong element that all other past movies didnt have a fine movie with exquisite acting and detailed cinematography,sad
is a movie that will forever stand the test of time over ten years have past since the movie made its maiden voyage proving itself to be unsinkable the moving love story of two very different people from opposites sides of the class rank proving against all odds that they love each other until the last moment he slips away from her grasp and her forever holding on to him in her heart this love story moves audience members beyond any other love story ever told enrapturing us all in their world aboard the most famous ship of all time this movie never fails to bring me to tears even though it is long since been engraved that she does in fact let go this moving love story transcends time bring countless generations aboard the first and last voyage of the grand all the while giving us a ride one of the sweetest romances of all time with this dream cast and some of the best looking scenery ever recreated to enhance the looks of it is no wonder that has been able to stay at the top of charts for the past ten years and more then likely continue to engrave themselves into the hearts of countless generations to come,sad
as im sure you know this was a huge hit back when it was in theatres turning out to be the highest grossing movie of all time but as hard as it may be to believe ive finally seen it for the first time over eleven years later i was eleven years old while the film was enjoying its box office success and yes i did hear a lot about the movie and how massive it was i was also soon familiar with the famous song my heart will go on performed by the greatly despised celine dion still i never actually saw the movie for over a decade shortly before finally watching it i knew that despite its popularity it has also been widely ridiculed so it wouldnt have surprised me if i wasnt very impressed at all but that didnt exactly turn out to be the case84 years after the sinking of the a group of treasure hunters discover a drawing of a naked woman from the ships wreckage a tv report catches the attention of a woman around 101 years old named rose calvert who contacts the treasure hunters to tell them that she is the one in that picture she then goes with her granddaughter elizabeth to visit the team although they are skeptical the very elderly woman begins to tell them about her experience back in 1912 when she was rose dewitt bukater a rich teenager aboard the believed to have gone down with the ship she tells them how she began an unlikely romantic relationship with a poor young man on board named jack dawson after he saved her from a suicide attempt and how this led to conflict between rose and her family and oafish fiance caledon hockleyseveral months ago i watched pearl harbour and it seemed that some people compared that film to which i thought was not good as a result i was expecting the same kind of poor dialogue and romance in this movie the first of the two well i definitely did find some fairly weak dialogue and there definitely are flaws in the romance so the film does have those things in common with its successor but fortunately to a lesser degree at least none of it made me laugh here though it certainly does take some points off some of the performances here are also weak including some of the actors who played the treasure hunters in the 90s parts of the film when the acting isnt poor its basically average for the most part at least oh well at least i actually cared about what happened to the two main characters even if they werent portrayed as well as they could have been i watched this movie on vhs and due to its length it was split onto two tapes to tell you the truth i was definitely more impressed with the content on the second tape than the content on the first without the climax which i saw on the second video tape i would be giving this movie a rating no higher than 610 but even that part isnt perfecti know this is a widely loathed movie im also no fan of the widely loathed celine dion who performed the hit song for the film and am not proud of the fact that shes from my country mind you i think my heart will go on is the only song in her catalogue ive ever heard more than once and i couldnt even name any of the others however while it is severely flawed and i wouldnt want to watch it multiple times i think it could have been much worse the climax is suspenseful and before that the film basically has some good and not so good moments there may be some fairly moving moments in this 1997 blockbuster though nothing that even came close to having me in tears unlike apparently many other viewers it was also interesting for me seeing gloria stuart as 101yearold rose since i had previously seen her in the invisible man which was made over sixty years before this film is this version of thoroughly inaccurate im sure it is so dont watch it if you want a realistic film based on historical fact its a fictional story about a romantic relationship between two fictional people while it isnt worthy of its position as the highest grossing movie of all time nor was it worthy of eleven oscars at least i think i can call it halfdecent im not sure what it would have been like watching this film without having seen pearl harbour first but now that ive seen them both i do think is pretty good in comparison,sad
a movie that will stand the test of time winner of a big 11 oscars and very well deserved a gigantic blockbuster and also a modern masterpiece the most expensive movie ever made as well the greatest film of the decade an epic romance and a big action packed thrill ride a rich girl meets and falls for a poor artist their love cannot be stopped but the luxury liner hits an iceberg and starts to sink featuring classic moments amazing action and massive set pieces an amazing cast featuring leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet a triumphant achievement and a movie to cherish forever an unforgettable journey of cinema magic the greatest epic tale ever,sad
on a recent viewing of i realized that some of the special effects now look slightly dodgy still the bulk of the film holds up very well the beginning is a bit slow as the older rose narrates her story bill paxton is wasted in a thankless part leo and kates tremendous chemistry makes it all worthwhile though they absolutely convinced me they were in love once the ship strikes the iceberg the scenes of terror and mayhem that follow are mesmerizing to watch remains an awesome spectacle with some tender scenes and a heartbreaking romanceoverall 910,sad
is the most beautiful story of two lovers the story is about a young woman named rose who feels trapped she goes on the with her fianc and mother her mother is making her marry her fianc for the money on board the ship she meets jack a young poor painter who won a ticket to rose finds adventure and love with jack she knows that she wants to be with him forever even though her mother doesnt want her involved with him because he doesnt have a penny to his name tragedy strikes when an iceberg hits the jack and rose must find a way to survive this fatal accident and try to live before its too late for help to come will jack and rose find a way to survive or will they die within hours or maybe even minutes in the cold ice water,sad
how can i begin this every movie has its own era for example ben hur in 1959 is monumental if you watched this movie you simply enjoyed it actors visual effects costumes the story itself the way of shooting music everything its spectacular its an epic movie and i have to say it deserves all the academy award prizes so is happening with which is different from ben hur because there are some 50 years of evolution now we have special effects better visual effects and sound editing and so on but the both movies are epic with huge budget many actors and people involved in the project great story both movies deserve their appreciation and prizes and the best critics in the world know that in my opinion these two are the best movies ever made everything is spectacular and fascinating at them i watch them with a great pleasure every time and i wonder why cant we see often movies like these,sad
i hate how this movie starts off the first 20 minutes are boring with the crew looking into the old ship even when youre telling a great story through film 3 hours is just too long i dont get why she threw the necklace into the ocean also its hard to understand why anyone would be impressed by a ship its just weird and why people would think a manmade ship couldnt be unsinkable thats just gullible and thats not the movie people actually thought the couldnt sink still three hours i could watch two different movies within that time span overall its a decent movie and a fun disaster film and yes while i do have my complaints i do believe its a worthwhile movie overall i would definitely own it on dvd,sad
from james cameron  the director of aliens thats all i needed to hear to know i was going to see without a doubt one of the best love stories i have seen in a long time all of this was very attractive great director great cast a romeo and juliet style love story and a hand full of positive reviews even though it was good i still dont see why it made over a billion dollars i saw it and couldnt see what the deal was all those years agoleo dicaprio and kate winslet lead the fine cast both had chemistry and gave us a romantic love story both give great performances and were great choicesi recommend it but dont expect much it was good but not that good had a great cast and great love story but that is all thats here if your looking for a good love story watch this or the notebook610,sad
have to just applaud boyo2s comment there it is a bizarre film this indeedi personally hate it but if its on then i will watch it until the end a true enigma of the film worldfor the trashy love story that goes on there are enough pure heartfelt moments in the film to make u have some understanding of the tradegy that occurredyou can never call this a bad film just not what i for one was expectingand lets be honest i think james cameron knows what he is doing he will go far that boy,sad
this is propably most visually beautiful film ever made showing the gilded age luxury in authentically while the drama of the drowning scenes is heartwrenching score is just perfect icing of the cake my heart will go on but rose who looks like that gorgeous flower but only superficially is one of those strong feisty heroines who are actually spoiled whiny and unsympathetic attacking the male servants because ya know 1st class female passenger is a victim and the male servant an evil patriarch sorry jim dont buy it but it is still one james cameron film which is not full of ugly hitech for plot and visuals,sad
i thought this film was alrightok so it goes on for absolutely ages but hell its an epic tale no i dont like the whole gushy side of it with that old womans sordid memories but i do understand that to spend that much money on a film it must appeal to a very wide audiencemy favourite character was mr andrews i thought he was very convincing especially as the full horror of the ships fate was sealed ismay  but this ship cant sink andrews  shes made of iron i assure you she can the special effects were great stop slagging this off you lot  anyway youre only jealous that you didnt get to do that sketch lol,sad
recently i was asked what is the greatest love storyfilm of all time i said it was the notebook and they all said no its id never seen i never had gotten around to it and it seemed slightly boring so i sat down and watched it with my sister when it was on the tv there were laughs in it but im not such a fan for tearjerkers such as this onethe score was very good there were beautiful pieces of music throughout i normally love tearjerkers but this one was just too much for me spoilers of course i knew what was going to happen its practically general knowledge when jack died in the water i was too overwhelmed and i became stressed later on the same scene running through my mind i threw up and had a brief panic attack i wasnt over reacting but it was much too overwhelming for me even though im not that much of a sensitive personi still respect everyone elses opinions such as its an epic movie of our millennium etc but it was an extremely emotional film and ill never be able to watch it again because it did affect me too much seeing as one of my much older relatives died on the to watch it again for some people it can even be upsettingly painful but you do like epic tragic love stories this is definitely the one to see,sad
i write in bytes saves time this movie a gem a rather fictional love story of poor boy comes on to rich girl from social climbing family who are down on their luck evil villain of a fianc for the girl the poor boy is a talented artist who has spent time sketching naked harlots in gay paree lol rich girl strips her clothes off and poses for boy artist nasty fianc goes gunning for poor boy puppy dog valethitman for fianc does some really goofy chasing down the ship for poor artist boyas an osu history major i feel in all seriousnessi know this story was fictional and that the real story was tragic and ugly sometimes i think the supposed disaster was a real setup and early harbinger of world war i perhaps the ship designers and certain cruise line executives were in cahoots with the evil perpetrators of the war the war started in europe in 1914 two years after the disaster not just a coincidence german leaders had been arguing among themselves for decades leading up to the war and perhaps they figured that a disaster really embarrassing the british and americans would be a real coup in their attempt to conquer the worldmaybe the germans were investors in white star and wanted the insurance money to fund their growing war wars do cost lots of money and germany as a united nation began in 1871 only about 40 years earlier young nations dont have a lot of money to fund such endeavorsthere are no accidents according to philosophical theory germany had been in unrest all during the early part of the 20th century  events leading up to world war i another closeintime famous ship disaster was 1915 the lusitania hitdestroyedsunk by german uboats armed with torpedoes who had warned that ship not to be caught in its shipping lanes lots of famous and important people were aboard the lusitania and also lots of richandfamous were aboard the even the ships names are rather alikethe chilling part is that it is now almost 2012  100 years after the fatal disaster now in 2007 2012 is five years away all things come back around and i imagine there will be some sort of commemorative remembrances regarding the in 2012 why has this accident been called the most famous ship disaster in history why are all those movies and even a broadway musical made of this unfortunate loss of life and wealthy propertyhow could such a magnificent ship suddenly crack up like so much balsa wood i feel there was lots of sabotage and manipulation i hope that there were real firstlove stories aboard this ship as suggested in this moviethe queen of the sea was supposed to be bigger stronger better and much more wellbuilt than all other ships of its day not to mention ultraluxurious and megaspeedy its riveting was worldclass and its workmanship unparalleled nay not an accident but perhaps and only perhaps a red herring to take the worlds attention away from the growing teutonic holocaust in europe,sad
beautiful to look it and easy to watch over again but not necessarily a great film it is pretty good  mostly because the last 90 minutes or so are fantastic cinema  but its not particularly wellwritten or wellacted the dialogue is often cringeworthy and the acting is not that impressive though that could be due to the dialogue more than the actors the story is simple enough but carried out pretty well and the look of the film is outstanding all the technical aspects are topnotch making for a thrilling last half the first half is no slouch either though and i felt the film transitioned nicely from love story to disaster epic all in all an entertaining but slightly underwhelming epic,sad
i just saw the movie not too long ago from start to finish with my boyfriend he thought it was really stupid but i loved it it was beautiful especially the true love moments between rose and jack rose is a sad girl before jack not really living life just doing whatever she was told engaged to a guy she did not love well that changed when she met jack rose was unhappy with her life so she was going to jump into the water but jack convinced her of otherwise from there the movie becomes better and better the only part that really made me cry was when the workers wouldnt let the people from 3rd class out well there is a mother and her two children and she tells them a story to help them sleep knowing them would never wake up again i love the character rose for not getting into the boat even when everyone wanted her too she choose to stay with jack till the end over all this movie is one of a kind and is way worth seeing,sad
isnt it great when a women has an affair she is a lovesick victim and a guy is a piece of shirt infidelity is infidelity but then again it didnt really happen maybe if it hadnt been puffed up so much i would have enjoyed it more take away the teenybopper effect and its a good movie at best a great movie stands time looking back it is a bit cheesy shawshank moves me every time i see it my review must be ten lines so i will go on better tearjerkers shawshank phantom wonderful life private ryan my fair lady seabiscuit prancer old yeller shane the untouchables what i did enjoy was camerons little documentary followup when he returns to in 2001 in loving memory of isadore and ida strauss there is a ten line minimum finished,sad
for the past year and a half the first time i ever really saw this movie id seen it when i was little and never really understood it until then ive been pondering over one allimportant question why does this movie have such a relatively low rating on the imdb the record for most academy awards oscars won by a single movie is eleven this was only won by three movies ever benhur the lord of the rings return of the king and out of those was also nominated for the most fourteen including its wins lotrrotk is in the top ten on the top 250 and i know benhur is on there somewhere if the overwhelming number of oscar wins and nominations dont tell you enough here what i think is one of the best movies ive seen the subplots all tie together perfectly the chemistry between kate winslet and leonardo dicaprio is amazing the acting is brilliant and the special effects are very welldone forgive the expression but i laughed i cried and i died a little inside along with jack to see this movie is to see greatness james cameron proves that he can do nonaction movies and still be a great director 1010,sad
this is not one of them a memorable film i would be quite happy to sit down and watch again if it came on television and yes i have it on dvd too most remakes are a bit of a cheat and lack of imagination but sets a new standard for the historical event and builds an involving love story running through it kate winslet is superb in every scene and the whole casting is excellent i have no hesitation in recommending this film it captured my imagination and involved me from beginning to end the cgi was superb and the costumes immaculate no scenes dragged and the editing always led you into the next scene that you wanted to see so many fail on this point i just now hope that somebody will not try and do a remake in fifteen years time,sad
okay now before everyone comes at me with knives i just want to say that this sounds like a pretty good movie i mean it centers around the developing relationship between a rich girl and a poor boy on the ship that struck an iceberg and took many passengers along with her i heard about this movie from the time i was a little girl and it struck me as interesting i am also a big fan of celine dion and i love her song my heart will go on the song i have always remembered as the song however this movie sounds just a little too risqu for my taste like when rose attempts to commit suicide and when she and jack have sex i may change my mind sooner or later but for now that is my personal opinion,sad
is the most romantic movie i saw and i know that all of you haters are thinking that the movie should have been about the not about some romantic mushy stuff but the was filled with couples and the same thing that happened to rose and jack must have happened i even read in a book about an old couple and how the wife said the exact same thing that rose said when she didnt want to go on the boat without jack and when you guys say that the movie was too long then you are wrong because when it ended i actually wanted to see more and was sad that the movie was over  and i know a lot of people agree with me on this just the same amount as the people who disagree with me,sad
when i first seen this movie i loved it from beginning to end i mean it was simply beautiful the effects were amazing the acting was great and the story was excellent so i dont see why so many people hate this movie it racked up 11 oscars for a reason a lot of people do not like the love story put into this tragic event almost a century ago hello people without the love story it would just be another documentary in this tragic event i thought the story played perfect in with a movie of this caliber it also had comic relief from what it was about to lead up to from molly brownkathy bates also the great stories by the ever so hated jack who was played perfectly by leonardo dicaprio who has become a icon playing parts such as the aviator and the departed also we cannot forget about rose dewitt bukater his love played by kate winslet these to had perfect chemistry throughout the entire movie and made it as sad as it was to become i think the love story and all around them brought this story more into vision to people about how sad that tragic day really wasin this movie there were also great special effects supplied by robert legato mark a lasoff thomas l fisher michael kanfer who won the academy awards for best special effects and did they deserve it from the beginning where the boat was at the dock under the sun or when it road freely through the night or even the sad climatic sinking of the ship it was all put together so great the cinematography in this movie was also greatly produced by russell carpenter who gathered in academy award for cinematography we cant forget about gloria stuart who played the older rose perfectly and told the story as if there were no flaws as if we couldnt help but believe the love between her and jack that was tragically ended this movie deserved every award it won from music which was great to best sound to best art which was extremely excellent in this moviei think james cameron deserves every award he won for putting together this masterpiece in a simply magnificent form he took a tragic event and put it into so many peoples minds for the rest of there lives he was even able to include a protagonist and antagonist in an event like this i dont know how you could not like this movie in the effects and acting column it has peter jackson proportions every scene is beautiful and amazing if you have never seen this movie dont judge it and just bye it i recommend this movie for anyone who is up for an amazing performance and a great love story i give this movie a 10 out of 10,sad
well not much to say just amazing movie by james cameron mixing drama and romance i highly recommend for everyone to watch this amazing movie just one of the best drama ever made a perfect creation by james cameron a perfect acting by the actors unique movie fascinating and exciting movie some very sad scenes take us to the very end none of the less just amazing movie a wise man once said one picture worth a thousand words one of those popcorncoca cola movies  if this movie is over hyped we have only to blame public this movie is just amazingtherefore i think he should get 9 rate a unique movie however this movie is very long and not all peoples have time to watch 3 hours for a movie its just too long some very sad scenes tears dropping and death much dead people died in the 1500 dead people only 6 manage to escape out from the drowning of the,sad
its a simple tale really made up of equal parts love story historical epic and disaster film about a young artist leo from the wrong side of the tracks who falls in love with a young aristocratic lady kate winslet while on their way to america during the fateful maiden  and final  voyage of the hms that pretty much sums it up without really saying very muchwhat after all can you say about a film that has made more money and faster than any other film in the history of motion pictures what can you say about a film that earned more academy awards it tied with benhur in this respect than any other film in history you can say its successful sure but that doesnt come close to doing justice to this spectacular epics impact on hollywood and the entire worldrumored to be in trouble practically before principal photography even began the film quickly lived up to its premature reputation by going famously over schedule by nearly six months and over budget to the tune of over 200 million nearly everyone  fox and paramount included  thought the film upon release would sink at the box office faster than the ship of the title sank in the north atlantic sea so many years agoinstead as everyone now knows did just the opposite and among the other and numerous happy results is the fact that it instantly elevated leo from the ranks of rising new star to that of international superstarone can only wonder why the academy chose to ignore his performance but few if any would argue that the two most important reasons for the films success are leo and kate,sad
although im a girl i did not watch this film to see leonardo dicaprio it was actually because of watching th film for the first time that i fell in love with himthe acting and effects are amazing with a gripping storyline to go with them this has definitely got to be my all time favourite but i dont want to start an argument with anyone who thinks it was crap i personally loved it and if you havent seen it yet you definitely should you may not enjoy it in which case you would have just wasted three hours of your life but if you do enjoy itthats three hours definitely worth wasting on the film again warningit may cause tears,sad
let me start off by saying that i have been accused of being over obsessed with i will admit i am fascinated by the tragedy of this ship this has got to be one of the biggest tragedies in world history i have always enjoyed researching this topic and finding out everything i can about exactly what happened that fateful nightnow to get on to my movie review this movie captured the tragedy of what happened april 1415 1912 james cameron is a fabulous director he captured the fear of what the passengers must have been going through on that fateful nightnow onto leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet they both did such a fantastic job in portraying their characters i was blown away the onscreen chemistry between the two of them was absolutely fantastic the two roles without a doubt launched the two of them into the fantastic careers they both have any movie i have seen either one of them in including have shown their skills phenomenally i recently saw the beach the movie leo did after and although the movie was a flop leo did a fantastic job as always i have seen kate in finding neverland and that is without a doubt one of my favorite movies of all time she portrayed her character so well that film nearly brought me to tearsoverall this movie is a fantastic movie it is a cinematic masterpiece that will go down in history as the biggest grossing film of all timethe best part of this movie was without a doubt when jack was in the ocean and rose was on the door and she tells him she loves him that is the best part its situations like that that really show you who a person really isthis movie can relate to real life so much even without thinking about the historical context of the movie everyone goes through love and at some point in life people feel the tragedy of losing someone it doesnt matter who it is that one someone will strike in the way losing jack affected rose,sad
is the most amazing movie i have ever seen yes its my favorite movie why you may ask has something for everyone romance action drama and even a little bit of comedy kate winslet and leonardo dicaprio are expertly cast as two lovers who meet on the doomed ship the heartbreakingly beautiful this movie will touch your life i remember the first time i saw the only thing i could think of was wow how can they ever make a better movie i recommend this movie to everyone because there is no possible way you can not find something you can love in what is one of the best movies of all timetitanic,sad
the love scene in the auto in the cargo hold is absolutely innocuous but man is it hot i rate it as up there with superman flying lois lane nothing dirty just quite erotic the facts of the movie were excellent for the time but as research progresses it becomes more and more likely the dramatic stern rise before final sinking did not actually take place too bad as that was excellent drama and probably why that version of the sinking was chosen victor newmanhanseric braedenrat patrol german officer deserved more screen time why wasteedit a big name nearly out of the picture to all those that slam the pictureget a lifeit is good drama and the effects are enough to keep anyones attention jacks death scene is probably one of the best ever filmed,sad
the was and he will always be one of the best films of always carried through of one it forms sufficiently professional and with an actress who in mine opinion is simply excellent kate winslet i have immense penalty that still it has much people that do not give the due value to this film i think that all its particularities are simply excellent wants graphical wants of performance of the actors james cameron disclosed great qualities while accomplishing and already in he has accustomed them to such and to rebate james horner with a sonorous band the height of this great film optimum of always congratulations everybody,sad
where is the suspense in a movie like this anybody who hasnt spent their whole life living in a cave knows what happens in this movie i knew what would happen over thirty years before this movie even came out the fictional love story between jack for once not played by jack nicholson and rose was a tear jerker but a little over the top also it seems like the producersdirector of this movie used it as an excuse to promote class warfare to give this movie its due it is a good story and that is what saves it from total mediocrity the story is told through the eyes of one of the last of the survivors of the disaster an elderly rose i highly doubt that the rich folks in this movie were the jerks they were portrayed in this movie i give it a 6 out of 10 only because it is a good storywarning major spoiler ahead it sank,sad
in 1997 this film became a must see for a lot of people there were several factors that caused this the film featured some of the first shots of the actual on the ocean floor after it sank it featured early glimpses of the technology that had been developed by robert ballard to get those pictures it offered one of the first true tellings of how the ship really sank as finding it in the ocean had finally revealed more details about what really happened to itthis movie has the trade mark james carmeron hokey love story he just redid it in the scifi movie avatar this is becoming the trademark of all his films as avatar is his first movie since this one will cameron ever do a movie without onestory is better than avatar simply because the story here is framed better there is true history here to base the film on  this is much better than the story for avatar which is negative without merit we have the ship of dreams the star of the ocean diamond the provocative drawing we have the ultimate ship which has become legend for yet another generation thanks to this epic remake the love story is camerons jewel  the necklace the ultimate symbolleonardo dicaprio has the highlight role of his career here so far no role he has done since matches it this film was the right time  right place for him right place because he got to play after the luscious kate winslet she was another unknown to most audiences but so far this is her best film too the rest of the cast is ok but other than the actress who plays kate as an old lady they dont stand out muchspecial effects appealed to sell tickets too the ship sets were so expensive so well done  so detailed that they actually became tourist attractions after the movie was made there add all these factors plus no real other film in theaters when this was released  you understand why it sold so many ticketsit might be the last movie to sell so many tickets well made hit films now do well for a few weeks but then a lot of folks wait for the dvd before they watch it this  the new television technology which has made home theater type television possible has changed the public theater into a less appealing venuedo i like this film yes it is a good film but 1 viewing is all i needed to take it all in i still dream about kate winslet  wish leonardo would try  match his acting in a newer effort,sad
this movie is the saddest i have ever seen if you like a tear dropper this is a movie you should seeyou probably need a tissue box right next to you if you dont like sad movies or just cry at movies that you think are sad i think you would like itits sad it takes place in 1919 if you have never seen it if you think lednardo decaprio is hot then you should see this its when he was young if you have seen meet joe black that is what he looks like if you like history then this is a must see movie for you guys if you like to be on a ship then see it the movie takes place on a ship through out the whole movie its self there is some nude seens in the movie to its very long movie to disk dvd,sad
i first saw this movie while living out in cyprus and i loved it everything about it was fantastic i didnt want it to end the cast was great i thought kathy bates was perfect as molly brown but leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet were terrific as jack dawson and rose dewitt bukater they had me on the edge of my seat i was almost crying by the end of it and i sure im not the only one thanks to leonardos magnificent performance the grand staircase was my favourite part of the ship it was beautiful every tiny detail just took my breath away i have watched this film so many times now but i still cant get enough of it from the incredible sets to the amazing costumes this film is truly magical,sad
i loved the movie when i saw it mainly i like the movie because of leonardo dicaprio hes such a great actor ive seen all of his movies including the departed which i just saw today in theaters is probably the only really romantic movie that i am willing to watch again and again alone or with someone else when they say that the kiss was the most famous they werent kidding man id love to have someone kiss me like that on the bow of a famous ship the day the ship was supposed to sink that personally is just really romantic that even though they are both doomed one to death and one to lose the love of her life they still share that passionate moment for a few seconds on the ship very romantic,sad
watching this film on original release and the extended scenes is a must to compare the differences on the extended scenes you learn a lot more it was commented on another site once about they went through roses story and no one said yeah this is all great rose but where is the diamondthese should have been left in the film and maybe cut out a bit of the love storyin a documentary about the film mr cameron says that anything to do with the ship is accurate fair enough he worked long and hard on it but im sure anyone with basic maths would know that 17 12 knots is close to 20mph 32kmh now again the basic maths at 20 miles per hour it would take less the carpathia less than three hours to reach them not the quoted 4 ill mention this part as well yeah i should put these in goofs the carpathias top speed was only 14 12 knots numeroues other errors in the film mr cameron great film loved it but please get all the facts rightalso last part why do american script writers writing stuff for english characters always think the english say the word bloody a lot,sad
is a brilliant movie trust me i own the dvd on special edition the scenes are all gutwrenching and i always cry on several occasions each time i see it i think that one of the brilliant things about it is that many of the lines werent in the script butt were developed by dicaprio and winslet such as when leo says lie on that bed uh i mean couch it was an honest mistake but james cameron liked it so much that he kept it really its one of my favorite lines in the movie because he loves her so much hint hint i really feel that this movie deserves every award on the face of the earth and i would recommend it to anyone,sad
since i was only five when this movie came out i didnt get a chance to see it until about two weeks ago and i cant stop watching it this is without a doubt one of the best movies ive ever seen and not just because of the romance the second part of the movie was amazing and very moving everyone knows about the and what happened to it but i had never considered just how tragic it was this movie opened my eyes to what really happened on the unsinkable ship some people say that the romantic dialogue was cheesy and unrealistic i can see where theyre coming from i read somewhere that rose says jack 80 times and jack says rose 50 times however id never considered that until i read that comment the romantic part was just as enthralling as the second half its about a romance that could never be somewhere in all our lives we can relate to this by the end i was sobbing my heart out for rose and jack so to everyone who saw this movie originally in 1997 loved it for about six months and now is constantly ragging on it please stop this is a cinematic masterpiece that needs to be and should be enjoyed without analyzing it this movie is truly a classic and will be loved for generations,sad
so many things have been said and written about the movie and well before it premiered in theaters around the globe after all its not everyday that the mostexpensive movie of all time is released and it was james camerons first theatrical release since true lies in 1994 three years beforeince its release in december 1997 still is a talking subject not necessarily in family reunions but in film its an unmissable not only it was the most expensive movie ever made it also became the most successful and that title still remains up to that datethe storyline is very simple and doesnt break any serious ground but every guy who only has a small knowledge in cinema knows that story by heart and even the main characters namesthe story begins in present day where a group of researchers led by brock lovett played by bill paxton explore the wreck and discover the portrait of a nude young woman wearing a huge necklace when she learns of that discovery by the means of her granddaughters tv an old woman named rose reveals to mr lovett that the lady in the portrait is none other than herselfold rose is brought to lovetts ship and tells the story of what happened in early april 1912 young rose kate winslet is a late teenager from a wealthy family and she is engaged with cal billy zane the heir of a big fortune however rose doesnt love neither cal nor her very reclusive lifestyle and dreams of freedomshes planning to suicide until she meets jack leonardo dicaprio an american street rat who makes portraits of nude women and sells them for livingthis is the typical premise for a romantic story the two lesslikely people who could get together meet themselves they are in a twoclass difference rose 1st and jack 3rd and at first they dont fit much each other but the more they pass time together the more they realize that theyre made to be togetherthe first problems for that couple is evidently the fishoutofwater situations jack is a poor guy who temporarily finds himself in the high society of the time and rose who voluntarily wants to get out of water spends time with jack with the other 3rd class passengers whose lifestyle is very different from the 1st class onebut the biggest problem happens next because when you say the first thing that should go to your mind is iceberg this is where the special effects wizards enter into action and its at that moment that you see why this movie cost more than what a thirdworld country has for all of its peoplethe sinking is the best part of the movie its more thrilling more exciting and more visuallydazzling than the best action blockbusters made by jerry bruckheimer or the like the spectacular views of people falling from the top of the ship the blowing furniture the water infiltrations the frozen bodies floating on the ocean all of that stuff earns my best regardsthe movie is also an epic because of its representation of the early 20th century society during all of the movie theres one thing thats never in doubt it is 1912 the high society is well shown by the 1st class cabins the costumes the ballroom the majordomos and the like that kind of stuff could easily be grabbed by an history teacher to show how life was in 1912its just impossible to hate simply because theres something for everyone those who love romantic stories will definitely fall for the jackrose relationship this is strongly due to the actors performances it is not dicaprio or winslets first acting roles but that kind of hyperbudgeted movie is what was needed to show their talent to the world and they dont waste their time dicaprio is charming tell that to young girls and professional while winslet delivers the greatest acting performance of allbut one actor that is often forgotten is billy zane his interpretation of cal is very strong and has unfairly been locked in the closet hes very aggressive tyrannic and egotistical thats exactly whats needed for the third side of the love trianglethose who prefer spectacle will have to wait until the middle of the movie to see the sinking but its worth waiting its time that you dont see passingthose who like history will definitely be pleased by the movies sets its like a travel in the past cameron used to be a sciencefiction specialist but he works astonishingly well in any time periodeverybody should approach like if they know nothing about it because i did and im glad i did i know some people who cant stand such mass publicity made about a guy with an italiansounding name and the mass budget allowed for that movie but if you defer your judgment for a moment youll see that is one of the finest movies of the decade and the greatest disaster film of all time because theres nothing more stupendous that a catastrophe that really happened,sad
these days who can make the difference between an entertaining movie and an interesting one hollywood has got a lot to answer for in that sense the current trend being that people are already bored with computer animations that plagued us since the lion king means there is still hope to get a discerning public the problem with is that the storyline is too linear too much too fast and not enough time is given to get a good picture of the characters dont get me wrong it is an entertaining movie with fantastic pictures and a lot of action however the only attempt at showing characters as they should be is in the near final postdisaster scene between di caprio and winslet thus i end up being entertained but no interest whatsoever in the whole movie as such just good for watching once methink,sad
this movie obviously deserves to be in the top 250 im surprised to see that 115000 voters havent enough sense to rate it higher than an 8 im sure it shouldnt be over 3 hours but it does make good use of its screen time its in my top 50 but i wish i could make myself not like it as much as i do a 77 or 78 if itll get it in the top 250 but not very high up this is one of the worst problems in the top 250 right now but its the fact that its a 7 not an 8 is my problem it shouldnt really be high up i would have totally different ideas to portray the id still have a story centering around persons other than j bruce ismay thomas andrews and ej smith although this movie does make good use of its time id time it down an hour or so my final rating 810,sad
it is difficult to imagine an actual event more dramatic than the story of the the true story was infinitely more interesting than that portrayed in the film and included in the actual account were love stories worth telling there was no need to invent anything much less one in which the couple make love in the back seat of a car the scene in which the hero is chained to a pipe freed by a single axe blow and then swims through the frigid water was preposterous the portrayal of the sinking was spectacular and gripping in every way it was movie making at its very best the ending of the contrived story in which a multimillion dollar necklace is tossed overboard should have been the fate of the contrivance,sad
my son was born the year this was made and hes had a lifelong interest in the as a result ive seen the 53 and 58 movies as well as this one several timesyes all the supporting characters are onedimensional the screenplay has holes you could drive a truck through and the dialogue is poor to godawful i really like the way he uses color says jack of a monet on boardrose and jacks second scene will make you cringe on so many levels the more times you see it the 17yearold rose spoiled depressed and wellschooled in freud takes a gratuitous interest in jacks sketchbook then unexpectedly decides in the course of a few seconds that hes really some artist youd think in a 200 minute move they could take a little more time with this bit which is a turning point in their relationship its too bad that cameron doesnt seem to think it matters whether anything that happens with the characters makes sensebut in the end the characters arent really what matters in terms of whether the movie works at least for me silly as jack and roses story is it does move the action along neither dicaprio nor winslett look right for their parts no getting around her looking at least 5 years older than him but the actors provide enough spark to distract you from the movies many flaws at least for the first viewing or twoand the fact is i didnt mind the the 200 minutes at all when i saw it in the theater contrast this with the vastly overpraised return of the kings the last 2030 minutes of which might have been the most excruciating experience of my moviegoing life im sure there are flaws in the cinematography i didnt notice but that combined with the score drew me into the experience and feel of being on the great ship at that point in history i generally dont care for special effects but theres no denying that those in 97 are integral to the actionas a threeyearold my son sat through the whole thing could be that makes the point for the people who hate camerons but i sat through it too i think gloria stewart deserved her oscar in the end i think cameron is overcriticized for not trying to make the movie many people wantedprobably many of the haters had already seen the 53 and 58 movies the former has the acting screenplay and dialogue that cameron lacks even though it obviously provided much of camerons inspiration while the latter is serious in ways that cameron apparently didnt appreciatestill camerons movie triggered a massive revival of interest in the which it could only have done if it effectively communicated the awesome scale of the event in history theres no getting around that even with his limitations cameron does care about the story of the and the story if not the characters is well served by camerons strengths,sad

years later its still fondly remembered even if the film has lost the powerful impact it once had and some people shamefully admit they cried in the end this film was director james camerons greatest cinematic success a largerthanlife epic thriller romance brought to life by a strong cast and an overall expensive production it came as no surprise that this beloved film swept the oscars earning the movie 11 oscars including best picture this one film made actor leonardo dicaprio a bankable star james cameron spent several years investing on this great project recreating a model of the which he then sunk hired costume designer debora lynn scott an expert on period fashion for 1912 haunting music by james horner production design by peter lamont art direction by martin laing and cinematographer russell carpenter whose rich color and panoramic scenes establish an intense realism especially in the latter portions the hype surrounding the film  not only leo dicaprio and kate winslets chemistry as the lovers but the powerfully emotional and human drama of surviving the most famous shipwreck in history the film opens in the present day where ambitious entrepreneur brock lovett bill paxton unearths relics from the sunken among them a sketching of a beautiful woman wearing a priceless diamond pendant which is what he is really after it belongs to survivor rose dewitt bucater played by old hollywood star gloria stuart who is 100 something years old she tells her story and we return to 1912 following the life of the characters on board that doomed voyage rose at age 17 kate winslet is a rich american girl on her way to philadelphia to get married to millionaire caledon hockley billy zane whom she met at her university and has not truly fallen for she is reluctant to marry or to take part of a stuffy lifestyle she finds meaningless not because she wouldnt mind being wealthy but because it would mean being denied her personal freedom these were sexist times and the movie clearly suggests this hockley may love rose but he is not presented in a sympathetic light and is generally ruthless arrogant and domineering roses mother is a selfabsorbed social climber who is pressuring her own daughter into a marriage of convenience without a thought to her daughters personal happiness when the desperately depressed rose attempts suicide american jack dawson dicaprio saves her the two strike up a romance breaking social class barriers and provoking the wrath of caledon hockley the last part of the film deals entirely with every single detail of the ships demise from the minute it hits the iceberg to the minute it sinks bottoms up into the atlantic waters impressive performances by minor characters such as kathy bates molly brown the only wealthy woman who was not a snob unlike the rest of the aristocratic brood jonathan hydes impetuous ship designer bruce ismay and victor garbers sensitive and resourceful captain andrews this is a superb film and one that is sure to stir the soul every time you view it although its quite long longer than the standard 2 hour film it is certain worth sitting through immerse yourself into the year 1912 journey across the atlantic on that illfated maiden voyage and experience the passionate love of youth all over again perhaps the most rewarding aspects of the film is its verisimilitude james cameron knew enough about the to suffuse the film with such poignant realities as the elderly germanjewish strauss couple who refused to leave their bed and died in each others arms the captain opting to go down with the ship the orchestra playing on even while the ship sank the issue of insufficient life boats and the irrepressible character of molly brown who had won millions when her husband struck gold in colorado journeyed to europe and returned home to america on the where she acted heroically by saving as many people as she possibly could the real characters of john jacob astor the richest man in america at the time guggenheim and others this film remains a wonderful and bittersweet tale of love and survival and a movie that represented the zenith of 90s cinema,sad
this movie is amazing i love history and i love love stories so this movie makes for my favorite movie of all time the suspense in the film is amazing the detail incredible and the storyline is outstanding i connect so well with rose i can understand everything about her and why she does everything i can imagine me being rose i dont connect so well with jack as a character though that is probably because 1 rose is the one telling the story and 2 jack is a male and i am female kate winslet is an awesome actress in this movie she shows rose so well and i can see the hopeful but clouded and misled young girl who is trapped into being a graceful perfect woman so well the depth of love between jack and rose is inspiring this film reminds me a bit of romeo and juliet where the two meet and quickly fall in love i also love the way that james cameron weaved so many facts about the event into the film it would of been easy to turn this into a big overdramatic story where jack becomes a hero and saves everyone on board by swimming the ship on his shoulders or the ship explodes into a thousand pieces because of a wiring problem and everyone has to live on the icebergs or well you get my drift the point is that it doesnt it sticks to the facts so well and i can imagine this story happening on i can see this being a real story and dont even get me started on the special effects the attention to detail everywhere is enchanting the way that the ship crumbles next to the iceberg and how the water bursts into the compartment suddenly leaves you gasping,sad
well i have to say that i was only 5yrs old when this movie came out and i saw it in theaters when it did i fell in love with it that same day i wasnt sure i understood the entire story but something at the age of 5 sparked my imagination and it was just wonderful i think this movie has a great mix of such wonderful actors and a great director everything about this movie was wonderful i have to say this will always be my favorite movie and it was because of kate winslet that sparked my imagination and ive wanted to be an actress so i owe her a great deal of thanks even though i have never met her but would love to meet her this movie was certainly one for the ages and i think they showed a lot of emotion and it just left me in awe i hope you all feel the same way,sad
it is a bit late in the day for me to be offering a critique of  especially given that there are so many eloquent and knowledgeable reviews already posted here however i would like to offer my retrospective view of this film after having just rewatched the piece and the alternative endings on the special dvd releasei was enthralled with when i saw it at the cinema and i was equally captivated when i watched it again on the video release what struck me more than anything else was the sheer passion for the project displayed by director james cameron i had been a huge fan of cameron and his body of work leading up to he seems to be a filmmaker who truly understands that blockbusting crowd pleasing cinema is just as vital and has as much integrity as small independent and more cerebral films an unfashionable view i guess but blockbusters with a bit of soul are possible clearly cameron invested a great deal of time energy and resource investigating the doomed and the circumstances surrounding her demise the lengths to which he and his crew went to recreate events locations and fittings faithfully can only be applauded when you read the goofs section here it seems almost a shame to pick holes in an otherwise superbly crafted film also lets not forget that cameron is a truly technically innovative film maker his early use of cgi lacks some of the seamlessness that we now expect but back then it was truly jaw droppingcameron is a director of huge quality but he is also a man that seems to divide opinion some people seem to hate him and cite his egotistical cry of king of the world at the oscars as justification for this although he was clearly just paraphrasing his jack dawson character and letting the world know how he felt not who he thought he was he is also apparently hard work on set but lets face it what perfectionist isnt hard work i am one of those who think that cameron makes fine entertaining spectacular and thoughtful films and he should be thanked for thatis majestic cinema that delivers a romantic story against the backdrop of probably the most famous and resonant maritime disaster of all time the plot is admittedly slight but when you have the drama of the sinking of  how much plot do you need one of the nice things about the dvd is that you can see the alternative ending where old rose shows bill paxton the heart of the ocean diamond which is what i really wanted to happen when i first saw the film  because the crew of the salvage vessel had some doubts about her story i found this incredibly satisfying  so if you havent seen it check it outoverall looking back over the decade that has passed since its first release had stood the test of time it is an exceptional film executed in style by a singular and forward thinking director the only downside that i can see it that it probably exhausted cameron and took him off in other directions  his output has been pretty woeful in the intervening years hopefully avatar will be a marvel 1010,sad
was the biggest ship of its timeno ship could stand up against her grandeur and excellenceshe was in every word a true master piecebut after her maiden voyage ended in tragedy she was long lost in the deepest depths of the mighty atlantic until she was once again found out in 1985but the world had to wait 2 more years for her story to be heardbut mankind had to wait 10 years for her greatest story to be heardthe story of the most beautiful love story ones ears could hearjames cameron produced his masterpiece on celluloid withthe movie captures each and every one who sets eyes on the screen with its element of humanity and loveis not the story of the biggest shipits the story of two people separated by the tumults and classes of societybut blend into one soul with their lovethis is truly one of the finest movies madea true masterpiecea must seebe amazed at the beauty of lovecourage and the stark realities of the humanityand the one thing which wins over any barrierlove,sad
this was a great movie its hard to see how i could improve on it it was over budget  ambitious  and amazingill start with the period scenery of the early 1900s  very nicely done the range of dress styles and accommodations aboard the ship as they relate to class was impressive the recreation of the was also well done throughout the movie the viewer gets to journey throughout this large ship and see everything from the huge engine room through first the class dining areaalso nicely done was the music songs and music vocalizations they integrated very nicely with the story and the idea of an ocean linerthe story  though fictional  was entertaining instead of creating a simple story at the time of the cameron gave us two  one now and one then  and linked the two nicely there is plenty of action romance and funof course everything in the story happens against the backdrop of one of the most famous disaster events in history cameron took his time depicting the tragic event and gave us a seemingly realistic insight into how events unfolded during the sinking event the special effects were excellentif youre in the mood for a great story and have an interest in the definitely consider watching this movie,sad
was a great movie one of my favorites but its not 100 accurate and im not talking about the goofs mess ups on the discovery channel there was a topic about the and people believe that the sank because the iceberg hit the side of the ship now there is evidence that states the iceberg hit the side and the bottom so therefore however many hours they say it took the ship to sing is actually half of that im not sure how many hours they had before the ship sank but for example if it was 3 they only had one in a half so please comment on this i would love to hear what you have to say but overall great movie,sad
as a 13 year old girl i saw this movie for the first time all the way through in january of this year on hbo ever since i have been obsessed you may think you will hate this movie if you havent seen it i know exactly where you are coming from before i started to watch it i thought the exact same thing and 3 hours later i was in tears this movie can get even some of the toughest people to cry there are many sad parts that have made me cry at least once including the nearer my god to thee scene old rose talking about jack jack dying and many more but there is one scene that never fails to make me cry the heaven scene where all the characters in the movie are reunited at the end of the movie on the grand staircase and jack and rose meet at the top in heaven this movie has great acting lines shots and an awesome storyline this movie is about a 3rd class male jack dawson who won his ticket on at a lucky hand of poker on the he meets a 1st class young woman by the name of rose dewitt bukater by attempted suicide and he saves her she is already engaged but her mother is forcing her to marry caledon hockley just for the fortune rose and jack fall madly in a forbidden love and fate pulls them apart when sinks 10 stars,sad
movie was directed by james cameron is a true life story i love this movie because of the tragic nature of the ship wreck which attracts some emotional feelings from the viewers movie is personal and somehow pathetic in naturebrock lovett is a ruthless treasure hunter in search of a diamond neck less believed to have been submerged under the sea in a liner he was rest assured when his crew retrieved a safe bearing a sketch of a beautiful woman wearing the diamond the story became more inviting when an old lady by name rose dawson came forward to make claims of the drawing on watching it on a tv program the historic event of the proof of ownership of the diamond by the lady in question may not be recounted here however it is pertinent to note that rose the claimer joined the at a young age of seventeen when she was lured into a false marriage with a wealthy american by her mom which almost landed her in a tragic end,sad
i cant even to begin to explain my love for this movie i first saw this movie about three years after it came out and ever since i have become obbsesed with it the acting was incrediblethey could have not had anyone better for any part played kate winslet is so beautiful and did such a wonderful job playing rose and of course leonardo did great playing jack dawsonthe romance they shared in this movie really touched my heart i bought the 3 disc dvd collection and completely enjoy it it is filled with wonderful deleted scenescameras on the set and great info from the genius directorjames cameron so if u love you will defiantly love the 3 disc dvd also if you love the soundtrack there is one you can not find in stores it has many beautiful songs you cant hear no where else i have them both and love those as well and again i love this movie it is so beautiful and completely touching and cant forget the real passengers may they rest in peace,sad
i was only 7 the first time i saw and the only thing i remembered years later was that jack died in the end but little time ago i found myself having i dony why my heart will go on stuck in the head it got me thinking about the movie and as it was raining that day and that and i had it on tape at home i decided to watch it its only then that i realized how an amazing movie it was despite the wonderful visual effects and the beautiful music to me the most amazing part that made it a worldwide success was the storyline the romance all the actors were amazing and it was the first and to this day only movie to ever make me cry since i watched it it is my favorite movie and all my friends who saw it have the same opinion,sad
there isnt a better jack dawson than leo he just makes this movie same for kate winslet shes so beautiful in this movie simply one of the best movie ever if not the best imo ive watched it tons of times and have enjoyed it like the first time one of the few movies you can see more than 15 times and not get tire of it ive watched more than 30 times and its still exciting from the begging till the end thats one of the reasons i think its the best movie ever made because every time i watch it though i know whats going to happen its still pretty exciting1997s biggest movie oh my i remember like it was yesterday i cant believe how many years have passed since this movie came out just beautiful i give it 1010 maybe its too much for some people since there are tons of haters who cant appreciate thisthanks cameron  god bless you ,sad
has to be one of the most amazing films ive seen i think it is so good how we see rose and jack succeed in their relationship but as soon as it happens the ship hits an iceberg and sinks it seems like when rose is happy something bad happens i love this film and it will always be a number one film for me  5 stari also think the acting is amazing and i dont know how anyone can dislikethe film was perfectionsigned bysummerflower,sad
when i first saw i was nine years old and just wanted to see the movie that all the critics were buzzing about i had no real idea of what the true story of the movie would be i merely assumed it was an action movie and that the cgi was amazing well it was filled with action and the cgi was amazing but what amazed me further was the story itself ive seen in full probably about 1015 times and most of them are recent viewings i dont know exactly why i cannot stop watching this film but i do realize now more than ever why it is such a great film there are flaws of course but give cameron a break he pulled off a film not many directors wouldve even dared to attemptis the best film ever made simply because of the way the story developed the story from the very beginning had a deeper meaning than just the sinking of the ship itself it touched on every issue plaguing mankind such as the conflict between good and evil trust marriage the role of women in society money and love while it may sound very bias towards the upper class reveals something that many movies try to but never fully accomplish this is the connection between money and evil yes the famous saying is money is the root of all evil and did an astounding job proving it monetary issues affected just about everything in the movie it was the reason behind everything that happened rose would have never been forced into marrying cal if it werent for money more lower class passengers may have had a better chance of survival if it hadnt been for money and lovett wouldve never found rose if it hadnt been for his lust for the diamond aka moneynot only was the movie outstanding for its development and plot the acting impressed me every actor amazed me except for amis played the role of lizzy calvert but then again her lines were limited dicaprio surely fooled me i initially assumed he was just hype and winslet stunned me beyond belief by playing her role to perfection billy zane will forever be remembered for his performance as caledon hockley and he is on my top 5 list of alltime favorite bad guys i could literally rave about the acting forever it is unmatched the best overall acting performance by any cast as for celine dions my heart will go on its not a song in particular i would like but it was a great pick for the love themeis one of the few movies to ever make me cry and im embarrassed to say that because i do not cry often however im glad that this movie is as teargouging as it is because it helps to relay the message of and it magnifies the faults of humanity better every time i sit down to watch i tell myself i will not cry at the final scenebut i always end up lying to myself i applaud cameron and everyone involved in the making of every time i see it i become more and more addicted to it,sad
i saw this movie 15 times from late december 1997 until early march 1998 in theaters upon its release and loved it each time it immidiently made my 100 favorite movies of all time list and i could see why it remained the top movie at the box office for a record 15 consecutive weeks and even more so why it became the top grossing movie of all time by early 1998 and though i did not see the march 1998 oscars i knew it was going to win the record 11 it did and could see why it had been nominated for a record 14 especially best picture director and all the technical awards it did then win it gave a very good account of the real life tragedy of the as well as integrating the real life people on board but its highlight was wrapping this around the fictional love story and relationship triangle which was at the center of its plot its pace and direction continues seamlessly from the opening modern day scene until the end and i could never once tell it was over three hours long and its climax is very exciting realistic and brings everything together this was a great way to spend a few hours of some late 1997early 1998 nights for me and i look forward to seeing it on dvd when get the chance,sad
the hope diamond is in the smithsonian it was never on thei should imagine that with the curse that the diamond had it could have been told to have been on the boat hence the sinking of an unsinkable ship however what the hell lets all believe this wonderful love story that isnt really trueif you perform a googly search on the internet you will find out the truth about the hope diamond not one word about the or any steamy sex scene with some teenage loversi hate to be a stickler for the truth especially when i enjoyed the movie so much,sad
im a thirteen year old girl and when i saw this movie about three weeks ago i fell in love with it its now one of my favorites ive seen it 5 times since and think it is a great movie to just watch on those sad rainy daysits a real tear jerker when i saw it i cried the whole ending about 45 minutes of the movie its long but when your watching it your just so into the movie you dont realize how long its really been me and all my friends love this movie and even a couple of my guy friends love the movie too its a great movie for anyone to watch my little sister who is three watched it with me and loved it too this movie was based on something that really happened with sometime that could of and that really makes it more interesting to watch because of the fact this might of been how two lovers lives were changed and the ending is a perfect way to finish the story this was the cutest movie ive seen,sad
is a great love story set in the hands of a historical background with a phenomenal plot is one of the greatest stories ever where survivor rose is narrating the story she experienced herself back to her seventeen engaged self to the heir of steel tycoon nathan hockley his son caledon rose feels trapped but on her stay on finds jack dawson by fate who she shares a personal and special connection with the dreams he is already living she aspires and there fore an amazing chemistry is formed between the two until an iceberg hits and their love for each other is tested by powerful means its a race for survival and the passengers are doomed with an amazing cast this tale comes to life on the big screen and will always be remembered,sad
this film won 11 oscars was on everybodys favourite films list and was cast with some of the most talented actors of its time probably ever for these particular roles however now it seems that people are embarrassed to admit how great really is for the simple reason really that people made it famous many people now wish to disclaim the performances particually that of leonardo dicaprio just because after the film came out they became worldwide heartthrobs and the fact that they delivered truly memorable performances is thrown aside i love this film and am proud to admit it its an excellent film that no matter who disagrees will live forever and go down in history as one of the greatest ever made,sad
well this film catched the hearts of million viewers all over the world by the way this film was released early in 1997 but ive watched this film late on 2000 what a late bloomer some people says this is a great and very touching movies so i tried to search a original copy of this film and luckily i found it its very touching you know the story lines sound effect and flow of the story ive feel i was there in the unsinkable ship together with the other passenger when its sinking what a masterfully done by james cameronthe actors are greats such as leandro and kate they justified the role they played in the film i cry in the scene that jack is dying in the freezing water and rose try to wake up jack when she see the rescuer to catch them ill give 9 out of ten in this film it was great ever,sad
for the people trying to make this movie looks like crap common admit it this is a good movie and it deserve to be in the top 250 list is better than many of the movies in top 250 list still in its time was overrated and overhype but in imdb is underratejames cameron did a great job and made a good movie he mixed fictions with facts clever the triangle lovetragedy rich vs poor wins the heart of the rich girl soup opera style is fiction is really the center of the movie and not the leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet acting was ok the costuming sound cinematography and editing were very goodhow was possible to make a good movie an 11 oscar winner and best grossed in history ouh ouh mass manipulation yeah media marketing rumors  my heart will go on good song attracted so many people to the theater creating a competitive environment expi have seen it 8 time i have seen it 11time i have seen it  times everyone is seen it  everyone is doing it  fighting for who has seen it more  the rumors cheesy like go and see the movie before it got out the cinemas because you will have to wait until 2007 for the home version make history dont go alone take a chick at the end you will score see it so you can talk about it so you dont feel out of grouppeople got so caught up they didnt realize isnt that good sometime people go so wrong those who saw more than 2 times plain stupid at the end they got ripped off,sad
its amazing this movie is just incredible leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet are absolutely awesome i cant see any one else playing these two roles in this movie as well as they did i dont think that i have ever seen any better special effects in any movie that ive seen before even the music brought the moment of the time in the movieim not even closed to surprised that this movie won eleven oscarsyes this movie is probably one of the saddest movies that i have ever seen in my life but you must see this movie if havent yet which i am surprised if you havent you will definitely not regret it,sad
well lets seethis movie is the most successful movie of all time it is wone of three movies which has one the most no of oscars ie 11and yet people now days think its overrated and plus its not even on the top 250 list of imdbi thought it was a good movie maybe its not better than godfather or shawshank redemption but giving it 70 is cruelit has great acting astounding direction and i still wonder why people hate itany thoughts,sad
the acting was just the right depth for its time of which it was set in i feel that leonardo decaprio portrayed his character jack very well and emotionally isnt it a shame he didnt get an oscar nomination i would like kate winslet to never play her character rose again due to her perfected version now i doubt sincerely that a lot of people love this film due to its other meanings which in my view are out side the box of many critics of the film think about it i do feel the direction was ok and the cinematography was up to standard i was freaked at my immediate 1010 because i so reluctantly give films this also i would like to add it didnt make me cry it just made me feel very attached with the characters,sad
i love the movie but its really sad but i think its kinda predictable cause you can tell jack and rose will get together and that jack will die right from the start but it made a couple of mistakes i mean they didnt have flashlights like what they have in it back in 1912 and the lights in the ship should have turned of earlier cause they had no back up power and stuff like that then but i think its so sad cause you know that only a few people will live you know that all the poor will die i think its a great movie though watch it if you havent yet and if you want the song my heart will go on go to wwwmp3intcom and download it free,sad
i voted 9 in because is my favourite movie because it is a mixture of romance and death and that proves that love is more powerful then death and even though jack leonardo dicaprio died in the ocean of coldness she still lived to carry on his name so that why i love because it is s mixture if different things and that love really is more powerful then deathshe lived on on that very day those words that jack leonardo dicaprio said will probably stay with me for eva these are the words that were saidno matter what happens you must stay alive and never let go because i want you to live and make lots of babies and always remember me that night jack dawson died,sad
this movie was okay and i dont mean a good way either the only good thing to come out of it is when the bloody thing hits an icebergbreaks in halfsinkskills a whole bunch of people that died 80 years before i was born if it wasnt for all the deaths and screaming id probably just fall asleepthe love story was stupid both leads couldnt act their way out of a potato sack i sat through the first half thinking jesus christ just sink already winslet should of saved movie goers time and just jumped if i was jack id give a huge shoveback in the days where there was no radiostvvideo gamesnothing remotely interesting to dojust shows how people back then were very pathetic even the rich cats what a bunch of losers did i mention the only good part was the end well it was i laughed my ass off when it hit the iceberg i laughed when the ship rose up and broke in half i laughed when that one idiot leaped off the damn thing only to hit the propellertoo bad it wasnt running when he hit it boyall us teenagers in the theater had a jolly laugh when the ship broke in half and a few people fell in what a place to be standing huh i laughed when the people were sliding down the ship and that ladies dress blew up several of us laughed at that scene i laughed when that one dude at the bottom of the ship got electrocuted in fact we were making comments throughout the film like suckers and other deserving comments that these losers all deserved i laughed when the loveboat finally sank last but not least i was rather delighted when jack diedthe last hour of it was quite entertaininghilarious as well james cameron is a true comic genius the deaths were so laughable one could help but laugh i couldnt be happier when the old bat finally croaked the icing on the cake if i was to give this movie a rating id have to say itd get a 5 it only got that much because of the rather amusing ending if things like that would happen today the news would be so much less boring,sad
this film is an excellent film and a very good costume drama i absolutely loved this film from beginning to end kate and leo i think are fantastic actor and played the part very well unfortunately with tragic consequences it made me cry at the end and made people think about the class differences and those poor people who died on that ship a wonderful movie tearful and heart stopping one of the best scenes is when jack and rose go dancing to irish music and rose gets tipsy when she balances on her toes i thought that must of hert her feet this film get 10 out of 10 from me a must see movie i would recommend it to anyone,sad
i saw this movie when it first came out and i was just in first grade it was so mind boggling i had never seen special effects like it and somehow even when i was that little i still understood the romance and jack and roses love for each other its my favorite movie of all time in my opinion its my mothers gone with the wind or wizard of oz i absolutely love it i watched it for the first time with two of my friends after not seeing it for many years and by the end of the movie we had used up 3 boxes of kleenex after seeing it again i was disappointed to see the special effects after movies like lord of the rings there were fog lines around the ship when it was sinking the sky was very fake and you could tell the background was fake all throughout the movie but the acting the acting makes the movie the love is the most believable love in any movie you can tell that the story was a love that lasts for ever even though millions of people hate this movie millions also are in love with it and millions will cherish it forever and it will go on in the lovers hearts no matter what a user vote says,sad
the script is dire the storyline obvious and the special effects not entirely convincing but there is something about this film that means i simply have to give it a good grade  i owe it to the 17yearold girl i was when it was released who saw it four times at the cinema i was addicted to it as was my most cynical of friends the combination of an already compelling story about one of the worst disasters in maritime history attractive leads in winslet and di caprio and a ashamedly gushy script means it assaults the emotions captures the imagination and made it one of  if not the  biggest films in the history of cinema a part of me does wonder if it was right to make a film about this especially given james camerons egocentric obsession with it my grandfather wont even watch it as he grew up in ireland in the years following the catastrophe and it was very much mourned there but the thing is that it was made and did its job very very well i bet you you know exactly what i mean,sad
what can i say that hasnt already been said about james camerons those of you who havent heard of it must have been living under a rock these past ten years seeing as it remains the highest grossing movie of all time and won a remarkable 11 oscarsyes including best picture there are people who hate itpeople who seem unconvinced that a film of such grand spectacle and infinite popularity could possibly own up to the hypeand then there are those who love it and i am proud to say that i am among the admirers maybe its because im a hopeless romantic but theres an appeal to the moviea sort of magic that captivates me every time i watch it everyone should watch this movie at least once in their life and while doing so forget the mass popularity and view it as what it really isa bittersweet unforgettable love story,sad
i am sure that this film was top of the worlds highest grossing films at the cinema for a reason rose kate winslet is a wealthy woman on the ship when she meets a young man called jack leonardo dicaprio jack is a poor man who immediately falls in love with kate it is your typical love story which is exactly why i love it it mixes tradition with originality and never falls too far away from the main plot if you havent already seen the film i advise you to go now there are some deeply emotional parts to the film which draw you deeper to the storyline the storyline is not hard to follow yet it is not too simple the tragedy at the end of the film will always make you cry no matter how many times you see it it is best to see it not too young but in your early teens as then when you are older when you watch it it will bring back the memories when you were most emotional thus causing a better experience all in all i would always rate this movie a 10 out of 10,sad
this is the best movie i have ever seen i absolutely love it i search my cable channels every day just to see if its on and i watch it every time lost track of how many times ive seen it but its enough to have memorized the entire 3 hours and 14 minutes seriously this is definitely a must see over and over again it never gets boring granted 3 hours and 14 minutes seems long but it goes by so quickly the movie is over so quickly i really want them to rerelease it next december in the movie theater for the 10 year anniversary if you havent seen it definitely head to out and buy it immediately any dvd collection is not complete without it or a few copies like me in case one of them breaks or wears out from too much usage,sad
this movie is super great but kinda suggestivelaugh out loud its a tearjerker definitely i mean to think that all of those people died god leonardo of course is hot hot hot i visited the exhibit in orlando and that completed the experience that the movie brings you being a girl i cried through pretty much all of this movie i wish that every girl could find a guy like leonardo in this movie at least that would love them as much as he loved that girl i cant really say anything bad about this movie because its just too too too great if you havent seen it which is unlikely then go to blockbuster right now this is one of those classic movies youll never ever forget,sad
i cant believe this movie has such a low score a 7 come on guys its a classic and it was brilliantly producedlets not forget that it is the highestgrossing movie in history as to date it has made 185 billionto pick out any weak points the main storyline regarding the romance of rose  jack is perhaps a little clich but overall this movie is very goodif not excellent the special effectsacting and stunts are all performed exceptionallythis movie is so underrated that i was shocked when i saw the 7 stars i mean its made more money than stars wars lord of the rings mission impossible and anything remotely close,sad
is indeed an excellent movie and one that everyone should probably see at some point or another it is truly a gem among films the cinematography is absolutely breathtaking easily some of the best that i have ever seen the performances from both leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet are some of the truest and most heartfelt ever their chemistry is perfect totally and utterly believable james cameron does an awesome job directing the suspense remains the entire time even though you know how its going to turn out my only problem with is the length seriously a good half hour  45 minutes could have been cut from the end do we really need to see all of those people drown yes and no no because 3 hours and 14 minute is way to long even for an epic movie yes because it makes the entire thing more believable and all the more heartgut wrenching is an amazing movie but not one that you can see a ton of times the 1st time its amazing the 2nd time its okay the 3rd time you end up checking your watch ever 5 minutes waiting for it to be over a solid 1010,sad
ha this movie was fantastici dont understand how people could not like it i meanits pure brillianceit deserves 10 hands downi will admit i criedlike a babyand so did my girlfriendbut it was great i really felt like i knew the characters and thats not common in movies of todayive seen it i dont know how many times and the end still gets mealso the musiclike it or notwas perfectbeautifulits a great love storyhad me intwinedevery time i watch it it has the same effect i cant keep my eyes off the screenand if u have never seen it i suggest you dothis movie is great,sad
they look excellent in the movie together they would also make a cute couple i love the movie and of all the special effects its a love story with true facts of the its my number one movie of all times but jack shouldnt have died in the movie great job even if this was a true storyit would have had so many more viewers if jack and rose died togetherold or youngit was all put great together and an excellent touch to it that can make you cry for several hours i also love how all the ladies wear their gowns like they would have in the early 1900sbut what makes the movie even more of a love story and a sad story is when rose dies in her warm bed like an old lady like she promised and she dies having a dream of her getting married with jack dawson,sad
i love this film the acting is excellent the cgi is excellent the stunts are excellent the production is excellent and the ship itself is excellent kate winslet and leonardo dicarprio give 100 in this film this is shown in jacks death scene not the acting of leo but of kate she really brings tears to many peoples eyes even if there not the sort to cry at a film celine dion sung a great song and james cameron did an amazing job in creating this film especially with the creations of the sets eg the lounge the iceberg im overjoyed that they won about 11 oscars i hope james cameon does a film on one of sister ships britannic,sad
so in 1997 my parents went to the theatres ajd saw and when they came home my mom was all in tears and my dad was laughing of course he was laughing because of all the people frozen now i was only 6 years old and i wanted to see the movie really bad but my parents were like no it is not a movie for you of your ageso im guessing early 2000s i was at a friends house and i looked thru the vhss and they had right there so i begged and plead if i could see it and they are like ok but beware it is 3 hours so we popped in the tape and watching for 3 hours and at the end everyone even the boys were crying it was the most amazing movie i have seen even today right from the beginning to the sinking the special fx were great and still cant be passed today it is my gavorite movie of all time and i have become obsessed with every since my mom also told me that my grandmas mom was on it so which made me interest go really upthere is no other movie like it and i dont think a movie will surpass it until another 25 years but everyone said the reason the 2005 king kong didnt make much money was because of the length of it well is the same length and it has made the most money than any other movie in historyis great amen,sad
was known as the ship of dreams but now is known as the movie of dreams it is every directors dream to make a movie such as it has become a grading scale for movies of today at first i had no interest in seeing but after all my friends saw it and wouldnt shut up about it i decided to see what all the fuss was about boy was i blown away i have never seen a movie like it before this is one of the few movies i have actually bought i was completely satisfied in every way a movie goer should be satisfied the detail in the movie was unbelievable from the costumes props and set design the music fit the movie perfectly not one cue was out of place all the acting was good especially from kate winslet and gloria stewart if i had to state a negative about the movie the only thing i could possibly think of would time this movie is long but it is good and i think it is well worth taking 3 hours out of your life to take a fascinating journey back to the heart of,sad
is a excellent film in every respect james cameron handles it with care i couldnt think of many people to do this type of film sam menzies steven spielberg just to name a few the visuals are fantastic this film deserves every single peace of critical acclaim i dont know a person who cannot like this film if you have not seen this see it every man woman and child in the planet should see this i dont think there are enough words to praise this i could go on for hours talking about the film you can watch it as many times as you want but you will not get boredso get down to your video store now and see it,sad
the first time i saw it i cried my heart out the film is a special and i knew it from the first time that i saw it in the film you never know what will happen next obviously you excpect that jack and rose will remain together but that is not what happens sometimes directors try to do their film as people excpect it to end in a happy ending but one must realise that in reality that is not what happens at least not always and i really like these types of films actually i like all types of films leonardo di caprio is so cool and in the film at least he and kate winslet look perfect for each otherbut one may never know,sad
i love this movie from the amazing sets and costumes to the epic adventure of jack and rose as they battle for survival on the the music done by james horner gives me chills every time i hear it and i am always listening to the soundtrack i love how he captures the essence of the joy at the beginning of the movie when it is first leaving from southhampton through the love story of jack and rose to the heartwrenching tragic ending of the rms the casting is superb leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet are two of my favorite actors and have the most incredible chemistry i really believed that they were in love the story is amazing and i love how everything that does not happen between jack and rose is true watching the extra features on the bonus dvd i saw the incredible resemblance between the actors and the real people who were on the such as molly brown and the captain i cry for days after watching this movie because it seems so real the way that james cameron captures the story of the through love passion and tragedy is outstanding i really enjoy watching this movie but also i feel deeply for the people who lost their lives on that tragic day of april 15th 1912 if anything this movie should come back to theaters for the 100th anniversary of the sinking of the i as a fan would be thrilled,sad
ive noticed recently how various critics and the general population treat horribly with the test of time i find it shocking how a movie that was regarded as one of the best movies of all time has fallen ill to tons of criticisms people seem to find it hip now days to bash and i fail to understand why i personally find it to be the greatest movie ive seen the academy awards seemed to think it was a pretty damn good movie the critics when it first came out werent too harsh and moviegoers truly expressed how the general population felt about with the gigantic ticket salesnow however makes the overblown movie lists from several critics endures extreme mockery and the ridicule of anyone who actually admits to liking it this may have been due to people wanting to be different from the norm in 1997 and maybe this attitude never went away and too many people fell victim to it or maybe it was the cheesy scenes people like to imitate over and over which obviously must mean the entire movie is cheesy however i recently watched the other day and im going to say why i find it to my favorite movie of all timethe ship itself expressed a mentality during this time period in which humans felt they could overcome mother nature with the sinking of this ship it made people truly eat the words is an unsinkable shipwith the character rose a first class passenger you are exposed to the arrogance high society had rose also opened your eyes to the luxuries high society had and how woman were truly trapped and were seen as secondclass citizens rose almost committing suicide helps hit home how truly horrible it must have been for woman during this time period the dynamics between rose and her mother also show the dynamics between how woman had to behave and in a sense how they survived in this societywith the character jack a third class passenger you are exposed to how large the gab between the rich and poor was how first class dogs went down to be walked on the lower decks how it was the poor who actually built and how it was the poor who were treated truly unfair on just because of social status which helped express the mentality of the timehaving these two characters meet and expose the viewer and each other to these different lifestyles helped truly put into perspective the mentality of what this time period was like sure it was in a way a cliche love story two people from different worlds falling in love but regardless of it being typical it still exposed the different classes in a way that truly made you realize how it was for people back then also many things are clich for a reason they most of the time work and have been shown to work time and time againwithout this love story you would have just come away with the basics of this story the sinking but this love story created sympathy in which you felt for jack and rose it made you truly feel how the people on the were feeling at that exact moment families loved ones and friends were being torn apart without the emotion created from the love story you wouldnt have felt nearly as sad or seriously towards what had actually happened to these peopleas for it being morally wrong on the part of rose well she was trapped by her mother and society the man cal whom she was getting married to proved to be inconsiderate towards others was very mean rude and thoughtless even before he knew of the situation between rose and jack he deserved and was asking for everything he got what rose did was what many do in youth and sometimes you have to take what life gives you at that moment thats exactly what she did and people shouldnt say her actions were immoral they were done out of love at first sight and out of vengeance towards the arrogant class she was apart ofwas very authentic and very historically accurate it did include a lot more then just the love story it had information about the lifeboats the binoculars how exactly it sank the famous people aboard the ship and numerous other things even things such as the firstclass band and their situation what exactly was sung on the last time day light hit the at the morning church gathering increasing more speed regardless of ice warnings and many more examples were all little details included in this movie which made it far more then just a love story if you actually paid attentionone of the major flaws people say this movie had was the acting i however thought it had amazing acting and i saw nothing wrong with it acting is something that is hard to pinpoint in terms of being good or bad i find it an easy way to attack any film if you say the acting is bad you cannot really prove to that person it was good acting is something that just goes to personal opinion and you cannot really change someones mind on it i personally give an a for acting and even the script but one thing to consider is that many shots could only be done a few times or even once because of what they had to do to the sets making it sometimes hard to get the perfect takeoverall one the best movies ever made,sad
its now 1 amand before going to sleep i need to salute this movie as its unfair not say a single word for this movie before going to sleepi re watched it after a long time and after went to my bed i looked intently at the roof for about half and hour and could not believe that those people on ship were gone through all thisand all the unimaginable love fr kate and jack even though this was a fiction movie and some of the facts might be different but this movie produced by a humanjames is extra xtra ordinaryi give damn to all faults in the movie pointed by ur any of the viewer in spite of all those faultswhich were noticed and calculated by the viewers after their sheer hard workto say something against this movie as its part of their nature to be critic always an ordinary viewer wont mind them come onthe movie is fr us to enjoyto feel the painand to understand all the agonies no one is perfect,sad
this movie was a good movie period nobody can say different but the thing that brought down the movie a little was the fact that rose and jack where the movie focused the most they were fake lets be realistic nobody is going to fall in love with someone in two days had they been a couple together already before they got on that would have been good characters like the legendary captain smith mr andrews murdoch wilde lightholler and ismay they were in the movie but could have been more involved the sinking was sad captain smiths scene where he heads to the bridge and when all the windows burst when its completely submerged is probably one of the best scenes in movie history,sad
james cameron is always to impressand that is why im going to say this film is his second best terminator 2 being 1 its a good story great acting by kate winslet and leonardo dicaprio professional directing just basically one of the best films ever it deserves every bit of its box office total even though i am a boy i balled my eyes out at the end of this movie it was a wonder to see in the movie theater and is just as good with its 3 disc digitally enhanced dvd collection which i own so if u have not seen this film i highly advise you to do so it takes all the elements of sound picture acting directing editing all it its highest and creates a monumental film that should be forever remembered 2010,sad
tell me what your favorite dress is that rose wears mine would certainly have to be the gorgeous dinner gown however i am also in love with the jump dress theyre both so impressive in case youre a bit hazy about the dresses she wore let me refresh your memory 1 pin striped suit at the begging w brimmed hat 2 red beaded dress she wears when she attempts suicide 3 the greenlace dress she wears when jack first sees her 4 the silky blue dress she wears when she kissed jack at the end of the ship 5 the red layered dinner gown 6 the white and black one with the rose on the collar which i believe she wears when she is having tea alone w cal 7 the flowing purplepink dress she wears during the sinking of the shipi might have forgot a few sorry,sad
i saw this film for the first time the day it came out on video at the time i would have been 9 but until watching it again for the first time in at least 2 years last night i realized i never truly cared or understood how truly beautiful this film was and is it is both amazing and sad how you can forget how truly great a movie is if you dont watch it for a period of time i have always loved the movie but until last night when out of absolutely nowhere i decided to watch it did i love this film for the right reasons aside from the awesome sinking ship and amazing visual effects stuff that kids 913 years will enjoy there is so much else than anyone of any age can and will enjoythe acting is amazing especially that of kate winslet who was in my opinion robbed of the oscar for best actress the cinematography is absolutely breathtaking and the music score by james horner may very well be the most beautiful thing ever made by a man absolutely undeniably perfect it is easily the best score for any motion picture ever just thinking about it makes me tear up all in all this movie deserved the 11 academy awards it took home and i could go on and on but i need not because unless you have been living under a rock for the past 9 years you have already seen this movie and every positive thing i could say about it has already been said that being said i will tell you one thing more this movie made me cry numerous times throughout and not many films do that to me very few in fact so any film that can do that is great in my book i know this movie takes a lot of heat now but its very unnecessary and it does not deserve the heat it takes and i simply do not understand why anyone could not love this movie registers a 70 rating on imdbcom 70 that is very sad come on this movie deserves at least an 81 rating and a spot in the top 250 i cannot stress enough how beautiful this film isyou can say what you want about this film i say its one of the greatest and most powerful films ever made and historically whether or not you like the movie it is going to go down as the most successful and one of if not the most important movie in existencethis is now and forever one of my 10 favorite films 1010,sad
i love this movie 100 its got a great storyline good drama and good casting esp the lead actorlol kate winslet is a fabulous actress and an inspiration to young girls everywhere with her sensible enviable figure and i love her as a redhead how on earth did she not win an oscar great movie anyone who hasnt seen it is mad  i recommend it 100 fave scenes the flying one the drawing scene the one where rose saves jack by cutting the handcuffs the bit where she jumps back onto the boat this is where we first met and the very end scene low points none one warning have a box of tissues ready 1010,sad
is an excellent movie its very dramatic emotional overwhelming magnificent i was really impressed when i saw this movie and i dont think i can say anything negative about it some people say that in the whole first half of the movie nothing happens i dont think that way about from the first moment the two saw each other you felt there were already sparks between them also the music is vry beautiful this is a fascinating movie its dramatic gripping emotional sometimes exciting the acting is also good the music is marvelous one of the best movies ever made if you havent seen it you should try to see it as soon as you can excellent work from director james cameron the whole cast and the whole crew,sad
many people think this movie is average largely because it has been at the front of hundreds of jokes about the pathetic romance in it personally i totally disagree the romance is how it should be if you are going to watch a romantic film you need it to move you and make you fall in love with the characters in this film you dont connect so much with the characters but you can see how the characters connect with each other which is something else entirely if these people who were insulting this movie were to sit down in a theatre and watch it alone i am sure that they would love it hell these people were the ones that were raving about it in 97 the special effects are like nothing seen before on film they are amazing for the time the special effects were very ahead of its time and even now to this day the effects are just as good to be honest the effects look far more realistic than the effects in movies like die another day you cannot spot any cg in the entire movie except for the iceberg which is obviously cgi am really not surprised that this picture was so great because it had an amazing director at the helm who knows the subject well it is believed that king of the sequels director james cameron researched for 5 years before creating this masterpiece and it paid off with 11 oscars to match benhurs record which was later broke by return of the kingjames cameron is known as a perfectionist for his work and this is no exception everything from the boarding of the ship to the boarding of the lifeboats is sublime and extremely correct it is very faithful to the actual disaster and even the cutlery was of the exact nature of the real 1912 cutlery on boardi give this a 10 and highly recommend this for anybody young or old not only because it has romance for the girls but has action for the guys part of the reason this did so well is because has something for everyone i am a guy and i was brought to tears watching this movieit is meant for the big screen so try to get hold of a high definition tv or a projector as its the best way to be viewed1010 25042006,sad
i didnt see in 1997 i was only five years old then but as i grew older i really wanted to see it and i did see it  and i loved it its an amazing movie the actors are great the director is great and the set was built so realisticthe story of the rich girl meeting the poor boy is great and as you learn more about them you find out that emotionally its the poor boy that is rich and he has so much to give to the rich girl though it has a sad ending i think thats what makes it such a great moviethe performances of leonardo dicaprio as jack dawson and kate winslet as rose dewitt bukater are excellent they are so good at it and you just get the feeling that you are there also the performances of the other actors such as victor garber as thomas andrews and kathy bates as molly brown are of firstclassi love this movie and i can see it over and over again if you havent seen it theres really something you have missed and you should see it this is the best movie i ever have seen and i doubt there ever will come one which is better,sad
if you have ever considered gone with the wind to be less than a masterpiece youll have to admit that this one is no less either is one of the greatest american classics ever made it tells the story of love and hope the two lovers both think the world is there for them and classes cannot influence their deep love for eachtotheralthough the movie is long it is never boring a reason for that are the performances dicaprio is very good charming and sometimes funny winslet is outstanding but i have to say that the best thing in this movie is cameron to make you care for a character like that is a pretty hard thing to do but he makes it seem so easy it is one of the strongest directing i have ever seenbesides the story and the acting we have the music the sets the costumes and the cinematography it is all great it will be a classic from now on right up there with gwtw,sad
this is the best movie ever i cried i laughed i was shocked i was sad it was the perfect movie ever i love this movie and the thing that i loved the most is the song i think that song is like the best song ever i dont know if this movie got an oscar but if it didnt it should my friends and i are always playing around copying that part of where she leaves her hand print on the fog in the car that was my favorite part i love this movie and if u havent seen it yet you really should because it made me realize something love is not always gonna be there so cherish it if it wasnt for this movie i dont think i would be going out with my boyfriend right now i love this movie so much no joke,sad
this movie was loved and then it was loved to be hatedpersonally it drives me crazy it had amazing effects a great secondary cast and extras and the sinking scene is one of the most stomach wrenching things i have ever seen in a moviebut james cameron cannot write dialog unless it was already based on something that happened in reality it was awful and it wasnt dicaprio or winslets faults as they arent bad when theyre not talking and they have been great in other thingsnot to mention yes you can certainly watch a documentary if you want the true story of the but that doesnt change one simple fact the real story is more interesting than a stilted generic love storyso many things not included in the movie charles lightoller and twenty other men standing on an overturned lifeboat for hours in freezing water is somehow less interesting than cal hockley the most generic villain i have seen on screen in a long timeso why do i bother watching victor garber as thomas andrews is heartbreaking and probably the best thing in the movie i also love the man who plays wallace hartley the entire nearer my god to thee scene is fantasticor when winslet and decaprio finally shut up they have a good scene or two when rose is being lowered in a lifeboat and looking up at jack and when rose and some minor characters exchange these amazing little looks as they wait on the stern for the ship to go downthere is some great eyeacting in this movie victor garber the man playing william murdoch the priest in the sinking scene as praying people grab his hands most of the extras and the people in the lifeboatsbut jmes camerons dull fiction and dreadful dialog kills the movie its a lot shorter the way i watch it a lot gets fast forwared but i keep watching because when the movie is great its greatit would have been a masterpiece if cameron had stuck to reality not because it was reality but because it was a thousand times more interesting than a stilted love storya better writer than camron would be hard pressed to write fiction more interesting than the reality of that nighta night to remember is much much better but is a goodish could have been amazing movie that i cant help but go back to for its quality elements,sad
was one of the greatest movies ive ever watched i have always been fascinated with the story of the once greatest ship of its time dicaprio and winslet were amazing the movie came together beautifully the special effects were mystifying and put you almost on the this movies touched my heart as i watched what those people went through it was heart breaking this truly was a great accomplishment of james cameron and all the cast and crew i think that this movie has showed people more of what happened that night in 1912 i would most definitely recommend you rent or buy this movie it was simply perfect,sad
when i first saw i was amazed at how well it was done the acting was perfect the directing excellent and the storyline was also good every time my family and i my mom and i go to rent movies i always try to rent i think its the best movie ive seen besides chronicles of narnia my grandparents have never seen this movie i told them that they should rent it and watch it because it was a very good movie it was good there was lots of drama which i like there was also romance woven into the storyline which i also liked i think that jack leonardo dicaprio and rose kate winslet made great leading people in the movie they worked well together and i was surprised thats the reason why i give 10 out of 10 the acting directing and storyline are excellent if you havent seen yet i encourage you to rent it and watch it its a great movie 10 out of 10 for,sad
its hard to believe that nearly nine years have passed since this movie came out its a masterpiece of special effects and storytelling even if the romance schmaltzes it up a bit im not too critical about films that stretch the truth if that were not the case we would only watch documentaries and of course many of those are suspect in addition to the incredible recreation of the and the people who sailed her there is an air of mystery maintained throughout accentuated by the incredible music score the fact that we all know the story and the result makes us voyeurs to history i enjoyed this movie and yet it made me sad i sat next to a couple of twenty something types with their baseball caps on backwards yelling all right when a falling body would smack against an obstruction as it plummeted down the length of the capsizing ship i sat in awe of the power of nature and imagined those poor people dying from the stupidity of an overconfident shipbuilder and captain i know its just a movie but it had a really connection to my heart the business with leonardo de caprio and kate winslet didnt really grab me what did was that there was a hopelessness beyond anything we can fathom if you read my review of a night to remember also a fine film from much earlier you will see that its about people saying goodbye to their wives and children and to another day that makes this event so horrible its quite a marvelous movie we may have forgotten that in the wake of all the attention it received including parodies and spoofs,sad
is an overall amazing movie it even includes romance in a movie about a disaster you would think romance wouldnt work so well but it really makes the movie spectacular kate winslet and leonardo dicaprio act with such passion that it makes the whole movie wonderful it definitely deserved the oscar for best picture the detail is amazing the furniture utensils etc is absolutely extraordinary i definitely recommend the soundtrack matches the movie so good and the feeling and passion in the movie makes it feel like you were there the suspense comes in at all the right places and really contributes to the overall movie its amazing how the was recreated to look like the actual ship it really does the historical footage at the beginning of the movie and near the end really shows how bad the sinking was and how terrible it would have been to have to leave your loved ones on the sinking ship as you stepped into a life boat again i really recommend its an extraordinary movie,sad
james cameron takes the story of the disaster and transforms it into a wonderful breathtaking moviethe movie revolves around two lovers jack and rose who come from very different worlds we watch as conflict unfolds with roses family and her decisions about jack then the iceberg hits the movie then turns from a romance to a actionsurvival story we are thrown into the devastating sinking of even though we know how the movie ends the ship sinks we are still able to become caught up in the movie although their are a few questionable parts the overall movie is amazing,sad
i love this movie so much and it has a special place in my heart for personal reasons james cameron is a superb director with focus and determination that no one can match leonardo dicaprio brings hollywood glamour without taking any focus from kate winslet who shines through the chemistry between the two is powerful and as a viewer you are sucked in to their world and you really feel for them as a couple and as individuals the movie is packed full of special effects and credit must also be given to the supporting actors such as billy zane as cal and the wonderful kathy bates as molly brown the action scenes are extremely powerful and the love scenes are so moving they reduce a grown man to tearsthe whole movie is captivating kate winslet and leonardo dicaprio bring a sense of class to the movie while james cameron brings experience you can tell james cameron has done his homework on the history as every little detail has been inserted in to the film probably the most detail was put in to the dining room in the upper class suitesthis movie is a most have for any movie goer and has to be in everybodys collection it is a movie that will definitely stand the test of timeloved it,sad
i think was a magnificent work of art each scene was flawless captivating the viewer true everyone knows the story behind yet the setting of the ship and the impressive role behind each actor makes it valuable the interior of the ship was remarkable it was designed to fit the era of the historical event the difference in character between the rich and poor that designates them to their destiny also was a great part of the movie yeah has a love story and maybe thats what makes it more exciting i think was a real classic if you havent watched it i would highly recommend you to,sad
i just love this movie kate winselt and leonardo dicaprio are really good actors i hope i will be able to see them in a film together sometime down the road it is just my absolute favorite movie ever there may have been many mistakes but it still pulled together very nicely i could not think of any better actors to have played in this film the ending was sad but excellent at the same time i definitely give this movie a ten it must have took a lot of money and time but they were very successful i am still torn by the fact that it happened in real life i am sure it was ten times more devastating then i recommend everybody to see this film thank you for reading,sad
i thoroughly enjoyed this wonderful tale of forbidden love set on historys most famous ocean liner and believe both the film and its engaging and sympathetic young lovers will go down in the annals of screen legend all the hype turned out to be a prediction of the movies calibre as far as im concerned though some have described it as the movie many love to hate of course the film chronicles the tragically brief shipboard romance between rose a beautiful confused young socialite traveling first class of course who is engaged to a suitable but nasty fianc of her social status and jack the penniless free spirited young artist traveling in steerage third class the lead roles are brilliantly portrayed with electric chemistry by the lovely kate winslet and the dashing young leonardo dicaprio both made famous by their roles here pity dicaprio went on to do that foolish modern romeo  juliet a desecrationas for the romanceyes its a moving tale that will endure along with other screen legends the weaving of the tale of the diamond necklace the heart of the ocean and jacks sketch of rose are interesting story lines when disaster strikes the ill fated ship the struggles of rose and jack to stay alive are truly gripping the films romantic song my heart will go on is of course legendary though i personally am not a tremendous fan of celine dionthis movie is not from my perspective a historical documentary and i dont take it as such my knowledge of history is pretty sketchy and it wouldnt surprise me if the film contains a few some or even many inaccuracies still for me the picture brought to life the spectacle of the extravagant luxury aboard this liner decor dining passengers attire etc the smug complacent assurance that the ship was unsinkable the tragedy and surely eventual terror as the passengers struggled with the inadequate life boats provided and the great white star liner sank albeit despite the early refusal to contemplate such a fate and the band eventually bravely playing on the final scenes are haunting hardly a dry eye in the theatre i feel the fictional romance is interwoven well with the historical details to produce a film that elicits compassion for the unfortunate real victims back in 1912 and would not offend them were they able to watch it todaythe class distinctions are also wonderfully conveyed one reviewer has complained that the film belabors the greater integrity and friendliness of the lower class casting the upper class generally in a less flattering light however historically let us remember that the lower class passengers were the primary victims so they would naturally tend to elicit the film makers and viewers sympathiesall in all an amazing modern spectacle based on a tragic historical event a touching love story and overall a fantastic film,sad
this film is dull trash and highly overrated i wonder how it got to be so successful it is clichd beyond belief the story is dull and again clichd and best bit is at the end when the boat crashes which should of been the whole film and why i rated it 3 and not 1playing on all the old cinema clichs the film portrays the rich as unhappy fakes who are nasty and vindictive and the working class as the salts of the earth happy and content this is just the tip of the iceberg sorryacting is awful as well and i cared little or non for any of the characters i am still unsure why this was a blockbuster both critically and commercially and what were all the oscars forjames cameron spent 200 million dollars on this trash maybe no one dared to say it was rubbish at the timeterrible theme music as well should have drowned without a traceill stick with a night to remember,sad
the sank the ship hit an iceberg and sank whats with this ten lines of text thing anyway why cant i just post the sank its succinct and that is what makes it humorous that and the fact that everyone knows it sank but alas my joke is ruined sue to these ridiculous guidelines ok so im typing aimlessly now why just to post a comment its like i must have ten lines of text but what if i just dont have that much to say then what im basically in a situation where i have to type all this meaningless bs just so the message will go through then theyre asking not to pad the post with meaningless text well which is it can i just post a short comment or should i pad my short comment with meaningless text you cant have it both ways imdb,sad
the ultimate chick flick that is disguised by giving some nudity the acting is so so dicaprio tried to save the movie for us guys but the plot was too weak for us dudes love stories can only do so much for the male department however even the background characters look good the costumes were well done to look like 1912 still the plot wasnt there the actual sinking surprised me to death didnt see that one coming basically romeo and juliet on the except that was a good story dicaprio showed a few flashes of brilliance but that wasnt enough to save the three hours of nothing the only thing that is worse than this film is how sadly overrated it was a lot of good movies came out in the nineties and some of them deserve a second look this one however doesnt its replay value is extremely poor and no guy i know would want to watch the whole thing more than once a real boring film,sad
when i heard and i heard dicaprio i thought romeo and juliet 2 how wrong i was james cameron takes his amazing film making and with maybe a weaker screenplay than in all his other movies he makes this impressive and unforgettable exercise of construction and i mean building the ship and building a rising climax that will go with you after watch the movie the story jumps from the predictable stuff you know the ship sinks that never changes to the heart and soul of characters that have no idea of their future for good or bad all starts with a simple drawing and from that simplicity we move to jawdropping chases in the guts of the ship hearbreaking love moments and many extras falling the rhythm is a little bit slow in the first two acts but from the moment the iceberg and the ice enter in scene wow here is mr aliens again kate winslet moves from classic first class lady to lt ripleys daughter the ship of dreams turns into the bath of nightmares the history accuracy fights against camerons machiavellian film making and at the end you just cry in joy sadness and suffering the best sequence of all this the ship splitting is awesome but nearer my god to thee is a hearttouching tearjerking whimper moment with that irish mother cuddling her children before die the captain facing his destiny and the band playing to the very end gentlemen is been a privilege being with you tonight maybe that line and not i am the king of the world cameron should said in the oscars,sad
it is insulting to think that this film was wellreceived i guess it would be tragic if a film this well shot and expensive was turned down think about it for one leonardo dicaprio as usual delivers a crappy performance that is almost laughable and so does kate winslet and the other people in the cast secondly there is no great story it is just a love story in the midst of an event that everyone knows about thirdly the only reason it won best picture at the oscars was because of the ending which is often mocked in commercials and the main song which is recognizable to anyone the only reason it was a box office success was because its the it is a major event no one was looking for a love story nothing goes for this movie except special effects and a nice song pathetic,sad
ok so may not be everyones idea of a great film and i agree with them despite his good intentions cameron has apparently used the tragic disaster that was as the backdrop for a forbidden romance now i am an enthusiast of the and know quite a bit about it and because of this i raised a few questions in my head what about the californian the ship whose captain was blamed for standing by and doing nothing which was proved wrong 60 years after the sinking if you look carefully as the ship leaves port the stacks are red now this is potentially historically accurate had the ship lived she would have these colours put on when cunard took over the oceanic steam navigation company or white star line but for the film it is wrong there was too much emphasis on the love story but seeing the two lovebirds run around the huge interior of the ship did give a nice tour however it did start to get annoying after a while because i only watched it for the ship the underwater scenes were credible well executed and looked very good it was a very good and dramatic way that the ship was portrayed sinking and when the stern is in the air and the lights go out and the ship breaks her back it really brought a few shivers as the windmill sized screws slammed back into the water crushing a few people on the way in conclusion the story of the sinking was very well played out the love story was good to a point after which it got a bit tedious and the whole essence of panic as the ships complement realise the great liner is irreversibly sinking beneath their feet is excellent i especially enjoyed watching the engine room scenes however if cameron ever makes another film about a luxury liner going down lusitania hint hint then would he be so kind as to not put a love story into it because really the film only succeeded because girls went to see the pretty boy actor make his debut and ended up sobbing because he had to diewatch it if you love the rms if you dont then dont watch it at all because 3 hours of leo d capro professing his love to winslet will bore you as he really doesnt look like hes seen the action in this film,sad
wow in 1998 i was in grade too and didnt understand how good this movie was i saw it in the movies and all i could think off is how boring this movie was until it got to the bit when the ship went down then i was hiding behind the chairs being scared as st now i look back and wish i had watched it properly in the movies because when i watch it now it brings me to tears not a lot of movies can do that too me i have only cried in the notebook my girl and the lion kingits not just the death scenes that get to me its the romance how to people that just meet can end up soul mates they would die for each other kate winslet plays rose so well and well we all know leonardo was made for acting you can see it in whats eating gilbert grape  basketballer dairys they make this movie so enjoyable and wonderful to watch people think this movie goes for too long well how can it not go for as long as it goes for its got so much history romance  suspense to put in it is excellent and it deserves a 1010,sad
it is unfortunate but i believe this film was over hyped and therefore received some extreme levels of criticism additionally it didnt help that when the movie was being marketed for vhs it was deemed the best movie of all time out of all of the 200 million dollar movies made i believe this one beats out lotr i think this movie was able to capture a wider audience yes the demographics did shift towards the 18 years or younger females but this is a movie you can watch with your grandma or your little sister historical accuracy was pretty good with a little bit of hollywood murdoch shooting people and himself as debated by his relatives i still think this is an important film and wont get the respect it deserves until fifty or even one hundred years down the road a true masterpiece in film,sad
is by far one of the greatest movies ever made to the outside person it may seem like a fictional tale of love during a horrible event in history it has much more depth is a movie about time and greatness maiden voyage would also be its last being the biggest ship of its time was something great to marvel at it only lasted a short time jack and roses love was quite similair jacks new presence in her life changed who she was forever he might have been the love of her life and they were only together for a few days the importance of the story is that you need to make every moment last or you could let something great slip by ex jack could have forfeited in his game of poker with the stakes so high and would have lost the chance of a lifetime rose could have never talked to jack again and would have gone on wishing she were dead everyday after life is to precious to let go  make it count,sad
well i dont really have time to write much so id just like to say that in my opinion is one of the best movies ever made its my favorite and takes my breath away every time ive seen it about 50 times lol i always cry too also i wish people would stop saying its a bad movie just for the sake of being different  its a beautiful love story and great film so get over it i have to write 10 lines well its a great movie and if you dont like it then you have no soul lol okwell i think the acting is great too and its nice to see an actress like kate winslet who isnt anorexic i wish they had made it longer lol i love it,sad
this movie is the most successful movie in terms of boxoffice numbers of all time because of the koolaid factor people got so wrapped up in the sweeping trend of thought that the movie was great that most of them were not judging it objectively in reality it isnt a bad movie its just not great the special effects and kate winslet look great in the movie while were on the subject leonardo dicapprio is someone else who is overrated hesok he was very good in the basketball diaries and he was decent in the aviator and the beach i was not impressed however unlike most people with his performance in whats eating gilbert grape he didnt play a mentally handicapped kid  he played a retard what i mean by that is that he was doing more of a caricature or stereotype of a mentally handicapped person well enough about that for now,sad
i just spot checked your new 3disc release ofdid you know that even though the packaging clearly states  widescreen version enhanced for 16x9 tvs it clearly is not i own a 3000 loewe planus digital display unit not a television and that upon playing the film i discovered that i was looking at a clearly flat transferi am understandably horrified and insulted that someone of your intelligence reputation and talent would allow this travesty to be perpetrated upon the publici plan tomorrow monday november 21 2005 to question my personal contacts at ascent media in burbank to see how this could have occurred if you or any of your seconds van ling etc could weigh in on this problem i would greatly appreciate the inputchristopher roth,sad
in its time was the ship of dreams she was big beautiful and luxurious when james cameron made this film he did a very good job however there were some things that were just not accurate in the history of the one scene is where there is an officer of the ship who salutes his comrade and shoots himself in the head that never happened however the order that was given women and children first was accurate for surethe other scene is where capt smith goes into the bridge house while its under water and truth is he disappeared no one seems to know what happened to him during final momentscameron did an excellent job in selecting a superb cast of characters decaprio and winseltt were just amazing as jack and rose you can feel their passion and desire as they learn about each other these two characters were flawless believable and kept the film going forward for the most part kathy bates as molly brown was awesome she portrayed her very well the character was very out spoken told it like it was and spoke the truth but yet browns mannerisms were more like a rough man rather than a ladyfor the most part the itself in the movie was very believable it was as if you were on the ship itself i never realized just how big she was but from what i saw she must have been a very big ship for sure cameron did his homework very well he must have studied every inch of the when he went down to look at her the first class area was very exquisiteand white star line must have pulled out all the punches to make their passengers feel welcomedeverything from the departure in souhthampton to her final moments was truly horrific but it certainly caught my eye the effects of the breaking up was very well done and accurate it just holds your attention as the remaining passengers face death when went down it was just heart breakingthis movie was well done well thought out and well planned everything from the story line to the characters to the special effects was well worth the 1050 i paid for is the all time movie of 1997 when you do watch it have a box of kleenex ready to use i guarantee you will have to have themout of ten pop corn boxes this movie gets a  10,sad
now although this film is underrated pg13 it should be r mainly because of kate winslets big scene now about that big scene i seem to not be able to stop thinking about it yet its not like im going to repeatedly picture her like that okay its only this film and only this film that this happens oh and only during that particular scene is a fantastic film both leo decaprio and kate winslet make a great pair here and do a terrific job too i think kat winslet deserves another award for bravest actor she was strong in this film and i would assume she was also very comfortable doing that big scene she had to be i mean she was totally clothes less and by the camera angles a lot her was seen while she was that way anyway kate was great leo was great this movie was great i give it a 10 half for the film and half for kate,sad
i watched all the way through today for the first time in roughly 7 years today i very vividly recall seeing this at the age of 14 i was a huge cameron fan and it took a few weeks before i could even get tickets to it i loved it i was extremely pleased to see it win best picture then things started to get a little crazy the backlash on that this film received was to be expected no doubt after such saturation i was a slight victim of the over exposure myself i never really had the urge to watch it when it would come on tv i was overloaded on it and that celine dion song still annoys me to this daybut the hoopla has long since died out at least for the most part i watched the film with a clear head today and you know this is a damn good movie its not perfect or great by any means but id be lying if i said i hadnt been moved by it now more than ever i cherished the loved story the class warfare bit and billy zanes character despite showing bits of compassion later in the film were a bit stock but the story of jack and rose was just plain wonderful the nude drawing scene was stunningly beautiful and not in a shes naked kind of way it was simply a moment so tender i was almost moved to tears and the love scene if you want to call it that was almost as moving no doubt the way the love story affected me probably has quite a bit to do with the way my life has been going recently im at a point in my life were i can truly recognize the feelings those characters were experiencing but is it a bad thing that my life experiences can color a movie id say the answer is obviousthe second half of the film is quite stunning as well despite knowing the ship was going to sink and having already seen the movie i did not want to see the ship hit that iceberg watching the ship sink was exhilarating but not in an action movie kind of way it was heartbreaking to watch from a technical standpoint the special effects hold up remarkably well i dont see how anyone couldnt at the very least give this movie the respect it deserves for its technical achievementswhich brings us back to that backlash and the legions of haters i wouldnt dare say everyone should like this movie but at the same theres no doubt in my mind that many many of this films detractors wanted to hate it for some strange cynical reason they refused to even give it a chance it boggles my mind that there are still people that refer to dicaprio as dicrapio please grow upi really hope cameron one day returns to character based movies perhaps even a love story like in this film or like the one in the abysseasily camerons best thats what always made his movies so remarkable and why theyll be remembered for years to come no ones going to be talking about aliens vs predator in 10 years but everyone will remember aliens and that wasnt because of any special effects it was because of characters we cared about because of films made with heart films like,sad
wow leonardo and kate really shine as a starving artist and a beautiful rich girl i thought that rose dewitt bukater kate winslet looked very beautiful in the dress she wore when she first met jack leonardo dicaprio the one person i really couldnt stand was cal billy zane this was because he was very conceited arrogant and controlling of the woman he loved plus he chased after jack and rose attempting to kill them if i were rose i would have told cal that the weddings off other than that this film really touched me and made me feel good in conclusion to all you leonardo dicaprio or kate winslet fans who havent seen go to the video store buy it or rent it kick back with a friend and watch it i guarantee you youll enjoy it or your money back,sad
this film for me never ages for all its a romance its also historical ive amazed my friends with facts about the great disaster and its all through watching the film i can sit down to watch and still cry in the same places i cried the very first time i watched it i can honestly say i dont know anyone who has watched this film and not been drawn into it its almost as though you are living the disaster with kate and leotheir acting is fantastic and to do a nude scene on the first day of filming is super brave but then again if youre kate winslet who caresthis is a film definitely for me one of the best films of all time,sad
this movie is one of the best movies that i have seen out of all of my 13 years this movie made me cry just by hearing the songme and my friends are such lunatics about this movie that i printed out quotesand am looking for the scriptand lemme tell ya we all think that leo makes a great jackwe all cried at the endand some of us even cried at the beginning thats how much we love iti mean it effected us so emotionally that two lovers were separated and that some people never got a chanceand like i saidwere only 13but there love kept them together through the hardest timesand she never did let goand when they reunited i literally burst into about a million tearsjust goes to show how powerfully emotional that movie is,sad
i think this film is one of those that you are afraid to criticise because fans will lynch you on the other hand saying you like it is not the coolest thing to say especially for a twentysomething male like myself so here goesthe films strengths are the scale of the film the romance element and kate winslet the sheer size of this film is breathtaking and the attention to detail which could have so easily been overlooked eases the path of the audience into the decadence of the era trapped in amongst the whirlwind is the story of two star crossed teenagers tm falling in love and one sacrificing himself for the love of his life kate winslet is impressive a feisty redhaired buxom rich girl who is trapped by a domineering boyfriend zane but her leading actor to me at least fails to match upleonardo di caprio is a good actor but looks like a little boy playing with grown ups and does not come across as a leading man especially for a movie of this size billy zane puts in a decent show as the caddish bad guy but lacks a foil of equal stature after all di caprio is after his girl and to be quite honest it reminded me of the time i had a crush on a friends older sisteranother fault in the film came from the dialogue its clunky over the top and made most of the actors look uncomfortable the salt of the earth steerage passengers looked hammed up and during the sinking it all got a bit wishy washy all overit does ok for something to watch with your loveinterest but all the time youll be left sitting there waiting for athe boat to sink bdi caprio to die and cthe end credits,sad
poor artist jack caught the huge ship in time after winning the ticket by gambling he just did not know what would happen to him young girl rose was not satisfied with the impending marriage with a wealthy merchant she also was fed up with suffocating highclass lifestyle even she wanted to kill herself luckily she met jack she quickly regained her vigor from powerful jack they unavoidably fell in lovehowever life was unpredictable due to huge body could not adjust promptly its direction so that it collided with the iceberg unsinkable was sinking an unexpected tragedy happened the people on were in panic most of them tried to took the limited lifeboats the most touching scene was that rose left the lifeboat and ran for jack facing with liveordie choice rose chosen love in a moment i experienced the greatness of love their love was so strong that anything could not separate themdirector james cameron did bring us a wonderful story simple touching plot and strong visual effect made so popular in the world eleven oscar awards proved its valueone of the best romance movies 910,sad
the sinking of the is an enduring story of 20thcentury mans arrogance in an age of speed and comfort the maiden voyage of the worlds largest most luxurious ship had a grim date with destiny on the night of april 14th 1912 there have been many more catastrophic disasters since but few with the haunting resonance of the tragic fate for complex social and political reasons the story of the is a shared experience of human folly and heroism james camerons hyped up extravaganza chooses to ignore the significance of the event opting simply to tell a trite love story that ends in the water it is in no way a fitting memorial to the 1537 souls lost at sea in the early hours of april 15th worse it is a travesty the american ship californian was less than 10 miles away yet ignored the distress flares this integral component in the unfolding disaster is not merely skimped by cameron it is totally ignored why by focusing solely on the insipid romeo and juliet romance between leonardi dicaprio and kate winslet cameron diminishes the tragedys devastating scale size matters claims cameron missing the point  he merely replicates the hubris of edwardian thinking on the unsinkable ship his sense of size relates only to his huge sets and the amount of screen time allotted to his twittering lovebirds cameron has made a for the dumbeddown mtv generation his bloated romance lacks the humility and simple grace of the moving british film on the same subject a night to remember is more like another 1958 film an affair to remember  soggy ponderous and clichd to the core the steerage passengers are saltoftheearth types happily dancing drunkenly to irish reels the aristocrats are pompous stuffedshirt repressives the crew is a collection of doughty brit caricatures even so most of them are more interesting than the limpid lovers sketched by dicaprio and winslet he quotes bob dylan lyrics she flips the finger to david warner in 1912 but the films failure as drama rests not with them the director falters from the outset airlifting an improbably sprightly 102yearold survivor on to an atlantic salvage ship and history isnt big enough for cameron  in a laughably melodramatic lapse he has billy zane chasing the loving couple through the flooding ship firing off shots as for the heralded special effects they are not always convincing and in one awful crane shot swooping from bow to stern clearly the work of computer imagery james cameron the writerdirector behind such soulless hollywood product as terminator 2 and true lies was never going to be the right man to tell the great story of the,sad
is seriously my favorite movie it has all the elements of a great movie romance tragedy lost love disaster its great the characters are wonderful and the script is beautiful the new special edition dvd has a ton of extras including some neverbeforeseen deleted scenes in my opinion its a good thing those scenes were left on the cutting room floor though as far as scenery you couldnt ask for a more beautiful film visually even though most of it is digital it really has the feel of being on the with rose and jack the costumes alone are enough to take your breath away the love between jack and rose is unparalleled and i couldnt ask for a better film to have a good cry to this film deserved the best picture oscar in 1998 i love this movie and i hope you do too,sad
i dont know why people are kinda afraid to admit they like i love this movie and i say it my friends came home to watch it with me it was the first time they saw it and they laughed at me until the movie began in the end they were all crying after that we made a group for lovers some people thought we were strange but they all admitted they had seen and liked it when i saw this wonderful film was only rated 7 i was disappointed by reading the comments i realised people discriminate because its a classic tragic love storydont be afraid to like thats what makes us different,sad
is a film based in the terrible history of rms romantic and very very dramaticdirected by james cameronit was filmed in 1997 in mexico it stars leonardo dicaprio whose character is jack dawson kate winslet is rose dewith bukater and billy zane whose main secondary character is cal hocklythe film is about on the one hand the rms tragedy on the other hand the romance between a poor man and a aristocratic woman in the the romance is gorgeous but the tragedy is terriblefinally jack died in the atlantic ocean and rose survivedthe film is romantic but is very sad toothe acting is very good in generalthe plot is easy to follow and the dialogue is fluid and interestingthe soundtrack is the best composed by james honerthe special effects are very good and fantastici recommend this film to all the people is really goodboth actors are very good,sad
i havent watched since i was little and growing up i constantly heard people harshly criticize this movie so as a young teenager i made fun of it too i recently watched it and i changed my mind i have never cried at the end of the movienot even the notebook made me cry at the end of my eyes were red  a box of tissues was empty  and tears were rolling down my face when jack dies at the end and she lets go of his handsthats when i completely lost it i heard that the part of jack was almost given to matthew mcconaughey  and im sorry but i am glad the part was given to leonardo dicaprio i dont care how much any one makes fun of mei will always like him this movie will definitely withstand the test of time,sad
ive watched a number of times and one thing puzzles me did gloria stuarts rose die at the end an old lady warm in her bed or was she just dreaming after the camera pans across her bedside photos and then across her face where you cant tell whether or not shes breathing it travels back down to the where we only see the people who died that night ive asked this question to a number of people who didnt seem to notice or care i dont know which but leo told her that night in the water that she wouldnt die this night this way that she would be an old lady warm in her bed so when they showed her as an old lady warm in her bed and recapped her life thru her bedside photos i concluded that she died did she,sad
this really is cinema at its finest is a brilliant movie mixing romance and tragedy together to tell a beautiful and fragile love story the genius of the movie comes not from the tragic sinking of the liner but the romance that develops between jack and rosedont be put off by the 3 hr plus running time this film canters along at breathtaking pace with the final hour of the film containing some superb special effectscosting upwards of 200 million dollars to make was all set to become one of the greatest flops of all time instead it has become an instant classic a film that can be seen over and over again love as they say is eternal,sad
i love it is a really good movie i think that jack dawson is really cute the actor who played jack dawson did a very good job he is a very good actor they picked the right person to play jack dawson no one else could have done a better job that the person who played jack dawson kate winslet did a good job on the movie the way she played her part was great the way leonardo did a great job on the movie the way he played his part was great will always be a great movie in my heart is one of the best movies i have ever seen it will always be a special movie in my heart the cast did a great job on should have won more awards the awards it won were very good awards the movie really does shine,sad
this film has perfect theme music and suspenseful action we note the reflection of rosestewart whose special memories of that fateful day in 1912 take us back in time love is special for younger rosewinsletwho shows us passion and feelings a heart cannot hideshe is bound to a man she does not love and meets a stowaway artist jackhandsome dicapriounknowingly wins his destiny on the glorious ship of dreams and meets the high class young girl who changes his luckcalplayed by talented billy zanemakes us see the green side of envy all his money is not enough to keep the heart of his beloved and he desperately tries anything to change herhe is a coward and hides away in a lifeboatwhen the time for manpower is neededthere is the stuffy nature of young roses mom she looks at jack with hate and loathing and does not want to lose the fortune because of a stray commoneri thought this movie had great effects that put the viewer up close with horror of the story the tense struggle makes the heart race faster,sad
james camerons aliens the terminator is one of the greatest love stories ever told this film has a special place in my heart as one of the saddest films to date the two leads leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet do a truly magnificent job at portraying the two doomed young lovers jack and rose james horners score is probably one of the best scores i have ever heard the set pieces are absolutely stunning the is recreated with authenticity and beauty the look of the exterior and interior of the ship is amazing the finale is one of the best i have seen its suspenseful and sad happy and tragicthe plot focuses on jack and rose jack being a poor street boy and rose being a very rich engaged women they both happen to be on the doomed voyage that is the as soon as they meet each other love blossoms and they are both drawn closer and closer together when the ship hits the iceberg a tale of survival and heartbreaking decisions is brought to life the supporting cast consists of billy zane kathy bates gloria jones david warner and bill paxtonmany people hate because they think its a corny overrated lovestory thats just an excuse for spending a lot of money plus it is very cool to hate its far more than that the lovestory is brilliantly told and is very tragic the ending will have most people in tears the scenes of the ships destruction are amazing and very well done the acting is top notch from everyone this movie rightly deserved its 11 oscar wins55 from me i urge everyone who hasnt seen it to see it,sad
i first watched the movie when i was younger it didnt have as much of an effect on me then probably because i was too young to understand but even then i thought the fictional love story about jack and rose was amazing i cried at the end of the film then when the ship sank and jack and rose were in the waterbut to top the first production the film has just been released on dvd i watched this film with my inlaws the other night and i thought it was absolutely breath taking the special effects have had a revamp so the ship looks even more spectacular the only down side to the dvd is that it is on 2 discs but not to worry gives time for a toilet break as the film is over 3 hours long the first disc lasted for 90minutes and the second disc was around the same duration and i swear as soon as that timer hit 30mins on the second disc i cried all the way until the end an absolutely fantastic filmand to top it all there is an extra 45mins of deleted scenes included on the disc i would recommend these deleted scenes as they contain a lot of the factual information that was cut out from the original film the captain calling back the lifeboats family sending morsecode messages to their loved onesi would highly recommend watching this film on dvd it will take your breath away just have the tissues at the ready,sad
except for the unnecessary language and most of the sexual content this was one of the best films i have ever seen leos performance as jack was somewhat over the top and cheesy but that is to be expected considering that its leo dicaprio kate winslets character really fit her i have seen her performances in other films but none compare to this one the rich girl who thinks shes seen it all until she meets the man from the other side of the tracks seeing her in this film was seeing yet another side of kate winslet kathy bates is hilarious as molly brown and i would not have put her in any other role the end of had me on the edge of my seat you know whats going to happen but youre just not sure how or when its going to happen all in all this was a beautiful film that should be viewed by everyone,sad
i have just watched for the 7th time i saw in in the movies when it first came out and it is without a doubt one of the greats i have searched through the goofs feature on imdb and i cant find the following1 when seeing the picture of herself on tv old rose calls brock lovett and asks i was wondering have you found the diamond yet or words to that effect why would she ask that question when she had the diamond all along 2 lizzy calvert says to one of the crew referring to rose we met a few months ago yet rose states later in the movie that she never told anyone about jack dawson not even your father to her daughter or was she an unrelated friend,sad
the second greatest movie of all times is watched by nearly all the humans around the world recently even by the afghani people as there was a premiere in kabul after the fall of the taliban and is strongly loved or hated by enormous amounts of people if you look at the comments and the vote rating on the imdb you will figure out that obviously there are a lot of people who think it is some kind of a banal romantic story and as they are tough guys they have voted negatively bringing it from the second place that it deserves to some regrettably low position so it is not even in the first 250 top movies on the imdbfor the fact that it has earned more money than any other movie i will not speak  star wars and the lord of the rings and harry potter and spiderman also earned comparable sums and they are idiotic but on the romantic issue i have to speak a lot and here i begin no you infinite idiots it is not a movie about love love is a great thing one of the greatest things humans have tragically not all of them not even half of them but love is 10 of what the movie is about love is only a contributing factor herethis is a movie about the irreversibly lost things in life it is a movie about memories and old age and lost happiness not only it is about these things but with all its contributing factors  the plot the script the music the greatest director of all times  it turned into an exceptionally strong movie so strong that if your heart is not made of stone and your brain  of interstellar vacuum this film will make something horrible with you it will break your heart and it will burn your brain and you will suffer from it and if you are too emotional or if you are alone in this moment i tell you with a good intention dont watch itspoilersyou have to watch three hours till you get to the point all of it was made for the last minute and whoever has slept through it will not get it happiness had passed tragedy had passed and suffering had passed and then oh dear god this broke me oh how she threw it it cut me through my heart through my brain through my soul my whole face started to ache like if it has been put in a hydraulic pressa lot of time after i watched it after many months had passed after many hours of thinking i understood what made my face ache she didnt throw just a valuable diamond searched by so many people in the bottomless waters of the cold ocean she didnt throw just a memory although it was a kind of a memory that was reminding her dear moments lived so many years ago  moments that she had passed so many times through her head what she threw were hundreds of trillions of dollars and all the computers in the world and the combined natural resources of asia and 150 million square kilometers of inhabitable land and the whole earth and solar systems and galaxies and universes cause none of these things could return what she had lost  as time is omnipotent and irreversiblebut she didnt look suffering when she threw it and i know why she was old she was at the end of her journey she longed for oblivion when she threw it she smiled as if she threw a burden at this moment she was saying goodbye to the life for her it was a relief for me it was painfully sad i saw the whole tragedy of mortality of transience of evanescence of forgetfulness i saw how the old memories dwell only in the minds of the old people how they fade and how they disappear with them like falling yellow leaves in the autumn i saw her story i realized that there were billions more stories like that of billions old people  stories better or worse shorter or longer more or less interesting and intriguing  which eventually would fade together with the old and would turn into rotting leaves on the ground and people would step on them and nobody would neither know nor imagine what treasure they werei think now at least i saw her story she redeemed the people from to life again and now they are here in front of me though for a while living with reddish faces from the wine straightly brought from the dark cold ocean bottom  not that it makes me feel better they laugh they drink from the glasses and stare at me and laugh even higher and then in an instant their faces turn pale turn grey and their smiles disappear and they begin looking cold and sad and serious and they say to me with a frozen cup in their hands live live now fully take everything and remember everything cause one day you will have only memories we are dead and cannot live but you live as much as you can and please remember us we were not bad people were we and all this  from her memoryand then  she was dreaming she was returning images she was refreshing memories as this was the only thing she could do to beat the time to fight with it before it defeats her too she was dreaming about the so insultingly short moments of true happiness she had in her life she was dreaming of what she never had and never would have she was dreaming in frightful tranquility in her last years in the twilight of her lifeachingly sad,sad
well was one of the films that made reviewers go crazy i didnt really read any review that said it was awful but now that is all people say when it came out in 1997 everyone was talking about this film it brought them to tears the end scene shocked them the love story made them feel warm now whenever anyone talks it is one of the worst films theyve seen did i watch a completely different film the acting was good the computer generated images were amazing the attention to detail was overwhelming the script is the only thing that lets it down and there are worse out there i found the whole thing to be very moving and if it was such a bad script it would make you cringe not crythe people who call the worst film obviously cried and are covering up for the fact it was one of the only films they cried ati personally really like i think its a very watchable experience that does leave you stunned if not tear stained it is one of the only three hour films i can watch over again,sad
i have only a few things to say about and that is i think it is nothing but a event in filmsthe film in my mind is one of the greatest love stories and movies of all timei am shocked that it is not in imdbs top 250the movie has great direction and a great story with some very nice and well done special effectsit is also one of the biggest money making movies of all time and deserves more creditit won so many awards and was loved by the critics in a great waythe movie starts with a team searching for a safe on the and when they find itthey discover pictures with one of a naked woman that they ask for information ona old woman named rose comes forward and tells her story of how she lost her loveand how she basically fell in love with theis manthe story is great and has a lot of fiction and nonfiction at the same timeeventually the ship has a accident and starts to sink then it becomes a survival for thousands of people who mostly diethe movie has very famous scenes and out of them allthe scene where rose and jack are holding hands and he sais never to let gothis scene has become a very famous scene and has been made fun of as wellbut it even has a great song that is played a lot in the movieand i am proud to of watched such a great film and i hope it gets in the top 250 somedayis a film that is in a whole level of its own and it is a one kind film for are times,sad
rose certainly got it right at the end of the movie when she says to cal you unimaginable bastard  i dont think ive ever liked billy zane after this movie his character is evil conniving ruthless and just plain clueless i think one of the most exciting parts of this movie is when rose is looking for jack after he is taken to the room and handcuffed to the pipe in the criminals passage i love it when she pushes the guy into the elevator and forces him to go down to e deck the entire scene after rose finds jack is amazing as well all of the water and special effects are incredible makes you think what you would do in that situation rose knows that there is a good chance she may never find jack and die in the process but shes determined anyway so emotional  i think this movie is outstanding and will go down in history as one of the greatest movies of all time just as has gone down in history as one of the greatest mysteries and tragedies of all time,sad
this is an odd film it takes an historical disaster the sinking of the and it adds a saccharine love story on top that supposedly makes the film more accessible first lets talk design james cameron and his crew have really outdone themselves here the oscars and other awards won for these categories were deserved the promenade set is a sight to behold and when we finally get to see the ship sink we see an amalgam of miniatures and computer effects put one of the 20th centurys worst disasters indelibly on film the way cameron influences our emotions with secondary characters is very well done we see flashes of families in the third class who know they are going to die soon old couples families with small children seeing them is truly heartbreaking and it is for those people that i mourn when i think of the however instead of letting these images tell the story cameron has included a love story on top to make the movie more palatable to audiences to me this is the only weakness of the film the acting is fine kathy bates is brilliant as unsinkable molly brown but since the main storyline is the weakness of the film this creates a problem the fact the relationship was extramarital didnt help proceedingsoverall we have a very good movie let down by hollywood schmaltz without the love story this would have been a masterpiece,sad
the hit an iceberg and sank on its maiden voyage from southampton england to new york in 1912 about 700 people drowned about 1500 survived the was part of the white star line it was believed to be unsinkable its passenger list was a microcosm of society and the tragedy has fascinated each succeeding generation robert ballard discovered it on the ocean floor in 1985 and recovered some of its contents ballads effort inspired james cameron to write and direct this film leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet star as jack and rose movies do not get more romantic than this who can forget the image of jack and rose at the front of the ship or jack supporting rose in the icy water as his own life ebbs posters of leonardo dicaprio graced the walls of teenage girls won 11 academy awards it is the biggest box office success of alltime pulling in over 600 million,sad
i was clicking around and saw that was the highest grossing movie to date globally and i just dont understand what the big deal about this film was theres been a thousand love stories where one lover dies at the sake of another cruel intentions w sebastian and annette west side story w tony and maria romeojuliet w juliet thinking romeos dead she cant live without him and thats dn romantic ill admit the sets and costumes are gorgeous but the storys not that extraordinaryrich girl in an arranged societypolitical marriage with a loveless fianc meets the charming almost always artistic poor boy who whirls her off her feet with the simple romantic things in life only to have the relationship be tragically struck down by fatecough coughthe notebookcoughi dont mean to be trash just someone tell me what makes it so dn special note and saying leo dicaprio kate winslet is in it doesnt count,sad
this is the best of the sappy melodramatic films to come out in the past years but it is still not that great of a movie i cannot stand billy zanes character he is such a stereotypical rich guy it makes me sick no this is not a bad movie but it is not great and did not deserve the academy award over la confidential but that is not why i am giving it 6 out of 10 i think this movie lost a point just by making it seem like it was rosejacks fault that the sunk remember when the watch guards are not doing their job and watching jack and rose make out instead of looking for icebergs they make it seem like they were partially responsible for it i must admit kate winslet is gorgeous in this movie but it does not make up for it,sad
is one of those films that you have to see its one of those films that can reduce almost anybody to tears if not for one storyline then for the otherunless youve had your head in the sand ever since this film was released then youll know the two stories this film revolves around the first is the obvious one the true story of the unsinkable ship the tragic tale of an unimaginable catastrophe the second is the fictional love story the collision of lives that could only have happened aboard the ship the love story starts off pretty simple the classic example of a romantic film plot boy meets girl and they fall in love love is forbidden but they fight for their love and this is normally where theyd all live happily ever after now thats where the first storyline confuses things because as well all know on this ship most of the passengers didnt survive the journeylike i said this is a film that can reduce almost anybody to tears whether the reason is the tragic reality of the disaster that was the or the love story that touched the world leonardo dicaprio is perfect for the role of jack dawson likewise kate winslet rose and gloria stuart tells the story beautifully as the future rosethe film itself is very poorly made by todays standards especially considering it cost more to make than the original ship did the computer graphics are spectacularly bad but all that seems insignificantthis film is a big deal and you can never fully join in film discussions until youve seen it love it or hate it its a story that will stick with you for a long timethe unfortunate thing is that now think of the and you think of the tragic love story you think of jack and rose nobody ever thinks of the tragedy that was the ship of dreams,sad
as we all know won best picture and best director and 9 other oscars in 1997 out of 14 nominations  quite an achievement this equalled the alltime record total of 11 academy awards also held by ben hur 1959 and the return of the king 2003 and yet has also received a mention on several worst movie lists in 2003 for example as part of a bbc listeners poll one person said my father fell asleep after 20 minutes he was lucky it was only his snoring that kept me awakeseriously though i was disappointed with in my humble opinion it was too long with too many special effects and a story that became fragmented because it was crosscut with anotherhaving a look at the academys best picture winners over the years there are several films which i think could be described as epics which havent quite made the grade these films seem to go on for as long as they possibly can incorporate the largest cast of extras possible and usually have several or more special sequences unfortunately i see as one of these filmsother epics which have won best picture and which have left me rather disappointed are gandhi amadeus the last emperor out of africa and gladiator,sad
greatest film of the twentieth century is without a doubt the most moving and artist film of my lifetime closes off the end of the century with an ode to the age a disaster to end all disasters a love story to last all the ages and a film that will be better appreciated for its perfection in decades to come the movie that has achieved the most oscar nominations 14 and all about eve and has won the most oscars only rivaled to benhur and the lord of the rings in oscars the most popular film alltime in box office terms and the most expensive film ever made testimate to its gloryode to,sad
the clock is still ticking on this classici rather like to think of people who thought it was horrible as having fish food for brains but rather than label and resort to namecalling i have to submit that i thought the movie showed some incredible ingenuity and unapologetic guts as well as phenomenal talent fiction and nonfiction were interwoven to such a fine twist that not even jealous people who wish they were in or wish they had made the movie themselves can spoil it its going to be a very long time before anyone whips this one for imagination or how to tell a lie and get away with itas many times as this story has been told no one has ever quite told it with that kind of depth and breadth and scope and magnificence of clarity of vision and focus,sad
i have to say after watching it several times this movie is still probably one of the better dramas that aired in the last part of the 1990s leonardo dicapprio is great in this movie i still would have preferred matthew mccoughnay and kate winslet is absolutely charming although some of her scenes are a bit overdramatic and sappythe only problem i have with the film is historical accuracy in most cases women and children were allowed to go on but men were allowed if there was room not at all as the movie portrayed the chaos wasnt as bad as the movie made it sound in fact many people were rather calm having it told by someone who wasnt even on the ship made it even worse because giving the part to someone assuming she was 101 was unreal completelyi could have lived without it the submarine scenes but still the effects for that was pretty good kudos to james cameron for that terminator is still your best workits good entertainment for adults and a nice learning video for kids although some parts of the movie the nude scene in the cabin and the love scene in the automobile arent meant for childrens eyes710,sad
this movie is the king of the world and it is it really is people who bash this movie have no idea what theyre doing to start yes there are a few bad parts but even few may be a harsh word in some parts my attentions wanders when the dialogue falls flat but besides thatthis movie deserves 12 stars out of 10 james cameron is one of the best directors in the entire world for doing ghost of the abyss t 1  2 and many many more new line decided to give cameron the budget of dreams 200 million i mean what is that thats more then a lot of movies make for gross in north america the effects in the movie are more then great theyre epic when someones says the effects are bad you want to slap them you cannot get any more real then building the actual ship almost full size one of the most haunting images of the movie is when the ship is about to break and its stern is right up in the air and then the lights go out the screams start and you here the groans that gives me the chills just thinking about itthe music the scoring in this movie is absolutely perfect before i get to the song i will say its is very smart to have all classical music in this movie the part at the end where the band plays and the slowmo starts like the couple lying in bed and the woman reading to her children i cry every time celine dions song my heart will go on is a terrific song oh sure you may bash it now but you werent doing that when we first heard it over 6 years ago one major factor of why grossed over 18 billion worldwide is because of the song did yall know the song was played around the world 500 billion times yeah so you cant exactly call it a terrible song can you acting the talent that is very very tough to find these days choosing people like kate winslet and dicaprio was probably extremely smart theyre wonderful in this movie and yes kates odd and albeit fake accent may sound well fake but that doesnt matterrarely has a 3 hour movie seen so short it doesnt just sail it steams ahead at 40 knots with all the boilers lit and with no iceberg in the way i love this movie and always will,sad
personally i loved this movie i am only 13 years old so obviously wasnt able to see it when it came out in cinemas i first saw the movie when i was about 10 or 11 years old and ill tell you now i absolutely loved it then and nothing has changed over the years when i was about 10 i had this major crush on leonardo dicaprio and so i mainly watched it the first time to see him but as i watched it i was so moved and i appreciated it for more than just a hot guy i loved the parts that you just remember no matter how long its been since you last saw the movie like when jack saves rose from committing suicide when they fly on the bow of the boat when jack draws rose nude on the couch when the ship gets hit by the ice berg and people are playing with the ice when that woman sings her children to sleep because she recognizes that their fate is death the list goes on the movie while parts are not strictly accurate is mostly accurate obviously some characters such as jack and rose were fictional people made up as icing on the cake but there were some people who actually did board that ship such as mr bruce ismay captain smith mr john jacob aster and several others however what really gets me is why a man who is actually said to have acted heroically was portrayed as he was shooting a passenger and then swallowing his gun all of you who have seen this movie know exactly who im talking about that was another part that you cant forget no matter how long ago you last saw this moviewhats with all of the negativity concerning celine dions song my heart will go on i personally love that song and think it goes perfectly with the story line its perfect for it as it resembles the ending rose living on while jack dies and rose would never stop loving jack and that shows in the way that modernday rose talks about him in the movie its a beautiful song if you can actually appreciate it for what it means in relation to the story line of the movie i guess if youre not a big celine dion fan you wouldnt like the song anyway but even if you dont hate her but dont love her if you could open your heart and your mind and accept it for what it means in relation to the characters you could love the song just as i dothe movie is so emotionally moving i know that i for one am not a big crier in fact i hardly ever cry but the movie moved me so much that i cried and couldnt stop for quite some time the part where the woman sings her children to sleep because she has accepted the fate of certain doom was the scene that made me cry the most its so sadthis is truly a masterpiece by james cameron the people who are now claiming that they hate it and that they never cried when they went to see it in the movies you either need to stop dissing it when people say they love it cos if youre not moved by something like that youre either coldhearted or inhuman or just get over it because from what ive heard in most cinemas where it was shown there wasnt a dry eye in the house it doesnt make you look cool or tough if you start dissing a movie like sure sometimes the script gets a bit mushy but thats what makes it so sad when it comes to the end even if you already know whats gonna happen but that dont mean that you can just start dissing it cos the mushy wording and actions are what give the ending such an emotional feelmy advice if youre looking for twists and turns and suspense sooo not the flick for you also if you dont dig mushy script probably not for you however if you dont mind a movie that you already pretty much know the ending that has no twists or anything filled with suspense and you dont mind mushy script go see it if you think you can appreciate the music and the script for what it is supposed to represent you will totally dig it i did,sad
if youre a buff and love edwardian period pieces youll like the first scenes where theyre exploring the wreck be captivated by kate winslets entrance love the montage of the ship setting sail and then be bored to death if not absolutely disgusted until the ship starts to sinkyes the love story is saccharine and clich the script utterly formulaic uninspired and just plain dumb and the characters so cardboard and tissuethin youd think theyd have turned to papiermache before they drowned the costumes and sets were truly magnificent though and the special effects superb  if building a 910 scale replica of the actual ship and then sinking it on film can be called a special effect if nothing else cameron deserves great acclaim for the unprecedented scale and unequaled ambitiousness of the technical side of this filmdespite the movies reputation for the accuracy of its historic details there are more than a few inaccuracies some innocent some outright despicable an example of the first kind would be the formal dinner scene which had the first class passengers dining in what was in fact the first class smoking lounge rather than the first class dining room which shows up only briefly as the backdrop for billy zanes shooting rampage of the latter kind probably the worst was the locked gates trapping the 3rd class passengers below decks  and a crew determined to keep them there historically on the real ship there were locked gates that kept the 3rd class passengers from wandering into the 1st  2nd class areas but these gates were only 3 high and could be easily climbed  or stepped  over the 3rd class passengers were not kept below neither were they denied access to the lifeboats the problem was that most of the 3rd class were scandinavians who spoke no english and most of the stewards spoke no swedish norwegian or danish when they were told to get up on deck they just went to the 3rd class deck on the fantail the stewards then tried to lead the women and children up to the boat decks but not understanding most of them refused to leave their men this inaccuracy in the movie was of course just the product of a little poetic license helping to reenforce the deep moral and thoroughly original message of the film poor people good  rich people badwhat reviewers seem always to miss is that kate winslets character is not much of a heroine rose is down to the last detail a snide rude arrogant superior sanctimonious selfcentered selfobsessed vindictive cruel confused conflicted and utterly selfrighteous little knowitall of a princess at once proud and insecure  ie youre typical teenage american girl which probably is the real reason the movie was so popular with adolescent females,sad
this overblown epic deserved the accolades and academy awards it received as much as someone who does a paintbynumbers mona lisa to think it now ties with ben hur for most awards yuckif you want an accurate historical see british night to remember at this point in time it is unrealistic to portray a woman to not to the right thing  marry for money status and protect her own family  for love of leonardo di caprio of all people i for one never saw the appeal if i never hear celine dion singing the song it will be too soon it was nice to see an actress as the main character who actually looked like a woman instead of an anorexic waif,sad
james camerons has everything money can buy this is a a big slick glossy ultra hollywood take on the tragedywe all know the outcomeso its no use repeating it herethis is essentially a shipboard romancernot unlike 1997s far superior out to seaonly it is not supposed to be a comedy the trite and hackneyed plot line involves an impossible romance between poor boy di caprio and socialite kate winslet and it its not totally convincingone high spot is the always fine cathy bates as molly brown and shes good almost too good for this movie scant little detail is provided for the events that lead up to the tragedyunfortunatelythe real star of this film is the itselfit is wonderfully recreated in all its glory even though it is only mostly sets with plenty of cgi details it is incredible you almost feel like you are on a real shipthat being said you probably enjoy this film if a good cry is your thing this film won many academy awards as many as ben hur but it did not deserve that many it is also the highest grossing film of all timeso far there is also a rather insipid title song by celene dion yet in spite of all its technical excellence1958sa night to remember remains the definitive version of the story and stands head and shoulders above this nearer thy god to thee indeed,sad
on a metal table in the virginian pilot a newspaper distribution wharehouse at 330 am i saw my my first glimpse of what would become the best remembered film of 1997 the paper was running an article that april morning on what its like to die by hypothermia and had a pic from the film on the cover whether la confidential shouldve won best picture is a good question all i knew was id never seen any film that got so much hype in the months that followedyou all know the plot you know the ship sinks but this movie isnt as bad as some say because while it does contain the most silly and overused love story imaginable traces of sincerity can be found everywhere james cameron really did care about the sinking it shows because the film does decently give the viewer a sense of whats going on thats incredibly important because the subject matter is so terribly serious 1 thousand 5 hundred peoples lives ending id have liked it better if the film had been solely on the sinking and not even but mentioned jack and rose but ill take what i can get finally a year later a film came out thats sole purpose was to be historically accurate it wasnt perfect but at least saving private ryan didnt ask me to cry for anyones deaths there was no celine dion song playing through the credits and james ryan didnt end the film by leaving a medal or something at the grave site it spr put out there what it wanted to say and let me come up with the rest had been that same kind of film i might own a copy of it now instead i rent it every other year or so the really sad thing though is that after this film was made no laws to prevent future spinoffs were passed the result was pearl harbor sad terribly sad,sad
this 1997 movie does a wonderful job at recreating the maritime disaster that struck this mighty passenger ship on its maiden voyage however the fictional story of the kindling but doomed romance of a very unlikely couple is totally unbelievable decaprio delivers an adequate performance but he is unfortunately miscast never once did i believe the sophisticated and mature beauty played by winslet would ever be romantically interested in someone who looked like a common and mischievous high school boy this budding romance never rang true thus i found it exceedingly difficult to become emotionally involved when their inevitable demise was at hand the only redeeming value of this movie was its special effects and the long drawn out sinking scenes and of course thats what this movie was supposed to be about anyway,sad
i honestly believe that is the best movie ever madeits the story of a doomed ocean liner and the starcrossed lovers on boardthe characters and casting are perfect especially kate winslet and billy zane they both succeed in bringing their characters to life the special effects are amazing in this movie and made me believe i was actually seeing the real ship sink also the music in this movie was very tasteful and tied in perfectly i have seen it many times and still get emotional when watching it its hard to believe all the people who bash this movie just check which movie is number one all time in the us international and world wide and is number one in all three categories so its my opinion that most people love this movie but will not admit it,sad
i have heard many negative comments about this movie the acting was terrible or the movie lacks suspense while the movie is considerably long and may seem boring to some there is no denying that is a masterpiece the acting is very decent and those who claim that leonardo dicaprio or kate winslet cant act must have some sort of personal vendetta against them because they do a very convincing job in the movie especially in their very precious scenes togetherthe specialsound effects used are very good and give the film a great sense of context and realism  like you are actually there in the the score is very fitting and really does elicit feelings of sorrow joy and excitement for the characters of the film although i am not a fan of her other work celin dions grammy award winning my heart will go on must be one of the saddest most touching songs ever producedthe ending of might have you feeling quite sad but you will likely also have feelings of triumph and inspiration for certain characters despite the fact that nobody can understand the true pain experienced by those of the actual events after watching the movie one will feel a deeper connection with the whole tragedyto all those people who have made a habit of putting this movie down by stating immature and unreasonable comments i have this to say 11 academy awards and 18b made at the worldwide box office 1010,sad
there can be no dispute james camerons 1997 epic is the greatest film ever to meet the silver screen or any other screen for that matter firstly the film offers a brilliant screenplay which weaves a series of actual events together with pure fiction secondly the cast is perfectly chosen with leo and kate at the front to hold the plot together to billy zanes cal hockley whom we all came to hate all the way down to kathy bates as the unsinkable molly brown and third the tireless work of thousands of people including the brilliant james cameron who wrote directed coproduced and coedited the picture the films boxoffice speaks for itself with over 18 billion dollars earned in under two years also the oscars tributed the achievement of the film by awarding it 14 nominations and 11 wins the most nominations and wins ever for a single film in conclusion is a tremendous film it has the power to bring even the biggest men to tears and ranks over the top as the greatest film of all timeand yes the picture does exceed gone with the wind which won ten oscars in 1939 as some weird folks like to call it the best,sad
personally it makes me sick to hear people say that they didnt like or that they dont care for it because it was a spectacular film i felt as though i was one of the poor yet lucky people who sailed on this glorious ship that faithful night i was scarred in a good way by this film and it is now a part of me and for the past six years i have thought of nothing but yet when i watched it again i realized i didnt even see part of the glory this is my favorite film ever and i have seen most of the movies out there that reader was correct open your heart up to and you will not be disappointed,sad
being such a popular film at the time of its release i was skeptical whether was going to be of any worth over 8 years after it hit the big screen i finally sat down and find out what all the hype was about is a romance of epic proportions and although we all kind of know what happens in the end the three hours plus seemed to fly bythe opening scenes of exploration of the at the bottom of the ocean 84 years after it sank is intriguing footage and bill paxton does well in the part of the main researcher even though anyone really could have done the role with ease it is when we get to main story with a 101 year old rose dewitt bukater reminiscing of her time on the that the film really beginsessentially a story of love also deals with the class system and politics of the early 1900s with leonardo dicaprio being the drifting artist who comes to met the welltodo kate winslet on board the ship from there on its business as usual winslets character rose is smitten by dicaprios jack dawson but is to marry another a welloff man named caledon hockley played exceptionally well by billy zane rose and jack fall in love zane finds out and seeks vengeance  its all been done before what makes this film unique is the setting of the story the on its first  and last  voyage from england to america lives are lost but love is not and it this eternal love that is depicted in the film that resonates with the audience the true highlight of the film is kate winslet with a traditional beauty ideal for the role of rose she is stunning to watch engages you in a trance with those round eyes full lips and perfect body straight out of a renoir painting i couldnt take my eyes off her does not falter with a great mix of drama and romance along with insight into the way of thought back in those days the film is dramatized for effect  it looked like a lot more that 1200 odd people in the water  but thats expected for a big blockbuster of a flick and so i didnt hold it against james cameron who fulfilled his need to tell the story of an amazing adventure that did in fact happen not so long ago and history always helps to captivate viewers,sad
i love this movie so much im not going to add a very long detail of why i do i just wanted to say that everyone found it hilarious that at the end when rose says ill never let go jack then she lets go of his hand its not his hand that she meant he had made her promise to never let go of the promise to live her life to the fullest and be all she could be etc thats what she never let go and it proves that at the end when you see all of the photos of her life and the scene at the end when she sees everyone who died in the grand staircase and she kisses jack is so touching even if i turn on the movie to only that part it makes me cry its the small touches too that make it good like the irish mom telling her kids one last story so that they die quietly is the sweetest thing,sad
i dont consider romantic drama to be my genre exactly and since leonardo dicaprio was a notorious pretty boy cast mostly to satisfy teenage girls expectations were exceptionally low but i was actually pleasantly surprisedthe story revolves around the poor and artistic jack and the rich girl rose they meet by chance on the and fall in love first their love has to stand the test of class difference then the test of the ship sinkingwhen i say i was pleasantly surprised that of course has to be weighed against the fact that expectations were exceptionally low but still this is actually a lot more entertaining than i could ever have dreamed it would be most of the credit for that i would have to give james cameron who seldom disappoints but while this movie does entertain not least because of very impressive visuals its still a very simple and basic story i guess what it comes down to is expectations if you expect it to be movie of the century a deep and sensitive film you will be sorely disappointed it is wellmade decently acted beautifully shot and rather entertaining as long as you remember what kind of movie you are watching i rate it 610,sad
if u dont like this film ur mad its the greatest eva i couldnt of made it better myself u rule go its ur bday gonna party like its ur birthday wop wop wop wop wop wop wop wop wop wop thankyou is the ultimate film ever u r the best ever and i owe myself 2 u and leo dicaprio is beautiful love ya leo x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x xx x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x,sad
is one of the most epic films of all time this 1997 tale is about the maiden voyage of the most popular ship in history the rms the film opens up with a under water discovery of the ill fated ship it sank over 84 years ago and now brock lovett paxton is discovering old artifacts he comes across a picture of a young woman lying naked on a couch and is soon contacted by rose dewitt bukater calvert stuart she was the girl in that picture and soon rose tells him and his crew her story about what happened in the days before the sinking kate winslet is beautiful as rose dewitt bukater and leonardo dicaprio is adventurous as jack dawson this film deals with the romance between the two characters and the tragedy that occurs is both romantic and sad better get out the tissues girls this is a must see movie 1010,sad
amazing love story with adventure and with coarage three hour movie makes you not bored but exited for the next part amazing computer graphics and was a ship of dreams an amazing movie makes me sad and exited at the same time my favorite line was  you jump i jump a breath taken crash of the great ship amazing settings you could just feel the atlantic ocean the movie makes you see and feel what was really happening and how it felt the actors were so good that you could feel the fear the ship was amazingly shown it the movie with even the smallest details at your sight you didnt even had to picture the ship in your head because it was right there infornt of you amazing movie the ghost ship came back to live,sad
i know there are many people who see this film as a collection of bad acting and crummy special effects but i think they are the ones unable to see the brilliance behind this filmthe two leads have an amazing on screen chemistry which makes the final scenes heartbreaking to watch and the supporting cast form a realistic backdrop to their fatethis is a film everyone should see and if you dont love it the first time then watch it againfor me this is one of my fave films and its not just for girls cos i know at least three guys who love this film to,sad
i consider myself knowledgeable when it comes to the the ship not the movie so i know a good story when i see one was a very good representation of what actually happened except for the whole jack and rose story but you get the point i loved the movie for a few reasons the first being because of the accuracy the second being because it revitalized interest in the ship and the third being that i loved the color shots of the ship as opposed to actual pictures of the ship which are all in black and white i have taken a still from the movie of the ship and set it as my computers background because i just love that shot it is the shot of the ship shortly after it has left southampton where the camera moves in on the ship starting from a long distance and then getting progressively closer until it finally hovers over the bridge and you see captain smith say lets stretch her legs i love that shot and the movie that it was in i feel that people were beginning to forget about the and when the movie came around people began to be reminded about it and started to gain an interest in it again i for one had loved it many years before the movie came out but felt great when i was talking to people and they actually knew what the was this movie is among my favorites,sad
there is one thing that i have to say about this movie it is not the worst movie ever but it is one of the most worst moviesever made of course if you are loving somebody you should go to this movie but in my opinion is far overrated it all went by so quick boy meets girl girl has already a boyfriend but is very unhappy she wants to kill herself and there he is her jack he saves her life and the two of them are getting involved it is such a wellknown story the boyfriend wants to get jack out of the way and he even tries to kill him i can not imagine that such things had happened on the reali know it is just a movie but i hate it so much the only thing that i like about it is the song by celine dion i think that that song is the most beautiful film song that i have ever heard,sad
this film leaves a lot out but of course how long do you want it to be for a run down of a lot of dramatic moments omitted by the film consult httpwwwbiblicalcounselorgga01htm the iceberg sequence looked fake perhaps it could be done more realistically now seven years later i mean how gullible do you think your audience isthe key line in the film is to paraphrase even god couldnt sink this ship the obvious answer to that brazen statement is thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god herein lies the cause of the tragedy hopefully many people learned the lesson,sad
obviously the ship was traveling too fast to break the record for arriving in new york the watchmen did not see the iceberg in time because they were not paying attention it was absolutely disgraceful that most of the life boats left with only a fraction of the number of people they were designed to carry i was disgusted at the men who forced themselves on the boats ahead of children and babies to save themselves the scene i just broke down and cried in was when rose was floating on the wooden door and after jack had been saying never give up she heard the boat coming back looking for survivors she excitedly repeatedly said to jack the boat was coming but he had died,sad
the movie tells the story of a tragic love between a poor guy named jack and the lovely rose during their trip on the unsinkable ship sailing to usarose was being forced by her mother to marry with a rich but very proud man because her family was broke however rose met a talented and kind guy while she was trying to kill herself and then the brave jack saved her life since this moment they start loving each other but the high society didnt approved it cause she was a rich girl and couldnt get married with such a poor man as jack although roses fianc obviously and also her mother were against this relationship the couple in love  jack dawson and rose de witt bukater  were trying to be together and they were making plans to start a new life in the new worldsuddenly an iceberg messed up their love plans and the began to sinkunfortunately jack died after he had been done everything to save roses life for the second time and rose survived and lived to tell us this romantic although sad story about love and blue diamonds,sad
i am writing this cause the comment that i read said it was the worst movie and how bad it was now i admit it is a chic flick in some ways but in no way is this a bad film it is a work of art by james cameron just an absolute thrilling story line and the graphics man the graphics are some of the best work ever done on a film i dont believe this movie or story can ever be out done and should never be redone this is a passionate moving yet visually breathtaking piece of work leonardo dicaprio no doubt has his best performance of his life and kate winslet whew just as sexy as can be plays a very emotional role as rose jack and rose fall in love as all of us wish we could but as we all know it comes to a tragic end as the meets the floor of the northern atlantic ocean there is only about 2 or 3 other movies that can even stand in the same realm as if you havent seen this is a must see for all people this movie really floated my boat get it  jason lantz,sad
seven years later much people still remember the biggest success of ticket office in all the planet this if must to the enormous talent of the director james cameron responsible for the successes the terminator 1 and 2 aliens 2 and true lies was its more ambitious project congregating two actors who would be known currently leonardo di caprio that were in ascension at the time and kate winslet incarnating two young that lived a forbidden love inside it more luxurious ship that finished sinking in the dawn it day 14 of april of 1912 leonardo di caprio is jack dawson a young adventurer who finishes earning in a game to poker a ticket for a trip in the luxurious ship is clearly that it is in the same ship that jack will know the young saddened rose de witt bukater kate winslet that it is promised for the ambitious cal hockley billy zane but in a crisis of desperation rose it tries to play itself of the ship and finishes being saved for jack that is seen by the mother of the young one as a young adventurer who would confuse its plans and would have outside to be a letter play of baralho rose and jack need to face all the obstacles to survive to the shipwreck and for its forbidden love finished winning eleven oscars equaling to the fact classic it epic benhur with charlton heston interpreting the jew judah benhur the best film of all is not considered the times therefore exists great classics of the cinema as casablanca kane citizen singing in rain among others valley the penalty only for diversion nothing more moreover  of ,sad
the first thing ill say about this movie is that it was excellent and will long be remembered as a classic for this generation the casting was excellent with the possible exception of leonardo decaprio  somehow he just seemed a bit young for the part chris odonnell or josh lucas wouldve been a bit closer to the mark here as far as the rose character wonderfully portrayed by kate winslet it didnt take a lot of time to see the possible real person she was based on her mannerisms and defiance of custom seemed to emulate the late alice roosevelt longworth 18841980 daughter of theodore roosevelt as i watched kate i began to see alice literally if you dont know much about alice and her later impact on washington dc politics and mores there are several great bios available i would recommend this film to anyone over 13 parents should watch out of the eyes of the little ones excellent film,sad
i watched this movie when i was in junior high school i was very young but i still remember the powerful emotions  thoughts the movie had brought me i cried and enjoyed the movie so much it has been always my favorite movie when people asked what is your favorite movie i would answer without any hesitations some people would laugh at my answer but you know what most of the people who laughed at my answer probably watched and enjoyed the movie 6 years ago too i just purchased a dvd few days ago and watched it for the first time after 67 years i was surprised to find myself enjoying the movie so much the strong feelings it brings me was the same when i was in jhs perhaps even stronger than when i was young now that im a grownup college girl it still has the beautiful music scenes and acting i would call this movie the very best movie the best movie of the century,sad
how does one describe the perfect film in order to answer this question one must watch the perfect film in this case is the perfect filmhas the perfect cast perfect script perfect scenery and the perfect director these are only a few of the many reasons the 1997 version of owned all the qualities that make an outstanding film furthermore has great action sequences dramatic moments suspense and romance is the personification of excellence and perfectionit contained brilliant performances by kate winslet leonardo dicaprio billy zane and kathy bates i was truly impressed by the performance of billy zanes cal who was the jealous fianc to kate winslets rose the casting director knew what he was doing when he chose zane because the role was played with such ease the set design and costumes that overseen by director james cameron was done with careful attention to detail the accuracy of the set and costumes was superb it was not easy to tell the difference whether or not it was made or reali have seen many many times and will continue to see as long as i own the movie because it was that well done it continues to hold a special place in my heart and will for as long as i livethis continues to be one of the best films i have seen everyone should see it again and again,sad
back in 1997 when was released i didnt think it would ever earn back the money it cost after all it was basically a love storydrama set on a ship that sunk not exactly a crowd pleaser like say armageddon then it came out blasted to number one at the box office and received 14 oscar nominations  so i felt i had to see it coming out from the cinema i had that wow feeling the one you get when youre so caught up in whats going on in the film that you forget about everything else three hours just flies by in all ive seen it three times at the movies and another eight times on video and i still get that sense of awe when i see itwas a phenomenon its the sort of ground breaking cinema experience that doesnt come around very often sure the script isnt the most original ever  its almost structured like a daytime soap poor boy meets rich girl engaged to evil guy but another classic like gone with the wind isnt exactly the stuff of deep thoughts either what they have in common is that theyre grand spectacles that give the audience 100 entertainment in an expensive wrappinglove drama disaster action and suspense  something for almost everyone all done by extremely talented and gifted people who could produce a visual experience on a scale rarely seen earlier and in the middle of this two lead actors with a chemistry between them so crucial in order for the story to work beyond its one dimensional charactersthe film may have suffered a pretty severe critical backlash just look at the rating here on imdb but theres a reason why it made almost twice the amount of money at the box office as the number two film its pure and simple entertainment that shows just how fun it can be to go to the movies 1010,sad
is the best film ive ever seen was one of the first real films i ever saw that excludes animations i was 12 then and everybody where crazy about the film that is my friends at school we didnt do anything else but played at during brakes of course i didnt appreciate the film as much then as now i like it because im fascinated by or well i became that after having seen the film the accident was so sad those who have made the film really have managed to capture it how could they make it look so real on film thats what makes the film so good apart from the story that really appeals to me jack and rose are great characters played very well in my opinionthe conclusion is that is a film i can see over and over again actually im trying to buy it cheap on dvd on the moment,sad
not only was james camerons directing excellent but the performances by leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet were spectacular this movie not only shows the panic between jack and rose and the effects the sinking of has on them but also of the officers and other passengers who know they will not make it through the night it gives an incredible visual of what it would be like on the and shows comparison between the upper class and lower class and their attitudes and feeling towards their last night on the unsinkable ship though its obvious sinks at the end james cameron is still able to weave in a beautiful love piece and incredible visual effects making it feel as if your standing right next to jack shouting im king of the world a wonderful film well deserving of the academy award for best picture eight out of ten,sad
is truly an amazing movie they say you either love it or hate it how can anyone hate this movie usually guys say they hate it because they do not like romance stories these are the people that think explosions make a movie and romance is for girls only i beg to differ who wrote this movie a male okay so presumably the number 1 reason for disliking this movie is the romance that is diminished by me so is there any other reasons to hate it no if anyone can say anything thats bad about this movie try to because you will be wrong and i can defend that statementtheres nothing more that needs to be said about a movie thats this amazing,sad
saw again just now and i can say i enjoyed every moment of it showing the old wreck the now very old female survivor the bringing back of memories and actually being there wonderful a true masterpiece  even the love story holds up where so many people try to dish this part of the movie  ok so di caprio isnt overly talented but kate is a marvel and the storyline interweaves the dramatic love story very grippingly with the even more dramatic impending doom of 1500 on board who cannot get outthis used to be my no 2 alltime favorite after schindlers list but now the first 2 lotr movies make it my current no 4  and well deservedthis movie aged much better than fi jurassic park does,sad
personally i loved the movie it told tons of true facts like how there wasnt enough lifeboats for all the people  then there happened to be romance which i m sure happened back in 1912 if i was there i would never have left the man i loved i would have done what rose did only a little sooner and stayed with himi thought the acting and storyline was great leo did exceptional with his part especially when he realized that in order to save the woman he loved he would have to sacrifice his life it it those moments in movies in which you just want to cry and you do kate winslet i thought was the greatest actor in the movie i loved the part where she jumped from the lifeboat onto the sinking ship because she couldnt leave the man she loved rose and jacks love was so powerful that i dreaded him dying at the endi have to give nods to the supporting cast they were great too bernard hill who i just now realized was from lotr  was the best as the captain who went down with the ship all alone in his officeoverall i dont see what the big deal about having a love story in this movie it kept me interested and i love leo and kate together this movie is great and it is one of my favorite movies ever pearl harbor 1,sad
for this movie to have made over 12 billion dollars worldwidebash it or trash it but it was what we go to movies forwell most of us romance and lovethe fact that packs of girls and women went to see the movie time after time simply because it showed a love beyond compare at the tender young age in our lives either means many of us are lacking that kind of love or we have never been in love and wish we were12 billionenough reason to make it the most watched movie evergo suck an egg all you bashers,sad
its pretty simple really to define as a movie experience awesome direction cinematography and effects but its handicapped by a poor script that has the tendency to put you to sleep theres no wit originally and its not completely believable it seems the script was low on the priority list when the film was being made and it pays the price a good script wouldve complimented the rest of the movie very nicely i thought the old lady telling her story business was a waste of time and didnt help involvement it should have been scrapped altogetherif you havent seen before its worth a look the movie gets up and boogies in the final hour although the first two is more in line with chick flicks like youve got mail etc has been unjustly praised and unjustly bashed in some quarters but overall its a solid version of the events of 1912 no more no less,sad
i personally prefer epics that move me and films with barely any love story with the exception of braveheart and i like guys films like patton platoon the hunt for red october spartagus saving private ryan and glory i like to leave the theater feeling happy and speecheless and this movie did it for me i liked james camerons style of a love story i saw little to no awkward or corny lines during this movie and i felt that it was well created and had likeable characters it was also not overly done every situation the characters were put into were beleivable this movie also explains the story of a cocky crew that signed there own deaths just to make good time and good publicity with their fatal flaw they caused the deaths of almost two thousand people this movie consists of cowards and heros the villains cal  feelings toward the hero jack coincide with the gradual rising destruction upon the ship as the climax is reached so is the climax of cals anger and he tries to murder jack and rose i believe this movie is a definate classic oscar liked it and unless you dont like oscar then i garauntee that you will also,sad
i have long been interested in the since reading walter lords great book a night to remember over 30 years ago  i loved the film made from the book and own it  so i was interested when hit the screen however this film just didnt do it for me as a whole i found the love story between jack and rose unconvincing  i really found the whole character of rose hard to take  while recognizing that she was in a bad spot she came off to me as so egocentric and petulant that there were times when i felt like she deserved billy zane great as a nasty  billy zane has the perfect looks for the early 20th century parts  so when she hops in the sack with jack it looked like a nice fiery diversion that probably wouldnt have lasted two weeks once the boat docked  but the boat didnt which brings me to the parts i like bestwe have some friends who are naval architects and according to them they sunk the boat real good  also i found that cameron really did capture the terror and tragedy that affected the nameless passengers who went into the water and went down with the ship i found most of the sections of the moving that didnt involve the main characters better than the hissy fits going on in first class  one thing that did surprise me was the absence of the story of the california a ship that was sitting within 20 or so miles of the with its radio off  that was one of the most poignant elements of the real story  i dont know why cameron didnt include it overall i give it a 7 of 10,sad
is absolutely a terrific mega production its visually perfect the special effects are terrific the score from james cameron is by far unforgettable the costumes are awesome the sound effects are spectacular and the acting is just the opposite it wasnt a surprise that got all the oscars but the acting onesi have to say that this movie is really clever because is not all about the ship is about the forbidden love story of rose de witt bukater and jack dawson and how they fall in love in this terrible tragedythe love plot is very predictable and while you are seeing it is not much like other james cameron productions besides i found annoying at times the acting between the very hot kate winslet and the fake leonardo dicaprio its not a believable relation for me it looks false and being 130 seeing this relation developing its kind of boring however not all is bad the characters of molly brown calvert captain smith roses mother and even fabrizzio and tommy are perfectly performedthe sinking sequence is one of the most incredible and realistic scenes ive ever seen in a movie its really impressive what james cameron and all his crew achieved its the best dramatic thrilling disturbing and realistic sequence that has ever been madethis movie was really daring and its pg13 rate was really criticized and with absolutely right because contains brief frontal nudity you can see kates boobies mmmmm one use of strong language and his fing hand sorry his hand some sexuality you are tremblinghoo haa and disturbing disaster situations lady holding her son and repeating him itll be over soon or tommy being shot by mr murdocki wouldve give it an r but who cares this movie is going to be remembered as the movie that more money  has earned 910,sad
there was no doubt was going to be big it was 3 hours long and it recreated a major event but away from the media hype i find it too romancelike for my likinglooking at the results of the user ratings for this film females prefer it to males and espically the females under 18 it comes to show that this has more of a female appeal it has romance bits thatll make you cry and introducing leonardo dicaprio to the much dislkie of men im not being sexist men can like this film too but the results just show iti didnt like the sickening romance or the sickening ending but what i did like is the reconstruction of the crash well worth the money and certainly showed the sadness of the whole event i never cried during this movie but what got me close to crying is the scene when the mother tucks her kids into bed knowing they were going to die wonderfulso like romance like this like expensive reconstructions of events like this this film certainly introduced leonardo dicaprio kate winslet and that damn celine dion song,sad
whatever people think about this film it certainly had the magic ingredients at the box office even after all the potter and rings movies its still grossed nearly twice as much as any other filmi cant imagine many people on the planet dont know what happened to the the story is set around the unlikely romance between jack and rose the film is pretty much split into two halves the first is the romance between jack and rose whilst the second is all about the boat going down the effects are still very impressive and leo and kate look nice enough maybe its not quite deserving of the oscar glory and box office but its still a fairly entertaining movie 810,sad
i agree that the first time i watched i cried a lot and i still cry when i watch it i watched that movie when i was pretty small around 14 and i had no idea of the rating whenever i watch this movie i do realise that the idea i had that it was one of the best movies ever made is not exactly true due to my age i failed to notice faults but now i can state where they are and how they spoil the movie firstly i do not think deserved all those oscars and 14 nominations were just too much so far only three movies have had 11 oscars and i think only one out of the three deserved more rotk i think other movies such as gone with the wind bridge on the river kwai lawrence of arabia my fair lady fotr the two towers and a few other movies deserve to get so many oscarsit is a pity that james cameron had the chance to make this a brilliant movie if he had omitted a few things and cut out some insignificant scenes such as the spitting scenes jack being imprisoned in that small place when the ship is sinking roses heroic role in rescuing him all the other nameless scenes and a few other things perhaps he would have been able to make a brilliant movie however he failed here and falls short of all those praises did anyone notice that rose is supposed to be british and how her accent seems so put on american those were other flaws i think the actors who made this movie a good one are the crew members they made me cry bernard hill as the captain doesnt say much but he shows that sorrow so well the others were also great but the main characters didnt act that well sorry to say i must state that this movie had brilliant cinematography special effects original score and costumes and set design but it does fall short in being called one of the best movies ever made lastly i reveal my great pity that james cameron had this one chance to make this movie brilliant and he failed to bring it to that total brilliance nobody will make a film like this anymore we know that now we are left with this good but heavily flawed movie i would suggest you watch it it will make you cry but only because of the suffering of the insignificant characters i felt sorry that rose kept her secret for so many yearsbut sigh i wish james cameron had worked harder to make this movie a brilliant one,sad
i really did not want to see another version of the story on film because there already were two superb versions both made in the fifties i went anyway as this one was hard to avoid you might say i found the story on the ship quite annoying tailored with shallowness and aimed smackdab at the blockbuster potential teenagersi was disappointed by the depiction of a romance that would have never happened in 1912 a young woman masquerading as a socialite becoming interested in and getting naked for a steerage passenger sleeping with him on the ship flipping the bird and spitting really in 1912  wow james you have quite an imaginationtechnically the film is hard to fault but it just seems to lack in suspense there are some fake looking computer generated moments the most serious flaw  how anyone could spend 3 minutes never mind 30 minutes in the film  in freezing seawater in the bowels of the ship and somehow make it all the way to the stern to jump off come on i would encourage those who share my views to check out these two classics insteada night to remember 1958 a definitive british minutebyminute docudrama that has rightly stood the test of time 1953 a great hollywood version the old hollywood which i could not even find a mention in these reviews it did a superb job of depicting a troubled and ultimately doomed romance on the great ship i can actually say this version puts you on the ship more than the 1997 version it featured a great story believable characters unlike this version played to perfection by some of hollywoods best not to mention an unforgettably sad fatherson moment at the end it featured special effects way ahead of their time which still look pretty impressive today but it is literally forgotten save for a studio classics dvd release it certainly makes me wonder why cameron needed to spend a gazillion dollars on sfx put in such a lame unbelievable story and get more awards than the 1953 version those who get anal about some of the technical details on the earlier films such as for instance the ship not breaking in half seem to miss the point this must have caught the academy sleeping,sad
warning spoilersthis film took enormous efforts to make and the special effects were outstanding achievement why criticising the movie because the two main characters are fictitious this is a story based on the fact of the sinking of the unsinkable just a story a very emotional one perhaps at times too sentimental but for certain good entertainment the cast were superb even though the plot seems surreal leonardo dicaprio deserved more credits for his acting kate winslets and gloria stuarts performances were fabulous the movie received much acclaim and criticism alike simply because it was such a smashhitlike romeo and juliet jacks leonardo dicaprio and roses kate winslet love would never die because it is cut short before it can one brief encounter brings the love that lasts for a life time i believe love makes anything possible so even in 1912 an upperclass young woman would fall in love with a thirdclass male passenger because rose is a different girl she is rebellious and audacious but feels caged by her upcoming marriage with cal billy zane all just for his wealth to support rose and her mother jack falls in love with her at first sight saves her life and the chemistry between them becomes burning and boiling such love affair is possible anything is possible rose admires picasso and jack is an artist who travels around and only has ten bucks in his pocket they set each others spirit free the party at the lowerclass section is great fun real fun rose says to jack that when the ship arrives in america she will go with himso it is too late when they have realised that the unsinkable has collided with an iceberg and the life boats are not enough for all passengers the mass death is gruesome when rose hears the boat coming back jack has already been frozen to death so she lets go watching his body sink into the deep endwhen the older rose gloria stuart has told her story to the crew who have been searching for the heart of the ocean the blue diamond their faces are all covered with tears but what really matters is the heart of the ocean has still not been found brock lovett bill paxton gives up his ambition the diamond will never be foundrose gets to the edge of the search team ship get the heart of the ocean out of her pocket and throws it into the sea so now it is with jack foreverif it wasnt jack rose wouldnt be here todayjames cameron created a dazzling work of art you love it or you hate it nothing in between however this doesnt apply to me i am as a matter of fact not mad about the film and dont hate it either,sad
i really stayed away from this movie when it came out but i just saw it for the first time the other day and it is really really good the thing about this movie is its not just the story of a big ship that sinks but is more about the lifestyles of the rich and the famous back in that time period and also a love story tied in there the ship is just in the background while the people on board are the real story i really like dicaprios character full of spirit and energy good attitude towards life hes a great actor and james cameron is a fine director i do give this movie a 5 out of 5 great story and very entertaining you should watch this movie if you never seen it before any one who likes a great movie will like this one,sad
is one of those movies that i have a strange relationship with when it was released no one had ever seen anything like it i marveled at the technical brilliance the superb attention to detail and the incredible amount of work that went into its production i liked the movie very much but apparently so did many many other people my friends and classmates went to see the movie again and again week after week children and teenagers gasped and said it was the greatest movie ever made the infamous theme song to the movie was played everywhere on radios at funerals and at every conceivable public arena and to make it worse it managed to sweep almost every award it was nominated for even though it was the year of la confidential gattaca as good as it gets donnie brasco and pt andersons superb boogie nights its true that many of these movies were recognized for their achievements but it was difficult to hear about anything that wasnt related to and i was very tired of iti spoke out as often as possible ridiculing people for loving the movie and for falling for its rather insipid romance story i tried to spread it around that is a movie that should be hated not loved for its huge production value and mainstream appeal unfortunately i wasnt the only man that did this and apparently the message has gotten around too wellit has become so popular to hate that i think people are disliking it for the wrong reasons the teenagers that once loved the movie have grown up and began joining the crowds in ridiculing it in college i remember wanting to review a scene in to help me write a paper about the use of light shading and colors in tragedies while i was watching the movie in the communal lounge i received no less that a dozen scoffs and insults from passersby the same people that once loved the movie that i had despised were now turning on me for watching itwhat a strange world the truth is that is a wonderfully made movie and worthy of admiration i reviewed the rewards that it won and i realized that almost all of them are technical awards which it deserves it has been a victim of mainstream shallowness that not only clouded its original appeal but now has lost its fan base simply because its uncool to like the movie i am a heterosexual man and i like but now it seems that i have to try to undo the damage that myself and other men have done to what is otherwise an excellent movie,sad
the setting of this movie against the tragic 1912disaster cannot possibly go wrong technological advance meets disaster caused by human arrogance leading to overconfidencegiven this background the flashback in storyline really is a great choice it allows us to be taken back from our times to 1912 making it easier to identify with jack dawson rose de witt bukater and all other charactersi only think the goodbyescene between jack and rose together in the icy atlantic after the ship is gone too much overdone and therefore boring however this flaw is corrected soon enough by showing us rose back in 1997 standing at the stern of the salvage ship she plunges her invaluable necklace right into the sea meant as a tribute to her longlost lover and also as a moral correction on the greed of the people surrounding herso much for story it is supported by truly magnificent pictures alltogether making this a truly great movie,sad
the visual detail of is superb in fact great to me the great effects and great cast is wasted on drab and idiotic love story  i didnt see why we needed to have an action movie thrown into a tragic event the sight of billy zane as a jealous lover trying to kill leo was absurd and in a way hilarious  i think camerons interest in the history of the ship is what carries this movie  his affection for this event is seen in every detail of the movie  for me i found myself cheering for leo and kate to die so i didnt have to sit through more of there banter  which is the main focus of the movie so  i rather became disinterested fast  the other side characters and stories is the only thing that kept me watching  see the older version of bad effects but better story,sad
is one of the greatest movies in history everybody says why would i like such an old moviebut back in 1997 i am sureit was your favorite one kate and leonardo are great actors and they gave their best to the audience all over the world in,sad
the scene of the rising out of the ocean as a wreck and becoming once again the floating palace she was is i grant you a cinematic marvel  when cameron sticks to the facts the movie is good but i couldnt work up any sympathy for the fictionalized hero and heroine  there were so many real heroes and heroines during that particular sea disaster why focus on two fictionalized characters  the movie ended up being a maudlin disaster epic,sad
this seems to be one of the movies that people either loath or adore  the first time i saw it i marveled at the technical display but found the main plot curiously uninvolving  this is despite a good performance by kate winslett and dicaprio as well  he has been very good in roles before he became a superstar and he will again  as good as they were i just did not believe in their story but in fact even though the romance between jack and rose feels false and anachronistic to me i have come to appreciate if nothing else the importance of having that type of story to command our attention while the spoiler alert boat sinks  if you have the chance to watch night to remember youll see what i mean the last half of that movie seems to be nothing more than men nobly rfusing to get on lifeboats and women weepingly not wanting to leave them  rose and jack at least give us something to concentrate on while the thing is going downso give this a 4 of 5 primarily for the technical aspects and also for answering the question whatever happened to the guy who played jesus in godspell  answer hes building boats even god cannot sink,sad
spoilers i saw the weekend it opened  i have always been a fan of the ship and disaster etc  i was in a crowded theatre surrounded by teenage girls whom i expected to chatter all the way through  at the end of 3 hours no one chattered the theatre was silent and everyone was in tears myself includedi watched it again on video recently for the first time in a long time overall the film was done well  the special effects were amazing  it made you believe you were there at the time of the accident  as many posters before me have said the love story was contrived and not at all convincingwhat was even more distressing about this film is the transformation of rose  she walked on the ship as a prisoner of the elizabethan era and within a few hours shes suddenly a female terminator  she also apparently goes through a time warp and becomes a woman of the 90s  shes swearing like a sailor she spits in cals face she tells her over the top prudish mother to shut up she has a chance to be rescued twice and she gets back on the sinking ship  she runs through sinking hallways to rescue leo surely she must have seen him on growing painsthat alone is a reason to let him drown sarcasmand then in the cold night air of the north atlantic in 28 degree water she spends way too much time fawning over leo the ice cube  who by the way was too much of a 90s smart aleck for 1912  i think if the ship had made it to new york he would have been locked up the moment he got off the ship back to rose amid a sea of frozen bodies  seems to be the sole survivor another poster mentioned that she could have moved over a few inches and made room for leo on the piece of woodaside from the love story this movie was done well  as mentioned the special effects were the star of the show  the only special effect james cameron couldnt pull off was to make leo a character i cared about,sad
this movie its a truly story from the past its a magic environment between a love story and history because we can see the in the past and in the present and we see it clearly in the description that rose she is a old lady and that feeling of missing makes us think that all she passed with jack was a magic experience the sequence of the story is too well organized  we can see through the characters all the feelings brought outthe end its sad but in historical part of the movie its what really happen but in love part its dramatic and romantic in the some time because she honor him and she survived like jack told her when they were frozen in the  sea the incredible sense of courage ans straight that rose had to surviveits sad when she died old in the bed warm but in the some time its so symbolic she complete here destiny and she went to meet jack and all people who went in the travel,sad
spoilers aheadi am writing this after its recent performance in certain pollsi dont think this deserves to go down as the worst film ever especially in a poll that includes both pearl harbour and battlefield earth though to be honest the lack of votes may be more to do with a lack of viewers now be honest how many of you have actually watched it ehhowever i am not convinced that it should go down as the greatest movie ever in my humble opinion there no movie deserves that awardone of the accusations leveled at the director is its use of some cliched characters and events you know the stuff the poor but noble steerage the rich but decedent 1st class well to be fair to james cameron these cliches are as much apart of the legend as the sinking itself in actual fact it would have been near on impossible not to include themso on to the movie itselfits central narrative is provided by the character of rose however cameron doesnt allow this to stop him showing over important events and conversations even in the case of conversations on the bridge there is no way or reason for her to be presentthe movie contains three separate but interwoven strandsfirstly of course there is the story of the ship and its sinking secondary you have the romance between jack and rose lastly you have the savage operationstory is handled fairly well more could have be made of subplots ismays part in the ships operations for instance this said it contains enough to satisfy anyone with a casual interest and to be honest the special effects go a long way to make up for thisthe second strand the romance between rose a 1st class passenger and jack dawson a steerage passenger is in my eyes the weakest part of the movie however i fear that this was more than likely there to help the film get the green light ladies looks aware now fellas hands up if you cheered when dicaprios copse sank near the endlastly the strand that pulls it altogether an 102 year old roses telling of the story on board the calvish well i liked this idea although its not original it gave the movie some focus and allowed facts to be spoken without it breaking up the flow of the dialogue this also allows for some flashy but impressive editing namely moving from the wreck to an intact and vice versaso what you may with justification ask is my verdict well to be honest like the curates egg of legend good in parts but still enjoyable now all it needs is a proper well thought out dvd special edition,sad
this film is made in 1997 by james cameron in the usa it  was awarded 11 oscars it is a very romantic story with beautiful music by celine dion in this film  leonardo di caprio plays  as a poor boy and kate winslet as a rich girl they met aboard the ship they fell  in love with each other the end of the film is unhappy because the  ship sank and many people drowned ,sad
is my all time favorite film and the very best film of the last ten years leonardo dicaprio is magnificent as jack the direction art direction and cinematography are all top notch is easily the best film of the last ten years worthy of its 11 oscars and rank as all time box office champ no film of the last ten years comes anywhere near,sad
okay as the hype for this movie built up i was eagerly awaiting to see it i mean 200 million to make a movie  but being a major james cameron fan i couldnt wait to see how he sank that ship  so for the first two hours i watch this love story develop anticipating the sinking  i was pleasantly surprised to see that the story was entertaining and it really did not get in the way  then boom  the ship hit the iceberg and the technical side of cameron came out  i was so impressed with the camera angles the sound and the visualization of the sinking  this movie became so popular that it probably created a backlash by people who just cant stand to join the majority well news for you youre still joining a group but i still enjoy watching this movie,sad
perhaps not a fully correct historically bit what a tear jerker at least for the first half dozen times you watch it i remember when i went to the cinema for the first time to watch this film at the close no one not anyone said a word all we could hear was sobbing the film certainly made its impact,sad
if had been any different say if it hadnt included jack and roses romance and just been a straight docudrama or if it had been set on a fictional modern ship or even if it hadnt been told in the flashback style history would have been different it would probably have simply made four or five hundred million dollars people would have shrugged it off as simply a more than usually expensive mainstream blockbuster it would still have taken home several technical oscars la confidential would have won best picture and life would have gone onbut it didnt happen like that instead james cameron made an monumental commercial gamble in putting together a story of love and tragedy across the decades the likes and scale of which audiences had never seen before and likely never will again he was rewarded with a mountain of oscars and the distinction of having made the first movie to a cap one billion dollars in worldwide grossnaturally a huge wave of people sprung up swearing up and down that the film was unworthy of this level of success im sure you know the sort they lay into calling it the lowest of dreck and that theres not a single redeeming point in it and that its success came solely from 14year old girls and to them i say  fine leave to the 14year old girls and go watch aliens or a terminator movie and get your testosterone rush james cameron gets the last laugh either way and how many directors can claim that,sad
i saw this movie and leonardo did great i give this movie a 10i love leonardos movieswhen he played romeo ahhe really did great and to say its a true story i really enjoyed this movie peace amy,sad
despite the fashionable negative reviews that a lot of film snobs seem to pass on this movies it actually is a very good telling of a famous story i admit when i went to see this movie i thought id be cheering for the iceberg but the dramatization does work very well with characters who have engaging personalities and the right mix of drama and humorspoiler warningi am a bit disappointed that my fav line from this movie  why do the british have to announce dinner like its a cavalry charge  turned out to be borrowed from the 1956 clifton webb version actually i think the really farfetched bit of storytelling is how rose survives after diving in and out of the allegedlyfreezing cold water about five or six times she gets wet more often that jack does i can only figure she must be full to the brim on alcohol which may explain a lot  ha hastill the story is delivered very effectively and keeps you involved all the way through the contrasts between the early part of the 20th century and the modern salvage expedition scenes is very thematically effective it certainly gives a new and interesting perspective and helps the modern viewer relate to the events great storytelling device i also recommend that people should check out the telemovie made the year before with barry pepper and catherine zeta jones that one works quite well too especially for a lower budget,sad
the way the movie portraits the tragic incident of the sinking is great one of the bigger events in modern historybut then you go and throw this banal love story in the mix it just doesnt work for me dont get me wrong their have been stories of the same kind far worse than the one in did you hear that right see thats all i need you know the big boat that sunk isnt that enough for one movie i think so,sad
what moves us varies greatly from person to person some are moved to tears by this film while others are left sleepy and bored as with any love story whether it be casablanca sleepless in seattle or gone with the wind people tend to end up in the same two camps those who embrace and those who abstainwe all have our own criteria that have to be met for us to immerse ourselves in any given movie those criteria are in turn influenced by our preconceptions and the genre in general with regard to movies immersion is determined by how much reality we are willing to temporarily set aside or how much of the illusion we buy if you willa movie is after all merely a sequence of photographs projected onto a screen with sufficient rapidity as to create the illusion of motion and continuity so even documentaries require us to suspend some part of reality to attain immersion once this basic requirement is met our own criteria determine what level of cinematography directing scripting acting and so on are required for us to be immersed the genre plays an important role too as these criteria differ widely from genre to genre one might not put so much emphasis on acting in an action movie driven by special effects as one would in a drama or one might not be offended by the impossibility of a certain action sequence as one would be of inaccurate facts in a documentarycan be summed up as an unbelievable love story set in a believable environment it has some minor flaws but there is no denying the scope of the film what we are left with is the storyline and this is where opinions differwhether you are moved to tears or bored to sleep depends on your ability to immerse yourself in this type of film the genre is an old one and we are reluctant to give in to the blatantly obvious plot that we know certainly must end in tragedy some are unwilling or unable to descend from their lofty seat of objective observation to the wooden planks of the sinking ship because they see through the directors transparent and unoriginal ploys to make them cry like babies having fought off his feeble attempts to trick them into feeling they devote their attention to the scenery and technicalities finding obvious errors that they cant believe other people missedin my opinion emotions are a very important aspect of humanity and to bottle them up without reason is a shame and a restriction of experience one can easily avoid caring about most things but it takes guts to allow your self to embrace the true horrors of what transpired on that maiden voyage if you dare to view history as more than facts and statistics if you have the guts to embrace a fictional and fantastic storyline you will love this movie if you arent prepared to do that this movie will most probably be a complete waste of your time,sad
well i am finally getting a little sick of people bitching non stop about this movie why do i feel half of you that rag about it are doing so because for some reason its become very trendy to bad mouth this movie then of course are the sudointellectuals that believe that movie  profit crap im not standing on my soapbox and proclaiming that this is the greatest movie of all time because it isnt i dont need for you love this movie or even like it because everyone has there own opinions see battlefeild earth i thought that was realy bad however this movie still has merit one last thought for those of you that have said adnauseum worst movie ever made lets see your movie then go and rent cluelimesodathose that can do those that cant critique  unknowni will perfect my own race of people a race of atomic supermen which will conquer the world   dr eric vornoff,sad
a kid who was a loner and strived on doing things different and better grew up to be an adirector and in hollywood that is a great achievement just to be in that league the man is james cameron and the movie isfrom the screenplay to the the ultimate audio dubbing at the lucass skywalker technology parkcamerons genius clearly shines if there was another person who can share the credit would be james horner the music comes alive with the sea parting for the ocean liner the initial departing scene in southhamton and the the working of the engines with the sound of the pistons going fullboard let us strech our legs mr murdoch is just awesome scenes to reckon with the sea is alive with the sound of the scene with rose shivering on the plank of wood is probably the weakest part of camerons directorial brilliance the scene is short and plastic gloria stuart as the surviving rose reminds me of katherine hepburn in her sincere portrayallike benhur this is a movie that will be remembered as long as the relic of remains in the bottom of the atlantic ocean,sad
very good movie that was very well done by directing writing and casting leonardo dicaprio and kate wilson did a good job im not even their biggest fans but they were pretty good id recommend this movie to anyone interested in romance or the historic ship,sad
a lot of people seem to think that is an overrated movie because of leonardo dicaprio and the whole leomania deal  well its not dicaprios performance in the movie is very good  in fact i seem to remember thinking he was robbed of an oscar nom  dicaprio is a good actor if you dont believe me then watch whats eating gilbert grape celebrity and to a lesser extent the man in the iron maskmoving onthe reason this film is so overrated is the screenplay  the screenplay is godawful  if you recall the screenplay didnt even get an oscar nom this is probably the only movie ever to win best picture to hold that distinction and will probably remain that way  there are a ton of lines that are stupid dumb inaccurate for the time and just plain worthless the screenplay also helps create a bunch of clichd characters  cameron might be able to direct great spectacle but his writing skills are lacking kinda like george lucas only lucas cant direct too well anymore eitherthe supporting performances are also wildly uneven  both leads are good by the way  as for the supporters kathy bates victor garber jonathyn hyde and gloria stuart all do well  but the much larger roles of billy zane and frances fisher are horrible  it doesnt help that their characters are clichd to the max but sometimes good performances can make characters seem less clichd  these two fail miserably here  usually theyre good in their roles  but here its just bad  especially billy zane  if he wants to promote his filmography he should really mention the phantom before this onethe movie is great spectacle however  the scenes of the ship sinking are amazing  this is probably the most accurate depiction of the disaster that will ever be seen  after all a night to remember didnt show the ship splitting in two which we know now happened  so the movie is handled incredibly well in this respect  you do feel like youre on the ship itself  the sets are exquisite  beautiful to say the least  you do get an idea for how majestic the ship wasanother problem i have with the movie is the very overrated celine dion song and james horners score  if you this is the only work of horners that youve ever heard then youre missing a lot  glory and apollo 13 are far better scores than the repetitive themes of this movieoverall is a solid movie  not great but not horrible  its a 710  it did not deserve to win best picture  that honor should have gone to la confidential,sad
personallyi dont buy this crap about the bad dialoguesthis film is supposed to be realisticrightwelldont tell me that two people in love dont say a lot of inappropriateunspectacularstupid things to each otherespecially in such a situation,sad
i watched the for the 3845th time yesterday well no not really it was only the second time anyway when i watched it yesterday the first half hour i felt like throwing up the first half hour is probably the worst part of the movie but after that it gets better although the sinking part couldve been shorterthere are several scenes mostly from the early part of the movie that i find particularly annoying if james cameron had asked me i would have told him to shoot them another way these are the scenes contains spoilers 1      first of all the early part of the movie the leadin is too long it should have been made shorter like maybe 10 minutes instead of like 20 and that part of the movie made it look cheap the movie is about the and how a girls life was changed its not about some modern expedition to salvage the ship using stateoftheart technology yeah yeah the miracles of technology and computer simulation we all know that already the leadin should have been made as short as possible2      when they found the safe its payday boys and  kaching these phrases annoy me i wouldnt have used them that fat bearded guy zz top is pretty annoying too3      while the guy was cutting into safe everybody stood around  and celebrated by opening bottles of champagne first of all thats pretty rude secondly if they were serious researchers im sure they wouldnt celebrate things prematurely that scene made them look like pirates ok maybe they were i would rather that they were serious researchers the movie does reflect on the director so it seems4      when mr expedition boss saw the painting of rose wearing the diamond necklace he asked someone for a picture of the necklace then held it sidebyside with the painting this scene was used to introduce the diamond to the audience but i think its too cheesy and dumb  if mr e boss was so obsessed with the diamond he would have memorized by heart how it looked like he wouldnt need a picture to compare a subtler scene would have sufficed for example jesus christ its the diamond bob its the diamond  cut5      roses granddaughter leggy longhaired blonde with big boobs yeah right come on i wouldve cast zz top as roses grandson instead just for kicks6      rose seeing the expedition on tv come on what are the chances unfortunately i cant think of a better way of doing it in reality they would have probably taken a longer time to find rose or maybe never in which case thered be no movie to be made7      ok those russian or whatever guys who were playing poker with jack had a ship to catch what are they doing gambling five minutes before the ship was going to sail the bartender was yelling is leaving in five minutes overdramatized unimportant scene i prefer it shot like this jack wins tickets russky gets mad and attacks jack accusing him of cheating thats what most people do when they lose in gambling jack grabs tickets and runs away loses them in a chase amidst the crowds cut8      im king of the world jackim flyingrose come on thats so cheesy do they let you do that anyway still i can live with those two scenes since they were the defining moments of the movie and every movie needs a defining moment except theres not a single soul close by when they did that it looked so like they were shooting it in a studio id prefer a few people close by watching their antics to make it look more realistic9    fabrizio jacks sidekick how convenient as a comedy fodder no sidekicks for me artistes travel alone10   at the end of the movie old rose throws the necklace into the sea come on those poor expedition people have been looking for it for years and she throws it into the sea how mean can you get why should rose feel so attached to the necklace anyway the necklace does not symbolize jacks love the necklace belonged to that mean fianc guy whom she detested and which he tried to use to buy her love i would have done it this way the scene where rose arrives in america looks up at the statue of liberty and finds the necklace in her pocket then she throws the necklace into the sea symbolizing the severance of all ties with her past11   old rose doing the im flying thing thats so dumb then she goes to bed and they show all those pictures near her bedside table hello youd think she would have left the pictures at home instead of lugging it all the way to sea for an old lady like her she should travel light i wouldve settled for her to look into the sea see her own reflection a satisfied smile go to bed those pictures of her living life to the fullest couldve been shown in the early part of the movie while she was still at home for example showing her photo album to zz top oh lookie this is me riding a horse oh lookie this is me piloting an airplane during ww212   the final kiss nice touch almost perfect ending to the movie except it was spoilt by having all the people looking at her and then clapping while they were kissing that is  so dumb because it made rose look like some sort of narcissist craving for attention and approval i suspect it was james camerons oscar winning fantasy ooohh im getting an oscar for this and everybody in the audience will be looking at me finally cheering and clapping their hands i bet thats what he was thinking when he was shooting that final scene the scene should just be her and jack with the people there as decorations no staring no claps zoom in and show just the two of them kissingand like i said  the one hour or so while the ship was sinking im sure it could hae been made shorter and less melodramatic but i cant be bothered going there,sad
this movie is the only one that i have ever seen that made me want to go back and watch it again and again there were so many things happening in this movie that you could not catch them all the first time you watch it if this would have come out before the afis 100 years 100 movies were anounced it would have been in the top 10 of that list,sad
warning some spoilers here just in case if you havent seen the movie in the past six years except the iceberg of coursethis movie in my opinion consisted of two different films  the first was a contrived love story that was clearly created by someone who doesnt have a clue about how people fall in love  i didnt buy the love story between dicaprios and winslets characters  it seemed to me like we love each other but it cant work out because were from different sides of the tracks so lets just have sex and make the most of it while the cruise lasts because when it ends im marrying for money  maybe something like that could happen but i doubt it  of course the ship hits the iceberg no spoiler hereand thats when the second film starts up  this is where james cameron is in his element action  characters that i couldnt possibly care less about before the iceberg hit all the sudden began acting like real people  the only characters i did care about from beginning to end was kathy bates charactera true credit to her talent and strangely enough billy zanes character  i hate to say it but i was glad his character survived the sinking the manner in which he does it defined his character more than anything earlier in the movie in my opinion james cameron wanted to make a film about the sinking of the but sold out to the almighty dollar and pardon the pun sank an otherwise good idea by a terrible love story in order to cover the young female demographic  you want to know why cameron was so happy at the oscars when it won best picture because he couldnt believe the academy bought it hook line and sinker  it just goes to show you that every once in a while the cream la confidential in this case sometimes gets bogged down at the top by the crud,sad
this movie really sucks  it is very predictable and the story is not that great kate winslet is a great actress and she is also the only good thing in this movie leonardo makes a really bad role even worse the music is okay and the scenery is okay if you see this movie once its enough,sad
a lot of the comments about this film are centered on the romance between jack and rose i never saw them as the center of anything that relationship was only a vehicle for the main purpose of the film that purpose being what the passengers of the went through during this horrific tragedymy husband and i had no desire to see this film when it came out we thought yeah yeah big ship iceberg sank a lot of people died we already know the story we were so wrong we were put into the shoes of those poor souls who were unfortunate enough to be of the wrong class steerage we saw those who knew there was no hope and waited to die we went through the terror that each one of those passengers went through and we saw the shame and disgust of those that let people die just to save themselvesat the end of this film we sat with tears in our eyes and could only say i never knew,sad
i gave it 4 out of 10ok where should i beginthe acting there were no actors in this movie except kate winslet only movie stars or should i say hollywood star leonardo dicappuchino or whats his name isnt an actor hes a hollywood star hes always the same charachter except for whats eating gilbert grape where he didnt act at all he just was himselfwell enough with the acting the story is well known but the script is ridiculous with its billy zane chasingscene and cheap love storyits a shame that you have to wait for about 2 hours to see what you were waiting for going down the way the did it was really good work thats why i did rate 4 instead of just giving it 1 awful credit is given where credit is due or something like that,sad
a titan of a movie history does provide hollywood with some of the best story lines the story of the tragic sinking of the socalled ship of dreams the infamous has touched peoples hearts throughout the century this is a perfect plot for a fantastic movie thanks to a little hollywood magic we can experience for ourselves the horror and drama of the fateful ocean journey of the is one of the great movies of the last decade it was a success from the time it hit cinemas amazing audiences around the world and why wouldnt it this marvelous movie has great actors an incredible set and costumes and of course a historically accurate plot that is going to be remembered for years to come in addition to telling of the fate of the this movie also captivates audiences with the dramatic love story of jack leonardo dicaprio and rose kate winslet two passengers aboard the unsinkable ship dicaprio plays a poor third class passenger who falls in love with the beautiful but engaged first class passenger winslet between chases and dramatic rescue acts these two actors awe audiences with their charm and tenderness in the many love scenes one of the most famous scenes of the movie the parting of the two lovers after the sinking of the is guaranteed to make hearts wrench and eyes shed tears but this is not the only scene that truly moves viewers though the general theme of the movie the sinking of the is often ignored due to the captivating acting it is after all what makes the movie special the sinking was tragic but what was really touching were the different scenes of the passengers of the right before it sank james cameron didnt skip anyone he shows us all the people that are mentioned in history books including mr guggenheim and mr and mrs strauss these peoples last moments on earth are almost as dramatic than those of the two lovers jack and rose from an historical point of view all classes aboard the ship are represented with attention to detail such as costume dialogue and their particular activities of course the costumes of the first class passengers are heavenly they represent the style of 1912 perfectly including the accessories such as hats purses cigarettes which make many appearances throughout the movie and jewelry but the third class is also represented well through costume but mainly through acting there are many foreigners in these classes just like 91 years ago on the small details and scenes in the movie make it so memorable the saddest part according to my own opinion is the faithfulness of the musicians who continued playing their instruments while chaos and panic erupted around them the movie however would not have been such a great success without the incredible set throughout the entire movie you never get the feeling that the ship was not the actual sailing the atlantic ocean not only does the ship itself seem to be authentic but also all the accessories such as chairs china beds and more even the famous grand staircase is recreated to look like the original the audience is bound to feel like they are dining and sharing in the lives of people of the 1910swith a fabulous set convincing actors and a tragic and captivating plot is a titan of a movie as close to historically accurate as you could possibly get that is well liked by all who are willing to share in historys amazing storiesrating 5 out of 5,sad
i think this was an excellent movie and i have seen it many times every time you see it you dont get bored and you see it with more interest all the charters have been beautifully and artistically presented the movie gives you a picture of the fateful ship that was unsinkable but finally sunk in its first ever journey,sad
movie was fantastic sad and moving about the true story of the white lines the ship that was unsinkable kathy bates and leonardo de caprio were excellent i didnt go for kate winslet as rose the love story was cleverly intermingled with the horrific sinking in the north atlanticwhich changed shipping passenger line regulations forever the class struggle was also exposed with the love affair of the two  and the damaging affect love has on your heart great movie but a half an hour too long,sad
almost a century ago the magnificent ship cristened the sailed the ocean waters it was the grandest ship of them all and its luxury was unsurpassed at the time but little did anyone know that its first voyage would also be its last and would come to be known as the grandest ship wreck of all timeafter sitting beneath the waves of the atlantic ocean for all this time with only history texts and lowquality photographs documenting it the era and the event has finally been brought back to life in its full glory james camerons 1997 faithfully reproduces the ship itself as well as the tragic events that occured that faitful april night and with it unravels an untold love story that despite being fictional really brings the full emotion of the event to a personal level and humanizes the tragedythis movie provides a little something for everyone romance tragedy action adventure all into one perfect mixture has an awesome story and inspiring special effects and professional art to back it up this film did not receive so many awards and nominations for nothing the soundtrack is complete and touching in its own right and the fiction and truth that make up the plot dance seamlessly and gracefully togetherif you havent seen this movie yet witch considering its success is difficult to believe then you definitely should all three hours give or take is packed with candy for your eyes and ears as well as a wonderful story that will keep you on the edge of your seat this will forever be a classic and a movie to remember i will be watching this movie again years from now and then many years from theni give it a perfect ten out of ten for me there were very few blemishes on this featureon the grandest ship under the worst circumstances during the greatest sinking of all time a story of love and passion unfolds for two people lost at sea one will make it out one will not but they know that they will always be togetherin their heart at least,sad
is a beautiful and thoughtful movie one thing bothers me the overly dramatic dialogue between jack and rose its sooo disgusting at times why cant they talk like normal people rose oh jack insert melodramatic line jack oh rose insert melodramatic response other that that i have very little bad to say about this cameron builds the tension between the characters and the ship beautifully and by the time doom is approaching faster and faster the film turns into a very beautiful survival story the part when the ship breaks in two is especially dramatic one more thing cameron is known for his larger that life action movies and it is obvious that this time around hes tried something else but lets be honest the last hour on the is just one brilliant action scene its just in his nature why fight it  ,sad
this has got to be the best movie of all time anyone who doesnt think so should regret it this movie has it all actionviolencedrama tragedyand of course comedy this movie is really a movie to remember years from now people will still be talking about this fantastic movie with a mix of fantastic actorsactresses including leonardo dicaprio kate winsletkathy batesbilly zanegloria stuartand victor garber those were just a few of the many outstanding actors of this movie has led me to my hobby and huge interest of i have a ton of books on theall the movies oftuffed animals models of and many other things i have also seen both the exhibit of at the local imax theater and the ghosts of the abyss which are both equally excellent im going to close this by saying if you havent seen you must as you probably tell i am obsessed with and proud of it too,sad
well done  i consider this a perfect film  finally a film that effectively gives something to everyone  a romance film for the romanticsa horror film for fright fansa disaster filma great effects film for science fiction fansand an action film with an independent film feel made for all demographics,sad
i saw a number of times upon its initial release i loved it these days i must say that i have become fed up with all the whining and moaning that seems to arise whenever it is mentioned having not seen it in about four years i decided to sit down and watch it againits still a great moviei can probably understand the backlash some of camerons dialogue is cringeworthy and james horners choirboy chorus soundtrack can get a bit annoying and im sure that after hearing that infernal celine dion song so many times watching camerons egoinflating oscar acceptance speech and never hearing the end of its bajillion dollar blockbuster success people got sick of hearing about this moviebut its still a great moviedicaprio and winslet are both wonderful and despite some of the wooden dialogue the romance is enchanting while the first half may be slow and somewhat padded the final 90 minutes are anything but the sinking of the is one of the most spectacular and terrifying things i have ever seen in a movie i will never forget itanyone who cant admit at least that much is lying so call me sentimental but this is still a powerful stirring film experience 910,sad
how on earth could this movie have won an oscar for best film the string ensemble continuing to play as the ship was sinking was straight out of monty python there was no sense of terror as the ship began to flood instead you sat back and admired the clever way the director filmed the ship filling up with water  how it burst through ceilings and doors and whooshed its way along the corridors surely we were meant to feel for the poor panicstricken passengers the director obviously didntas for the romance between leo and kate  they have to be one of the most mismatched couples in movie history it might have had a big budget but this has to be one of the poorest ever movies to win an oscar  what was the academy thinking of,sad
we had to do a project for my bcis a computer class class at school and it involved coming here id never actually looked at the all time top us movies but i knew still reigned supreme anyway but i also noticed something we only had to list through the top 30 movies on our project but over half of them were adventurescififantasy or whatever i think there was only one other drama or romance besides this one yet so many people seem to hate this movie well then why did it gross 601 million because when it comes down to it i think this movie shows the kind of love between jack and rose that we all wish we had whether we admit or not i cant even begin to describe how i feel about this movie i just dont get how so many people can dislike it or make fun of it one of my friends told me that when she went to see it in theaters when it came out a big man in front of her with a cowboy hat was crying by the end ok so maybe this movie did receive a lot of hype and so did my heart will go on but for obvious reasons i think that this is the greatest movie that there will ever be and honestly i hope nothing else ever outgrosses it and even though i love celine i dont just love this movie because celine sings in it but then again i am a hopeless romantic which is probably why i love this movie so much i just think so much love has escaped the world and with all the divorces and everything in the world i just think it is incredible to see people like jack and rose and couples like them today that love each other that much its almost scary but amazing that love like that can exist maybe jack and rose call each others names ten million times throughout the movie but they love each other so much it hurts i read an article once where a girl was like oh my god i cant believe rose would give a perfectly good seat on a lifeboat for jack personally i think she totally missed the point but anyway thats just my theory i really think broke records in the movie world because maybe its hard to see sometimes but love really does conquer all i think people realized that in 1997 and hopefully they can realize it again now,sad
spoilers ahead is without a doubt the best movie of 1997 and deservingly won its oscars but that is all it is and when you compare it to other best picture winners then it is nothing special and is for example inferior to braveheart or platoon the only bad parts of are the flying scene and the jack dying scene those scenes just make you embarassed in pain excluding those scenes the film is for the most part great for example the opening or closing scenes are pure cinema perfection with emotional musical score that send emotions through your whole body in fact even though there were a couple better movies since none had better single moments than a couple moments of absolute perfection in however this is not a perfect movie and is in fact the most flawed james cameron movie how could cameron go so over the top with the love story and keep a cheesy flying scene if you want to watch cameron at his best then watch terminator 2 but otherwise watch this and expect a couple of embarassments,sad
there are a lot of people out there that hate this movie and right off the back i want to say that this is one of the best movies ive ever seen i will admit the love story was a little annoying and a waste of time they had to waste the first 2 days some way but i dont think anyone can disagree that the sinking of the ship was a amazing and horrifying thing to watch the special effects were perfect at that part and james cameron captured what happened perfectly this movie deserved best picture a,sad
i have seen this film like 10 timesand every time y watch  i enjoy it like the first onebefore the first one i thought oh no its too longthis will be a slow filmand now i know how wrong i was the story was pretty goodbecause the director mingles the love story with the disaster of the boatand its so captiviting that you dont realize that 3 hours have passed and the two main stars are awesomekate winslet act as the rich girl that lives unhappy because she has depply fall in love with jack dawson that its leonardo dicaprio but she has to get married with a horrible rich manthe setting and the costume are also greatthe only thing that i dont agree with are the special effectsthey are like cartoons ones on the whole i think its a wonderful filmthat will make you cryand im sure you will never get boredso in my viewits well worth seeingeugeniacutralc argentina,sad
i saw this again recently on dvd  this is a wonderful film  i had heard some idiot say the boat didnt sink fast enough and all of that  some people are so negative  i love this movie  its magical and wonderful and romantic and the score is my all time favorite  when the ship goes from wreck at the bottom of the sea and transforms back in time and becomes new again my heart was in my mouth  a spectacular film from a great directoremma,sad
i love this movie this movie was one my favorites along with many other friends of mine we would watch it over and over hehe i have always liked leonardo dicaprio he is a great actor and has great looks he plays handsome jack dawson a poor artistic american who travels all around the world he wins his ticket on at a lucky game of poker along with his italian friend fabrizo he seems to care very much about people and their feelings despite all of cals money and power he could never measure up to someone like jack dawson the prideful cal realizes his competition with jack even in the beginning he thinks how could someone as wealthy and powerful as him lose a womans heart to a 3rd class passenge the answer is love he meets the beautiful rose a 1st class passenger about to be wed to the wealthy but evil cal hockley it was an arranged marriage made by roses money hungry mother who doesnt ever seem to consider what rose wants or how she feels her mother and fiancee seem to have absolute control over her this pushes her even closer to the edge the two meet out of fate jack reaches out to rose and he ends up falling in love with her as does rose rose is left with the decision as whether she should stay loyal to the evil cal and her mother people seem to complain that this movie has way to much romance and not enough action it has plenty of action a movie like this can really open up your emotions i dont see anything wrong with adding a little romance some of the characters are ficticous obviously but it still includes history on famous passengers thomas andrews bruce ismay margaret molly brown or the unsinkable molly brown john jacob astor captain ej smith 1st officer merdock and many others obviously theyre all 1st class passengers merely famous for their money a lot of the movie centres around 1st class and 3rd class i didnt see anything on 2nd class though to this day the movie still makes me cry it would be nice if all men were like jack dawson and no men like cal hockley hehe well if you like romancesthrillers and want a good cry i reccomend to you 10 stars out of 10 hats of to james cameron,sad
i find an unbelievable blindness  not only among detractors but even among fans  to what is at the heart of this film its not primarily about a big ship a huge catastrophe or an intense and shortlived love affair those things are by no means incidental but theyre means to an end that end being to tell people in despair not to kill themselves to turn around instead and live their lives with fierce and total commitment thats camerons message and thats what moved mei dont expect those who havent considered suicide  or experienced the suicide or nearsuicide of a close friend or relative  to get this film the same way i do it isnt some fluffy confection it grapples with life and death the same way a story about auschwitz doesspoiler i guess does anybody not know how this story turns out if dicaprio is too good to be true its because his character is called upon to embody life itself he has to burn brightly and joyfully even in the face of certain death in dying he has to pass that spirit on to the woman he loves so that she can go on to become everything alive and human in the face of the deathfilled century to follow people who know me are shocked i liked this film liked is an understatment  i cried nonstop for twenty minutes after leaving the theatre im crying now while i write thissentimental favorites that garner multiple academy awards eg terms of endearment leave me spitting and fuming at what manipulative bull they are beautiful movies like zeferellis romeo and juliet strike me as empty confections i tend to respect tough ironic sardonic filmmakers bunuel cronenberg solondz the most notable exception however is capra whose corn i am an absolute sucker for the parallels between and its a wonderful life  another lifeaffirming film centered on an averted suicide  may be the subject of the next essay disguised as brief comment i smuggle onto imdb,sad
you cant love but to be drawn into the movie  james cameron really captured essence and brought us into the movie onto the ship the iceberg scene and the scenes were the is sinking were very dramatic suspensful and upsetting 85 out of 10 i give to this movie,sad
this happens every time when a person a company a product whatever you like is extremely successful people start to criticize it very hard this is called envy is one of the best movies ever made period james camerons dive to the real to get a mere 12 minutes of footage deserves alone 11 academy awards please people wake up this picture is a truly masterpiece take off your hats you are in front of the 19 billion wonder that is,sad
ok i admit i am a teenage girl and a huge fan of leonardo dicaprios but despite him being in this picture this film really isnt that bad maybe it didnt deserve all 11 of its oscars it doesnt compare to benhur or over 1 billion at the box office the acting isnt that great as the script is quite poor but still the film doesnt deserve some of the comments its received its entertaining and moving and is worth watching if its on i think it deserved to get onto the top 250 on this site even if it shouldnt have got very high,sad
its too bad this movie didnt even make it in the top 250 voted by users of this site  i guess teenage girls dont come to this site  oh well  im sure there are lots of guys who liked this film but in an effort to defend their masculinity decided to trash it  i think this film is no different from star wars and even that film was voted in the top ten  the level of detail and accuracy this film possessed minus the love story is why it won so many oscars  and yes none of the actors or actresses won because of the cheesy dialogue  nonetheless the producer and director definitely deserve credit,sad
this film is the best film ive ever seen it deserved the 11academy awards and the 18 billion dollars it earned world wide it is so sad yet so beautiful james horners score is a masterpiece james cameron showed us that the heart can go on after losing someone we lovejack and rosedicapriowinsletare two great film characters that will go down in movie history this film is up there with gone with the windit was truly a moving experience 1010,sad
and this coming from a thirty something heterosexual married male figure that one out will yai just read a number of the posts and i find it amazing the hatred for this movie it was a movie throughout the history of movie making there have been mediocre plots and mediocre acting unbelievable sequences and inaccurate historical portrayals i believe this movie rates average to above average in all thesethis movie is typical hollywood in every sense cameron wanted to do a movie that encompasses the nonfiction events of one of the most well known human tragedies with a fictional story fantasy meets nonfiction so what if he didnt get all the historical events exactly right but he did give an accurate sequence of events that lead to the tragedy for example the fact that astor is on the stairwell as opposed to beneath the stack is irrelavent even though his whereabouts cannot be truelly confirmed either way the fact is he went down with the boat the class stereotypes are very accurate todays society doesnt reflect such class division as it did at the turn of the century not all rich people in the movie were evil justrich the middle and third class just knew how to have a good time with what they hadthe story does leave something to be desired but it is a love story that has to fit inside 3 days it was okwhat impressed me the most about the movie was the nonfiction that encompassed the story a truely accurate dipiction of society of the turn of the century and the human errors that caused a horrible tragedy that should never have happened 1500 people did perish with a very high percentage of them middle and 3 class it still stirs something in me when im reminded of that stati say hats off to james cameron for having the courage to even attempt this extremely expensive film i guess someone believed it could a success both at the boxoffice and in theatres18 billion  someone liked it,sad
spoilers   spoilers i know a lot of people see this movie as a joke but i absolutely loved it although it was my favourite movie for a long time but isnt anymore it is still the only movie ive ever seen that has the ability to reduce me to tears every time the music is beautiful and haunting  and possibly one of the best things about the movie  but the acting and romance is equally good ok so not all the acting is good but i definitely think leonardo was the best actor kate was just as good  if you can set aside her dodgy american accent maybe the plot is predictable and cliched but there is just something special about this movie  and im sure many others will agree as well there is a great chemistry between the two main leads and they are lovely to watch as their characters fall in love with each other billy zane plays a convincing villain though im not sure about his scary hairline and frances fisher is quite good as roses mother however one of my favourite characters was thomas andrews victor garber and i found it very sad when spoiler he says goodbye to rose and you realise hes going to stay and go down with the ship i found the ending heartbreaking and it took me a few days to stop thinking about it i know there are many mistakes and historical inaccuracies but at the end of the day it was intended to be a romance first and foremost and then a drama and an action movie i have nothing against those who prefer a night to remember  and i know its a lot more accurate  but the positives definitely outweigh the negatives in this movie and as far as the mistakes go any epic containing special effects is bound to have mistakes and if you can move past the odd continuity shot and sun setting on the wrong side of the ship you can appreciate the movie for what it is  a touching love story that does what its supposed to do 810,sad
this is a beautiful sad movie  people often say that it is cheesy and corny but i think that is is beautiful and moving  the acting is quite good at least on kate winslets part and most supporting actors  leonardo dicaprios performance is not exactly to be applauded unlike his performances in romeo and juliet and marvins room  but hes not terrible overall this is a fabulous movie that i watch at least once a month whenever i want to cry and imagine i could possibly fall in love someday,sad
go and look at the worldwide gross top movies of all time there is a reason why has nearly double the takings of the other movies it isnt sfx it isnt leo there are other movies with leo and other movies with sfx for years until 1997 any movie taking the box office alltime crown pushed out a little bit blasted the other movies apart the reason is no 1 is because it is a great film of course it has flaws like any other movie but when you take 18 billion you must have got almost everything righteveryone thought that harry potter would knock off no 1 it didnt even get close hp had a huge established following and great special effects but the film was rubbish it will take a truly great film with mass appeal and visually beautiful to ever dethrone either that or wait until inflation does the jobso go and put your leojealousy away after all his career has hardly been that good since only catch me if you can has had been any goodand watch this film again you will enjoy it and realise that it is a great movie,sad
this is the movie of the 90si cried as jack hung on in the freezing waters of the atlantic how can you honestly say that this doesnt bring one tear to your eyethe forbidden romance of jack and rose got our hearts pumping we danced along to the lower class funthe title explains it all it broke barriers brought in crowds and got nominations all in 1 weekit cost a fortune alsoit was the forgotten era and the movie shed some light to the 20s,sad
i remember when i watched back 1n 19971998 i had watch it for about 6 or 5 times in the theater and its not just me because everybody does being the holder of the world record for the most successful film ever made and winning 11 oscar crafted it became a true classic no one will ever forget easily to jack dawson and rose dewitt bukater three days romance that ended with tragedy  even tough many critics said that was nothing except a piece of shallowly and clich crab but james cameron proves that he could manage a wonderful tale of love and one of the most disastrous event that ever happen became one in a magnificent visualization story tellingthe chemistry between leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet is so strong like they are really meant to be lover the romance is thrilling the action is heartpounding and the fx is first class i barely can find any flaws on it 1010,sad
was that i was more interested in the historical aspect of what had happened to the since i was 10 the love story was not a factor to me in seeing the movie but i could pick out with great clarity the historical errors such as the one between robert hitchens and molly brown in the lifeboat there was no way that the molly brown that we knew would have sit down and not taken action on her own also the last time we saw john jacob astor was near the grand stair case leading one to believe this is where he died he was actually hit with the falling smoke stack that we saw hit a third class passenger the number of musicians were cut down from 8 to 5 i believe it was and the burning question in my mind is where was the californian that sat about 10 miles away and didnt do a thing to help these people all i remember seeing was the rescuing ship the carpathia there is controversy to this day as to whether william murdock committed suicide and since his body was never found we will never know also there is controversy as to whether any passengers that were out of hand were shot by him or anyone else about the best i can say for the characters of cal and ruth were that they showed with great clarity the attitude of the first class passengers towards the lower class of people but on the real jack dawson would not have been allowed to roam the whole ship nor make several contacts with builder thomas andrews but i do have to say that they opening underwater shots of the sunken were great as for jack and rose i believe had james cameron dug deep enough he could have found a ship romance that he could have used for the movie and it be a real romance of course it probably would not have crossed class lines,sad
considering is a truly hollywoodesque movie one is not the least bit surprised at the amount of historical inaccuracy present  regardless of these various and numerable mistakes still proves to be a highly enjoyable and moving film  kate winslet and leonardo dicaprio perform well as the main characters of a love story backdropped by the sailing of the doomed vessel  kathy bates is excellent as the unsinkable molly brown and frances fisher performs well as the arrogant lovetohate mother of winslets characterthe special effects including a near lifesize replica of the ship are great  the film would be enjoyable to watch simply to see the magnificence of the oceanliner itself  the soundtrack to this film is brilliant as well,sad
thought to be the most popular motion picture of all time by many this film is probably also the most hated director james cameron created an epic disaster story combined with a sloppily put together love story on the illfated unsinkable rms we all knew the story of so why did we all bother to go see it we were curious about the events leading up to the disaster and im sure there were many who were interested in seeing the stupid love storyjames cameron wanted to make a love story he said so himself but what he should have done was create a love story and only a love story but no he decided to combine his romance tale with the tragic story of as soon as the iceberg hits the story becomes just like an actionadventure movie with a little bit of love thrown in and cameron also dragged his stupid romance out for almost two hours before the real reason people went to see this movie happened we all wanted a great movie about the story of not a love story how this film garnered so many damn academy awards is beyond me i mean a couple would have been understandable but won almost all of the awards and i aint kidding when i say allthe cast was also allstar leonardo dicaprio if i was cameron i would have gotten someone else to play that part as no one likes dicapriothis probably discouraged many people from seeing this film kate winslet billy zane kathy bates frances fisher bernard hill david warner victor garber bill paxton danny nuccijonathan hyde bernard fox and jason barrey lead the way in probably the biggest hit of all timeand the biggest flop gets 35,sad
is definitely a great movie incredible visualsound effects fantastic directing art direction costumes etc however for this movie to win eleven oscars and be the topgrossing movie in history i think thats crap this wasnt that good first of all the movie had terrible dialogue kate winslet overracted badly and said her lines so unbelievably annoying the movie was also way too sappy and corny i know its a love story but if youre going to make a movie that you know is going to be an international hit then you should make it so it appeals to all audiences i like the fact that the movie was a mix of all genres though it had its romance humor drama etc it even had its thrillersuspense effect around the last hour but the movie couldve been a whole lot better it got way too much acclaim than it deserved all in all i think that is great but not excellent it deserved its share of oscars but not the amount it got it deserved to be really successful at the box office but definitely not the highestgrossing ever i recommend it to everybody but i wouldnt expect an unbelievable perfect toogoodtobetrue film like its been displayed to be thank you 7510 stars,sad
  the tale of the unfortunate unsinkable ship the tale of love that became unsinkablethe direction of james cameron also writer of also director terminator2 and aliens gives an everlasting effect to the legend of tough most of the people would rather fancy that the movie is unacceptably long and so did i sitting half an hour into the movie but then the next i think i knew was that the 314 hrs were already over i would say that the movie was extremely well paced providing the viewer with the exact of everything the magic the love the pain the tragedy the wealth the poor sincerity faithfulness  everythingthis movie received the highest ever box office collections in world cinema history i would add that no doubt the movie was good enough to force the viewer to watch again but the credit for pulling the masses into the theater for the first time goes to the voice of celine dion and the composition of james horner the classic my heart will go ontough it would have been better had the movie been shorter but if they ask me to reedit this movie i think i will only end up adding another half an hour to the movie because it is not just a movie but a euphoria a magical experience that i will never want to leave its like living in alices wonderland leading to the desire of having a loving and a sincere and of course beautiful rose of your ownit is hard to believe that this masterpiece cannot find its place in imdb 250 ratings my ratings for the movie are 1010 and thats because there wasnt an option for more than that,sad
first let me tell you that this isnt a terrible moviebut it surely did not deserve all the credit it got11 academy awards is a bit too much5 would have been enoughif people love this movie thats cool but the academy is supposed to uphold and respect artdont add me in the list of leo haters because i think he is a great actorevery actor makes a few mistakes,sad
what a fantastic epic of a movie the drama romance and that ship this movie is the ultimate tier jerker every one i know has seen it and regardless if it was a male of female all admitted to shedding a few to this movie the score for the movie which is composed by james honer is so haunting its makes the hairs on my neck stand up is truly the greatest film of all time and deserves that no 1 spot,sad
wow  this movie deserves every single one of its oscar awards  the acting directing modeling of the ship ect  excellent  if you havent seen this movie  i had long ago but didnt have the time to post a comment shame on you  this has got to be one of the movies people will watch in the next generations,sad
ive seen this film recently and without a doubt i can say that these four hours it was shown in polish tv so interrupted by ads were the biggest waste of time in my life  i cant understand why it was given 12 oscar awards  was the academy bribed  were they all on dope while watching it obviously the ship itself is great  the sinking looks authentic  even the whole idea of the film and romantic plot is not bad  but this is just 20 per cent of every movie  the rest is just awful  first of all bad acting di caprio and winslett are the most annoying pair in history  this toxic mixture of free artist and spoiled brat made me seasick  another thing is the dialogue  i havent heard such a nonsense in my entire life  it was just hilarious  another problem is that every character is black or white either good or bad  nobody seems to be developing  changing  showing various shades of their personality  and last but not least cameron lack the judgement of the mood  i mean that in some scenes i was drowning in pathos  and in others when something serious is needed he spoils everything with some pseudofunny dialogue or situation the worst in it is the final scene when the old rose dies and her soul goes back on the ship where shes welcomed by the rest of the dead passengers  and after kissing jack everyone is applauding  i wondered where was caledon hockley if he committed suicide in 1929 he must have been with the others  and if so was he applauding with them  all in all give me half of camerons budget and without a doubt you will be given a masterpiece not a crap like this one ,sad
this movie was too long and drawn out it was unrealistic with bad acting on leonardo dicaprios and kate winslets part  i also found the dialog cheesy im the king of the world it was exceedingly hard to sit through let alone take seriously and as a result im forced to give it a 1,sad
if only james cameron could write dialogue  this is a wellproduced fictionalization of the and her maiden voyage with all the historical details just right well except for some really minor stuff   the romantic story overlaying it all lends poignancy and drew in the crowds in record numbers  the performances are by and large goodtoexcellent except for leonardo dicaprio who did much better in his earlier movies up to and including the quick and the dead and billy zane whos never been able to do more than look like a movie starcameron is a great director of action and a good visual story teller  too bad hes such a control freak he ought to allow someone to rewrite all his dialogue so that it sounds like humans talking not t1000s i give this a five only because the seven its currently averaged at is too high,sad
did anyone else read the script my god what was the academy thinking in one of the best years in film history they gove this the best picture it should be noted that this is one of the most expensive movies of alltime and that even though it had a great set the acting is pathetic for 200 million dollars they could have got a decent cast and then there is gloria stewart she made me want to cry because i paid eight bucks to see her on film this is a one demensional movie that at its very best should have won maybe two awards and pull down a boxoffice of like 200 million three hours plus is painfully long for this kind of film dear god i wanted to jump too,sad
while i am sure that many of the negative reviews this movie has received are sincerely meant i cant resist adding that i think has suffered more or less unfairly from its tremendous boxoffice success  it is always hard to like a winner and this makes it  difficult to give this film both overrated by some and underrated by others a fair assessment i can only say that i feel that for all its obvious shortcomings is an exceptional film  at roughly threehours of running time the movie never feels long and is never dull  it is both funny and genuinely moving by turns  whether intentionally or not james cameron has endowed the characters and situations in this film with a simplicity and a monumental resonance worthy of a great nineteenthcentury melodrama  while it is not one of the greatest films of all time is nevertheless an magnificent production well worth repeated viewings,sad
i must be one of the few people who didnt want to see this movie in a theatre because i didnt believe the hype hype usually is a bad thing as proven recently with the disappointing road to perdition but yesterday i decided to give the a chance because i had nothing better to doi have to say that the movie wasnt as bad as i had expected it to be but it certainly will never gain a spot in my top ten of alltime favorite moviesi liked the cinematography though not the best in a movie and the soundtrack except for that celine dion song a lot the acting was okay and sometimes i was even touched by the not so surprising story we all know that the boat will sinkall in all its a not too bad movie that you can see if you have a lot of time and nothing better to do 6 out of 10,sad
i was 16 when this movie came out and i saw it once with a friend of mine the plot was fully cliched and it could have been shorter tell you the truth but no it dragged on and sorry to say i want my 3 hours back i remember a couple of people that were in my classes who went and saw this movie 6 times because they were so obessed with it this movie had great cinematoghapy and the make artists did great kate winslet was good in this movie was leo dicaprio should have not been cast in this movie hes not that much of a great actor to carry a movie like this this movie is good seeing once if you love sappy love stories and i still dont understand why it was nominated for so many oscars,sad
anyway i liked this movie it was pretty cool it had outstanding special effects nice love story outstanding score nice song good performances fantasticyet somewhat predictable ending and a naked kate winslet3out of 4stars,sad
goes down in history forgive the wording as one of the most overrated movies of all time  the fact that leo is in it and what effect that has on imdb voters opinions is neither here nor there the movie just stunk the acting is mediocre the direction secondrate and the special effects who cares about special effects these days not me for one story isnt everything and i know that dialogue cinematography lighting art direction etc should all be taken into account but when a story is this infantile its easy to overlook these aspects of the picture and i think thats where falls short its hard to give any movie a fair rating when its given this much hype but all hype aside and all prejudice aside i would honestly give this picture a 4 out of ten and thats being kind for fear of being labeled as a leohater,sad
i am aghast at the comments of others on this site about  a sense of outright hatred spews forth  finally one commenter admits it leonardo dicaprio was in it and therefore the imdb ratings for the movie were doomed  i have been to a couple of chatrooms where these teenagers go on and on about their hatred for leonardo dicaprio a very personal hatred as if they know him now go to the imdb vote breakdown  notice that a very strange thing happens  the most votes are 10s then 9s then 8s etc  except that a very large number  107 of the voters  gave it a 1 rating really no matter how much fault anyone may find with the movie it is by no means a 1 thats ridiculous  and it is done by the dicaprio haters in order to sink the overall rating of the movie which at 70 still isnt bad and can you imagine how much higher it would be if the 107 voted with their heads and not their hatefilled hearts oh yes i know that some of you will say that james camerons script wasnt that good or that he got some details wrong blah blah blah but the 107 is all about leo  nothing to do with cameron or realityjust to let you know  i am a 60yearold man and i found the movie to be one of the most touching and spectacular that i have ever seen  i love it i have seen it multiple times and the final scene of the lovers in the ocean makes me tear up every time as for dicaprio he has a bad reputation for his temperment as does russell crowe and many others but dicaprios acting has always been first rate and is no exception  just see this boys life and whats eating gilbert grape  no second rate actor can do what he did in these films in short lets not count on imdb voters as a guide for the upcoming gangs of new york  no doubt the leohaters will be out in force dragging down its ratings tooone question to the 107  what horrible thing did this guy dicaprio do to you personally,sad
as a canadiani should be cheering for the canadian director james cameron james for sure is a better writer than a director i have seen every james cameron movieandat bestthey are large budget b movies what i find careless about this movieis that it won as many oscars as william wylers benhur thatis an insult and im quite sure willey is rolling in his graveonly redeeming factor is timing andour morbid preoccupation with disasters this story has been told in many movieswhich were better directedwith much lower budgets hellwith the budget cameron haded wood jrcould have done betterroger cormanthe notorious cheapskate with that budget would have probably made it betterjames stick with arnieand you may do a movie about governors that ego you developed after the movie was making zillions does not putyou in the same league as spielbergmore like tobe hooper,sad
yes another film joins my 610 club  my complaints werent the romance itself winslett and even dicaprio who i loathe btw give good performances  there are some scenes however that take away from the flickwhen the film came out didnt see it in theaters i was a buff  this film caused a lot of disinformatia in the gullible audiences who thought that in seeing a fictionalized romance there were being present fact  in the months after the movie i spent minutes of my life explaining the inaccuracies to not neccessarily unwilling people who believed jack and rose were real etc  most of the supporting actors are good jonathan hyde is one of my favs but its not exceptionalproblems  there are many unnecessary scenes  the obligatory sex scene was moronic and stupid  the scene where jack and rose meet at the stern of the boat  ick  i did like the for the most part historically accurate dialogue between the crew and real passengers esp ben gugenheim  there was historical inaccuracies obviously the number of watertight compartments punctured by the iceberg the number of men officer murdoch actually shot though this can be disputed  but nothing that cant be overlookedwhat is bad however is the screenplay  regardless of how talented the actors are including bill paxton hyde kathy bates frances fisher and david warner  they cant save the exceptionally soggy screenplay  it was cliche it was boring it was    blech   its harder to put this into words than it would seem  overrated but enjoyablesix stars,sad
was a complete turn from james cameron already known as a great director with such films as terminator terminator 2 aliens the abyss etc cameron strayed from the genre that he had done so well with and turned to romance the problem is that while fared as a blockbuster cameron alienated his dear fans the movie features a story weaved well by cameron but the point left some disturbed dialogue wasnt good but like george lucas cameron can get away with that setting this story on the helps to manipulate the audience and turn some buff jocks into cry babies others however feel that the film was cheap and dirty using a tragedy to create a story that wasnt at the heart of the true event while i could see why some loved this film i can also realize the latter further movies using strong love themes to carry tragic historical films such as pearl harbor are now going under more scrutiny and disregard overall this is a hit or miss movie cameron certainly knows how to grasp an audience but many will view this flick as trash,sad
i am always suprised when people hate movies that i love so now  its  my turn to bite back first of all i would say this film  isnt bad but it certainly isnt great its really  a  love  story  using  the   as an  impressive  backdrop to the romance the fact the ship sinks is almost incidental to the two star crossed lovers and is used as a mechanism to produce the touching if somewhat schmaltzy ending really this is no better than  love  story with ryan o neal which is also a reasonable  but not great film the really  impressive  thing  is the  special effects which render a stunning  vision of  the   visually  this  film  was a treat but no  substance  to  hold  up  this wreck 5 out of ten,sad
excellent work by cameron he always does it the right way the movie has all the ingredients that an all out film should have there is something there for most of us to see it is a great experience and i hope to se more of its caliber from cameron in the future,sad
the best love story of all time timeless in all aspects and one of the most accurate movies ive seen aaaaaaa  a definate 10 kate winslet and leonardo dicaprio are both excellent and seem to be so accurate on their characters anyone that loves romantic movies should see this,sad
many people dont like this movieand for the wrong reasons mostly because of the sappy love storybut you should appreciate the history of it all when i first heard about this film i never saw a preview so i didnt know what to expect i thought it was more along the lines of schindlers listwhere they show several characters before the disaster i didnt even know the leonardo dicaprio was in the film once i saw that i knew the film was doomed for bad comments i agree with others that the love story was over the top but the movie is a great movie and heres why spoiler its based on true events those kind of films always are good second its historical correct with costumes society even the silverware is correct third is portrayed beautifully how people would acted in that situation and through out the film showed how much it mattered what class you fall in when you watch first class lock the third class up in the sinking ship just so they could ensure a seat on a life boat you are sick to your stomach how in such a cataclysmic situation can you kill so easily its makes you disgusted to be human when you see such raw instinct take over good judgment i think people should appreciate this movie for what is important the whole love story is to give it personal character to help you feel for these people and hey its a movie movies are for entertainment which is exactly what it did 10 out of 10 from this critic,sad
ok let me get something straight i do not regard to be a masterpiece however considering that this movie rates 70 here in imdb and lord of the rings is third in imdb last time i checked there is something really wrong is not as bad as many of the reviewers are trying to make it the soundtrack is well done the acting is good at that particular time the movie effects are also pretty good the movie do appeal to the audiences emotions mostly duing the second half of the movie i do feel for the characters in the movie even if they are not that believable overall i think this movie deserves 7510 and besides i think at least this movie is in the same level as lotr which is also worth a 7110,sad
some people today especially guys pretend they dont like but they must be lying for is a classic i cry every time i watch it the actors eloquently portray the bravery fear and other emotions that went on that dreadful night,sad
yes i was a teenage girl when came out but i had trouble seeing what all the fuss was about it was good wellacted movie but beyond all the glitter its nothing more than perhaps above average winning best picture was highway robbery yes i recommend seeing it however its not the greatest movie of all time,sad
to start with is a good movie  its not phenomenal but its not junk either  the acting especially from dicaprio is not the best i have seen but kate winslet makes up for that as does the plotlines of which there are manyfor those of you who pan this movie a kate winslet was not by any means overweight  even if she was that is not a reason to pan a movie  the lead actresss weight is not the focal point of an entire 3 12 hour plus production b if you dislike the romance there is historical value  if not there is action and also some special effectssubtle moments in this movie really give it its value  the shots of the older couple on the bed as water floods the cabin and the shot of the irish mother calming her children as the ship is sinking are two of the most pivotal moments in the entire production  also the father grabbing his little boy and going the wrong way after jack tried to save him is a moving shot as is when rose watches a girl about her age cling desperately to the railing only to lose her grip and tumble into the atlantic  for some reason seeing trudy roses maid slip and die was also moving  the score thanks to james horner is beautiful  victor garber plays an excellent mr andrews  gloria stuart is underrated as the older rose she gives a wonderful performancei admit it is a predictable movie  how can it not be when its about the  the lovers are conveniently placed throughout the movie and everything falls into place with few exceptionshowever this is a good movie with something for everyone  a 910,sad
this movie was veryveryvery goodit is a romantic movie to watch when u are on a dateleonardo dicaprio and kate winslet were very good in this moviekate winslet looked beautiful and leonardo dicaprio was at his hottestif u havent seen this yet u better rent or buy it because everybody needs to see it at least onceit was very sad at the endwhen i saw it in theatres i cried the last hour of the moviemy heart will go on was an excellant love song for that movieceline dion has a beautiful voicethis movie is in my top 10im sure its in everybody elses top 10 of all time too,sad
it seems like nobody thinks this movie is good its either this is the greatest movie that ever was or ever will be made or its you mean somebody actually paid real money to make this trash to me its a decent movie the love story leading us all through it is hokey and its far too long but it is captivating winslet was decent leo was marginal and zane was way over the top  could any real person actually be that annoying the effects were mostly good and occasionally stunning overall it wasnt a bad flick had cameron put half the effort into the romance story and the characters that he put into the effects it might have earned its 11 oscars on the other hand you have to hand it to him for being smart enough to know that there are millions of women out there thatll drag their boyfriends and husbands out over and over to see the charming and handsome dicaprio drown for the love of a woman and husbands and boyfriends that are secretly not complaining about having another look at winslet or the cool fx,sad
truly unsinkable masterpiecesit was an unsinkable ship it was one of the largest of its time and a wonder to the eye the tragedy of will be a part of history forever to educate us about this tragedy james cameron directed his version of in 1997 camerons voyage is seen through of the eyes of a 101yearold lady who tells her tale of what happened rose kate winslet is a young welltodo passenger trapped by her up bringing in a world with nothing but meaningless conversations parties and money feeling that there is no other way out rose flees to the back of the ship to end her life however she meets jack jack is leonardo dicaprio a third class passenger who ironically wins his ticket on in a poker game this couple meets and falls in love at first sight most of the movie is based on the love that jack and rose share and their problems which they endure along the way rose is engaged to a rich and powerful man by the name of cal hockley she feels trapped with the engagement and with the wedding plans well on the way she struggles to find her true feelings and the courage to desert her mother for her own happiness james cameron tells this unforgettable love story this unsinkable movie rose to the top and was nominated for fourteen academy awards moviegoers around the world knew the outcome of the film but still made this movie 1 for 1997 the powerful love story stole the interest of all people young and old leaving the theaters with tears in their eyes moviegoers were amazed at the realities of what happened that night this movie was not only an outstanding masterpiece for script color costumes but also for its cast line up this movie touched the hearts of many leaving them watching the movie over and over,sad
possibly one of the most overrated films of all time mind you i am not a hater i saw the movie and i cried and was moved the sinking scene was heartbreaking however for all the hype the movie isnt that high quality a sadly cliched story subpar acting historical inaccuracies and gratuitous use of plot devices is hidden under beautiful scenery costumes and great special effects its your depressingly average story of rich girl meets poor guy runs off parents disapprove evil boyfriend lurks in background quite possibly the best proof of the weak script is the fact that as you watch the boat sink and as all the characters fates come together it is not jack and rose your heart goes out to but rather the random extras running around falling off of things and being trapped insidee the boat in this to some degree there was success one of the most powerful images in the movie is an old couple just lying on their bed while water floods in beneath them again this movie isnt awful its actually pretty good but it certainly didnt deserve the eight million academy awards it recieved costumes yes special effects sound editing sure it was all very well puttogether but in the categories of character and plot where it matters most the movie falls apart even the more recent pearl harbor also hailed for its messy plot is wellacted and powerful and you at least like the characters the powerful performances hold it together next time youre at the video store id reccomend pearl harbor over any time however still is not to be missed it does have its good points points which make it very much worth seeingi rate a seven out of ten,sad
why does everyone hate this wonderful movie sofor it to make over a billion dollarslots of people had to see itthen they turn around and say its shiti dont understand iti didnt care for leonardo dicaprio before i sawbut i came away convinced that hes a pretty good actor after alljames cameron did a fantastic job and deserves his directing oscarjames horners score was magnificent and the beautiful song beautifully sung by todaypremier vocalist celine dionnow a lot of people dumped on kate winslet not because of her acting chopsmost agreed she gave  a terrific performancethey kept referring to her as fatkate is a wonderfully voluptuouscurvy andyessexy womani guess if youre not a chickenlegged anorexic stick firgure like calista flockhartyoure not a beautiful woman these daysid rather see kate naked than calista any day of the week i got ped a joan rivers because she said similar things on oscar nighti guess joan has a complex because kates bust is so much bigger than hersanyway a few words about another performenrgloria stuartshe gave a truly marvelous performanceeespecially after being retired so longminor spoilerher speech about the fifteen hundred who went into the water and the 705 in the boats waiting for an absolution that would never come is one of the single best secnes ive ever seen in a movieperiodkudos to the other cast members as wellespecially billy zane and kathy bates 10 out of 10,sad
what can i say about camerons that hasnt already been said  i watched it originally against my will to please my wife and was blown away  i had been led to expect yet another britbashing epic where the wicked aristocrats trample the poor working class  thats how it had been presented to me  instead i found a film that portrayed clearly accurately and most importantly with balance the world of the early twentieth century with its vast contrasts between haves and havenotsmany have complained about the score or about cline dions rendering of the theme song  personally i believe that the score was as near perfect as any movie score can be  and if you dont happen to like cline dion well thats your problem  i was a cline fan back before she ever learned english and i still am  i still find her version of the heart will go on minus all the crummy dj remixes to be absolutely magical especially from the top of the las vegas eiffel tower looking down on the bellagio fountain balletand yes five years later the film still enchants and impresses  every time i watch it im overwhelmed by the incredible attention to detail the breadth and depth of the screenplay the amazing special effects  i could wish that cameron had eliminated the hokey scene with jack handcuffed to the pipe but apart from that theres nothing i would add to or take away from this movie  if time has jaded your tastes to the point where you can no longer appreciate it i feel sorry for you  if maturity has robbed you of the ability to express your appreciation of it then shame on you  the mona lisa is a magnificent work of art no matter how old it gets or you get  and so is camerons,sad
i just cried and cried and cried and cried it was so romantic and moving yes and that lovely lovely lovely theme music it is mozartian every time i hear it in a lift or in a bar it makes me weep my life will never be the samejames cameron you are the shakespeare of the cinema,sad
and gone with the wind have much in common  both were enormous sprawling troubled productions and both dealt with actual historical events but their place in history is based more on their popculture influence than on their presentation of these events they both have some extraordinarily beautiful sequences yet both are hampered by clunky dialogue and some painfully inept performances billy zane would have looked right at home in a dinner theater production with all of his histrionics and it has been well documented that their creators in the case of gwtw that would be producer selznick not any of the five or more directors were obssessed with their respective creations and certainly each consumed tremendous amounts of money though their earnings seemed to justify the expenditures but it begs the questionwhat is the morality of spending so much200m when there is so much actual need in the world oh well at least didnt have those godawful southern accents like gwtw news flash to hollywoodnobody in the known universe talks that way,sad
how it won 11 oscars is beyond me the original a night to remember shot by geofrey unsworth is far superior in its style and story james cameron the biggest plagurist of our time just uses cgi effects to take away the soreness of a bad film he portrays real life characters as villians without doing his research just to rewrite it the way he thinks it happened as seinfeld and george said so that old ladys just a liar and a bit of a floozy too damn right,sad
people get mad when they find that their girlfriends have seen this movie 10 times and they come here give it bad ratings to get even  these same people make lord of the rings the most boring movie of all time the 3rd best movie shame i just noticed that is not even in the 100 best movies list  if you dont like the romance the people getting crushed will keep you on the edge of your seat dont like violence the story will keep you interested  my point is that it has something for all tastes and a movie like that deserves more credit than 70  and who ever voted 10 for lord of the rings has my pitty,sad
there has never been a film that speaks to so many different age groups as  a few bad lines of dialogue do not ruin this work of art  the film can be viewed on three different levels  there is the the commercial love story and the formula epic disaster  most viewers tend to deal with camerons masterwork from these perspectives  but there is a third deeper level that is actually responsible for the films wide appeal it is a cynical myth that communicates only to teenage girls  is at bottom a metaphorical telling of the workings of human emotional experience trapped in space yet set free through time  ive written three detailed cyber essays on this wonderful film  please contact me if youre interested in reading more of my analysis,sad
teenage girls spent an entire summer watching this movie people flocked to it in unprecedented numbers the academy of motion pictures completely lost its head and awarded it best picture all for a film that was little more than a poorlywritten harlequin romance set on the greatest ship to never finish one voyagethis film could have been improved in so many ways1 punt the insipid fictional love story and focus on the reallife characters the supporting cast playing the actual people on board the was on the whole a much better group of actors than the ones in the fictional love story 2 have somebody anybody else play the role of jack matt damon would have been good joaquin phoenix would have been better but dicaprio was a huge mistake3 if dicaprio is really a must have him and billy zane switch roles zane is much better suited to the romantic lead role and dicaprio would have been perfect as an unlikeable selfabsorbed fop4 the captain should have been portrayed more as he was in real life not as the confused incompetent geezer the movie makes him out to be witness reports say that captain smith acted heroically and with honor it is a disservice to his memory to portray him as this film doesafter all this i must admit that i did kind of like this movie i just dont understand all the fuss over it and i really dont understand why it won the best picture oscar this is a good film but it is far from being a great film,sad
is the neverending story of jack dawson leonardo decaprio a wicked godless and decidedly catty gambler determined to kill his way into bed with rose bukater kate winslet  when the ship they are voyaging on tragically sinks during the middle of their voyage killing thousands of innocent people in one of the worlds most tragic tragedies hilarious hijinks ensuejack dawson gambles and wins tickets onto the and remarks upon how lucky he is  it is here that he meets rose  jack saves her life they fall in love jack remarks upon how lucky he is  jack meets all the rich people in the whole wide world some like him some dont he remarks upon how lucky he is  jack draws rose naked then proceeds to americanize her by having passionless and unprotected sex with her in the back of a car then jack gets arrested and the boat sinks and he finds himself drowning in the moderately chilly atlantic ocean our snotsiclecovered hero proceeds to tell rose all this stuff about love and life which is valuable information to hear from a 2024 year old penniless vagabond who is about to freeze drown and die of melodrama in the north atlantic ocean  rose considers dying with jack lets jack die then proceeds to have a series of zany and altogether wonderful adventures through the rest of her fabulously comfortable days on earth  when meditating on her dead lover she shrugs and says wellpausei guess i liked himalthough is fraught with historical inaccuracies the real can still be viewed today at dock in londons docklands i think that the reason this movie received unanimously negative reviews is because of the absolutely atrocious performance from billy zane in the role of caledon cal hockley covered in makeup that makes him look like an escapee from the set of to wong foo thanks for everything julie newmar zane spends his time throughout the movie saying bizarre and disturbing things then looking to the left while shuffling away  let me tell you his acting is excruciating  it is so horrible that local legend has it that stevie wonder said upon exiting the premiere i wish i had eyes that i could stab outreally excruciating stuff avoid at all costs,sad
great special effects mediocre romance capable cast suffering through poor dialogue does not nearly live up the the hype  in short far and away the most overrated movie i have ever seen  the made for tv movie had a better written and acted love story  it is a barely above average movie that is worth seeing but no great movie,sad
okay people that are criticizing about how james cameron just decided to make a movie about one of the most historic events in time and add a love story to it  i read an interview with james cameron  he wanted to make a movie about the titianic and show how grand and sad its story was  the only way he could do this however was to have it as a romance movie though its not completely a romance movie  so there you go stop making rude comments about it  i am a huge fan the ship so i know a lot about it  i think that the makers of this movie were pretty truthful to the ship  people this is one of those rare movies where it has everything  action humor romance its educational and just great  i really do enjoy watching this movie and according to the academy awards a whole lot of other people do also even though not a lot of people enjoyed the english patient  but this is a excellent movie  watch it,sad
this is a moderately entertaining film but overlong and certainly not deserving of multiple oscars ive found that on video its best watched in several sessions i was an early fan of james cameron and am depressed to see the extent that success has led him to excess as in the abyss the directors selfimportance seems to radiate from the screenim surprised at how few people comment on the music to me it is the most trite tacky and clumsy part of the whole thing whenever we hear the theme that goes with the horrible song the heart will go on  which is often  whatever mood james cameron has managed to create is destroyed this is particularly grating towards the end i found this films music score particularly disappointing bearing in mind that james horner has written some excellent film scores,sad
unlike most pg13 films was watchable perhaps it was the setting of april 1912 instead of april 1997 although you know how it turns out it was watchable during its first half the movie begins in the present in which the worst scenes take place mainly because bill paxton is in it a man ive hated since seeing him in twister and his partner played by someone i cant recall they are oceanographers who meet with old rose played by gloria stuart old rose was a survivor of the sinking ship and she tells them the story only here the movie is awful we get that dreaded pg13 talk read other reviews of mine for the descriptionto make it short we get the story of rich teen girl meeting up with the dashing poor boy who fall in love despite the clashes of stature we get the usual fluff king of the world etc but because its set in an earlier time frame its not as badthen all hell breaks loose the hits the iceberg and slowly sinks here the movie becomes an action film as rose and jack played by leonardo try to get off the ship and onto a life vessel here the sfx are brilliant they recreate a ship going down in spades although it would have been nice to have some fish floating around in the boat as the ocean started pouring inadmittedly the movie does its job and i guess cameron deserved his oscar and deserved to be called best movie of 1997 still this could have been better maybe the next remake will rectify it after all bill paxton or music sung by celine dion wont be a part of it,sad
i went to looking to be bowled over by the special effects sets costumes etc and wasnt disappointed the scene showing the ship leaving the dock looked so real i was truly taken by the visual splendor on the screen i also knew going in that the story and cast would be a bit of a disappointment but i never expected the total letdown of those aspects of the film the sappiness of the love story was just plain putrid and unworthy of the grand setting that was the the portrayal of evil fiance by billy zane was one of the most ridiculous performances ive seen in years if he had a moustache he would have been twisting it like snidely whiplash and beware of the little spoiler here the scene in which he chases jack and shoots at him all while thousands are dying around them had me laughing with the cruel absurdity of it all earning me a stiff elbow in the ribs from my wife this film is proof that popularity in no way equals quality,sad
is one of the best films ever made it contains stunning performances by leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet there are many scenes in this picture that make you want to cry particularly the scene where rose says shell never let go of jack forever it is one of the most touching scenes in the history of american cinema and is truly a classic among classics it ranks as james camerons best film to date and will continue to be one of my favorite films the winner of 11 academy awards including best picture of 1997 truly ranks among classic films such as gone with the wind and the godfather,sad
standard covering spoiler warning just in case like many other films i have seen and then read the imdb comments for many seem to either love it or hate it although in this film the extremes are not as vivid  i happen to for this movie fit in the former category  i saw it five times in theaters most with excellent theater sound and picture quality but if you want to really see it you have to have seen it in all its glory on an imax screen with the surround sound branson mo aug 1998  that was a cinematic experiencei have been interested in the story since 1994 and i never tire of learning or talking about it  i more or less fell over myself and my parents to get to it in its first ten days  on december 27 1997 i was not disappointedthe cg work with the ship is spectacular especially the flyby with the water and the smoke  that takes a lot of work and it was pulled off nicely  not to be outdone by that the cg work in the sinking phase of the movie was great too  give the hand to digital domain  especially that guy that hits the propeller  another big hand goes to the art and set departments  can other historical movies claim to order the same carpet and lifeboat davits as those of the original  lots of little things add up although there were as many equally little things that were missed  this movie certainly has the biggest goofs page ive seen but more on that lateras a male i certainly am not one of those who went to see it for leo andor any part of a love story  however it does provide an effective vehicle however flawed you wish to claim it for connecting the present to the past and showing all aspects of the ship  the love story is not the central issue  the story of the ship and the hope glory and tragedy in it is what youre looking for  the story serves to get you from first class to third from the forepeak although passengers didnt go there to the stern and the boiler rooms to the bridge  as far as dicaprio and winslet themselves well i dont have enough acting experience to be declarative on thatthe interplay with the historical figures is done well for the most part some of us more than others may know exactly who is being discussed or referred to with their historical context eg colonel gracie with the women he was helping when rose and jack come out of the second class stairs getting to know mr andrews was a good thing to put in  of course you have to realize that the cast of characters during the dinner scene although all real people except for rose ruth jack and cal would most likely never have dined together  however it does serve the purpose of putting the fictional characters in with historythis film is not without its errors  i mean check out the goofs page many are your runofthemill continuity errors but others are legitimate factual errors that despite the best efforts of cameron and crew happen a film based on a true story with photographic and witness records not to mention a couple volumes of senate testimony will do that those who are not at least moderate scholars wont catch most of themgoofs particularly grating to this buff are astor at the grand staircase at 215 he was crushed by the funnel molly brown being called molly before the sinking the inordinate amount of women on collapsible a there was one rosa abbott and the brownhitchens standoff which brown actually won and did get the women to row  on a side note to that though you will notice in boat 6 both frederick fleet and only one firstclass man who was ordered into it because he was a yachtsman and they only had one seaman on board thats a historical detail not lost on methe soundtrack is worth every note played on it  i think the movie as a whole earned every oscar it got andbut was rightfully denied the ones it did not  the fifteen minutes that begin when the band finishes playing are in my opinion one of the if not the best fifteenminute sequences in movie history  but some may not say that doesnt mean much because there are a lot better fiveminute sequences out there  to each his or her own anyone wondering why this movie didnt hit the afi 100 by the way its because voting was cut off at movies made in 1996 and earlier  obviously a december 1997 release doesnt make the cutif you want to see some of the moreknown deleted scenes and some of the notknown deleted scenes and would like to know more about the ship in general i recommend james camerons explorer cd  if you are interested in the ships story as a whole this is a valuable addition and movie clips interspersed throughout make it that much more reallooking at the rankings you can see that its tops 1035 its great or good 8925 or its not worth the 310 of celluloid its printed on 111  as i said earlier to each his own  i loved it and it earns its ten  for the naysayers well i also love the matrix and according to some of the reviews i read im a mindless hack for that too,sad
this is a good movie but lets not consider it a masterpiece like some have do i still dont understand why it won 11 oscars you know the story that incredible ship the who sunk on his first trip in 1912 its the whole love story between leonardo and kate thats not very interesting for me the best part of the film i must admit its when the ship go down under bernard hill was excellent as the captain of thein conclusion is a bit too long but still a good movie but lets not consider a classic too soon 8 out of 10,sad
there is little word could be used to describe other than breathtakingthe astounding special effects using cgi graphics and arete are incredibly realisticthe acting while not absolute topnotch was sufficient to be convincing i was particularly impressed with the trouble gone to by the casters in finding actors who resembled the original charactershistorically if you extract the romance storyline the movie was amazingly accurateeven to the point of the helmsman turning the wheel to port after hardastarboard was ordered  many might have thought this was a mistake but in fact this was historically correctby far my favourite film  a must for the historian or the hopeless romantic and kate winslet is living proof that you dont have to be built like a pencil to be absolutely beautiful,sad
this is a good movie for people who like history ship wreaks romance drawings pretty necklaces and more leo is so hot in this movie rose calvert does excellent storytelling also the costumes are gorgeous this movie also makes us feel sorry for the people who died on and feel happy for the people who survived james did a good job with the directing the script was well i would give this 10 out of 10,sad
there is certainly alot of biases about this movie the chicks worship leo so he delivered a terrible performance its one of the 10 biggest ticket sellers in history so it must be a terrible and unjustified success and on the other side everyone loves it and so i must the academy loved it and so it must be one of the greatest movies of all time leo really didnt give alot to the movie but his presence did not detract just the same as kevin costner in dances with wolves he was just as wooden but for some strange reason he got nominated he had about 1 and perhaps 2 different facial expressions but the movie soured as a masterpiece anyway is one of the best theatre experiences i never actually did see at the theatre but i saw twice on video it is easy to imagine it movies always are 100 times better on the big screen its becoming more and more rare now that people go with the crowd for the sake of it but occasionally we should try not to be so opinionated that we dont listen to anyone else the academy members were fresh out of the theatres when the golden boy ballots arrived the tactic is always a good one and had bearing herebasically james cameron was 300 nautical miles from an original screenplay and 882 feet from a historical tribute but the movie remains powerfull a combination of the score the vistas and general cinematography the in your face presence of the movie and the usual dont let go love story stuff pulled it off very well it had me rivetted and i wouldnt mind one more viewing some of the blue screen shots are atroscious sure and some of the digital effects leave me at a loss to understand why it won the award for them billy zane and the supporting cast are all good winslet put in a good performance despite some of the previously mentioned laughable dialogue delivered to and by her i reckon this movie holds interest alot better than many other epics especially gone with the wind needed its duration for the movies meaning and quality i find it hard to believe that a ship crew would be riveted by some old ladies story about an incruise fling she had decades on decades ago that was really cornyjust as a movie in my own opinion id give it 85 but by the constant cinema standardsproduction values 22 quality and meaning 152 acting 22 screenplay 15 originality 527510,sad
getting past the fact that leo is way too young looking for kate this really was a great modern film  every time i see it i find something new to like about it  knowing the ending before going in from a historical perspective does not dampen the excitement that leads up to the inevitable costumes are divine and although kate overacts kinda sounds like a breathless dorothy from the wizard of oz occasionally the acting is believable  the recreation of the is amazing  considering this is not the typical film i would enjoy i tend to avoid overblown hollywood blockbusters it was extremely enjoyable,sad
is an excellent moviewith excellent graphics and acting it wasvery hard for me to watch it because i have an intense fear of drowningbut i managed to get through the whole thing and then bought it on videolater the costumes and furniture in this film are so beautiful i lovethe dresses that rose wears the ship itself is awesome they did such agood job on all the special effects in the movie i was veryimpressed,sad
right before i begin my comments i would just like to point out that is not my favourite film ever the godfather is but i believe that is the best film ever made you see your favourite film ever and the best film ever are two very different thingsi believe to be the best film ever because it united the world in my opinion was the movie phenomenon of the century can you remember the first time you saw this film wasnt that just the most incredible experience of your life anyone who doesnt think this film is great then lock your selves in a dark room and watch on your own and without interuptions it is the best film ever made the whole buzz surrounding this film is just amazing and its impossible to watch without smiling and certain bits such as when jack teaches rose how to fly and the brilliant ending the only other film that came close to this type of hype was jurassic park is the best listen to the timeless soundtrack its brilliant everything about this film is great it is a great film to watch alone or with friendsloved ones etc seeing this film for the first time is the best experience of my life keep telling yourself this watch the film and listen to the soundtrack come on deep down you know that this film is the best ever made you may not want to admit it around family and friends but tell it to yourself when your alone and youll know itll come trueeverything about this film is perfect great acting effects sound story script cinematography etc this is a timeless example of how a film can unite a world and bring a smile to all those who watch itsay it out loud now is the best film ever,sad
yes is a rather simple film in terms of storyline and character depth  it is cliched and predictable  but even with this is simply one of the most entertaining and engrossing fairy tales of all time it is truly one of hollywoods greatest guilty pleasures  those who negatively criticize it do so simply because the film is popular   a lot of wannabe  movie experts tend to look down upon it because it is their sophomoric opinion that anything popular or mainstream is simply not as good as the less popular art house or independent films  as much as i love these small independent films i still believe that has a special quality to it which gives it an almost magical essence  its hard not to like this film assuming you can put all your jaded and cynical views aside   a film like this comes along once every blue moon and millions of movie goers around the world did well to make it into one of the most popular films of all time,sad
ok so the script is weak ok so the two leads are acknowledged as being very good looking do these two points detract from the overall quality of the film not reallybeing an aspiring screenwriter myself i am usually the first to complain if the script is packed with corny lines however i class james cameron as a maker of event movies and for the purpose of big budget blockbusters all that really matters is that the script pushes all the right emotional buttons this one does despite not being a consummate wordsmith jim knows how to manipulate an audience so that theyre cryin at the soppy parts and gaspin at the thrilling bits so in that sense any minor script faults dont really come into itwhat people also forget is that both leo  kate are actually good performers before this kate cut her acting teeth in weighty period adaptations like jude and leo did a good job of bringing his interpretation of one of the bards classic characters to the big screenthis is as ive said an event movie and they dont come much bigger in scale or scope,sad
many have commented recently that was overratedoverhyped some even saying it was the most overhyped movie in history somehow i doubt that perhaps waterworld might take that prize or maybe independence day or jurassic parkanyway what makes no sense to me is this why havent you shaken off the hype yet  the movie isnt playing in theaters anymore it isnt being hyped up anywhere  so cant you just put in in your dvd playervcrwhatever and watch it for what it is  i mean thats all it ever was anyway hype is just consensus conditioning and you dont have to be affected by it at all unless you choose tothat said i maintain my stance that is still a great entertaining film that it was never meant to be a documentary and would have suffered greatly without the tensionrelieving lovestory subplot and my agreement that dicaprio was a poor choice for the male leadanyway i can put the dvd in every once in awhile sit back and watch this movie for what it shows me the hype was forgotten over three years ago and i like the film  if you dont like the film fine but quit complaining about it being overhyped andor overrated  do you still remember the weather the day the film was released too,sad
despite all the negative comments about the film which may be directed more at the stunning success of the film james cameron delivers another solid piece of filmmaking although not the greatest film in the world the script was well written the acting was solid some outstanding and the direction was excellent its not perfect and not the best work mr cameron has done but all in all a very good movie,sad
this could have been a really good film  clever script brilliant set mostly convincing actors if i can nevertheless only award an average assessment its because of the last half hour or so that drowns the real drama in a lot of splash and spludder  doesnt a ship sinking with 2000 people on board not provide enough tension emotions and tragedyso whats the point of adding all this chasing around of the main characters in pointless pursuits had cameron cut out ca 15 minutes at the end he would really have created one of the great films,sad
great film saw it with a small audience in the theatre  this allowed me to feel the moods of this picture which translated to an exciting terrifying and sad story  it shows you how precious life and love are when you finally discover it amazing film making so real and grand were the sets the photography was remarkable,sad
james camerons of course deals with the technologically advanced and her invincibility on her first voyage the captain has her steaming full speed to set a record and thus promote the white star lines namei feel the movie is one of the top 100 movies of all time firstly the undertaking of the moviemaking is in its own right the use of submersibles to photograph the wreck thousands of feet down the massive set that involved building a virtual replica of the great shipsecondly i believe it is one of the greats because of the seamless use of movie making technology to bring this great ship to lifethe movies popularity is found it camerons putting a human face on the sinking of this great ship  the courageous the cowards  the wealthy the paupersits only fault is that it is a bit long could have used an intermission i rank it a 10jim peet,sad
the leading actor in this movie is indeed tssthe passengers and crew are in supporting roles throughout what is the plot the plot has been doing the rounds of hollywood for years namely boy leonado dicaprio meets girl kate winslet the girl is traveling first class with the haves the boy from the other side of the tracks is traveling in steerage class with the havenots their relationship developes when the boy coaxes her not to end her wealthy and luxurious lifestyle by taking a dive over liners stern into the atlantic she is invited to the steerage class by dicaprio for a raveup  they wind up in the cargo hold and the rear seat of a automobile what happens next between them is inevitable so whats new what happened between them had to happen before the iceberg butted in and upset everything for them and the rest of the passengers and crew special effects brilliant they could not have been bettered director james cameron poured all he had into this movie and it came up trumps he richly deserves the plaudits but as the great billy wilder stated without special effects some presentday film makers would be unable to hack it,sad
let me tell you how it ends the ship sinks is that a spoiler no i dont think so we all knew it would sink thats the whole reason why i saw the movienote im a bloke and did not see it leo whatshisfacethe story revolves around two classes the third class where jack leo and his mate a terific danny nucci puting on an accent win 2 tickets to america on the new unsinkable shipthe other people are rose winslet her fiancee cal zane another splendid role and her mother ruth fischer also travelling in the first class are bruce ismay hyde the ships designer thomas andrews victor garber when jack saves rose from an attempt at suicide their romance blossoms into a passiontate affair aboard the doomed vesselthe story is told in 1996 when a picture of a nude winslet is found a woman claiming to be her shows up stewart to tell her tale to paxton he is looking for a rare diamond why is it blue i ask should that be a sapphire which she was wearing in the picturea brilliant cast in a brilliant film written and directed by a very tallented man but the best performance comes from kathy bates as the unsinkable molly browndont miss it 910,sad
while i enjoy this movie historicalwise and the plot of it as well the ending leaves me depressed  i dislike the fact that jack froze to death  i understand that james cameroon had to make most of the passengers die because that is what happened in reality  what he didnt need to do however was make jack die since he was a main character    if i produced this movie i would have made cal freeze to death instead and jack would marry rose  the present time would have both jack and rose as an elderly couple talking about what had happened  another thing that bothers me is how these third class passengers were treated  the crewmen wouldnt allow them to go up to the deck until all the first and second class people were loaded onto the lifeboats   after breaking down the door the third class passengers fled to the deck  some of them however gave up and stayed down in the steerage  the scene where the irish mother is telling her children a story to put them to sleep is very sad  i really hated roses mother ruth  she was very nasty and shallow  the ship is sinking many people are dying and all she cares about is that the lifeboats are seated according to class  what a b  the only reason she wanted rose to marry cal was because they were broke and cal was rich i still enjoy this movie as i had mentioned earlier but it really isnt something i want to watch everyday  it certainly isnt something you want to watch before you go to bed  if you do you should watch something funny afterwards,sad
james camerons oscar winning was a great film that could be even better if given some better dialogue and some more mature acting  leo dicaprio and kate winslet do well in their roles but a lot of the dialogue from cameron is weak at best  winslet succeeds in her role much better than dicaprio although both have their good moments and their weak spots  the supporting cast helps to bring the real life people of the to life most notably by kathy bates  what cameron lacks in dialogue writing he more than makes up for in the accuracy of the recreated ship and its icy plunge into the frigid north atlantic  the film is worth viewing for the scenes of the ships sinking alone  james horners musical score is also terrific  cameron and crew have succeeded in making a grand epic as in days of old  get past the cheesy lines of the 2 stars and you will be in for one great ride,sad
is simply the perfect movie no movie will come close to its genius story and its emotional musical score brought to life by james hornerthere is a reason grossed over 18bn worldwide and it has nothing to do with leonardo dicaprio although his part was played well it is because there will never be a movie this amazing and deepis such an amazing movie filled with excitement and drama but i have to say itemotion yes i am a male and i found this movie very upsetting the way cameron builds up the story and character is sheer geniusyears from now it will be looked upon as the movie of our time the movie that destroyed star wars and all other movies before it a true classic and if you dont have it on dvd or vhs then get itimdb rating 1010 percentage rating 98,sad
i have seen this movie many times and it gets better and better each time james cameron did a great work because he combined the great special effects of the downfall with the love story between jake leo dicaprio and rose kate winslet,sad
 the name stood for a great dream and a much greater catastrophe but since 1997 it also stands for love a fairy tale made by james cameron this film is absolutely fantastic and will satisfy both kinds of viewers  the one expecting historical information and great action sequences and the other wishing a great love tale on the illfated according to camerons salary of 115000000 dollars kate winslet and leonardo dicaprio really seem underpaid for their great actingto put it in a nutshell  view and cry this film will not be forgotten soonsf,sad
this movie is and will always be the best movie of all time a flop would have ruined two studios but the film became most successful film of all time the characters are great i enjoyed watching kate winslet and leo di caprio a lot because leo wasnt such a big star when the movie came out after the success he got really arrogant but thats my opinionbut the best work did james cameron i still cant believe with what an unbelievable expenditure he let the sink and in all this theres always  the love story with jack and rose simply fantastic one thing ive to say at last is that i enjoy the soundtrack too james horner couldnt do a better work than this one nothing more to say i rate it 1010,sad
warning review contains spoilersthis is one of the most realistic films ive ever seen a modern day classic that allows for drama by having the lead character tell the tale in flashback letting you know she lives till the end this framing sequence neatly comes back three times and we get a voiceover cannily breaking up the narrativeit turns out the elderly lady was kate winslet a rich society girl engaged to the boohiss pantomime villain played by billy zane well he is english after all anyway this upper class madam soon falls for a cocky brat with a head shaped like a turnip and starts performing activities generic of her class like spitting over the side of the ship and getting her boobs out i did give the movie 810 but that was for kates mighty chest rather than the film itself mind you its all quite understandable as jack has an enticing line in fortunecookie platitudes spouting lines like when you got nuthin you got nuthin to lose and make each day countwhere it really succeeds is in its accessibility like many cameron movies rather than confusing the issue with all that characterisation nonsense we have dialogue that is functional and neat stereotypes like the irish crew that love to do nothing more than dance a merry jig whuy it be straight out o a advert four de morphees and just like it theyre not bitter well theyre the uss spiritual kinfolk arent they even the scots and welsh help a little bit but the english cant wait to shoot the passengers and only the americans are truly heroicperhaps the stumbling block is the superb realisation of the ship itself to correct this error cameron gives us some ropy cgi from the background where rose attempts suicide to the iceberg which is as two dimensional as billy zanes character apparently the cheap effects came about because despite costing 200 million to make over half went on zanes mascara ooo hes a real villain he is another wrong foot is casting the rsc jonathan hyde the thought of having a decent actor in the film is absolutely abhorrent yet luckily its not a mistake the director makes twicebut the masterstroke is the running time where a 90 or 120 minutes duration might feel just about right cameron drags it out to over three hours genius other great moments include the constant references to the ship not being able to sink and the cod english accents any old director worth his salt could cast realistic accents but giving it a touch of the van dykes is a feat of remarkable postmodernism in fact the only thing the film needed to take it to the very peak of perfection was a dreary love ballad at the end by celine dion oh dear,sad
it was a great movie this film was based on the true story about the unsinkable shiptitanicwhich lies beneath the north atlantic directed by james cameron and starring by kate winslet as rose dewitt bukater and leonardo dicaprio as jack dawson this film won eleven academy awards including best picture in 1997 kate winslet is a capable actress she is a young rich girl sailing to the usa to get married to a young rich man who gives her a priceless blue diamond her mother is forcing her to get married and she become desperate she tries to commit suicide but she is saved by jack dawson jack is a thirdclass passenger who likes drawing they get to know each other very well and then they fall in love this film is the greatest film i have ever seen i admit i cried when i saw this film i cant imagine how they tried to struggle in the freezing water and hope someone can save them,sad
this movie is one of the most beautifully designed portrayals of a story that everybody has heard about is the kind of movie where you either love it or you hate it theres really no in betweeni love this film i definately dont hate it and since it is close to being one of my most favorite films ill go all the way and say that i do indeed love it with so many mixed comments about how it was so awful or how it was the best film in the history of filmmaking i just have to comment on iti am pretty confident in saying that everybody has seen this most people complain about how it had such a big budget and that the sinking part of the movie was so unreal others say that the cast was made up of the worst actors possible let me break my opinions down into different sections of the movie i thought that the cast did a very well job when the time that was at the theaters there was so much hype about leonardo dicaprio after a while the publicity was a little too much and it started to become old news i agree that his part as jack dawson was an excellent role watching him for three hours  isnt too bad either kate winslet gave a good breakthrough performance as rose and i liked her style as to how she made the character come alive the only problem that i had with her was that towards the end where it was focused just on her she became a real snooty b     thats okay i guess that it was good for her to act in that certain mood the entire cast and i mean every last person did an absolutely spectacular job frances fisher kathy bates billy zane bill paxton gloria stuart bernard hill victor garber and everyone else that was involved were really good the writing was terrific a lot of time and thought went into this script after hearing that it was over three hours long i had no intention on seeing it but i went and saw it and was especially impressed with the writing that james cameron put into it being that it is such a long movie the script had to hold up well for the entire time not once did i think that it was boring or did i ever want to skip a part that is one of the problems with most newer movies too many unnecessary parts are added in to take up time was fine with everything pertaining to the scriptthe plot was a little original but still held my attention a first class girl falling for a steerage boy and vice versa each scene and situation that the two were in really made it enjoyable both actors played these parts good and made it somewhat believable that they were starcrossed lovers one problem that i had with the plot was that the meeting and getting to know each other was a little on the hurried side they meet fall in love etc we know the story maybe the special effects were the majority of the movie considering that the second half deals with the sinking of the ship a lot of computers and a ton of money helped make the film a success im not one for movies where special effects take over the entire film but there were enough in to where it still stayed realistic plus they were really gooda big part of the film that i liked was the music and score for it after a couple of songs they all started to sound somewhat similar but i was still able to get along with it just a little word on what i think the most annoying scene was it wasthe famous im the king of the world line it wasnt awful but it was a minor part that could have been left out i know that im forgetting something and as soon as i submit this im going to remember it anyway my final words are that this was a overhyped not overrated film that is still good to watch every now and again i think that it was a little bad that cameron and his crew set aside as much money as they did just for one film i am glad that the gained all of it back plus more a little long maybe ease up on the fx andthats about it it was a very good movie however to get some original lines and writing be sure to see a night to remember and when its available see the cbs miniseries,sad
there are a lot of guys out there that wouldnt like to admit to watching and loving but i am not one of them i thought it took movie making back to its roots as a spectacle with heart sure some of the dialogue was corny but i cant imagine anyone not being moved by the tragedy told on a grand scale those of you feeling a leomania backlash dont let the overexposure of dicaprio blind you to the fact that he is the best actor of his generation and watch james camerons other films and for the first time notice the tenderness in terminator this is hollywood at its best,sad
forget the multibillion takings the ability of the actors the love themethe underlying story here is attitude small mindedness that cost 1500 lives lives needlessly wasted through the selfishness and pig headed arrogance of others and there seem to be plenty in this forum who have completely missed the pointit must have been one horrific night if youre a parent put yourself on that ship with your children image your desperation you know you may well die but you so badly want your children to survive imagine saying goodbye to your partner parent or child not knowing if youll ever be reunited imagine the desperation that forced people to jump into the water and imagine trying to keep afloat in that water as the cold eats at your body growing weaker hoping that maybe just maybe someone can save you then all becomes quite even though many scream around you then darknessi admit i cried yes i am a man and not ashamed to admit it i cried because of two particular scenes a scene where a mother reassuringly puts her children to bed as though it were any other night for them and the scene where the elderly couple lay together on their bed as the water rushed inwhy did they make me cry because we all tend to forget just how precious life is some of you laugh at a man bouncing off the propeller  but that was a life and someone somewhere lost touch with that life forever and there was grief and paini came out of the cinema still holding back the tears got into the car with my wife and hugged her so tightly as i cried i truly felt for everyone onboard and those left behind laden with grief and i felt glad that i had not had to endure something so tragic that i could get into bed with my wife that night and continue to live life  and more recently become a fatherthe events of that night should not have happened they were easily preventable sadly the attitude then still exists in some forms today and still costs lives if youre lucky and i hope you are then that attitude just might not affect you,sad
can i be honest with youi didnt cry at all the only one among my friends and everyone i know whove seen it  i didnt bawl my eyes out or even pound the arm rests in frustration until it tied ben hur in its number of oscars  maybe its because the first time i saw it was on a computeroverall it was a good movie even though the message is corny  for quite awhile love at sweet sixteen has been classified as infatuation though kate winslet really seemed to love  she didnt look sixteen either  the love shown was part gratefulness and part idealism ie living happily ever after with jack on her side and affection and anguish on his  still theres a lot of love ing isnt thereim ruining the movie message arent ikathy bates gave i think a great performance as the unsinkable molly brown and victor garber was an equally good mr andrews  the the extras and computer graphics of people drowning and the ghostly floating figures were greatits a good movie if you dont spend all of the three hours dissecting the plot and vivisecting it or giving everyone a character analysis with freudian cp all over  then again that applies to most epics if this qualifies as one,sad
i enjoyed a hell of alot it had enormous and terrific production design wonderful acting a beautiful score and well just alot of fun did i think it was the best film of the year do i think it is any competition for such movie classics as good will hunting as good as it gets or la confidential do i think this deserved to topple jurassic park out as the highest grossing film of all time no no and no what is just 3 hours of good entertainment has gotten blown way out of proportion i enjoyed this film in the same way and as much as other cameron hits and im sure noone is going to give true lies or the terminator best picture i suggest those 2 or 3 people in the world who havent seen do so but just not to expect a piece of film history,sad
where skeptics and other rampant haters typically center their criticism is on the perceived sappiness of the central romance what they fail to do however is recognize the subtle vignettes that cameron masterfully employs to make us comprehend the impending terror the tragedy and the visions of hope and grandeur that went plunging into the icy depths with the great ship andrews sips his brandy and turns back the clock on the mantle an old couple embraces and weeps as water rushes up to the bed the ensemble soberly plays its final pieces together a preacher delivers a final prayer with a mass of hands clinging to him those are the scenes which make the cinematic juggernaut it has become some may be put off by the winsletdicaprio romance this male however found it to be very essential a frame of reference for the audience to vicariously realize the horror of the accident deserved each of its 11 oscars,sad
ill be honest  i thought was on the whole a very well made film the special effects were great acting was fine and generally the plot was good  however its message ruined the film  think about what this movie taught millions of people   passionate oneweek flings are more important than a lifetime with your husband and sex outside of marriage is goodthough this movies poor message was mild by comparison to many movies it still had a huge influence on many people  for this reason and the totally unnecessary nudity i will never watch this movie again  oh well  it could have been a great film,sad
i saw in the theater with an ex girlfriend and although i didnt cry i could see why many people did the film has alot of breathtaking effects and james cameron has done a great job of replicating the doomed ship kate winslet is absolutely beautiful the movie was a little too long and the whole heart of the ocean storyline was uninspired the acting was pretty good but leonardo dicaprio is an overrated candyass hack actor the whole love story could have been morepassionate if it wasnt so cheesy took awhile but once the ship went down the chaos ruled  out of ,sad
some people will look for anything to criticize this movie  i recall one user comment complaining that the ship didnt have any bow waves  oh dear god no  i usually cant stand the tedium of romance movies but i found this one to be very entertaining although i think dicaprio should try a pushup one of these days  by the way great career ditching american psycho for the beach  anyway some criticism id like to offer is billy zanes character  i realize that he is the predesignated bad guy but does his character really have to be so unoriginal  id like to have seen him as a real person and not equipped with the default personality for villains of course i guess all the other main characters are pretty much just as unoriginal but i enjoyed the movie anyway  i recollect releasing an especially malignant laugh upon the weeping audience as i witnessed leonardos frozen pretty little face dwindling down into the black abyss of the atlantic ocean  i dont understand the point of keeping a priceless diamond for about eighty years just to plop into the ocean  maybe her senility clouded the fact that its value is beyond that of money or maybe she just an idiot  uhoh it appears that now i am nitpicking  i guess im just a hypocrite,sad
this is one of those movies where the cinematography is one of the main highlightes the ship sinking is awesome and best seen in either the big screen or in widescreen format that scene and the budding romance between leo  kate make up the vast majority of this filmabout 97 of it the movie certainly made a heartthrob of leo see this movie if just for the ship sinking part young  the restless fans can spot eric braeden victor as john j astor and of course leo kate and kathy bates molly brown are recognizable as is billy zane out of ,sad
was a goldmine its potential had not been tapped into since a night to remember and cameron saw the perfect way to milk the audience emotion by creating characters we felt for on a ship headed for disaster and boy does cameron know how to convey disaster and the horror of sinking to an icy deathcameron decided to go with a flashback account sounds good the added perspective would help tremendously cameron decided to throw in a very interesting modernday search for a priceless gem oooo interesting great keep going cameron decides to use the richgirl captivated by poorboy theme wonderful it hasnt been done properly in 4 decades cameron decides to make the focus very specifically centered on the couple hmm well ok as long as it is done right and done very carefully with respect to the ploy of the ship cameron decides to cast leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet as the lead characters and drops almost all other character interaction including that of the charcters in 1999 who are listening to the story arrrgh nooo bad bad dicaprio is completely wrong for this role and so is winslett the lack of acting and emotion in dicaprios performance sinks the movie faster than any glacier could ever hope for the movie is more centered on cicaprio than the sinking of the ship and dicaprio falls flat on his face it was a poor decision in the first place putting dicaprio whose only impressive effort was in whats eating gilbert grape is so completely and utterly wrong for this film its mindboggling i found myself screaming act act you fool dicaprio could easily have been replaced with a bag of sugar with a magicmarker created starryeyed face and goofy grin however the people who made this film so much money all wearing their scrunchies and drpepper lip gloss love him so what can you say as for ms winslett i just did not like her i think she gave a poor performance to a character that couldnt afford to have a poor performance she came off as an annoying brat and unsympathetic she also helps to sink this movie almost as much as dicaprio that being said everything else in the movie is gold it seems that every moment when leo and kate are offscreen is a breath of fresh air and is excellent in execution unfortunately these moments are few and farbetween sorry cameron your fundamental concept didnt work and ruined what could have been the greatest movie of all time i give you a10 for your story about the sinking of the but i take away five for your story about jack and rose 510,sad
awesome visual effects great music but the plot just plain sucks i watched with my friend the first time and found the first 90 minutes boring  the second time my wife wanted to watch it and i slept until the ship began to sinkperfect score for visual effects 6 for plot average 8,sad
everything that needs to be said about this movie has basically been said i would just like to throw some light on perhaps the final overlooked flawwhats the deal with that fat bearded jackass who pilots the submersible in the present day scenes in the movie you know what im talking about youve got this incredibly complex expensive salvage operation in the middle of the atlantic youve got whats probably a multimillion dollar deep sea submersible craft that can send a robot camera into the wreckage and who do we have piloting this delicate operation whos making the clutch decisions here a scrappy loud fat bearded jackass who the filmmakers have presented as some kind of i dont know junkie extreme deepsea salvage enthusiast he looks and acts like hes about to pull a large drippy chili dog from an onship microwave and stuff it in his face while screaming wooooo its the freaking man wooooi think they may have imported this character from twister where you may also recall that one of the scientists on the research team was also a fat bearded jackass who was presented as some kind of die hard extreme tornado enthusiast arent these characters really annoying what purpose do they serve i guess the point is that if you are really into your hobby in an extreme woooooo kind of way you will probably forget to shave and eat sensibly,sad
although the script is not its strong point this film has many virtues the directing is excellent the acting is sober kate winslet show us that she is a talented actress and then comes the entertainment section in which is the king of the world from the moment that the iceberg hits the ship this film gets a new totally epic dimension the scenes where splits in two are indeed visual poetry in short is a good film with a strong directing an enormous attention to details but above all is an impressive visual spectacle,sad
this movie was stunning and yes it did move me but the fact that all these people are pretty much dead by now anyway marred the whole tragidy part so i liked the special effects they really did catch the realizm of it all and they did pull the old heartstrings with the mother singing her kids to sleep while a quartet played nearer my god to thee but i was in it for the intense action miles of corridors filled with water the lights flickering out all at once and the ship breaking in half that was cool,sad
wow as a surf through this messagethere is nothing wrong if you really despise itbut calling those people who admire the film having a bad taste so selfish attitude is totally unacceptable it seem i only heard that phrase in one placenazi germanyi respect those people who despised it because james cameron is as arrogant as hell probably its politically incorrect to have 250 million budget or earned 1 billion causing such petty jealousy well who knowsi heard a site called people against hype in translationpeople for star wars hype against hypesubject is not immune to hype and if a media received an information that a wellknown director james cameron will make a 150 ended up 250  of epic with loaded with special effects hype is inevitablemy honest thought about this film script isnt damnable or stupid some single minded people belived there is a stereotypesthis is bs of course irish likes whiskey and they drink it dunring a celebration duh,sad
its hard to add a lot to what over a thousand people have said before so ill keep the comments short  this is a fantastic movie  the effort that james cameron put into filming the sinking ship is mindboggling  and it works  well worth seeing  a love story an actionadventure disaster movie and a historical epic set on the high seas accurate down to the smallest detail all in oneits hard to imagine this movie ever becoming a classic of the gone with the wind type though because of the casting  great classic films have great classic personacreating performances and this movie just doesnt have that  leonardo dicaprio in particular is a very talented engaging young actor and its not his fault that an extremely ambitious epic movie like this was simply too heavy for him to carry  but unfortunately thats the case  i cant say that he was too young for the part  but the character of jack was definitely too young for the movie  this film needed more substance than he could give it  dicaprio is simply too close to being a teen idol at least a 1912 version of one  of course thats precisely why so many teen girls flocked to see this film multiple times and is a big part of the movies huge successkate winslet also is an endearing young actress and you really felt for rose in her bravery throughout all of her trials and tribulations  but even after the megasuccess of this film winslet still doesnt have a clearlydefined persona  maybe the problem is that we dont have oldschool movie stars anymore  we have actors now and most of them are better at acting than the classic movie stars ever were  but the oldstyle stars had personality plus and thats what this movie needed to make it a true classichaving said that though i really dont mean to be negative  this is a grand story told extremely well and the sinking of the ship has the advantage of being a true story as well  never was this tragic event duplicated on screen so well so accurately or so effectively  by the way the music was awesome,sad
when i came to watch this film i was expecting to find the next casablanca by the reviews in the media and of people i knew who had seen this movie instead i saw another independence day a movie with all the special effects but a weak and cliched plot indeed some parts of the movie can be quite entertaining  several classic rushing water scenes in the second half of the movie rival that of even the poseidon adventure  the sinking of the ship was shown with great accuracy and remarkable effect     however i have never seen a best picture film with as weak a storyline as this  the second half of the movie contains chase scenes and water scenes that although entertaining has no relevance to the plot and shows that indeed this movie cannot be considered a classic film  take those special effects scenes away and you have a story that is a poor rendition of romeo and juliet and the actors are quite horrible  yes i am a guy but i do believe that di caprio has good acting qualities as shown in basketball diaries and whats eating gilbert grape  in this movie however he does a pretty pitiful job as jack  kate winslet does not do much better and does a pitiful job of overacting  this movie did not deserve 11 academy awards and all its nominations  take into account other movies which won best picture even the ones in the 90s braveheart forrest gump dances with wolves and one can clearly see that the academy was clearly swayed by the  masses of people who watched it  just remember that the amount of money a movie makes doesnt necessarily  determine how good it really is  if so then men in black should have won best picture the following year and will smith best actor,sad
if you think youre a film buff but youre really filmilliterate you will hatei avoided seeing this movie in the theater because the studio played it up as a sappy love storywhy oh why did they play it up like thatit didnt matter that james cameron who is a genius directed it i hate love stories and i still havent seen the english patientwhich by the way is not a love story as it was portrayed in promotional materials reveals itself to be much more than just the surface subject matter that is written and portrayed many people who have commented on it already have mentioned why so i will not try to explain why is one of the best films made which would require a novellength volume of words,sad
despite all the hype about huge ticket sales being due to the young teenage dicaprio groupies delivers a wonderful story with great special effects  3 hours of non stop entertainment the only weakness is the whole search for the heart of the ocean stuff although mildly entertaining its unnecessary and time consuming besides why wait 70 years to through away your grandchildrens inheritance  i gave it an 8 although certainly see were many would rate the movie higher,sad
how does one describe the perfect film in order to answer this question one must watch the perfect film in this case is the perfect filmit owned all the qualities that make a film 1 action drama suspense romance and action is the personification of excellence and perfectionit contained brilliant performances by kate winslet leonardo dicaprio billy zane and kathy bates i was truly impressed by the performance of billy zanes cal who was the jealous fiance to kate winslets rose the casting director knew what he was doing when he chose zane because the role was played with such ease the set design and costumes that overseen by director james cameron was done with careful attention to detail the accuracy of the set and costumes was superb it was not easy to tell the difference whether or not it was made or reali have seen many many times and will continue to see as long as i own the movie because it was that well done it continues to hold a special place in my heart and will for as long as i livethis continues to be one of the best films i have seen everyone should see it again,sad
what a movie  its amazing what you can do with a couple hundred actors a doomed ship and a director  i find it very unfair that kate winslet didnt win that best actress and gloria stuart didnt get the best supporting actress  i always cry when it gets to the part whenwarning  spoiler aheadrose and jack come to where the ships builder is looking at a clock his life jacket at his side  and then when he tells rose hes sorry he couldnt build a stronger ship i totally burst into tears  if you rent this flick have your box of tissues,sad
while i still feel that camerons lacks the emotional impact of a night to remember it still packs a relative wallop  i will not be jumping on the trendy lets bash because chicks like it bandwagon because when i went to see the film in the theater i was blown away  the emotional impact alone of the ship sinking made this film worthwhile  i was moved and the real tragedy of the event was brought home directly  now on videotape this is not anywhere near as grand but it is still quite decentthe love story was not really anywhere near as bad as people say i think that both winslet and dicaprio have done decent films and will continue to do decent films  in retrospect i am sure that will not be remembered as their best film but it will probably be their most remembered  i was less touched by the romance than i was by the sense of history small h history that the framing of the story provided  it was a nice love story not a particularly great one but a nice one  however the scene at the end when rose goes back into the ship and meets jack still young and handsome is a nice touch and a moving vignettewhile i will not claim to a brilliant film or a deep film it was a beautiful film and i still enjoy watching it,sad
i think this was a great film truly an achievement in filmmaking superb technically and in the story department it was above average i think part of the fun of hating it is that people are annoyed by dicaprio  okay understandable but come on even he cant ruin an otherwise great movie that muchi know i know all those detractors say that the plot was simplistic and predictable but hey simple stories are the best its not how convoluted the plot is but how you tell the story all stories basically boil down to boy meets girl loses girl gets girl boy versus bad guy and boy versus nature and various combinations of those this story has all these elements and though the characters werent terribly deep they were consistent i really cant stand all these hip modern movies that have these truly original characters that have nonsensical quirks and get involved in contrived plot twists for no good reason think swingers plus the visual aspects of the film were just masterful i mean did you notice the dissolves between the present and the pastand lets not forget all the little details that cameron put in showing all the scenes with the minor characters they really made you care for the at the end when the ship sank you gotta admit the sinking was intensespoilerlastly the very end was the most emotional part for me  no not when jack dies  im talking about when the old rose goes to sleep and the camera pans over all her photographs on the bureau seeing that really gave you a sense on how rich a life she led and made the events on the that much more poignant  it tied the past and the present together nicely and you cried for her not because youre sad that she went through such a horrible disaster or that her lover died but you kinda cry for joy because she survived and you know she lived life to the fullest the way we all should not to sound cheesy or anything but that is the most touching part of the movie to me anyway i gave it a 910one big peeve though i wished they stuck with an allorchestral soundtrack didnt have that skinny bitch celine sing on it  but hey thats capitalism right,sad
i thought was a great movie one of the best ive seen in my whole life it has great special effects great acting and it also has action and suspense and it has some comedy and a lot of romance this movie is way better than armageddon and i dont understand why so many people like armageddon better,sad
every time a film becomes such a huge participant of pop culture in this country the backlash will surly soon follow people can trash it all they want  this film was successful on all levels and there is nothing that is going to change that cameron has smartly avoided the spotlight the last few years not involving himself in any major feature film have the feeling he knows his critics cant wait to tear him down and by the way i agree the love story is relatively weak but the film does justly honor the memories of those who died in this tragedy want an accurate depiction of what happened to some of the real people who were aboard read the book a night to remember,sad
is an epic a true epic and will continue to be loved forever many people did not like it because they do not understand the message epics are sending out morals put to life dreams fulfilled in movies  fulfilled these and will continue to for generations  gone with the wind was respected just as much as when it came out and now many deem it to be the best movie the world has ever seen  so go back and watch and remember the words i said as you view this epic spectacle masterpiece that has been made immortal by being named the title of best picture 1997 and the no 1 movie in the world,sad
i think i was one of the few people that waited for this movie to come out on video before i saw it  i dont know why  i think maybe because i knew what the end would be just like in romeo and juliet you know what the end is going to be and you cant help but hope the end is going to be different than you know it to be and you just cant help watching it  mixing the fictional story of rose and jack with the true life people who really sailed on the was done quite well  i can tell you watching the very detailed sinking of the ship probably only gave the viewers a 20 feeling of horror that the actual passengers had especially third class how they put people in the ships by class really irritated me a sad fact but true  putting only 12 people in a boat that could have held 6070 when they were already short of lifeboats was incomprehensible  it seems to me that even after 80 years generations of people have never gotten over the sinking of this ship and they probably never will  the fascination of the and her passengers will outlive time,sad
love story with a famous historical backdrop  an astonishly wellgroomed steerage class passenger catches the eye of a beautiful haughty first class passenger aboard a doomed ocean liner  technically excellent film sunk by soap opera script inane plot and televisionquality acting  but if youre a fifteenyear old girl who cares  rating b,sad
originally i was sceptical  several times i commented to my sister whod seen it twice on the big screen and was always talking about story about a ship that sunk  big dealbut this particular film appealed to me when i finally watched it in fact its one i kept watching over and over and had virtually nothing to do with kate winslet who is clearly older than 17 being in there i wish i had seen it on the big screenleonardo plays a very amiable young man in this one and fabrizzio is a good companion one qualm is that once rose appears on the scene fabrizzio prettymuch disappears but its true that the central interest lies with jack and rose the other characters are portrayed well in their various roles totally believeable you develop real feelings for them even the two unfortunate lookouts who see the iceberg just a few seconds too latethe special effects of this film are excellent there was nothing anywhere to suggest during the sinking that this wasnt really happening as you saw it and the music and instrumentation is wellsuited to an ocean voyagetrue theyve rewritten history in many places but it enhances the drama some of the dialogue isnt lifelike again one must remember that it isnt meant to be totally believeable the final scene watch it if you havent could have been skipped the fairytale romance between jack and rose could be thought of as too contrived but it is nonetheless striking for these reasons some people will not like it also three hours is extremely long for a movie but in my case having read some of the scenes they cut i wish it could have been four hours long910,sad
well here it is three years after the release of and the movie is still eminently watchable  i have the dvd version and watch it occasionally  ive come to realize that the love story which many have complained about serves to offset the disaster portion of the movie perfectly  without it watching would simply be a bleak and depressing experience  but notice how the love story reaches its peak just as the ship crashes into the iceberg and a crossover effect is achieved  disaster intersects with love and the human spirit  without the love story and no i didnt think it was particularly cheesy would not be the movie that it ispeople have said that this movie has aged poorly since its original release  i dont think so  i saw it three times on the big screen when it came out and bought the dvd when it first came out  multiple viewings have not diminished this movie for me  it still stands as the finest movie of 1997 and the best epic disaster film ever made  remember this movie is not a documentary and was never intended to be  some people dont quite seem to get that point  as for leonardo dicaprio i do feel they could have chosen a different actor for the part and it would have improved things but only a little  this film has only one lead character the herself all the rest are extras albeit important onesif youre one of those rare birds who hasnt seen yet dont listen to its detractors  watch the movie and judge it for yourself  i wont comment on the special effects except to say theyre incredible and 99 seamless  the story taken as a whole is profound and moving  no other disaster film the innumerable airport 19xxs and others have managed to capture the human side of a major 20th century disaster so effectively  and this is still a great date movie as well  it succeeds from many many angles  so many that its flaws yes it has some can and should be overlooked  director james cameron put his heart and soul into this film and it showsverdict acquitted on all charges and rated 910 for true excellence in filmmaking,sad
however im sorry to say that im not a member of the congregation among its many accolades and achievements also holds the unique distinction of being james camerons most overrated film to date the plot is about as simplistic and predictable as it gets  the character development is on the level of a bruckheimer production  sure the production values are top notch but would you expect any less for over two hundred million if i had to choose between robotic assassins from the future and sinking ships id take the steriod devouring austrian cyborg,sad
ive seen this film about 10 times each time i howl at the end i know there are heaps of flaws and some serious narrative ambiguities but actually i dont really care because i found it 3 hours of absorbing and completely magical storytellingjames cameron does a fantastic job with he makes wonderful use of the film as medium  no other visual art can offer the grandeur and breathtaking sweeps of imagery that film does the effects are simply riveting and emotionally wrenching i loved the story of rose and jack they were alive and had great depth and believability kate winslet was magnificent and so was gloria stuart leo di caprio did seem a bit too modern but his jack was sympathetic and interesting the supporting cast was excellentthe script does require a fair bit of cooperation from the viewer in terms of believability but this can be done by people who dont try to put historically accurate and film in the same sentence they dont go together never have and never will film is fantasy escapism and a willingness to suspend ones life in order to live another for a few hours does this superbly it deserved every oscar it receivedand its simply wonderful storytelling like star wars the original not that hideous travesty tpm it is the best of popcorn genre entertainment without baggage and ill cry again next time i see it,sad
this movie was greatly over exposed in the first few weeks it was out in the theaters although i do have to admit that the story line of the ships history and the actors who portrayed the real life crew were outstanding but to be honest me and a lot of others couldve done without the romantic side of the film to me it gave a somewhat bad taste to the movie,sad
i like a lot and for me personally its among the best movies ever i saw it in theatres back in 1998 and now recently bought the dvd  i must say im not much a fan of romantic movies but what i like so much in here is everything about the ship itself  from the first scenes underwater in the present time until the sinking itself near the end of the movie also the first day set sail and the engine rooms are shown are great to watch  many times even during the sinking they have the camera moving around the ship so great that it really looks like the real thing  but the best part in special effects no doubt starts with the breaking of the first mast until the ship goes down under completely  a good recommendation for all buffs and romantic souls  i rated it 1010 which makes it my 4th favorite dvd title after ronin bad boys and rob roy,sad
the 1997 version of this great tragedy is a very entertaining and meticulously crafted movie the whole plot with a romantic story makes it very likable among the youngsters especiallythe detailed depiction of the interior of the liner with so many opulent and richly decorated halls and passage ways is indeed commendable the tragic accident and events leading to capsizing of the liner with the passengers and crew caught in the iron hands of fate are all picturised with stunning craftinesshowever the cold and cruel ocean is shown too placid and calm against the backdrop of the sinking ship and floating corpses i wonder if the open seas and oceans resemble the same this is the only cinematic drawback which has resulted due to the filming of this top grossing movie in a swimming poolfinally the story the whole disaster and tragedy does not cover as wide a scope and magnitude that it be crowned with eleven oscars the juvenile love affair between jack and rose does not encompass the maturity of character and therefore cannot be very engrossing or appreciative,sad
after seeing this film again i still feel this is a terrific movie but cant shake the feeling that  leonardo di caprio was terribly miscast as the manoftheworld artist seeking adventure he was just too young for the part he looks like the kid who delivers my newspaper,sad
this is a good movie  theres no doubt about that however it is not all its cracked up to be i saw it about a week after it opened in swedenthere are some magnificent performances for instance the oft forgotten billy zane playing the jealous wouldbe husband of rose cal hockley i must confess that i have something against leonardo dicaprio but there are a few performances in which he shines these are luke in the series growing pains arnie in whats eating gilbert grape and jack in kate winslet however delivers a very stereotypical richgirlgettingatasteofthewildlife performance which i soon put out of my mind the best female performances are instead kathy bates as unsinkable molly brown and frances fisher as ruth dewitt butakera final note the saddest moment of the movie is not the one people usually thinks about but rather the fate of tommy ryan jason barry watch it again and see what i mean i dont usually cry at movies but during that scene i was close to tears,sad
is an epic cinematic masterpiece this is the type of movie that 50 years from now will be considered one of the all time best is an epic in every sense of the word watching the great ship sail and then sink is one of the great technical triumphs of film in the 1990s the talented cast turns in solid performances and the direction from james cameron is top notch i cant really say much more about this film that hasnt already been said so sit back and enjoy,sad
i liked this movie  i thought the reproduced ship was remarkable  to reenact that night was tough to do and they did it its one of those movies in which you laugh and cry  the only other thing was leo looks about 15 and kate winslet looks about 25  wonderful movie though,sad
no doubt that james camerons is an epic story told in grand fashion  but lets get one thing straight right nowthis is not a human interest piece  this is a special effects piecelook at all the academy awards it has won  the majority of them in the technical arena most logically  if perhaps not the strongest in character motivation cameron is first and foremost a craftsman  its what he works best at just look at the terminator films  every detail is lovingly placed and arranged with a perfectionists eye and hand  and the final half of the film which ill get to is a masterpiece in itselfbut as far as characterization goes kate winslet and leonardo dicaprio play their parts like good soldiers but are simply too shallow and unconvincing as the puppylovers caught up in the huge sweep of tragedy a plot device as old as motion pictures themselves to project much emotion or personality instead they just walk around and say their lines as the rest of the movie goes on its merry waywhich is as it should be i guess as the movie does indeed have its own agenda and does its work very well thank youthe final half of the movie is what everyone is interested in anyway  and cameron and company acquit themselves very well as the slowly splits and sinks into the icy deep waters below  every single moment has its drama as the different passengers confront their mortality while the ship confronts its own  older couples comforting each other parents holding their children tightly as the water rises around them musicians valiantly playing hymns for the passengers the doomed ships designer calmly waiting by the fireplace as his creation collapses around him  in this respect deserves every award and accolade it has received even more so  no one modern director has worked so hard and emphatically on a vision as cameron has here  but as far as the human effort he is the modernday hitchcock herding his cast cattlelike from scene to scene positioning them just so to emphasize the fxbut just consider the fx and youll understandin view of the sight of the itself that earns ten easy stars  but subtract four stars for failing to find one cast member or character as interesting as the ship itself no not even gloria stuart  sorry gloriain all six stars for  fast forward to when the iceberg makes its appearance and you may enjoy it even more,sad
this movie is excellentis a poetic impulse the direction inspires respect and hope cameron is very talented see the abyss roses and jacks personalities inspire me kate is an amazing actress her acting in every movie is a exceptional phenomenon with emotional result  simply the best,sad
now ive seen a lot of films in my time  ive loved a lot of films in my time  but simply tops them all sure some of the criticisms this film has been given are not terribly offthemark but i dont see them  i have watched this film over and over again and never tire of it this film is terribly rich in detail  while dicaprio and winslet are brilliant in the leads its really the supporting cast that shines  i was especially impressed with gloria stuart who i still think should have won the oscar in 97  also absolutely brilliant is victor garber as mr andrews  his part is small but absolutely heartbreaking and definitely my favourite element in the film of course the cinematography editing score etc are all as brilliant as youd expect from an epic and more  but its the underlying messages in this film that truly makes it count  it makes me happy that such an intelligent film is also the topgrossing film of all time definitely worth seeing again and again  10 out of 10,sad
i liked the movie very much because rose and jack were played very good the director made very good use of the existing theories about the like how it sunk how everything was etc on the end the movie was very exciting but some parts before were funny and also impressive this was a movie that made great impact to me compared to other movies so over all a great movie i would recommend it to everyone,sad
i just wanted to say that i have done research on the and this move has so much detail i am so surprised on how much detail was used in this movie i have never seen a movie that is based on a true story that who made it actually took the time to really get into detail i am very pleased with that,sad
this film got some good part and not so good i like the film though the love story is typical and lack of romantic wit and the script is pretty sparse but or obviously bad but cameron manage to put it together with some grunt thoughthe drama is the strongest point of this film from noble band player sacrifices of other passengers and the inevitable end of the designer of thomas andrewsspecial effect is awesome especially when the dolphins jumped near the massive bow of and the sinking of course the wonderful thing is it doesnt looks like a special effects unlike some cgi generated characters in mars attack or jumanji monkeys the music is very good and fit nicely on every scene and making the film feels like in 1912well done for first timer james cameron but he needs more learning to reach same level as steven speilbergmy verdict this is not a thrill ride as star wars or starship troopers or fine tune of schindlers list but a good movie you like it if you dont mind leonardo dicaprio sitting like a bum for 3 hours or listening to old fashion like music ill give it 8 out of 10,sad
i dont usually cast a vote for movies but this movie was incredibly compelling  it has my vote for best direction and screenplay  despite comments to the contrary i thought the two main protagonists did a fantastic job  this was a very well made correographed and well written rewrite of a movie  it was incredible in every detail  i thoroughly enjoyed every minute and this will be in my dvd library forever  i only wish they made gold standard dvd this would be a classic masterpiece of which i would proudly display and watch to serve as a reminder just how well done this movie is  i didnt realize the true story of what happened until the events unfolded in this outstanding film  this movie gets my vote as perhaps my favorite movie of all time  certainly you cannot deny its impact on the entire world because as of the date of this comment its the best selling movie by at least double of all time  i would say its the best overall movie even though i myself prefer scififantasy movies  this movie moved me and i even being a man am not afraid to say  stirred feelings i never knew i had  i was angry upset frightened and shocked all at the same time  this movie is perhaps the only movie to date  in my mind worth the title number 1,sad
i must admit it  this film deserves all its awards  the film did have great cinematography great editing good shot selection and outstanding special effects  i liked kate winslets performance and the art production team deserves a special award for innovation alonebut the film sunk on screenplay and character development  fortunately all the award organizations mainly the academy of motion picture arts and sciences didnt recognize the film for its screenplay  in fact the film didnt even receive a nomination of screenplay  but all the other eleven awards given to the film including best picture of the year was well deserved  i give the film a b and an 8 out of 10,sad
i saw this movie again recently three years after the hype and it was brought back to normal proportions the special effects are still impressive the idea is great and the story too but kate winslet is ok but not as good as she was in heavenly creatures dicaprio wasnt at his best either watch romeo and juliet gilbert grape or this boys life and the biggest laugh of the movie was the dialogue wich is rediculous in some scenes hilarious in others looking back it was ok but not brilliant,sad
okay this movie disturbed me it was so beautifully made that it managed to trouble me knowing that aside from the tender romance between leonardo dicaprio and kate winslets characters this was based upon events that actually happened in the early 1900s  a ship called the sank and that many people did actually die in the same ways graphically portrayed in this film which deserves its status as a modern classicthe romance between dicaprio and winslet is what made me develop a serious crush on leonardo dicaprio wonderful love story spoiler ahead the only objection i had was that they killed off leos character and let the bad guy who was engaged to winslets character and who we hear later commits suicide during the great depression survive long live leo gets a 910,sad
titanicdirection 98 lovely amounts of accurate details and the ship sinking is a tour de forceacting 73 the unsinkable molly kathy bates was great kate winslet got an oscar nomination but the others may have to learn more for next timeeditingspecial effects 100 can you get more realistic than thisplot 45 the weakest part of the film but some people like pseudo love storiesstrong words and violence etc 86 a brief sex scene which should not be there oh of course people dying every second when the ship is sinkingmusic 100 sheer joy so get both james horner albums with irish music sounding like this and celion dion rumbling away you probably listen to the music than watch the moviesound 96 incredible effects like the ship sounds the crackling of the stern and the human noises crying for help against the rushing of the waves and the debrishookability 98 when you see the computer models and underwater cameras you want to do aqua driving  as soon as possiblelastability 98 you do want the ship to sink dont you then fast forward the middle nonromantic section of the movieoverall 83 though the movie captures your senses it leave your brain in neutral,sad
i have resisted seeing this movie for a long time after all the ship sinks and given that they produce a survivor to tell the story i had a funny feeling that she too would survive the whole where is the treasure thing was unneeded the movie would have been better not as her story which it could not have been since it continuously showed things about which she could not have known but as her love story no late twentieth century stuff just her in the end giving her name to the officer on the ship as they entered new york harbor that would have been a perfectly acceptable end to a rather implausible love storythe script is as ponderous as the movie is long then there is the how old are these two lover anyway factor for dicaprios character to have done everything he had done would have made him much older and more jaded to the ways of the world even movie version americans lose their innocence after a while and the paintings that rose collects aside from not having been painted at the time her tastes reflect someone beyond her 18 or so years of script time and she quotes freud no lessnever the less the actors give it their all and turn in some rather good performances kate winslet and kathy bates being the best of the bunch and the fellow who plays cal h perhaps the weakest i liked the captain and the ships architect very much they gave convincing performances of men who have tried and recognize their failure just a bit ahead of the restquibbles with the story are abundant my personal one is why the lights were on as long as they were my experience with electricity tells me that the lights would go out before the deck they are on is under water in fact the whole ship would certainly have been much darker come final push into the water and while we are on the subject of lights i have seen a lot of cruise ships at night and none of them had so much light pouring out of every porthole werent some of the folks out to dinner or heaven forbid in bedso the movie is too long and didnt need to be by about thirty minutes just by cutting the modern day part out it adds nothing but a phony treasure hunt,sad
is one of the few movies in recent times on which the film academy and the public seemed to agree  it won more oscars than any other movie but ben hur and had a box office take that topped even the first star wars movie  so youd expect it to be the greatest movie of all timeunfortunately it isnt  its certainly a very good movie  it has great special effects though if thats what youre looking for the star wars movies and jurassic park are better  and it brought home the magnitude of the disaster when in recent times have we had a single disaster that killed 1500 people  and it has a haunting theme song  but it fell short of what it could have beenthe situation of the movie was an immensely interesting one  you have a ship thats going down in icy waters  theres no rescue in sight  there arent nearly enough life boats  so its inevitable that a lot of people are going to die in a rather unpleasant way and they know this for over an hour before it happens  how would people react in a situation like thatthis is the sort of thing that fiction could never tell you  you can probably figure out that some people would be heroic while others would be cowardly that some would be selfless while others would be selfish  but most interesting of all are the reactions youd never expect  and to the extent that the movie told those real life stories it was excellentunfortunately the real life stories were obscured by a fictional plot which bore an uncomfortable similarity to romeo and juliet and which employed so many stereotypes that it was hard to take it seriously  virtually all of lower class passengers eg are portrayed as coarse but goodhearted people while nearly all of the upper class passengers are portrayed as selfish snobseven with its flaws id still recommend seeing this movie if you havent already  but with all of its oscars and with its record setting box office take i feel compelled to add a caution  its not the best movie of all time as you might expect it to be from the hype,sad
i thought the film was excellent  however way too much emphasis was put on the jackrose story  important real characters and interesting real story lines were omitted  although i must admit for a real buff evidence of some of the lesser known stories was there  i was somewhat irked by the fact that some of the real heroes were given nothing but fluff parts for example sixth officer james p moody 24 years old at the time of the sinking  but i digress james camerons didnt need the jackrose story  the story itself could have easily stood on its own,sad
when this movie first came out i thought it looked like a piece of romantic girliemovie drivel  after at least 20 people told me it was great i convinced my boyfriend to go with me  we got to the theater ahead of the adolescent mobs and settled in me praying that it would at least be ok  wow  this movie was way better than i ever thought it would be although its a hollywood movie in every way especially in the plot and mediocre writing i admit that i was sucked in  i thoroughly enjoyed the movie  it reminds me a lot of oldfashioned hollywood movies where the whole film is out to blow you away and actually succeedsyes some of the acting is well subpar and the dialogue has some truly cringeinducing moments but overall this is a darn good film  its nice to see it now and again not to criticize or play erudite film scholar but just to enjoy a movie,sad
this is not really a story about two lovers  a big ship this is an experience that you can dive into at any stage of life  find a buried treasure forget cameron  his plagirism of previous films or indeed his own films like the abyss he is a true artist as he learns from previous work  evolves it nothing is wasted like many 19th century painters  novelists i doubt he knows or can appreciate the independent life of his creation if he were to understand the magic the essence of his directorial inspiration that drives actors performances it would become formulaic  worthlesssit close to the screen with music at maximum  feel the experience you will find yourself in a metaphorical world that will always be relevant  will always mean something there is an intangible quality that sucks you in against your willconsider kate winslets recent comment that she was in the middle of nowhere in a remote country yet an old man approached her  knew she had been in this highlights the magic that is interwoven in the actors performances that touches people regardless of the films context or theme the appeal is nothing to do with a ship it is about the essence of human spirit  the motivation to live a full life kate should have won an oscar because her performance is perfection personified i hope that in time all the actors will come to value without needing awards to validate their worth the quality of the art that they were fundamental in instrumentingwords can not do justice to the priceless value of emotional  spiritual experience that this film evokes but be warned the experience this film offers can be addictive as you will always be searching for the holy grail that is at its core,sad
what more could a film viewer want comedy romance  tragedy a baddy etc etc  excellent film from all angles 1997 but a film definitely to watch over and over again the music score added to a superb film,sad
this is my favorite movie of all time and i will never get tired of it  i love everything about it and would never change a thing  i think the backlash is assanine and people should always go with their first opinions i love this movie and that will never change,sad
thoroughly engaging  great setupspayoffs and attention to detail  most characters possessed redeeming qualities  one major character suffered an unresolved storyline  nice mixture of dramaromanceaction  the travelling angel motif is perfectly executed  special effects were first rate haunting score  an instant classic  today was my third time watching it and i enjoyed it just as much as the first,sad
this is cerartanly a movie to remember a tragical love story with wonderful cinematography good dialogues and exquisite performances from kate winslet leonardo dicaprio and gloria stuartcameron is fateful to the original facts that happened aboard the that cold night of 1912 its almost like if the story grabs you and pulls you inside the celuloid it makes you feel the fear and desperation that all the people felt during the sinkingkate winslet is wonderful as an oldfashined lady even when leo dicaprios fame leaves her behind they both are excelent and they fit perfectly into their roles i am a little mad because everybody treats kate bad because she was a little overweighted but she is healthier than all those skinny models out there imagine kate moss as roseleo is awsome i am actually mad at the academy because he never got a nomination he was great and he deserved at least a nominationif you call yourself a movie fan you must see this movie9 stars and it worths it,sad
i have to compliment james cameron on this movie because this is probably the most historically acurate movie i have ever seen  its interesting watching these fictional characters rub elbows with history like john jacob astor molly brown benjamen guggenheim etc  i am a huge buff and certainly enjoyed this movie  a movie theater in my area had it on until the day it came out on video  of course i was going to be in line at suncoast pictures in my local mall for my copy the day it came out but three days before it came out i had to go back and see it on the big screen one more time because it was so impressive and so realistic  i felt like i was there really there  this is definately one of my favorite movies,sad
is a good movie and has a touching love story of 2 young lovers leonardo decaprio kate winslet aboard the doomed ship that sunk in 1912 one of the movies best aspects is the special affects and direction even though the love story drags on a little bit too long some of the acting had its ups and downs winslet and billy zane as  her rich fiancee are the best the movie was too overhyped but still very good,sad
i was impressed very much by this movie not for its pictures or its directors talents but i liked it just for the sake of the extraordinary romance happening between well chosen leonardo di caprio and kate winslet of course the glorious romantic song my heart will go on sang by celine dion was one of the effective factors that made the movie a heartbreaking modern piece of romance,sad
banal crass slushy unoriginal expensive only won 11 oscars as a thank you because if it had flopped the entire hollywood studio system would have collapsed etc etc yes all of these charges were and still are being laid against james camerons hugely expensive multi oscar winning epic times and critics for that matter never change because that is exactly the sort of thing people were saying back in the 50s and 60s with epics like benhur and look were they are in the cinema cannon having said that it is ironic then is the sort of film people say they dont make anymore it is true that some of camerons dialogue is not exactly shakespeare but everything else in the film more than makes up for it dicaprio and winslet are perfect as the lovers crossing the class divide and bland lines aside camerons story is cleverly structured in developing the love story from the dinner scene as wisconsin boy dicaprio holds his own against the snobs hes sitting with to the detailing of the sinking itself cameron as director triumphs totally at three hours long the film feels more like 90 minutes the recreation of the both afloat and going under is brilliant spectacular and thrilling cameron coaxes superb performances from his cast with zane the stand out among the supporting players as a nicely nasty villain and james horners beautiful music score enhances the mood of the film perfectly hits all the emotional targets with more inspiration that is common among todays big budget films and the amount of effort that has gone into it from the acting and not just the production is there for all to see even if you hated it you cant deny that 200 million was up the on the screen,sad
wow  it only took me one viewing to decide on making this my favorite movie  kate winslet gave a fabulous oscarworthy performance as young rose and leo was really good as jack dawson  even though this movie is over three hours long the viewer will get so wrapped up in the intensity of the film they wont even realize the length  go see it,sad
in 1912 the was a technological triomph and it is again today  james cameron is one of the greatest people that ever lived he is right up there with george lucas and jim hensen  the completion of that movie was nothing short of sheer greatness  the dramatic camera effects all the way to the computerized extras is almost the greatest movie ever made now the reason i say almost is because there just had to be a nudie scene to ruin it for everybody with standards  i myself would not even see it until i was able to purchase it and have it edited but it was immensely worth the trouble of getting it edited now the movie would not be near as great without the strong effort on the soundtrack sidejames hornerthe music fits the movie more perfectly then any other movie i have ever seen in my life  james horner is probably the greatest composer the lived,sad
i think the best deserved award for this movie was the best soundtrack oscar imagine without its marvellous music both action and emotional scenes in the movie but especially emotional wouldnt be the same if we watched it without the music james horner created i think both music and images are 50 important in the final result but some movies have their main weight in their music,sad
this is much better than word of mouth led me to believe of course the script is corny and full of simplistic sentiment and it panders shamelessly to midbrow sensitivities and theres no question that the main intent is to jerk mass tears but we could have guessed that from the subject still the photography is wonderful kate winslet is captivating and the plot clever this is an old time hollywood movie made not only to seduce the audience but the academy as well and it succeeds billy zane is perfectly onedimensional and completely familiar as the conceited and selfish immoral heir to a gilded age fortune kate winslet as his intended is a ravishing beauty with oomph and a mind of her own leonardo dicaprio as the wily and clever sketch artist who seduces her while twice saving her life comes across curiously as part huck finn and part john boy his romantic bravado in the freezing water saying he was so lucky to have won the steamship ticket because it allowed him to meet her was enough to embarrass even the most hardened harlequin novelistmost of the action before the bow scene was almost painful because just about every line was written so that a tenyearold could understand what he was supposed to feel about whom evil decadent rich people good clever hard working poor people they even party better clich followed clichbut the romantic bow scene was artfully staged and after that kate came to life it was strange to see her in the early scenes she seemed almost a bad actress as though the mediocrity of the direction had reduced her but her part was so big and she had so much to do that her natural talent overcame the early junior high school text and the later schmaltzsince the audience knows the ending director james cameron knew he had a fine opportunity for dramatic irony but his touch was a bit heavy handed eg as theyre boarding a guy says were the luckiest sons of bitches in the world and since the audience knows eightyfive years of history unknown to the passengers we get these further heavy bits of irony on picasso he wont amount to a thing trust me and freud who is heis he a passengermy sensitivities were most offended however when cameron has the savage crew smugly celebrate their good fortune before the safe they have hauled up is actually opened that was the tip off for everybody in the audience to wisely know there would be little of value in the safe duh in real life those guys dont celebrate until the gold is in the hand camerons style is to flatter the audience make them think theyre smart the usual pandering of a mediocre talent cameron even tries his hand at some cheap symbolism ie mommie tells rose that she must marry this suffocating and insufferable man because they need the money as she vigorously tightens roses confining corsetall right why did the academy vote this best picture simply because it was a popular lavish production squarely in the hollywood tradition employing a whole bunch of movie folk and it was a financial success just what the industry craves i should add that everything technical in the film was excellent and camerons dramatic direction was a lot better than his dialogue also because of the exquisite detail watching the big ship sink was a whole lot of funnote over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book cut to the chaise lounge or i cant believe i swallowed the remote get it at amazon,sad
im pretty sure that most people who strongly argue that this film sucks are merely determined to not liking it not that i dont see their points the dialogue is fairly stupid and the characters are pretty stereotypical but that doesnt alter the fact that its probably one of the grandest films of all time and to spite you nonbelievers i might add that it will become a classic much like gone with the wind  and theres nothing you can do about itthe performance of winslet and dicaprio lifts the dialogue and the entire scenery is so magnificent theres none to match it as for detail and camerons eye for excesses i dont think there was one single penny lost to this film all of it bears a sensation of reality that is just way above anything else ive encounteredive enjoyed camerons films for several years and it saddens me to think that this man had to make a drama albeit the best of dramas to be recognized as the great director he is i long for his next projectand to those few who hasnt seen it yet please dont listen to your friends who didnt like it think for yourselves,sad
the trouble with seeing any film in the midst of all its hype is that you can never pass a judgment on the film alonei didnt see at the cinema trying to avoid the hype you see but waited until i had a free afternoon and watched it at home on video what a moviesome imbd users have called it historically inaccurate romantic rubbish what did you expect if you want to see a documentary about the there are plenty available if you dont want to see a romance i suggest you look for a film that doesnt have two of cinemas darlings embracing on all the postersthe best way to enjoy this film is simply to go with it ignore the fact that some of the cgi is too obvious and ignore the fact that leo looks more like kates younger brother than a convincing lover let the film tug at your emotions and if by the end youre not crying at roses collection of photos then youre probably not the sort of person who should see moviesis a great movie,sad
it was a great movie a heart felt perspective on a heart felt tragedy the movie was awesome  very few historically accurate movies can be this good its worth all 600 million it has brought in at the box office,sad
james camerons is quite simply one of the greatest films ever made the intricate love story set on board one of the 20th centurys worst disasters was superb the score the visuals the special effects the acting etcall combined to make this film the phenomenal achievement that it is this film pulls you back in time to 1912 on board the famous ship with its doomed passengers you come to feel close to jack and rose all the while aware that certain doom is just ahead of them the film is sobering and fittingly emotional as too many lost their lives husbands and wives torn apart forever as were large and small families and of coursejack and rose at least until the end when rose finally passes away and returns to jackon board is absolutely spellbinding engrossing and an incredible film experience a definite 10,sad
is a very good movie and a wonderful love story but along the way something happened people got all carried away and started saying it was the best movie of all times then the publicity started to become more and more present and then the oscars 11 for those who might not already know more publicity and it kept on going people got tired to hear about it and started saying it wasnt that good and even that it was bad i even said it im not proud now this movie isnt the best movie ever but you cant deny the fact that it is well directed well written well played not boring and thus that it is a pretty good film,sad
i think james camerons is the best movie ever made it offers something for everybody i think that leonardo dicaprio should have at least been nominated for the oscar for best actor the film was well acted and well scripted the visual effects are unmatched there simply is no better movie,sad
wasis a very popular film  the story of is fascinating which meant that many people wanted to see this movie this movie could have been one of the best ever madeat least in the genre if it hadnt been for leonardo dicaprio  i hate dicaprio he is a very poor actor and very nearly destroys this movie  however the other actors are excellent it has a solid director on board and the best soundtrack ever composed is also an important movie that every human on earthat least in western societies should see once in their lifetime 710,sad
now when people hears that word doesnt think with the ship anymore now the people thinks about kate winslet or leonardo dicaprio some even think about james cameron and some just think of the movie itself but is not the anymore is the movie of people knows better than even gone with the wind it was just a great social event some people loved it enjoyed the great direction of james cameron with the beautiful soundtrack of mr horner and the great visual effects reconstructing the terrible event of the some other people thought it was another stupid romantic film the lovers of van damme thought so and some just hated it because of leo jealousy reasons they will not recognize theyll just say he is the worst actor they ever seen not true what is for sure is that nobody got out of the movie theater without an opinion i have to say that not much directors could do what mr cameron did but we should congratulate them and we should congratulate each actoroh i just think that if james cameron can make sink the again he should have taken care that kate winslet and mrs stuart dont have the same color eye so you can see that one has blue eyes and the other has brown eyes well if you havent seen it yet congratulations not much people can say so,sad
i may be a guy but this movie really hit me in the heart im not the kind of guy that likes to pick a fight like every other man does i got emotions too the first time i saw it seemed to pass by really fast sure i admit its a long movie but it felt like a ten minute cartoon before i knew it it was over what im trying to say is dont pass this one up if you look into this movie very closely you will see what i mean im surprised isnt in the top 250 movies,sad
i voted a 910 partly because the romance did drag on a bit too long the ship didnt hit the iceberg until 1 12 hours through the movie after seeing this movie 3 times in the theatre i was very bored with it but reluctantly bought it on tape anyways it can be considered a masterpiece however the acting was very good the story could have used several improvements to keep it more interestingafter the ship hit the iceberg things got exciting this was the part of the movie i really enjoyed those who didnt see it in the theatre can never get the real feel of the movie when the screams are blasting at you it was excitingif you havent seen this movie yet i suggest you rent it and sit down at least through the boring first part until the ship starts sinking and it gets interesting,sad
is truly an epic motion picture and in my opinion one of the best films of all time  the movie has a deep and powerful center to it that cannot be accurately described in words  all i can say is that i felt like it was more like an experience than just a movie  you almost felt as if you were on the  everything about the movie is awesome from the soundtrack to the special effects  james cameron is a great director and i would like to thank him for making such an amazing film,sad
we just saw the movie now and after two years of hype i was ready for disappointment but i wasnt a bit i was spellbound from start to finish when jack and rose hit the water i took a deep breath weve actually watched it through twice in the same week that never happens was well done in every aspect acting music effects realism we never noticed a model or a computerenhancement not that we looked too hard while we were wrapped up in this story even though i knew how it ended i couldnt wait to see what happens next,sad
since all the things there is to say about this film has allready been said im not gonna say anything about itexcept if you have not seen this masterpiece by james cameron what are you waiting for go out there and rent itor buy it this is a movie not to be missed spectacular worldclass effects excellent acting magnificent story wonderful photography superb music alive with tense atmosphere its camerons best movie ever if that doesnt mean anything to you youve missed out on some very good moviesbut like said this is the best one and this is one movie you dont wanna miss,sad
is one great film that never falters in length talent or action but is not ever to be considered the 1 film of the 90s it may come as only a close second behind schindlers list kate winslet is a promising character actress but leo dicaprio is destined to play only contemporary parts well his take on romeo in william shakespeares romeo and juliet 1996 was very 90s despite the faithfulness to wills original script and jack in was very much the same the man in the iron mask was pretty much of a flop on his part also billy zane after playing dozens of supporting parts now has a chance of proving himself a good leading man such as shown in tvs cleopatra as mark antony last may gloria stewart made a tremendous comeback after 45 years with her portrayal of old rose but millions were shocked when she didnt win the supporting actress oscar who did it go to miss kim basinger notorious for playing a prostitute in every movie shes made kathy bates is a perfect choice to play the unsinkable molly brown and frances fisher is a narrowminded wretch of a woman as roses mother ruth one who only cared about herself and her position in society now for sheer spectacle and brilliant music action and tension may qualify as the best action movie of the decade but not on a general allinall scale as a unique drama benhur 1959 finally met its match as the oscarwinning champ when tied with it as the film with the highest number of oscars 11 in all for both and the everpopular my heart will go on by celine dion is probably the greatest song written for a film since moon river of breakfast at tiffanys but lets not get carried away and glorify as the best film of the decade,sad
is one of the best movies of the decade interestingly it was the official script book that got me to notice this film  since i took pains to ignore when it first came out i thought the hype was a bit too much and i really hated celine dions performance on an otherwise excellent song now that i have seen the film i cant see what many people are complaining about the bstory of jack and roses romance is touching and never dull the historical facts are generally accurate except for a few minor errors but a lot of people forget this film is told from the point of view of a 101yearold woman i rarely find myself choking up watching a film but this show did it to me  the only other movie ever to make me cry is the excellent hawks 1989 repeated viewings of only make the experience better because you get to see different things each time by the way anyone staying away from because of celine dion will be happy to note her song doesnt appear until the closing credits   the rest of the time james horners exquisite work carries the film,sad
as usual i didnt get caught up in the hysteria and watch this film when it came out instead waiting for the film to arrive on tv  i must say i expected trash and instead was profoundly affected by the film  i thought the acting was very good a good performance from di caprio and kate winslet was positively gorgeous  i see many commenters say they observed closely di caprios acting and didnt like it but why watch a film to observe the acting  acting is good when you dont notice its acting  a script is good when you dont notice any bad lines  if you look specifically for things then youll watch a film in an artificial manner and find all sorts of things  is to be enjoyed for many reasons  the romance is sublime the special effects are dazzling the way classes were treated so differently is shocking the tragedy of seeing those passengers perish is haunting and stayed with me for a couple of days afterwards  all in all is a powerful film well directed and for me deserved many of the oscars it received  for once the hollywood blockbuster movie was worth the millions spent on it,sad
since i have commented on over 100 movies my collection may not seem complete without a comment for the grandest biggest most expensive and highest grossing film of all time you either loved it or hated it it was one of the films like pulp fiction or fargo which i loved both by the way and i know why everyone talked about it for months on end it is a grand film it isnt my favorite movie of all time some like it hot takes that title but it is worthy of a place on my video shelf kate winslet gives a powerful performance as rose and leo dicaprio is very good as well im not one of those girls who swoons over him but some of his movies have been enjoyable including gilbert grape and romeo and juliet kate was wonderful in heavenly creatures and sense and sensibility and she has become of of my favorite actresses because her roles are given from the heart she puts her best effort into her acting i must confess that i bought the movie the day that it came on video and have only watched it a few other times while i do enjoy the film very much i am glad that the hype has died down the effects and sets are oscarwinning and for a reason you will never see a boat bigger than this one a great job by all although many may view it as a chick flick hey my mother loved it too if you can spare three hours check it out or watch it again ill never let go i promise,sad
ive already seen four times the first time i saw it i didnt pay attention at the mistakes so i loved it and i would give it a 9 out of 10 or even 10 the second time i began to pay more attention specially at leonardo dicaprios acting this time i saw with my mother and she didnt like it at all i would give it a 8 the third time i saw at school and i found more mistakes a 7 the fourth and last i hope so a 6 out of 10 i think thats my final votethere are a lot of good things and a lot of bad things about kate winslet is a great actress the art direction the costumes the special effects oh perfect however james cameron change the actors except kate winslet into dolls we can see this in billy zanes and leonardo dicaprios acting and the script is so poor you know cameron was thinking he was the king of the world when he did this film and thats the result is sosops i dont see anything special about the sound track well i hate celine dion,sad
depending on what crowd youre a part of it may be cool to your friends to like everything that is popular without forming your own opinion  or conversely it might be cool to hate everything popular without thinking about it  this seems to be the basis of most amateur reviews of i ve read  the truth is that this is a terrific film which emotionally chronicles the death of 1500 people on a doomed luxury liner  every movie needs a plot though or the fantastic last third of the film would have no meaning  i am not a particular fan or detractor of either leo kate or james but all three work their professions to perfection  jim writes and directs the film with real feeling and intelligence and only in the movies is dialogue also perfect  there is never any confusion as to what is going on at any moment and leo and kate both give outstanding performances as the doomed lovers  the historical characters are cast with uncanny resemblance especially e j smith and the effects are so perfect that you hardly realize that what youre looking at is not real and probably wouldnt know if you hadnt been told  horners soundtrack is at first wondrous and becomes haunting as fate is sealed  my only bone is that cameron doesnt know port from starboard  the bottom line is that this is one of few films ive seen where the fate of the characters is of utmost importance to the viewer  you know kate survives the wreck and kathy bates as well but what about the rest  these characters have the feeling of being real breathing men and women and for good reason  many of them were  this is not a tragedy that belongs in a pop culture tug of war  ive seen the film only twice and have been moved both times  and perhaps the best thing about historical dramas like this is best summed up in hitchcocks own view on suspense  when the viewer knows the potential outcome but the characters dont hitchcock explained it as two men at a table discussing baseball while only the viewer is privy to the fact of a bomb ticking beneath the table is a marvelous film and the budget politics etc involved in the hollywood aspect of this memorable masterpiece are moot  if the film had not won an oscar it would still be among the five best films in the 100 year history of cinema,sad
what do and independence day have in common they have both been roundly derided for their technicalactingstory line when both films can stand alone for sheer entertainment what is it about this film that makes three hours in a cinema pass so quickly its not the suspense of not knowing what will happen next after all history tells us in graphic detail the fate of neither is it what happens to rose i mean the mere fact that rose tells the story as a hundred and one year old woman tells us that she survives so what is it about this film that makes it so enjoyable well its five things really 1 the romance between rose kate winslet and jack leonardo dicaprio 2 does jack survive 3 the gradual realisation of the fate of and how it takes place told with historical accuracy 4 the remarkably accurate detail of the ships whole interior 5 the special effects used during the sinking all in all forget about the films supposed lack of technical excellence poor storyline and trite dialogue and concentrate instead on the splendid entertainment on offer thanks to james camerons splendid direction the superb cinematography and the excellence of the two leads,sad
i believe that was overrated and should not be one of the greatest films of all time i will say it is a good film but the poor dialogue and the hackneyed story seems a little boring why did the movie win so many oscars it was the lack of quality movies that year there are many reasons didnt make the top 250 among the voters  the movie also showed a lot of nudity for a pg13 film and winslet shouldnt be showing her stuff,sad
the day james cameron makes the best film on earth is the day i hold a gun at a copy of star warsi think cameron has made some pretty good films none of them are on my favourites list not even this one but there was a definite style or quality that i just cant put my finger on its like my fascination with director jan de bonttwister he doesnt make the best films on earth but he could do if he opens up a little more or if he stops trying to be cool i believe this is also where cameron faultershe said his goal with this film was to show the world the brief and glorious life as well as the tragic irony in my opinion his goal was to convince people that what he had created was the best movie ever made and he succeeded i thought this was a good film but not the best film people have just become zombies when they were led to believe thisi will say this loud and clear i do not like leo i also believe that he like cameron is a fad that people have fallen for and not seen through no wonder they worked together on this film leo too could be a great actor if he would just let go of his egotistical nature and cool boy attitudeyes all im really complaining about in this film are the director and the lead actor the rest i thought was phenomenal the visual effectsi couldnt compare them to anything else that year the impressive acting the sets the costumes the inspired plottelling an untold and deliberately fictitious story about the and what could have happened had it not been for the iceberg and many more technical and psychological aspects cameron obviously wanted several life issues featured in this filmie class and social standing hope placing too much confidence in one thing and recieving nothing from it this i believe he achieved i thought his coverup goal of telling the story of what happened before the sank was achieved but his other goal creating the best film ever was notthis never should have won best picture at the oscars it never should have won even half of the awards at the academy awards ceremony i believe it only won those awards because there was nothing better that yeargood will hunting as good as it gets la confidential the full monty all were not worthy of the best picture role in my opinion i just thank the internet movie database for thinking the same as i discovered on the top 250 list when much to my relief this film wasnt listed9you know what should have won men in black,sad
i think people hate this film because they are letting the hype about the film interfere with how they see the film  dont judge a film based on outside influences  dont hate it because cameron is an egomaniac  dont hate it because 14 year old girls went 20 times just to see leo  dont hate it because they played that song 10 times a day for a year  hate it because you hate the movie itself what was on the screen and that alone if you but all the hype aside i think you will see a truly great film  a film that succeeds on many levels  special effects acting music action humor historical moral philosophical  did i miss one ill admit i love cameron films  i dont however typically like chick flicks and this is partially a chick flick  but it is also an action flick does it go on to long  i say about 5 minutes  i hate the part with the stupid kid screaming alone in the hallway  other than that its perfect in just about every way  i graduated from film school and nothing i saw there came close to this film,sad
provoked polarized reactions from its first screening  for many it was the greatest movie ever made some patrons were reliably reported to have seen it more than thirty times and it became by far the highestgrossing production in cinematic history  but a fairly large minority of people both in the average filmgoing public and among the critics felt that the craze was much ado about nothing and many of them bitterly resented its bloated budget which they felt could have gone to far worthier films  two years after its release the ardency of fans is no longer quite so hot but its detractors seem to grow ever more bitter and thus a backlash has snapped out against the movie that has driven it from its former place at number one  in internet movie database voting to a place completely off the top 250  its become passe to like but i still like it  a whole lot in fact  and while i dont think it ever belonged in the 1 spot ranking it below mediocre stuff like the phantom menace 199 or forrest gump 172 just isnt fairis the story of two fictional passengers on the white star lines most famous vessel  rose bukater kate winslet is the child of a family high in social class but deeply in debt roses mother frances fisher plans to rectify this by betrothing rose to the rich but odious cal hockley billy zane  jack dawson leonardo dicaprio is a penniless dockworker who has won his ticket on the in a poker game  rose having gotten a good look at just what her future with cal hockley will be like attempts suicide but is stopped by jack which sparks a brief but memorably passionate romance between them under the shadow of the disaster we know awaits the shipif you had told me in 1996 that james cameron would direct a movie which had no violence or chase scenes for the first two hours i would have laughed in your face  i honestly had no idea that cameron was capable of gentle scenes so rich with humor affection and grand spectacle  the greatest ship ever launched comes to life and we get the grand tour from the massive throbbing engines to the graceful swanlike prow  we get a sense of just how grand this voyage was for all participants rich or poorleonardo dicaprio shouldnt have been the sole focus of this movies popularity  not that he does a bad job he always delivers camerons sometimes strained lines believably and sincerely and he does some fine work in a difficult late scene where he has to mix fury and love in the same moment simultaneously kissing and berating rose when she stays with him rather than flee in a lifeboat  but kate winslets performance is the real meat of  her large liquid eyes can be heartmelting when she wishes  she perfectly simulates the mixed embarrassment and joy she feels as jack teaches her to break down the inhibitions that her class and upbringing have placed on her  and at one point she delivers a kind of stuck for words expression that is so perfect that she couldnt have done it better if she really had forgotten her linesbilly zane has a comparatively easy job as the villainous cal hockley its a onenote role and zane plays it that way  while hes certainly not the most interesting villain ever to appear on screen comparisons of him to snidely whiplash are unfair  hockley is not motiveless he is merely one of those men who thinks of women as property rather than as human beings there are millions of hockleys in the world today and you can see the wreckage they leave in their wake in any battered womens shelter hockleys character is perfectly realistic just not particularly deepmy favorite supporting actor in this movie was victor garber in the quiet and understated role of thomas andrews shipwright  of his many fine moments the best is his reaction to bruce ismays anguished protest this ship cant sink  shes made of iron sir  i assure you she can almost any other actor handed that line would have delivered it with contempt and sarcasm  but garber does it more with a mixture of disbelief and real pity as he realizes that the man he is facing is emotionally incapable of facing realitycertainly has many flaws  the framing story is sometimes mishandled making the first half hour drag  the humorous wisecracks while funny are often very poorly timed and undercut the drama of the scenes since cameron has to tell his story during the brief duration of the voyage roses transformation from inhibited prisoner of class expectations to free and independent woman is too hasty  cameron also at times seems intent on demonizing the rich just for being rich a tad hypocritical for a man who risked and made millions on this movie  and the dialogue has more than its share of melodramatic lines and the odd cliche though winslet and dicaprio deliver it so well that i generally didnt mindstill there is great power in camerons invitation to become attached to something you know is doomed  some refuse to take the risk but not wisely everything that you become attached to is doomed sooner or later  you get two choices meet your own doom without ever having been attached to something at all or meet it with at least the memory of how good the ride was while it lastedrating  12 out of ,sad
how does one describe the perfect film in order to answer this question one must watch the perfect film in this case is the perfect filmit owned all the qualities that make a film 1 action drama suspense romance and action is the personification of excellence and perfectionit contained brilliant performances by kate winslet leonardo dicaprio billy zane and kathy batesi was truly impressed by the performance of billy zanes cal who was the jealous fiance to kate winslets rose the casting director knew what he was doing when he chose zane because the role role was played with such ease the set design and costumes that overseen by  director james cameron was done with careful attention to detail the accuracy of the set and costumes was superb it was not easy to tell the difference whether or not it was made or reali have seen seven times and will continue to see as long as i own the movie because it was that well donethis continues to be one of the best films i have seen everyone should see it again,sad
is a movie about a ship called and it takes place in 1912leaves on a journey from england and is on the way to new york but it never gets there because hits an iceberg and sinksyou all should know this story because it happens to be a true storybut this movie tells also about two people falling in love in the shipthese two people are the rich rose dewitt bukater played by kate winslet and the poor jack dawson played by leonardo dicaprioand then there is also roses angry boyfriend cal hockleyplayed by billy zanegloria stuart plays the old roseso everything goes pretty fine before hits the iceberg was pretty successful movieaccording to all the oscars it gotbut was worth every oscarsnot necessarilythe topic of the movie was good and it touched many of us but the love story in was pretty boring only the rest part when is sinking is more absorbingtoo long this movie is i could saybut this works pretty well anyway,sad
the movie was heavily marketed and as such i expected great things from it fortunately it lived up to the hype which is rare  after seeing it in the theatre and loving it i tried to watch it on video a few months later but couldnt  it is extremely slow once you know the story line definitely worth watching once but not worth owning,sad
this is a great movie no matter what anyone says the storyline actors everything is just wonderful i personally think that gloria stuart should have gotten the oscar for her portrayal as old rose she did a wonderful job as did kate winslet leo dicaprio and billy zane this is one movie that i will never get tired of,sad
this along with schindlers list is the greatest movie that ive seen even though its very different from schindlers list has all elements together romance drama suspense acting and stunning special effects no wonder it won 11 academy awardsits not coincidence that millions of people went to watch it over and over again  1010,sad
whoever makes a movie about the most famous shipwreck of all time will inevitably run the gauntlet of criticism for this part or that part being correctnot correct in general camerons version is a reasonably correct version of the known facts  not including the two fictional lead roles  some points about the crews behaviour  particularly lightoller  as shown in the movie are open to debate however the whole truth will never be fully known one fact that never seems to have been mentioned in any movie to date that i know of is that the white star line was part of the american imm shipping combine owned by american tycoon john pierpont morgan the vessel was crewed by british officers to give the impression of a british operation therefore morgan  who was extremely proud of  and devastated by her loss  would have taken a great interest in her specifications of course ultimately captain smith and those on board issuing orders must shoulder any blame for sinking apart from disputes over historical facts the film is magnificent few directors would be able to control such a huge production as cameron has the sets are stunning and the computer graphics top of the line the movies 3 hours seem to pass very quickly the love subplot is well constructed and ably acted  although leonardo di caprio seems a touch lightweight in places  billy zane and david warner both stand out as villains and of course there is the lovely kate winslet in fine acting form a must for any video library,sad
i admit i am not a leonardo dicaprio fan but what he did to this movie is fantastic would not be this big without leo he totally outact himself the story is truly one of the best love stories of all time right there on top with movies like somewhere in time and when harry met sally,sad
an excellent film which gave a real sense of what it must have been like to be involved in such a disaster with almost no hope of rescue the real star is the ship but kate winslet and billy zane give great performances many of the smaller roles are excellent particularly crew members the irish band are brilliantthe costumes are gorgeous and the attention to detail is top class leonardo di caprio makes a good fist of his role but really any half way competent actor could have done the job overall thoughthe only main reservation is the script,sad
i thought that this was an excellent movie that combined fact and fiction like i had never seen before  the effects were amazing the research of the facts for the making of the movie had to be extensive and for the most part well acted and written  although leos character said rose too much  i was not impressed with the acting on leos part when he has to be the hero  he played a poor guy rather well though  also kates character went from coldhearted to mildhearted a little too fast for my liking  but then it would be a 5 hour movieive been forever waiting for the release of the dvd  now that its here i am truly disappointed  no special features what so ever  there are enough effects research and actual fact that could have been put on to the disk maybe on the other side  the one thing i do like about the dvd is not having to switch tapes  however they could have edited the two parts together better there is nothing really special about the dvd,sad
this film of the legend is amazing well except one thing the millions of dollars couldnt help the main acting dicaprio and winslet did indeed not fit in here at all this is too sweet cameroon was it ment for fourteen year old girls or i really like cameroonfilms but if you like to see some really good sets then this is one of the best nobody is perfect thoughscenes 10 of 10 acting 2 of 10,sad
this is probably the greatest movie ever made the love story is so beautiful and the attention to detail is excellent the acting is amazing and the special effects are breathtaking a true classic no matter what you like in movies be it romance adventure drama comedy tragedy special effects it is all in this one movie and as a student of history the attention to historical details is wonderful,sad
am i the only one who got this movie  a luxury liner bound for the states is struck by an iceberg and with inadequate safeguards sinks quickly claiming the lives of 1500 souls this movie in very delicate ways brings this point homeby intertwining the lives of a firstclass passenger rose and a thirdclass passenger jack the moviegoer is thrust into both worlds slowly and tragically we witness how money means everything in the early 1900s to the point of overlooking security thus eliminating an adequate number of lifeboats because they make the deck look too cluttered  i never knew until seeing this film that white star staff literally locked the gates so that thirdclass passengers could not emerge to board the boats  irish genecidethe computergenerated images of the titantic tearing apart and sinking are breathtaking so much so that when i first saw this film in the theatre viewers alternately wept and gasped at the inhumanity of it all  those poor victims of a moneyworshipping world  the circumstances of it all truly disgusts me,sad
this is the movie with everything  if you have not seen this movie youre missing out on a unique experience  what i liked best about this movie is that every time i watch it i feel like im there with the characters and that those characters are real people some actually were this movie does have one flaw  there are points in the movie where the dialogue becomes rather corny  however this can also work to the films advantage to make you believe that it is taking place in a more naive time,sad
first of all was on the whole and all things considered a good movie  there have been much sillier best picture awards handed out over the years  ill go through the basic drill as quickly as possible   yes the was huge  as they say  and astounding to watch yes the musical score was intolerable synthesised neoceltic syrup yes kate winslet was gorgeous and at one point naked yes the story was pleasant but pretty thin for three hours  have i covered everything  probably not but i want to move on to complain about the very end  the final few minutes contain footage that is just so manifestly stupid so completely unnecessary so obviously witless that even if its not enough to ruin the movie james cameron ought never be allowed to hear the end of it  the trouble is that i cant lodge my complaint without giving some stuff away so i feel obliged to issue awarningto those people wherever they may be who have not yet seen  which i hope they will ignore  go on  have a peek  it cant really hurt you to know what youre in for  its not me but james cameron who wants to lull you into quiescence for three hours and then hit you over the head with a big stupid mackerel  that said ill issue asecond warningbefore getting down to businessmy complaint is in two parts1  a good deal of interest was supplied as we watched the diamond change hands throughout the movie wondering where it would end up when the ship finally sank  well it ends up  this is your last chance to stop reading  in roses hands  she keeps it  in fact she has it on her person seventysomething years later when she heads out into the atlantic to meet the salvagers  then she wanders out to the railing one night and tosses it into the ocean  why toss it into the ocean  if she doesnt need the money then the poor sods who invested heavily in order to find the diamond probably do  why not give them the diamond  and what right does she have to effectively destroy this historical heirloom former property of louis xiv  clearly cameron thought that having made such heavy weather of the diamond early on he needed to do something with it at the end and he thought that throwing it into the sea would be very fine and dramatic dramatic fiddlesticks2  rose finally dies at a ripe old age and goes to a kind of heavenly where she is reunited with her true love jack  but hang on shes been married for several decades to some other bloke who presumably has some claim on her affections in the afterlife  i bet therell be an awkward moment on the hms celestial when he shows up  but overglorifying her no doubt genuine love for jack is the least of it why the sudden dive into the supernatural  one minute were in the material universe with the rest of the human race the next were up in the sky somewhere  im surprised they didnt give us a shot of cal hockley stoking the boilers in hell  ive heard some people run the defence that this is all just a dream  this strikes me as a strained interpretation and even if its the right interpretation its a poor defence  dreams are dramatically irrelevant  at least this one isthese two complaints arent trivial theyre illustrative of a more general problem  the wondrous spectacle of is more than twice undercut by camerons facile theatrics  still  big ship adolescent love kate winslet lots of water and all that,sad
like everybody that attended i knew the ship would sink but i was hoping that it wouldnt i wanted the movie to forget about the destruction of the ship and carry on with the story of rose and jack the two lovebirds that james cameron based his fictional story on but i knew it had to happen the ship hit that damned iceberg fortunately the film only got betterthis is a fabulous film worthy of each oscar that it received the chemistry between the leads will never be matched personally i think kate winslet and leonardo di caprio were made for each other the supporting cast are excellent the ships builder the captain molly brown and of course gloria stuart in a sensational performance but there is no denying it this is james camerons film his script has many flaws but his direction is flawless this man knows every trick in the book and he pulls everything together as a romance as an action movie as a historic drama its a success james cameron is a wizard and he deserved his moment of narcissism at the oscars well done jamesps if you didnt see it at the cinema wait until there is a cinema rerelease the films is a lot less effective on the small screen,sad
it takes a decade or so before narrowminded people see beyond the hype and enjoy a movie for what it is  and other megahits may have made tons of cash but this fact should not persuade or dissuade anyone from enjoying the movie  just remember was not hyped up like the phantom menace was  success was due almost entirely to being a good movie and appealing to a very wide audience range  if you want to hate a movie for being its marketing hate phantom menace or blair witch cameron has been my favorite director since aliens and this movie made him a household name as he deserves  i cant stress it enough be objective judge a movie on the movie not on its marketing  just remember other directors sell themselves out and spend more time marketing their movies than making them lucas and spielberg  cameron has never done this  he may be a jerk but he has integrity and simply loves to make movies as shows  he doesnt care how much money they make,sad
james camerons recordbreaking epic yesterday sailed into stores in the first dvd edition paramount has done an outstanding job of bringing the pictorial and auditory splendor of this film to its latest video incarnation watching this story unfold after about a year reminds one of what a cinematic masterpiece it is cameron has used many of the tried and true movie conventions to great effect  slow motion enhances the lovers flight through the engine rooms using the glow of the furnaces to foreshadow the romantic scene to come and the ensuing tragic events  instead of constantly bombarding the viewer with a blaring soundtrack in the sequence just before the ship finally sinks the director uses the spare violins playing  near my god to thee as the captain the architect and other characters near their approaching doom the sound design also includes some extremely effective use of surround sound as rose kate winslet searches the bowels of the ship for jack leonardo dicaprio the creaks of the nearcollapsing hull of the ship envelop the viewer as does the sometimes soaring and sometimesquiet musical score of composer james newton howardperformances are impassioned all around kathy bates is both humorous as she dresses dicaprio and touching as she observes the foundering ship in its final moments francis fisher portrays roses selfish mother in such a way that even though she is selfish and bigoted you somehow understand her when she laces up roses corset and explains her reasons for desiring a marriage for wealth rather than love she holds a mirror up to the society of class distinctions that would be disappearing with the sinking of the ship eric braeden has too few scenes as john jacob astor however he is perfect in projecting that image of new american wealth and class surely many of his scenes ended up on the cutting room floor in the excellent cdrom james camerons explorer astor searches frantically for his dog as the sea engulfs the ship victor garber is most sympathetic as architect his final moments setting a clock as he awaits the inevitable is memorable bernard hill is the captain smith hill imbues this oft portrayed character with a subtlety so you sense his frustration as he realizes that his hands are tied as the ship sinks from under him in a  scene with a steerage class mother who asks him where she must  go to a lifeboat he just barely shrugs and turns away from her jonathan hyde is the steamship lines representative and a major heavy in his insistence that the ship break speed records and his quiet slinking on to a lifeboat to save his own neck incidentally he lived the rest of his life in shame and seclusion of course the tale is carried along by the expert thesping of dicaprio and winslet as the starcrossed lovers their travels throughout the length and breadth of the magnificent expanse of ocean liner give the viewer a perfect sense of the luxury and size of although their characters are fictional they bring them gloriously to life so that in the end one really cares whether they live or dieone hopes that cameron will in the future release a collectors deluxe edition including deleted scenes and a detailed making of feature giving the digital effects crew a chance to show how some of the fantastic special effects made everything seem so real what made the effects so special is that they were unnoticeable cameron has made a film for the ages it has earned all of the many awards it has won its place as a classic will only be realized with the passage of time however its records as the most popular american film to date will probably not be broken for many years to come,sad
has taken on a bad rap for being thin on plot and heavy on budget some argue that the films mass popularity came in part because it was designed to sell out to audiences  i have even heard a few cynics trash the movie for it not being completely historically accurate  dont listen to these people is actually very good  yes the sweet romance between jack and rose contains some typical love story elements and bigtime bucks were spent to give the movie a sense of cinematic greatness  so what director james cameron should be proud of his work  the talented cast never failed at bringing out my emotionshappiness and sadnessand the scenery is breathtaking i feel everyone put a effort into the making of this picture and it deserves to be noticed,sad
not only is the greatest film ever made it is truly the greatest thing made by the hands of man this comment is limited to 1000 words  i would need a limitless page to explain why but i will say this the represented everything that the people of 1912 hoped that this century would be like it represented the illusion that we had finally conquered nature but we were wrong when billy zane says it is unsinkable  god himself could not sink this ship  you can almost see high above the clouds god saying oh yeah well see about that  the movie  is not only a mesmerising beautifully made heartwrenching uncompromisingly realistic film but it is a true meditation on not only mankinds progress through this century which began at the end of the gilded age and is now finishing at the dawn of the digital age and on the human condition itself james cameron having established himself as the action maestro with aliens and t2 finally proved not only that he was willing to totally defy and redefine the auteur theory to ignore the cynics and the unfathomable opinions of people who think that a night to remember is the definitive account of the disaster calling planet earth do you think that on a sinking ship without enough lifeboats for everyone everything would be done in a smooth cool calm orderly fashion eh and forget about codes conventions and film theory in order to make the film the way he saw fit but that he is a human being when steven spielberg made schindlers list in my opinion the 2 film of all time it was a big break considering among other things the fact that he had just finished jurassic park but he had made real human dramas before  the color purple and empire of the sun cameron had shown that action movies could have real production values but a true human drama was a totally new thing the film had to be made before this century was out i was only two when camerons big break  the terminator was released but i can imagine a lot of people thinking that this man would be the one to make the movie technology versus mankind anyone as well as the powerful messages more than youre likely to find in a stateoftheart digital communication system the film has unchallengably breathtaking grandeur aweinspiring beauty an excellent cast a moving storyline and totally absorbing and thoughtprovoking entertainment when cameron and fellow producer jon landau received the best picture academy award last year the final moment was the moment cameron had been building up to throughout his career he summarised what the film meant to him and spoke as human being not as a hollywood director when he called for a moments silence in honour of the 1500 men women and children who went down with the ship by faithfully recreating the disaster and giving it mass appeal in uncountable ways cameron has made a document of the human condition the 20th century and what it brought about and social moral and technological progress that will surely stand the test of time and maybe one day when those snobbish critics have a live life to the full you never know when it could end experience will make them realise that citizen kane excellent but overrated is not the greatest film ever made but then we are all human beings and we are all different and the right to freedom of expression is a right we all should have  one of the films many messages perfect freedom does not exist but we can be free from oppression if we let other people and exterior forces work with us in the ship in question represents roses gilded cage and the limitations of her society but ultimately it she sorry becomes her means of salvation  both in that itshe brings her to jack and in that itshe sinks therefore changing the lives of all the survivors dramatic license works its wonders in the scene when jack and rose go up on deck having just been doing it in the car rose decides that she is going to forsake her money and her family and get off at new york with jack she kisses him the lookouts look down and see them  but when they look ahead what do they see the rest is history although many critics were critical of this film the fact that it is both the most popular and the most honoured film of all time is a testimony to the value we place upon our freedom and upon life itself not a day goes by when i dont think about the awesome wonder of that film neither will i ever forget how it changed my life every time i watch it i notice something new james cameron is the greatest artist in the history of mankind dedication passion and commitment were taken to new levels with i could go on forever you know,sad
youd think that with all the movies out there about the the last thing the world needed was yet another version  wrongthis movie was not only wonderful in its recreation of the ship and its passengers but the anthony and cleopatra love story between jack and rose was heartbreaking  how many of us can say weve had that one love that shook us to the core that one love that we carry in our heart for the rest of our life  not me  not yetso lets get into this story  rich girl meets poor boy and yet they manage through all the tragedy that surrounds this ship to hold on to each other until the end  lets talk about heartbreakingwho can forget the mother who tucked her children into bed telling them a bed time story so they wouldnt suffer when the end came  and what about the mother cradling her infant as she floated in the frozen water  whose eyes were still dry after that scenewas i really there for three hours and fifteen minutes  did i become so engrossed in these peoples lives that rich or poor my heart cried for each and every one of them  yes and yesif you havent seen this movie run do not walk to your nearest video store if you have then see it again  it gets better every time,sad
this is more like two movies in one its divided to two parts the love story the ship sinking at first we see what seems to be a documentry about the but isnt then we see how old rose gloria stewert tells her story in which at first we see jack dicaprio and rose winslet meet have a love story parents disagree kinda like romeo  juliet which is also a dicaprio film then we have a break and then the ship crashes into the iceberg which mostly shows how people try to survive and then in the end well i wont say the end if you take away the effects you have one of the greatest love stories of all times with low budget effects and if you take away the love story you have one of the greatest adventure films basicly the film won 11 oscars and became tho most grossing movie in boxoffice history ita good movie if you havent seen it where were you the past 2 years go see it it wont hurt you ot james cameron ok i was foucusing too much on comedy on this review sorry anyway to make a long review short rent the movie if you dont like it turn it off id recommend it a long with a billion other people ok less,sad
im an avid fani have been collecting memorabilia on the for 15 yrs i have seen the movie  with leo and kate 27 timesi thoroughly enjoy the movieif you could send me any websites or information on it would be greatly appreciatedthank you for your time in reviewing my comments on theincerly robert hooper,sad
is a wonderful film that is why it got all the attention it got it was completely oscarworthy leo was robbed of an oscar for all the idiots out there who keep bashing this film and the acting well id just love to see you go up and act if leo wasnt an excellent actor he wouldnt be where he is today completely deserved all the oscars and the attention it got and it will not soon be forgotten a classic it can totally rival gone with the winda lot of people are really being unfair to this movie saying the only reason it got all the attention was because of leocrazed teenage girls this isnt true a lot of people went to see it not just teenage girls it became the wonderful classic it is because of its wonderful enduring love story that touched the hearts of millions worldwide i think all of the fools who keep bashing this film are jealous dont ask me what their jealous of they just are rules,sad
the only reason this movie did extremely well at the box office was because of all those girls watching it about 12 times why because of leo personally ive got nothing against him and his acting is fine really nothing spectacular but adequate kate winslet was better though acting in general was goodthe special effects are superb it is one of those rare movies in which you dont think hey that computer animation is good because you dont get the feeling that it is actually a computer animation the is realsince the story was a bit too simple ship hits iceberg ship sinks there had to be some kind of lovestory and romance the perfect combination of course it is still deceptively simple girl is about to marry guy she doesnt like falls in love with good looking boy boy falls in love with girl other guy goes mad ship hits iceberg ship sinks end of story but somehow cameron succeeds in making it look like an extremely complicated storyin the end this movie provides a great atmosphere good acting superb effects and a simple but effective storyline if you havent seen it yet you really should go out and rent it,sad
i have been fascinated by the rms since i was 8 years old so i had very high expectations for  i was not disappointed  although the script did drag its feet at times and it was came a slight bit close to being on the trite side cameron has done a remarkable job of recreating what remains one of the most tragic events of the century despite a few historical and social inaccuracies is fantastici have often morbidly wondered what it would have been like to be on this ship on her voyage  camerons film gives one a good feel for what it must have been like from two perspectivesaside from the herself the first shot of the ship in all the glory of her youth will take your breath awayliterally kate winslet turns in a truly wonderful performance   winslet breathes life and beauty into the character of rose and is pleasing and easily believable to watch billy zane also does a fine job here as do the very talented frances fischer and kathy bates  fisher is particularly and frighteningly convincing as roses domineering societallyobsessed motherignore all of the littlegirl squeals about leo men read this lol is successful because it runs the viewer through the gamut of human emotion from a joyous high to a wrenching piteous lowand everything in between  if anything the special effects make truly worthwhile,sad
i must have seen this movie millions of times  i stopped counting after i got to 25 which was yonks ago i must admit the first time i saw it was when it was my brothers birthday i was to go and watch it at the cinema with the family three hours seems long time but once you get hooked onto it like me you will soon need the video the book the poster and the tshirt  im now only working in getting the starman himself thats leo  though it does seem very hard to get him ive been tring it for a long time now and all ive managed to get is a signature ok i better start talking about the film itself now so hows this it starts off with a card game leo who plays jack is playing a game of poker with his best mate phbritso he is playing against someone who we dont no the name of and a bloke called sven  jack has the winning hand he gains along with other things two tickets for the for himself and phbritso in the storage 3rd class  since jack is a person of limited needs as rose calls him some poor bloke he isnt dressed in the finest of clothes  though he does look totally great when hes been shined up like a new penny  anyway this film will touch everyone  if you have already seen it then my advise to you is to go watch it again  oh yes and if anyone knows leo tell him to get in touch with me this film will touch you in every possible way through hate despite love romance drama and most of all tragdey i give it a super ten out of ten  top marks from me  remember go watch it if you havent seen it before  its one you will rememberlove sall84   leo go e mail me now please,sad
it seems that cameron did a decent job of recreating the physical atmosphere of the ship  his attention to detail is noteworthy but the movie is so overdone  are we to believe that some extremely recognizable art works went down to the bottom with the rest of roses belongings  is it really necessary to have rose swimming through freezing water with what an axe in her teeth  does the jilted fiance really have to start firing bullets at the height of the crisis  it is so easy to rattle off a number of pictures from 1997 that were so very much better starting with the sweet hereafter l a confidential good will hunting and as good as it gets  there are many more before we ever get to this one,sad
many critics like the one in nbc who got to the point of showing a cartoon with a ship sinking into the waters of failure seemed certain that we would watch a new tragedy overbudgeted late release etc james cameron never seemed to be one those men who dream of doing something no one dares doing and keep that dream alivehe never looked to be a dreamer thats the problem with most people and directors and writers nowadays butwow was i wrong he had a dream he awaited the opportunityand he did itthis movie has a greek tragedy dimension to it and also an epic proportion that most tv movies and hollywood movies do notyou cant help but feel very close to the characters irrespective of their being historical or fictional the soundtrack and the acting achieve something that together with camera positioning and ship and costumes details has put behind every documentary and film ever done on great disasters in history maybe someday someone will try something similar with pompei or the zeppelini doubt itthe storyline is too simple but mr cameron had his hands on too much material the abyss between upper classes and lower classes the characters final struggle the replic of the tragedy itself to pay more attention to the plot so its predictable so whatunless youre dead or you belong to a particular kind of person that considers feelings and the sense of loss something unimportant and unworthy of movie cameras focus  you cant help but go along with the characters plight and fears with good acting good special effects marvellous soundtrack historical detailshow cant i put myself in the position of those 1600 people or so who lost their lives going through the movie reaching the finale i began thinking what if it was me in jacks place or the captains place or the men and women below decks or the men in the machine roomsthe final scene of is a deserved and beautiful homage paid to those who survived those who die its poetic and sweet and somehow puts the souls of those who saw the movie at peace with history sometimes nature the cosmos god puts us to the test and one of those tests took place in 1912 beautiful and moving motion picture maybe it deserved another posture from cameron at the oscar ceremony maybe di caprio deserved to be nominated great,sad
most people are too critical of  i think that it was one of the best movies that i have ever seen  i am a female and i do not like leonardo dicaprio but that does not change the fact that i think he did an awesome job in  the special effects in the movie wer also some of the best ive seen and even if they werent that wouldnt change the fact that the script casting acting and directing were superb  some movies make it even without having good visual effects for example star wars before the remake of it its special effects were very outdated but people still liked it  special effects were amazing and created a sense of feeling for not only the characters but the unsinkable ship as well  rose and jack also left an incredible amount of compassion in me because of the way that they showed their undying love and promise too each other  too me is a wellrounded good movie because it appeals to all audiences contains both elements of love and action and tells an age old story of courage and strength against the odds  for those who say that is too predictable they never really let it sink in  the true story of doesnt lay in their hearts,sad
as a big fan of the movie id like to clear up some misconceptions  first of all as someone who has seen this film many times at the theaters the notion that teenage girls were responsible for making the huge success it was because of their obsession with leonardo is completely wrong in fact they were probably in the minority in the audience  what i saw was an older group of people coming to see this movieprobably at the urging of one of their grown children in addition i witnessed substantial representation of our citys  oriental community at most the showings obviously this movie transcended age and ethic barriers thats what made it the success it was was the dialog corny in some places  of course it was just like in real life romances could they have developed the characters more  yes but the movie is already over 3 hrs long how much development do you want finally this movie was very costly to make and some say it was a waste of resources  well the proof is in the pudding as they sayitll remain the top grossing film for many many years,sad
it was very good just too long probably many potential viewers were discouraged by the length the producers should have researched and edited moresee goofs forbut the producers wanted it out all in all a good movie enjoyable because of good casting,sad
wonderfuli have never seen better film than beforeit was fantasticit is fantastic and it will be fantastici think leonardo was very goodand kate was very goodtooand the film was unforgettable,sad
i didnt know what to expect from when it first came out other than being the most expensive movie ever made and the ship sinking at the end  but when i saw the film a few weeks after theatrical release all i can say is that it was the best until star wars episode 1the story wasnt just about the ship sailing away with passengers each of the survivors with their own stories to tell  it was a love story between two young people one rich kate winslet and one poor leonardo dicaprio who just had to stick together while trying to survive disaster you jump i jump  right quotes leobefore the disaster dicaprio who plays jack dawson had all the spiritual tools on loving a girl like rose bukater played by kate winslet  who was only rich and didnt enjoy her way of life until she met him  then their love blossoms in the air that touches the audience and myself based on the way it was displayed the spitting the conversation the dancing the kiss the portrait and the sinkingthe one particular element of the film that nearly reduced me into tears was the score background music which added to the drama of the film  it sounded like an angel singing from heaven above no wonder the soundtrack went platinum and won an oscar thats perhaps on why the movie was deemed sad and why it became so popularthis movie is definitely one of my favorite films but it is the best romantic movie ive ever seen  you wont hear nor see a guy like me comment a romance film like that but i bet this film touched a lot of guys hearts as much as the girlsyou know how most guys are they dont want to admit it,sad
the problem with that is you cant please everyone all of the time life is like thatfor me was a lesson in history the lookfeel the setting the mood every detail is everywhere in every image and frame the best part is the back and forth from past to present the why the how meet the who the wheni am a fan of jc and this had the qualities  i am used to on the acting part the roles were difficult to play and were played well the story was a love one with very emotional implications but id did not choack the movie for the era is omnipresent for that duration of the filmof course some viewers like to hate it because of the amount of hype that preceded the opening and i agree that if 2000 viewers took time out of their day to give it a 0it leaves no one neutral and its notthats how it looked to me and its the best movie i have ever seen its not the best documentary its not the best epic its not the best romance its the most of everything and it has something for everyone,sad
this movie had great effects great costumes and the music still sends shivers down my spine and i dont mean the song sung by celine dion the sinking scene made me gasp in horror and sadness because i knew it had to be so much worse for the actual people on the in 1912 i felt helpless sitting in the theater and you could see all too well this mammoth tragedy could have been avertedthe acting was overrated no offense to leonardo but i dont think hes a very good actor and im one of the few young women who doesnt find him very attractive i didnt think either jack and rose were likeable characters most of the movie i wanted to smack rose who was an obnoxious brat the drawing scene and sex scene in the car were tasteless and unnecessary kathy bates was wonderful as usual but the best performance was delivered by frances fisher as ruth you could tell exactly what she was thinking and she didnt have to say a wordthis was a very good movie but i think it could have been even better and i think james camerons acceptance speech at the oscars was insulting and embarrassing,sad
well i think that is best movie of all time not only was there a great story line and also the detail of the ship were spot on i went to see the movie eight times at the movies and it was well worth the money and each and every time i found out something new about the form this film and i would love to se the dirctors cut of this movie even though the movie gos for over three hours the dirctors would be well worth releasing in the near furture i felt part of it all when i was at movies it is the best movie i have ever seen and i wish it was still at the movies even though i have my own copy of the film on video you can beat the big screen,sad
i didnt see this movie until way after i heard stories of people seeing it 10 times and boy was i disappointed  other than the half hour of the ship going down which was impressive the other stuff was no better than an old rerun of the poseiden adventure  lets run down this hallway full of water jack rose if they said that once they said it a million times  even my husband noticed how often they jacked and rosed themselves to death  i have really enjoyed decaprico in the past gilbert grape especially and think he has a future as a good actor as long as someone gives him a decent script  unfortunately this was pretty banal  thumbs up to the ship but thumbs down to everything else,sad
being perfectly frank the posters made me gag nothing on earth could come between them rise oh please well its not gone with the wind and it doesnt star anyone who looks remotely like clark gable but this is definitely the summers thinking persons action flick that is just a waste of your money and time,sad
look i dont want to give away the ending but the ship sinksif you want suspense surprise happy endings or twists in the plot then this really is not what youre looking for on the other hand if you watched apollo 13 knowing the crew get home safely in the end anyway and still enjoyed it for the personal insight into a significant historical event then you have to watch as a film it is rightly to be considered a classic both for the storyline as seen from the perspective of the young lovers and for the special effectskate and leonardo perform well in their roles but its the character played by billy zane which gives the story that extra bite this is the guy you want to see going down with the ship,sad
what i dont see is how people can flame a story of love  yes i do see how they can flame the hype  but if there wasnt a lot of hype i bet trillions more people would love this movie  it was a record of history  if they make a movie about amelia earhart or the kennedys i wonder if people will be as inconsiderate as the did of the rms  i loved the movie every time i saw it i cried  the couple behind me were hitting me on the head trying to shut me up  i couldnt help it  now i must admit  i am a leo fan  and i mean an obsessed fan  you should see my roomdang  anyway i think leo is the best actor around  dont start to label me as another teenybopper  hes had some rough spots like critters 3 but hes come a long way  the people who flame him are obviously jealous  everyone wants to be admired  all i am saying is please dont flame a movie that went down in history   bby leos 1 fan  not joking,sad
one of the best movies ever made and also a movie people only would put down because of the attention it got is absolutly flawless never boring and has a story to die for a powerhouse with the oscars only true lose besides kate was gloria stuart being practically robbed of a very worthy her best suporting actress oscar everything is to like about this film from the song one which we all know to the actors and lets not forget the special effects they just dont get any better than that lets face it hardly any film gets better than this except gone with the wind of coarse   ,sad
if gone with the wind could be said to define the movie epic in the first half of the 20th century than can certainly be said to define it for the second half both films are set against significant moments in history both have spectacular special effects both have love story subplots but most importantly both have heart and a real respect for their audience something you seldom see any more certainly no film since gwtw has had this much publicity blitz and no film including gwtw has had as large an audience at its opening even though youve probably seen both films several times if youre like me youll never tire of seeing them again and thats the mark of a true classic,sad
i didnt go to see because leo was in it i went to see cause i had to i really thought the movie was stupid till i saw it it was a great job i cried almost through the whole movie james cameron did a great job the gunshots were good they made the sound the model was great the model looked exactlly like the and so i give it a 10,sad
welleveryone saw this movie  maybe not everyone but mostly everyone i was impressed by this movie the first time i saw it in the theatres and thank god i saw it in the beginning when it first came out before the movies became crowded by leonardo dicaprio and movie fans  i loved the portrayal of the reallife wealthy passengers like the unsinkable molly brown the captain john jacob astor the countess just to name a few  the set was amazing and took my breath away  this movie really explains a lot about the whole experience of the famous and when i see pics of it lying there under the sea its pretty freaky and scary  its like a ghost ship under sea but above sea and for those who were there the ship was a real wonderi thought it was very generous of james cameron to have that special moment of silence at the academy awards back in 1998 when he was accepting the award for best picture and who knew that a movie such as would ever come alive on the big picture  this movie is dramatic romantic funny in its own way sexy and magical all together  its every genre mixed into one  thats why i call this movie the best movie i ever seen in my whole life,sad
winner of 11 academy awards 4 golden globes 600 in the us box office oscar nominations for stars kate winslet and gloria stuart several floods of hype and took leo dicaprio to super super stardom but does all of this praise really go to show for a film that is essentially empty to say the least i was very disappointedthe acting was very laughable winslets and dicaprios characters displayed no chemistry whatsoever gloria stuarts character displayed almost no emotion and no one else in this film put forth a great effort for their characteri think that the thing that really set me off was the relentless hype that followed this film around everywhere if a film is going to be constantly hyped about it had better be excellent otherwise it will suckis probably the worst best picture of the 1990s and it seemed to have won by default 1997 was a bad year for films and just goes to show you that it may be the most successful film ever made but it is certainly not the best i give this film a weak 2 out of 5 stars,sad
i dont know what all of you people who didnt like are talking about i thought was the greatest movie i have ever seen i was lucky enough to see it on its opening day to tell you the truth i hated leo when the movie first came out after i saw all that changed i couldnt help falling in love with him as jack dawson i mean face it hes the kind of guy any girl would want i mean hes sweet caring brave and who wouldnt want a guy who risks their life for yours i thought the love story was very moving its the kind of love story everyone would want its my dream love story i would give anything to be loved like that who cares about the special effects get away from that and focus on the story of two hearts who go against tremendous odds to be together i mean rose couldnt stand to be in a lifeboat if it mean being separated from jack i thought the script was very well written and the actors did a tremendous job especially leo and kate they lit up the screen stop comparing to star wars they are two totally different movies im a big fan of them both star wars was a action packed scific adventure and was a story about jack and rose who experience the kind of love we all dream about but seldom find,sad
this was a brilliantly filmed movie and deserved many of its awards i was however disappointed by two or three scenes specifically 1 the ridiculous spitting lessons 2 the portrait scene 3 and especially the sexinthecar scene its sad that so many of hollywoods producers feel the need to force totally unnecessary scenes such as these not to mention roses finger scene into a movie just to try to appease the public with the sex and worldly innuendos they think we want to see  regardless of whether it distracts us completely from the story at handwith that said i must add that overall i really enjoyed the film as a whole its pluses easily outweigh the minusesthe most notable points i appreciated were 1 the fabulous score 2 the amazing special effects 3 the beautiful costumes 4 the editing 5 the lighting and colors in general and finally 6 the casting for the main roles leonardo has got incredible charisma winslet is just a fantastic actress loved her in hamlet and billy zane is always cooli give it 8 out of 10,sad
so theres a love story and the ship sinks  we know that  what james cameron has given us is visuality a chance to feel sorry for those doomed and an average every day affair  so the affair wasnt as brilliant as i expected it to be  i wish there was some more to it some more twist but the visuals no one can say that was done wrong  cameron did an excellent job of making this saddening story come to life  the ship sunk  thats how we read it  what he gave us was this the huge claimed as unsinkable ship was on its way plummeting down towards the sea where death to over a thousand passengers and crew members awaited them  the ship took a plunge down into the sea the passengers who had already dived into the sea were either looking with astonishment or fighting for their lives in horrorall in all though this was superbly done and deserved all of the hype it got sparkle ,sad
not the greatest film of all time but then again not the worse is at best an average movie which contains some pretty impressive special effects the story however is not believable and neither are the characters it was way too long for one thing i do applaud james cameron for target marketing this film toward the right audience ie the teenageyounger crowd which is where it made its money that of course is the bottom line this film probably isnt even the best one about the tragic event years from now people may view this movie and say how did this win the academy award for best picture that year,sad
 it speaks for itself  the name means huge  that is what this movie was huge  you could tell that winslet dicaprio stuart paxton zane and everyone else really loved working  at times they referred to cameron as a tyrant  i can see why  working on a movie that has a budget more than some countries have to spend is pretty difficult  cameron squeezed emotion out of monotone leo and proper kate  has anyone noticed that in every movie she plays she is wealthy  for that we owe cameron and the cast a round of applause,sad
kate winslet and leonardo dicaprio are perfect as rose dewitt bukater and jack dawson  billy zane is also great as the villain cal hockleythe musical score is very beautiful   the action scenes are exciting but its the romance that makes this film greatstirs up emotions and touches one deeply its forbidden romance between starcrossed lovers during a cataclysmic event is reminiscent of casablanca and gone with the wind,sad
if theres a more insulting film from hollywood out there i havent seen it and ive seen loads whats worse than a dumb disaster drama which consists of special effects bad acting cheesy romance and a lame unrealistic plot  this movie took itself seriously big mistake well the movie would be okay if they would have edited the first two and a half hours out this would have a watchable one what was cameron planning to create romeo and juliet on or gone with well he really have to reject the services of conrad buff and richard a harris but he couldnt do that because they had edited some of his other features including terminator 2 i did not like the first two and a half hours because that is just a waste of tape i couldnt find a plot in this part at all  it seemes to rely solely on hardly believable romance and banal dialogs like i love you jack you are the best thing happened to me on that ship i will go with you and of course this cheap dramatic trick when rose climbs the ship and then falls overboard but jack manages to save her well but this movie has a lot of fans and you will enjoy it ifayou think that the current crop of hollywood movies are too deep or intellectual byou like seeing crying mothers trying to give someone their baby three times in a movie cyou like superficial special effects for their own sake  this movie seems to be made from bits from the spare parts bin of other disaster movies dif you like cheap dramas ala gone with the wind and soap operas as for me i like some of the actors in this film and they should all see that theyre removed from the credits i considered erasing the movie before returning it to the video store as a humanitarian move awful script cardboard characters the sets did better acting every scene rang false not a scintillion of credibility the characters just sleepwalked through their parts there were some big and small stories like rose and jack with their oh i love you so kiddielove or roses mother and molly brown who get thank god washed away in the ocean aaaahhhhhrrrrrggggg as one reviewer accurately pointed out you find yourself rooting for the disaster big script disappointments include never even glimpsing the underground haven and having the end fizzle with some rather unrealistic lastminute feelgood moments james horner the composer is at his usual using his sucessfull apollo 13 score why didnt he compose anything new for this masterpiece many scenes seem to be shot with a videocamera sincerely all this movie is a big bright rubber toy which sinks with 11 oscars 2000000000 and cast and crew on its board,sad
while the story was predictable  what better way to take us all over the ship  we saw how the rich lived aboard the ship right down to the poor we saw how the poor were treated horribly by being locked in  even though it was acting we could get an  idea of how frightening it must have been for the victims of this tragedy  so i feel that this movie accomplished what it set out to do  sure sometimes it becomes cliche  but in the end we learned how people thought in that time  and most importantly the mistakes that were made that contributed to this tragedy that are not allowed to be made today,sad
i have been a long time fan of james camerons work i saw this movie the third day it was out and i had no idea what to expect since there are so many different movies around this movie totally blew me away everything from the writing to the direction was extraordinary and the actors were so perfectly cast i am not a leonardo fan but i thought he was good as jack billy zane was brilliant as the evil cal and even though he never showed real feelings towards rose you knew that he really loved her remember he went searching for her on the boat at the end kathy bates gave another wonderful performance and kate winslet was terrific as rose  she really held this movie together and i cant believe that she didnt win the oscar,sad
is simply the best movie ever and it will stay that way forever all you hear about is the incredible special effects of the moviewhich i admit are great however what makes so memorable is the engaging love story  leonardo dicaprio gives the performance of his career as an enthusiastic unselfish bum who saves a young womankate winslet from leading a shallow predictable life  i am sick and tired of people ripping dicaprios performance because he was simply perfect for the role  i am hardpressed to find another actor that could exhibit the freshness and excitement of dicaprio  kate winslet was incredibly believable as a spoiled rich brat who wants to lead a more exciting life  the movie also had light touches of humour which helped to balance its serious nature all in all a wonderful movie  kudos to james cameron,sad
i think the reason most people are saying stuff about how they hate is because so many people are talking about it and making this huge deal over it i loved the movie but i understand some people dont because they are sick of the attention is getting i cant wait to get it tomorrow yes tomorrow whoo hoo it is a fantastic movie even if u hate leonardo dicaprio not me or love stories the special effects are great,sad
to start these comments off yeah i am a huge fan yeah i have really seen it 129 times and no i do not drool over leo but this is a fantastic movie that people have judged too harshly by expecting something its notjames cameron has managed to transport us back to 1912 to experience almost first hand the senseless and completely avoidabletragedy that was the sinking of the now he could have done this in a variety of ways a load of speculation facts and figures dates and times boring or he could have followed the documented facts to the letter ship left southampton got to the middle of the atlantic hit an iceberg not enough boats people died the end also boringby using the love story of jack and rose and by making us take them to our hearts the loss that we feel for all those hundreds of people is enormousthis isnt just a movie about  sinking ship or a movie about a rich girl and a poor guy who get it on it is a true slice of history that is known about and now thanks to james cameron kate winslet leo dicapriokathy bates and all the others it is history we care deeply aboutso next time you watch it dont think about the sfx or the love story or the sinking ship think about what it gets across to you and makes you feel for all those people that diedin the real disaster,sad
with a movie making as much money as it did and winning several awards it was a surprise to me that this film which was widely seen had a subplot about a guy who drew partially nude women why was this subplot needed could the film been made without it i believe so when it comes on network tv it will be missing that subplot almost completely take that part of it out and you have a well made almost completely historical account of the voyage i give a c,sad
yeah the movie was something i think it was the best one ever made the beginning of is my favorite when jack won the tickets and everything else it was just wonderful i also like the parts when rose and jack talkedalso in the beginning it was funny the part when sankwell tht was the longest partabout 15 hoursi think it was a little too long i dont know i did not really cry at all but i was really sad the very end of the movie was good too did rose die at the end i am not sure i guess well never know the movie all together was just great looked very realistic good job cameron i think if we would have more of those kinds of movies it would be so much fun i really dont know what to sayits hard to explain what i feel about it you just have to see it oh well i guess everyone already did but if you did not where have you been anyway i think it was a really good movie and i really recommend it ,sad
i think it is the best movie ever i saw it 4 times in the cinema the actorsactresses did a perfect job you hate hockley and lovejoy you hate roses mother for being so shallow you feel for jack and rose and i cried the first 3 times at the end of the movie i have read books about the catastrophe and i must say that cameron has done a perfect jobwell star wars episode 1 might be the most developed movie ever but just has more feeling,sad
i still have not seen anything wrong with  even after viewing it 10 times if youre a film student or aspiring director  im sure you have seen a million things wrong as for these people  get a life  go out to dinner more often with your girlfriend wife  etc smell the flowers so on and so on maybe you ought to rent the movie for a night  and watch it with someone you care about this movie is like religioni cant see god  but i know hes looking out for me in other words this movie is for the average person  not film gurus since james cameron   as i read drank drove a school bus liked fast cars  well he can relate to the reg person  untill someone else makes a film that earns over 1 billion worldwide  i can hear spielberg crying already  i suggest we give and company its due props ,sad
was one of those films that people as a whole embraced and took it to their hearts  though there may be inaccuracies in this film and which films out there really do not thats besides the point  was created by this great storyteller named james cameron who incorporated a fictional love story and wove it in the actual moments of the from its initial departure to its inevitable sinking knowing a good story when they see one people literally came in droves to see such a masterpiece as this film was  if you are one of the few people in the world that missed this film either try to catch it a local 2ndrun movie theatre the choice of medium or rent the widescreen version of itnote  early in 1999 there was talk that that prequel to star wars episode 4 a new hope would destroy box office numbers and dethrone to be the alltime champion of all films  personally i dismissed these claims that this would happenwas a movie phenomenon while star wars episode one will stay a marketing phenomenon with its true success in merchandise sales  will be remembered as the film of the 1990s not the first star wars prequel  i say to the naysayers who said would be toppled in the box office by star wars i that you all will turn out to be saddened to find out that this will never come to happen  while george lucas himself says that the phantom menace would be fourth on the list of films with the highest boxoffice receipts i say that this star wars film will end up in fifth or sixth placewhere would be on my top ten favourites list1tie braveheart glory   4 raiders of the lost ark 5 the shawshank redemption 6 malcolm x  7 forrest gump 8 boyz n the hood  9 terminator 2 judgment day  10  saving private ryan,sad
anyone who loves movies will love this one excepting horrorbloodwarmy guns bigger than yours fans it has all the hallmarks of a movie classic the special effects are relevant the fictional plot cleverly wound into the real events the romance versus drama well balanced the acting persuasive the stage settings and costumes were amazing all the people who made this film know what they are doing  and it shows it cleverly jerks out those tears and makes you stare in wonder good clean fun id say go see it,sad
jealousy  its a powerful thing wouldnt you say  in fact so much that people would ridicule and bash a film that gained so much popularity  it is all a matter of jealousy  if you hear anyone tell you otherwise they are lying  the people who bash the film are the same people who thought it would flop  because it didnt they are trying to find new things to complain about it  its too long and all that crap  of course ironically these are the people who just love gone with the wind which is even longer running at 4 hours  is a great film  its a tragic love story simple but completely effective  its haunting in its portrayal of jack and rose  the film was supposed to evoke emotions and a complex story can not do that  if you watch the english patient you dont cry  you just watch with fascination makes you cry  simplicity is the key  weve seen all sorts of films on but they all focus on cardboard characters  by making us care for jack and rose we eventually care for everyone aboard  jealousy even takes a part in the film  this reflexivity is actually rather humorous considering that cal hockley was jealous of jack for getting roses love  cal hockley represents all the people that bash  jack represents  and rose is the masses of critics and audiences that do love it  did cameron purposely write a screenplay of this type in order to reflect how people would really feel  i doubt it but the similarities are quite striking  in a period when films are mostly centered around special effects and style comes along and heralds back to the old days of making films  but when it tries to do this it gets ridiculed by many  these people should take heed because if they do this they are giving themselves bad names they would rather watch armageddon than  gone with the wind is the most obvious comparison here  when watching it today for the first time i thought the romance was lame because it wasnt romantic  it displayed a moronic lead female who couldnt make up her mind  is a postmodernistic tale of love that we should all comprehend  we would just love to find someone like jack or rose  but alas most of us wont  watching it on screen is the closest we will come  people that bash it are obviously haters of love and maybe never feel anything at all  is a great film  the best of 1997 and one of the best ever made  cameron has done something no one ever expected  he made a successful film based entirely on love  now how ironic is that ,sad
first and foremost before anyone makes an opinion i am not a teenage girl in love with leo i am actually a 27 year old guy that loves  when i say i love it i dont just mean the movie i mean the ship  i have been an avid historian since i was in the 7th grade where i did my first report or at least that is what i called it back thenbut now on to why i wanted to post this here lately i have read nothing but bad press on and a lot of people say it is because people want the new star wars to beat in grossing  well to the people that are asleep in the back row of the audience wake up it is inevitable for this to happen  but is and star wars just about money or maybe are there two terrific movies involved in this  i am here to say in my opinion it has nothing to do with star wars but it has to do with the followingthe people that are giving bad press if you look close are the ones that have seen it way after its first release  it is inevitable for the movie to fail in their eyes because the hype that has followed this movie can never be met by any movie that you watch  i was one of the fortunate ones that my wife dragged me to the theatre on opening night and i have to say was the best movie i have seen in a long long time  i can say that because i didnt have any hype of the movie going into it no promises of grandeur or of excellence just a plain movie and my eyes to judge for myself  i can sit and watch the infamous godfather a dozen times and let me tell ya i can pick that movie apart just the like the average joe sitting next to meis a great movie and for those of you that believe it is so far from fact that it isnt funny i hate to tell you but of all the movies made about the infamous ship this is the closest so far and that includes a night to remember  now please dont get me wrong i loved a night to remember but if i am not mistaken the facts in the movie swerve off quite a bit when it comes to the actual sinkingnow for my last entry people say my god the acting was terrible remember this if i am not mistaken the actorsactresses that that were in the movie beat out a lot of stiff competition for their parts  this all goes in the hype and picking the movie to pieces category in my opintion and i agree kathy bates is in a league of her own enough said on thatone last thing to ponder on how many movies that you know of that is a historical fact has caught the hearts and mind of the public the way that did  if i am not mistaken there has never been a deathstar or a wookie discovered in this world at the present timethank you and god bless,sad
i went to see a ship sink i admit that  i was thoroughly impressed with the sinking the authentic costumes mannerisms and food and the soundtrack  for those reasons alone i enjoyed the moviei did not expect to be drawn into the characters as one was with the british a night to remember  but two characters did stand out  victor garber as mr andrews and ioan gruffudd as fifth officer lowe had small but vital roles  these actors portrayals were marvelous  i wish so much of their work had not landed on the cutting room floori expect great things of mr gruffudd in particular and certainly look forward to more of his work  hes clearly shown a genius for becoming the character  and his welsh accent is music to my earssee the movie for the excellent manner in which it was made not for the story line  and keep a close watch for mr andrews and fifth officer lowe,sad
ok ok so what if im the last person on the face of the planet to see this movie  and so what if i didnt see it in the theater with the doublewraparoundwide screen the floatation device seats the automaticactionsplashinyourface sequencer the multiquadrasuperenhanceddigitallyremastered xyz stereo sound design  so what   i can still have an opinioncant i i knew from the beginning that i was watching the best movie everaccording to someif not most  so i knew this movielike the vesselcould only go down from there          but not too far to still make this a very enjoyable experience  all the accolades all the awards are richly deserving and then some  james cameron has added another masterpiece to an already impressive portfolioterminator terminator 2 abyss aliens true lies strange daysthese are good movies   he has a knack of making movies we like to watch  and hes succeeded again everything about the moviethe look the splendor the glamour and glitze are simply outstanding  the fictional storyabout a man in search of a diamond but finding the truth so much more rewarding and a woman eager to tell her story and revisit her fondest memories  the acting is topnotch kate winslet sells this movie and deserves the oscargod bless helen huntportraying the rebel family savior through a prearranged marriage to an aristocratic twit billy zane  the passion is in her eyes throughout the gambit of emotions she endures and her delivery is superb  there are so many memorable scenes to make her performance classic  dicaprio as the youthful exuberant love interest was also quite good as was frances fisher playing roses mother  particularly enjoyed the courtship scenes with cal hockley zane and roses motherand the overall look of rose with the quasi90s hair style  only a selfrighteous nitpicking critic might contemplate the casting of oscar winner kathy bates in such an insignificant role wishing there were more she could have contributed  i liked this movie as the period piece that it is the costumes the customs the caste system all tempered with the back drop of a historical naval disaster strictly as a love storyyesweve seen it all before and it does have some problems dialogue scene stealing but overall this is a very good movie and i give it a strong 75 out of 10  at a time when premium leading womens roles are few and far between watch this movie for kate winslets performance,sad
i must say im rather amazed at the negative comments that have been submitted to imdb i strongly disagree and in my opinion any serious student of film and no i dont mean people that went to film school upon viewing this film wouldnt be struck by its  true greatness towards the end of the film  bill paxtons character states that while he was involved very strongly in the search for treasures he never let it in that is what cameron has achieved above all elsewriting a story that brings the passengers of the ill fated liner to life we of course all have heard the story of the grand ship that was at the time the technological marvel of its day its tragic sinking at the hands of an iceberg in the north atlantic was a huge blow to mans quest to conquer nature cameron could have easily written a cheesy screenplay and turned it into a 70s disaster movie but he has created characters you care about ive always found that films that have a huge boxoffice are easy targets for people to criticize in general most blockbusters dont garner the acclaim that did the box office in america and around the world was unlike any before it and i suspect it will be a long while before a film will come along to achieve what it has is the gone with the wind of our generation that from ny times critic janet maslin and i whole heartedly agree,sad
is there anyone who hasnt seen this movie yet  if so i recommend finding a bargain theater still showing it  i feel this movie will lose a lot in the translation to the small screenparents  nudity one sex scene some violence  remember many people died aboard and the vivid images of frozen people floating in the ocean may be enough to give smaller kids nightmares  after much consideration i did take my 10yearold daugher to see this and do not regret it  the much ballyhooed nude scene is actually quite beautiful and sensitive truthfully its my favorite part of the film and just thinking about it can bring tears to my eyeswhy so beloved  some are touched deeply by the tragic true events some by the fictional love story  in a good theater the movie makes you feel as if you are right there  i found myself moving my arms as if to swim and shivering with cold while sitting in my seat  there are some beautiful seagues between past at full steam and present at the bottom of the ocean  its true there are some legitimate criticisms of the rather lame anachronistic dialogue but as a whole this movie still rates very high,sad
was not a great movie however i found it very entertaining there were many memorable scenes some interesting special effects reasonable adherence to the facts about the sinking respect for those that perished and a lovely leading lady  hey it was just a movie  wait for it to show at the dollar movie house and youll get your moneys worth i wish there were more movies like  i would start going to the movies frequently again watching the movie has motivated me to read lords book and see the movie by the same name,sad
when i first read walter lords magnificent a night to remember in 1978 at the age of 9 i began a love affair with the story of the and her people that continues to this day and it is partly responsible for my being a professional historian today  it is because of that that there have been few nights as disappointing to me as the one and only time i saw this movieyes the technical details are brilliant but the bottom line for any movie must be its story and characters and the manner in which james cameron exploited the tragedy of the to tell a cheap thirdrate story of horny teenage lust that is far worse than the tawdry soap opera of the 1996 cbs miniseries continues to offend me to this dayit is not the fact that james cameron told a fictional story at the expense of compelling real history like the californian incident that offends me so much its the fact that this is a bad fictional story  no one aboard the real had a situation remotely resembling the one of jack and rose why couldnt cameron have told a fictional story revolving around something real and representative of what was on the  if he wanted to do a class barrier romance then why not have jack be an honest irish immigrant out to make a fortune in america as so many of steerage were instead of some loserdrifter in life who couldnt make an honest living in the real world beyond jack strikes me as the working class gaylord ravenal  someone who in ten years is going to be just as bad as cal is or better still why not a story of a young newlywed couple that was parted by the tragedy  god knows there were plenty of those couples aboard but i guess in this day and age of hollywood morals true love can not exist between a married couple thus rendering that idea politically incorrect in james camerons eyes  and so we get the false dichotomy in which a persons capacity to love is measured by his poverty a message that is not only stupid in and of itself but also false to the reality of what was on one need only point to the true love that existed between the strauses who perhaps not coincidentally had all their key scenes left on the cutting room floorthere is so much more i could rant about the demeaning depictions of first officer murdoch and molly brown also come to mind but the bottom line is that as a enthusiast i feel disgusted that james cameron has hijacked any hope that one day someone could make a movie about the with modern technology that did justice to her just as a night to remember so brilliantly did in 1958  for me a night to remember and the 1979 tvmovie sos remain the definitive movies and should be seen as antidotes to this horrid mess,sad
the tide will turn yet again in light of watching the overlywrought gone with the wind i say thissaves great thrills for its viewers inviting us to understand what it means to be savedin every way that a person can be saved it is a brilliant homage to silent era films with classic moments of dire terror and bravado scenes of selfsacrifice watching this amazing film has taught me more about what it means to experience the joys and sorrows life brings us all and to live each moment in a fuller way,sad
is one of those movies that will have to be rereleased in the theaters periodically because you miss a lot on the small screen  even so camerons fantastically detailed canvas still amazes me the movie is filled with images you can never forget  its the work of a great visual artist,sad
the special affects were awesome the acting and script were a disgrace sort of a juvenile stalinist propoganda piece watch a night to remember1958 to see a great movie about the a movie suitable for those older than age twelve,sad
first of all i am a girl but i dont like this movie because of leonardo dicaprio i think he was quite okay but anyone else could have played his role  and better thats the only thing that bothers me about kate winslet was great as poor little rich girl rose and also billy zane as unimaginable bastard cal the huge ship is just fantastic its luxury amazingi just loved romantic scenes like im flying with that breathtaking sunset but what fascinated me most were the 63 minutes of the sinking sinking faster and faster panic rising and rising more and more people trying to escape from death but drowning of being sucked back into the ship and more and more things getting destroyed  these aspects made the sinking the movies most breathtaking suspenseful and moving minutes thats the best about the movie to mefor me kate winslet is a great actress not only for her good acting but also for her patience and perseverance to hold out i suppose it must have been hard to do the sinking scenes as i read that kate once almost drownedive seen six times yet and every time the sinking was as suspenseful and moving to me like seeing it for the first time i can almost feel the cold water and the sheer terror those people feel and that makes me want to cry each time also the romantic my heart will go on when i saw for the first time i cried when the ship broke apart now only the beautiful song makes me cryalthough three hours make almost too long its a great movie which i like to watch again and again i dont like leonardo but i love that movievote 10,sad
epic adventure film the story of the tragedy might have been told in a better way  a night to remember  but it has never been and never will be told in a bigger way a huge amount of money was spent and unlike some other films  waterworld  it showed leonardo and kathy bates are excellent while the others give pretty good performances the climax is probably the best in hollywood history and the sets are also fantastic having said that  the movie is certainly not the best of all times and i doubt that it deserved the 11 oscars kate certainly didnt deserve to be nominated the movie swept away the whole world and probably the academy members also got a little carried away it definitely is worth watching at least twice,sad
this movie got a hold on me from start to finish its very rare for a movie to do that to me from the opening scene with the beautiful music i was hooked everything looks so beautiful the set decoration the costumes the boat itself everything the cinematography is brilliant pure eye candy camerons oscar for best directing is so well deserved how he manages to show people falling and walking across the entire boat is amazing theres this shot where the camera moves from the very head of the boat to the very back and literally everywhere something is happening brilliant piece of directingthe acting was good as well especially kate winslet en billy zane the latter plays very convincing a real bastard very unpleasant person but perfectly actedthen the music the soundtrack is one of the most wonderful ever made the central theme of the woman humming is beautiful just like many other songs like for instance nearer my god to thee very moving together with the accompaning sceneof course people whove never experienced the sinking of a ship themselves cant really image how that feels but with this movie i had a feeling that we were able to experience from minute to minute what they must have went through i thought the panic of the disaster was very realistically shownthe special effects the sinking of the ship was the highlight of the movie seeing how the ship breaks falls down again and people falling down when the ship stands straight up is truly breathtaking without a doubt one of the most impressive special effects i ever witnessedadd that to what i said about the music the set decoration the cinematography the directing the realistic showing of the disaster and you get one of the best movies ever made i put in my top 10 favourite movies of all time,sad
this is probably one of the finest epic movies of our time it will surely have its place as a classic for years to come for the monumental budget and phenomenal cast it lives up to its hype james cameron did a superfluous recreation of the tragic illfated voyage the personal drama and romance only further pull us in and connect us with the past we feel the pleasure the pain the loss with the characters vicariously though the vivid sets dynamic characters and heartwrenching plotleonardo di caprio and kate winslet were truly cheated at the awards but their performance in will be wellremembered for years to comeit is truly a masterpiece in its own time but what more can really be said about it than has already be said,sad
ill admit it was hard to have no expectations for 11 oscars and of course the hype would lead you to believe that this is the greatest movie of all time while the movie was very good it is far from the greatest of all time the visual effects are outstanding but the dialouge and several errors detract from the overall story the movie ignores the ship californian which was less than 20 miles away the love story  while touching could have been lifted striaght out of alladin more than worth your time for the effects alone but suffers somewhat due james camerons script and editing choices,sad
how could this get a 74 out of 10  i think it deserves a 9  i would give it a 10 but its still not as good as dawn of the dead  now everybody runs off to the theater to catch a good movie  surprisingly the majority of movies at the boxoffice are aboveaverage  they better be if im forkin out a couple bucks and an hour or two of my time  three hours in this case it doesnt seem like that long though because it rarely ever gets boring and about the bad dialoguethis is bad dialogue  you should check out my attack of the bathroom creature if you think has terrible lines in it  theyre memorable and thats what counts  james cameron obviously knows how to make a movie let alone hitting a home run every time his name appears on the silver screen  aliens and the terminator are fine masterpieces so i expected the same here  this exceeded my expectations however and ill be waiting for his next  so just remember leo if it wasnt for jimmy this movie would have only made half the moneytrust me either way the first and last 15 minutes are going down in cinema history wait has anybody not seen this movie  does this even need a review,sad
i think is a very interesting movie indeed it depicts a true story and we really feel as if we were living the story the details are very realistic and the special effects great moreover leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet play very well and the idea of making the film around a love story is pretty good,sad
one thing about is for sure is the most successful film in the 20th century it made a kazillion at the box office and picked a pile of oscars and other awards the craze grew to the point of making people sick of it including myselfits no surprise why a lot of people hate this film as much as the people who love it the lack of chemistry of the decaprio and winslet couple the laughable acting of decaprio and finally the cliche and often ridiculous dialog in certain part of the movie the chip was in climaxsinking mode people were dying like flies the first thing our heroine occurred to say was this is where we first metdespite the movies flaws manages to hit a nerve on us all the experience is completely immersive and the films last hour makes up for all the romance rubbish its no question its a very well done movie and its worth every penny people paid to see it,sad
the craze was out everyone was talking about it girls swamped the theaters to see it 78910 times best movie ever they said to i finally rented it i have to say that i found it sadly lacking it was a historically inaccurate movie about a girl that cheats on her fiancee i find it sickening that the american people find such great pleasure in a movie like this there was no action at all in the first 2 or so hours of the film leonardo stood around and looked cute and kate stood around and tried to look cuter the evil character in this movie was completely one dimensional showing us no other qualities of himself except that of some ogre which makes you wonder why kates character ever got engaged to him anyway when her romance with leonardo began she never before during or after suggested to the ogre that they should just be friends she decided just to skip that and start steaming up some windows and why did people see it so many times did they expect the ending to change after the eleventh viewing were they hoping to see the boat not sink i think it could have been a wonderful movie if they had based it more on fact such as gettysburg or braveheart the true story of the is filled with action and sorrow and loss enough that they didnt need to ruin it with a revolting play of a cheater an ogre and a pretty boy that brought excitment to an otherwise boring and uneventful voyage,sad
i was kind and gave this thing a three im glad to see that i have lots of company in bum rapping this over rated film sure the special effects were spectacular and thoroughly milked throughout the last hour of the film gads  i thought kate and leonardo would never get off the shipyou can certainly see where the money went  besides the spectacular sinking of the ship extras must have found this a bonanza along with hordes of stunt personsto such fine actors and leonardo dicaprio and kate winslow this schlock must have been a breeze hardly up to the demands of their shakespeare portrayalsthe usual bit about the lower classes not just being as good but even better than the upper classes was predictable of course  im sure shed just love tossing if beers in a pub for the rest of her lifewell enough of this sarcasm  i could go on but you get the point,sad
perhaps a little cheesy in the scripting if youre picky but at least thats the only thing wrong of all the possible things that could have sunk this wonderhype  when i saw it the only hype i had heard was a washington post article that started love story sinks printed several weeks before the movies release  i saw it on new years eve and was completely impressed  i barely noticed the 3 hours pass as i was totally drawn in by camerons effective presentation  if you havent seen this because you already know the ship sinks youre fooling yourself the ship sinks in a computer model in the first 5 minutes so nothing you see is a surprise see it  thank you  ,sad
i went in to the film with low expectations i thought the acting wouldnt be brilliant nor would the script but the special effects would make up for it  much like godzillabut i thought yes  ill put 4 hours of my life into this effort 4 hours that i will never get back no matter what i domy summary 1 lame script and dialogue 2 weak acting from all and sundry except perhaps billy zane and definitely his bodyguard  who rocked in twin peaks 3 romantic moments cliched and signalled from on far by the use of the theme 4 for the first 3 hours of the film pretty weak special effects the ship and the sky were both clearly computer generated for most of the filmthe sky looked incredibly fake it was more starstudded than mars attackssecondly when people cant act or rather dont act both leads gave superb performances in other movies eg dicaprio in gilbert grape and winslet in heavenly creatures one would expect them to be pleasurable eyecandy here dicaprio really keeps up his end of the bargain hes too good looking grrr but kate winslet seems peculiarly miscast her english accent breaks through and she is not particularly attractive subjective sexism aside though i cannot understand how the academy felt her performance was of nominee standardonce the ship starts sinking the special effects do improve some but very little else does the ridiculously cliched script continues unfazed making the characters implausible anyone as evil as zanes character would wear an eyepatch and leonardo dicaprio would have been shot by someonea film i feel completely outclassed by all of its conominees for best picture la confidential and as good as it gets both shine out as excellent movies time and time again the academy needs to get a gripalso what was the gloria stuart nomination about,sad
i think ive seen enough bad films but definitely this is the worst i can forgive acting what can you ask from such a poor script but even the last hour of the film deserted me fire works propeller man vertical ship it was a theme park on the sea at night if the film makers thought of 1500 victims it would have been a lot more different two selfindulgent loversthey might be in love but do they loveare just annoying i hardly saw a bit of love let alone tragedy but the money they wasted,sad
as a teenage guy it may seem weird to hear that was a very good movie from my mouth but it is leonardo dicaprio was very believable in this movie and to a lesser extent so was kate winslet and gloria stuart this movie was very well created with excellent artdirection and cenematography the sinking of the ship in this movie is so good that when i saw it in the theaters i almost felt that i was in the middle of the atlantic on a huge sinking ship this movie wasnt the best movie of 1997 la confidential was that still may be the best combination of very good acting and great special effects ive ever seen  out of  for,sad
camerons alleged masterpiece has two things going for it amazing digital effects and the fact that the vessel broke in halfdozens of excellent reallife stories are abandoned for an an insipid love storysee the excellent a night to remember instead0 of 4 nirostars,sad
i have seen twice  from the beginning it has promise but the promise fades away when the upperclass passengers are all depicted as coldhearted selfish villains with little or no humanity at all  the villains are too cartoonish to be real much less entertaining  especially in the cases of cal and mr lovejoy who are even psychopathic  we know right off that the girls fiancee is someone to root against because 1 she has to end up with leo so she cannot be allowed to desire this man 2 he is arrogant enough to put half of hollywood to shame 3 with his lines god himself could not sink this ship and picasso he wont amount to anything trust me he wont we know that he is an idiot and a waste of her time  the special effects were outstanding but i cant help thinking that if only the movie had depended more on good writing than the hearthrob factor that it would have been a much better movie,sad
i was going to see a movie one snowy night in december my friend suggested tomorrow never dies but i was wanting to see sence last summer i was expecting a disaster movie but i got a lot more this movie takes you to the ship in 1912 youre there you see it you feel it its actually like your ea part of the movie this movie wasnt really all that great in script writing but how many are most guys say this movie sucked and had no point i think they just werent man enough to admit it if you feel like reliving history than you should see this the end is so creepy because you feel like youre there you cant help wonder what it was like for those unlucky passengers the effects of the ship sinking was very realistic and this movie was definitely worth the 200 million it took to make it i admit the end is sad but that makes it all the more realistic its one of the greatest movies of all time and the most successful of all time and one of my favorites of all timerelive the past and see this movie,sad
a great epic a movie that will always have a special place in my heart why because it is one of the few movies that made me cry,sad
is the most overrated movie of all time  i know that it sweeped the oscars for the year 1997 but that doesnt mean that it deserves to be recognized as it is now  there are numerous reasons why the film was labled as the best picture  first of all it made 1 billion dollars worldwide and thats the record for any films  the reason  leonardo dicaprios in the movie and if you are a girl and doesnt like leonardo dicaprio you are not normal  i know several girls who saw about 20 times  also the movie was in fact entertaining i must admit  i enjoyed it  the sound and the score by james horner and the cinematography was excellent  also the year was a weak year for films  l a confidential or good will hunting or as good as it gets were good but not terrific but they were better than  was a blockbuster but the screenplay sucked  the screenplay sucked like hell  the plot was simple a poor livingonthewildside boy meets a rich girl who is controlled by her mother and falls in love  it is the most simplest plot ever  even a fiveyearold can think of that  but the excellent direction of james cameron actually overcame the screenplay and made it entertaining so james cameron deserved an oscar for best director  but the fact of the matter is even with all the technical excellence the foundation and the backbone of all films except for action films the screenplay sucked  remember the line rose rose rose rose rose rose rose rose rose rose rose rose rose rose rose   is that the best cameron can think of  films such as l a confidential and good will hunting or as good as it gets had better screenplays and better cast of actors then  so in conclusion i admit that was a good action  chick flick but it did not deserved to be awarded as the best picture of 1997,sad
well what can i say is just the best movie ever it has it all the acting is great kate winslet was stunning and beautiful she deserved the oscar for her role as rose i cant wait to see her next movie hideous kinky leonardo also did a great job the movie is fantastic if you didnt see it in the cinema go and see it on video now,sad
when i first saw this movie the day it opened i was going in because i liked the cast i like james camerons work i was blown away by trailer and i prefer not to judge a movie by its budget  i am not a fanatic about the actual ship my reaction has always been its a big ship it sank  so what  back on opening day though some rave reviews had already come out some dissenting views had also come and while interest was expected no one knew the ultimate fate of the movie  and at the theater i saw it in the projector broke down three times in the first five minutes and i think its safe to say the audience i saw it with was ready to kill  then finally the movie went on interruptedby the end though we of course took the free passes the theater provided us to apologize for our inconvenience we were transfixed by what we had seen on screen  james cameron is a director who tries here to make art out of pure entertainment and he suceeds on a massive scale  there were better movies in 1997was 8 on my top ten list that year the first seven were in order the sweet hereafter la confidential as good as it gets the ice storm ulees gold in the company of men and grosse pointe blank but this was the best pure entertainment of the year  the physical achievement of the movie of course is not to be forgotten particularly when the ship sinks and the scene where jack leonardo dicaprio and rosekate winslet are standing in the front of the boat the im flying scene which when i saw it in the trailer was what made me want to see the movie  but the love story worked for me as well as did the wraparound story of the old rose gloria stuart remembering when she was in the heart of the ocean  dicaprio is a good actor and hes good here though a bit too modern for me but its winslet who gives the movie its heart playing passion to the hiltbut as the 70s were the me decade and the 80s were the greed decade the 90s can probably best be described as the backlash decade  as soon as a work or artist in popular culture american anyway becomes popular it seems people have a felt need to line up and dump on it simply because a lot of other people like it and they cant stand it  this is not to say all popular culture is good  rather it is to argue that just because a lot of people like something doesnt automatically make it bad  this is not the movie of the year the decade or the century but its a great movie and i wish people would get over themselves and not consider those of us who feel like i do cretins  this will stand the test of time,sad
is a good film and ill give it that but to call it the best film of all time is ludicrous i love romantic films but i think the love story in this film was uninspired i mean did anybody else notice how in one scene jack and rose disliked each other and the very next scene they were talking about riding horses together in the sunset gimme a break there were a couple amusing and touching moments and i did enjoy the filmbut to even put it in the same ranks as gone with the wind is utterly hilarious,sad
the movie was as everyone knows a huge success and a beautiful love story but as i watched the grammys the other night i realized exactly what james cameron gave to those involved with his project from the heart  look at what the film did to leonardo dicaprios career  i know you werent paying any attention to him when he was on that kirk cameron show  kate winslets name no longer goes unrecognized  gloria stewarts age old days in hollywood were revived and probably the most wellknown soundtrack in the history of film was created  now james horner has a grammy to add to his collection of golden globes and oscars for the beautiful music he created that moved us to tears  granted celine dion wasnt doin too terrible before her heart went on but now shes polishing and putting up the multiple awards shes won for singing the i know overplayed theme song we will never get out of our heads  as for others in the film bill paxton and his earring will always be remembered  it replaced those visions of flying cows we had in our heads  and instead of a question mark we view billy zane as the mean guy who tried to shoot leo  cameron braved cold waters to get that movie made and im sure glad he did  it amazes me that here in february 1999 over a year since the movie was released theyre still giving it awards  cameron may have said the wrong words on oscar night but he did a bang up job on what has been called one of the greatest movies of all time  he not only gained access to do what ever movie he wants in the future but he gained a girlfriend too,sad
first of all i want to express how impressed i am at how intelligent so many of the comments here have been it kind of surprised me because i figured the average person who loved or hated the movie would be at least a little bit on the dull side we are talking about people who in my opinion got so carried away with the romance that they completely overrated the film or people who i thought were going to blast the film for stupid and superficial reasons i was wrong the comments here have been fantasticthis was a good movie but it is not one of my favorites of all time it is a very beautiful film at first and obviously becomes ugly when we slowly watch the brutal disaster get worse and worse we know that the ship sinks we know that many people died and we know that it was a long time ago but cameron succeeds in bringing new and intense emotions out of us anywaywhile has hard work precision and passion it does lack some real intelligent writing much of this movie is like a high quality soap opera filled with chatter and nonverbal language that left me bored several timesstill i thought the romance special effects music and acting were all good enough for me to enjoy the and will probably watch it several timesi have seen several people here change their minds about when their original opinion was way on one side or the other of the spectrum that is because when you use your openmindedness you will probably find that this is not a nearperfect film nor is it a piece of crap but that the is a pretty damn good movie plain and simple,sad
you know why leonardo dicaprio wasnt nominated for an oscar for his role in the movie  simple  his acting was not very good and at times it was the equivalent of some of the performances one might see on an after school special  that will keep this film from holding the title greatest of all time  i still say that was not even the best movie of 1997  that should have gone to la confidential  but that argument is for another time,sad
is in my opinion the best movie of all time 30 years from now it will be a classic like gone with the wind i think the academy awards people were right in giving it 11 awards including best picture and thats the bottom line cause i said so,sad
very overrated and endless saga about the famous oceanlinert he film only comes alive for the last hour when the sinking finally occurs up until then the story is a silly victorian melodrama its even laughable its hard to believe this film won so many awards and made so much money the real surprise is how well the critics received it one thing for sure its no gone with the wind but then what is,sad
i mightve enjoyed the movie a little more had they tightened it up a little bit  3 hours 20 minutes is an awful long time for such a shallow plotit appears as selfaggrandizing by james cameron  no way should this film have won or even been nominated for best picture yet,sad
this film was overhyped and as a result made much less impression on me i found the heavily revisionist element wearisome at best disgraceful at worst the acting is good but the animation  graphics are poor,sad
when i say this is the most powerful movie of this time i understand that there are not a lot of brilliant movies to see when i first went to see  and i saw those introducing images and heard that unforgottable melody i asked myself what is cameron going to tell me and three hours later i understood that maybe this is the best movie ive ever seen dicaprio and winslet make it bigger they could reach the audience heart and soul i am not sure if this makes cameron to be a genius or an excellent director i really dont know it yet but i am sure that he made me get into this ship and live a beautiful love story beside rose and jackshines over the rest of the 90s movies and becomes a new classic of this time it is also my favorite one,sad
i love romances  lovie dovie movies are my favorite and although this movie was not perfect by far it showed true romance  it does seem to me though that there should have been perhaps a little more emphasis on the sinking of the ship rather than the romance of jack and rose  as much as i like the romance part i am also interested in historical events too,sad
it is widely known that the director is the hardest working person on the set  james cameron takes this fact to a new levelcameron took a great interest in the great ship back in 1989 while filming his deepsea thriller the abyss  in 1994 cameron began principal photography of the wreckage just off the coast of newfoundland  as cameron took his cameras deep into the atlantic tears came to his eyes as he looked at the destroyed vessel for the first time  cameron was on a mission to recreate the story of the great ship a mission which could be called the greatest accomplishment in film historyincorporates the widest variety of genres it is a romance a drama an actionadventure a suspensethriller  it is a tearjerker a spiritlifter a special effects extravaganza  it drew in an audience demographic so wide that children grandparents and all in between love to watch it over and over  it is one of those few films that you can see ten times and still love it still notice something else which makes you love it more  took moviemaking to a new level both technically and thematically and in such a way that its achievement may never be surpassedcameron poured his heart into this film  he wanted to produce a tale of the ship which would have a great effect on its viewers make them feel for the passengers the tragedy of the ship the power of rose and jacks love  the symbolism of their relationship mirrors that of the ship itself  their love for each other although shortlived will last for an eternity  they came from a different world different backgrounds yet the essence of their inner selves is so wholesome so connected that they could not stand to be apart even if it meant changing everything they knowthe film reaches into our hearts shows us a love so pure so tragic and destined for destruction yet we all truly care for rose and jack wanting them to survive so their hearts can go on  tears came to my eyes on five different occasions while watching this film  i was pulled into the story the characters and the sheer presence of the ship  i wanted everyone i cared about to experience this film to be able to feel what i felt to see what i saw  cameron showed me a side to the human spirit human tragedy and the power of love well beyond anything i knew possible  i am eternally thankful for camerons monumental achievement and i will never forget experiencing,sad
this was james camerons best work yet ive said before that was the best movie ive ever seen but when i saw it definitely was the best i even own a copy of i doubt the new staw wars movie will even come close,sad
im a big james cameron fan and am really happy this brilliant director finally got his due while diehard cameron fans might be surprised that the movie isnt the nonstop thrillasecond yarn they are used to they will really appreciate his involving characters flawless eye for detail and spectacular special fxthe movie isnt perfect though while jack and rose are warmly human fleshed out characters most of the others are reduced to dissapointing cardboard charcters too badmaybe they will be explored in the directors cut while gloria stuart is very touching as old rose she was robbed at the oscars by kim basingergrrrrwhile the movie is more than 3 hours long it never feels like it you experince total awe as james cameron whisks you back in time allowing you to explore the worlds most famous liner in perfect detail after the 3rd class dance scene you actually hope in your heart the doomed liner never hits that icebergafter the ship hits  we are exposed to the sinking of the in equal almost scary detailand here cameron is in his best formi found the realism of the ship breaking in two almost disturbingly real a great unforgettable motion picture that should not be missed truly deserving of its best picture oscar,sad
when i got out of the theatre i did not realize this movie was three hours long i am not saying it was boring leonardo and kate just captivate you he is so handsome and she beautiful the cinematography in this movie was great its like youre there no wonder it won all those oscars and for the old rose gloria stewart to tell the story was really moving this is just a little insight i work for a popular retail store and when this movie video came in it sold out quickly thats why i say theres a unsinkable ship in every house great movie,sad
i was amazed how i felt so helpless as the people tried to save themselves from an inevitable end i wondered how the people who survived must have felt i would love to find out more about who lived and who died and if a sequel is planned to follow the lives of the survivors that would be a terribly interesting subject to me,sad
where can i start i love 30 minutes of this movie the sinking of the ship will go down as one of the great effects sequences in cinema history yet i couldnt help feeling cheated at spending my cash on cinema entry for this movie the love tale is far too poorly written to maintain interest of the more actionorientated viewer of which the film is partly complex and also too simple to interest someone who loves good character interaction i believe that the best character in the movie cal billy zanes character didnt get nearly enough screen time i laughed heartily at his youd almost pass for a gentleman line directed towards jack and the black and white original footage was very emotional but little things like this a fraction of its 3 hour duration dont assist an over rated and drawn out film i may be going against popular opinion but i saw at least 8 better movies than this in 1998 and will see another 8 this year im not totally against the movie but i cant stand a film winning on hype a good but not great movie 610 man im harsh,sad
i really liked this movie the only thing i dont understand is the craze that it triggered ive seen a few better movies and a lot worse the storyline was good the acting was soso so all in all it was a pretty good movie but save yourself the energy and dont obsess over it,sad
most of the criticism ive read of james camerons on this site and elsewhere has been unjustified and trivial  i can easily imagine people going to a theater  having already decided they hate the film  and watching it for the first time looking for anything to criticize so they can justify their prejudicesthat said some of the criticism was right on target  the worst part of the movie had to be the contemporary scenes with bill paxton  other than providing a framework for telling the story i got the impression that one of the main reasons these characters were included in the movie was to give the audience the celluloid version of an applause or weep sign  the submarine crew particularly the antihappyface character and paxton were unbelievably callous at the beginning but by the time rose finished the story they had become mistyeyed at the old womans harrowing tale  the transformation appears quite artificialim a little surprised that no one has commented on the peculiar relationship between the contemporary and historical scenes  after all it wasnt until elderly rose said essentially those of us who were on the remember it differently  at that point we faded back to 1912 and rose began narrating the story  but within a few moments her narration fades outwe are led to believe that what we see on the screen is the visual equivalent of what rose speaks to her contemporary listeners  but within a few minutes we start seeing scenes which rose could not have witnessed much less described jacks card game discussions between the ships manufacturers and the captain and so forth  was rose simply making these things up or did cameron quietly replace rose as the narrator  i realize some may think it a trivial point but imagine if cameron had filmed the rest of the movie from roses perspectivewe would have missed out on a lot of panoramic views  the propellers turning the flyover view of the ship the pistons churning  as well as other scenes such as when lovejoy put the diamond in jacks pocket the conversations between minor characters in which rose was not present the reluctance of the captain to speed up and his ultimate despair after the ship started to sinkon the other hand we would have gotten a much fuller picture of roses passion for jack who would probably be a somewhat more mysterious figure since we wouldnt know if he had pocketed the diamond or not reportedly dicaprio had asked cameron to portray jack with something of a dark side  to make him complex in some way  but the director had refused  in addition to being a more intimate film if we saw the complete story through roses eyes everything would be much more chaotic since we wouldnt benefit by knowing all that the captain and crew know  while camerons gives us a birds eye view of the disaster and one might add the personalities of the characters roses would convey the sheer terror and panic in a way that probably more closely resembles the experience of the unlucky 1500its easy to see how this would be a much different movie  much more complex and terrorizing  this reminds me of the landingatthebeach scene in saving private ryan where the camera gives us a view of what the soldiers actually saw  the chaos and the horrible realism  seeing the event entirely through the eyes of rose would likely offer the artistic direction which so many find lacking in camerons filmbut would it actually be a better moviei have my doubts  camerons succeeds because it actually balances quite well between the cerebral justthefacts rendition of the ships sinking that many of us saw in a night to remember and what could have been a gutwrenching though confusing inyourface chronicle of roses painful experience  instead we have a very good blend of historical account and personal tragedyin addition to offering an appealing story for some moviegoers the fictional romance between rose and jack serves at least four other important purposes  first by allowing the camera to follow them around we get to see more of the ship  both first class and third  second unless the movie were to run nine hours it would have been impossible to show in detail what happened to all of the real people on the ship  but by following rose and jack we can gain a glimpse regrettably brief of some of the main real characters  third as pointed out by others particularly those fond of 1st officer murdoch we dont really know the true story in many cases and to connect the dots in regards to real characters risks disparaging their memory  by focusing on rose and jack we gain a fairly realistic view of the times the people involved and the event  finally the loss of roses lover makes the tragedy more personal to viewers in a way that a night to remember couldntwhen you think of the other ways this story might have been told  instead of just citing the movies shortcomings  you may gain an appreciation for camerons  it may not be one of the best movies ever made but its definitely worth a 200 rental and three hours of your time,sad
big budget version of the famous story has become the most successful film of all time and jointly the biggest accademy award winner 11 in total leonardo di caprio and kate winslet are excellent in their roles  it is long but beautifully filmed and will probably leave most of the audience quite red eyed  this movie is a classic,sad
this was the shortest 3 hours i have ever sat through a movie this movie made you want to watch and then rewind and watch again kate winslets best work all the roles were cast perfectly i would suggest this movie to anyone i dont usually watch love stories but i couldnt stop watching this one a solid 9 out of 10,sad
first of all i would like to say that im not a fan of leonardo dicaprio in fact i hate him as a person he is a good actor thoughwhat makes me such a fan of im one of those fanatics so it cant be the love story no it is the history of the ship that fascinates me to see the ship in a motion picture was just great the effects were superb if the rms fascinates you go see the movieone last thing the movie would probably be better without leo,sad
a 250 million dollar movie with a 200 script,sad
i loved the film   and it wasnt just for leonardo dicaprios pretty face it was for everything for the pretty love story for the story of the ship that was unsinkable the wealth the poverty the ignorance the despair the trust the hope the love great film of james cameron with great interpretations so much of leonardo dicaprio as of kate winslet,sad
of course this is a chick flick and of course not everyones going to appreciate it but seriously if you take a good look at it its a wonderful film  i loved it the first time i saw it and i still do  now i dont cry at movies and ill be the first one to say if a movie really stinks but was a perfect movie  there were a few problems likewell if theyre standing in water chesthigh and things are electrically shorting out then why are they still alive  and when she hit that guy while she was looking for the key to the cuffs before he even touched his face he had blood all over his hand  and when everyone was outside starting to get into the lifeboats why couldnt you see anyones breath  it was just as cold then as it was when they were all in the water but despite these things got all that it deserved  it was everything people want to see in a movie  personally i think that at times the whole love story was a little drawn out but its not the love story that makes the movie this time  its an endless tale of the perils on the biggest ship in the world  just because theres some kiddy love in the story doesnt mean that its an allaround chick flick  if you think that then you need to get a clue  if you didnt see the tothedetailed accounts of things that really happened or take the movie for what it was then of course youre not going to appreciate it  but was more than just a documentary it was a wonderful portrayal of what really did happen on the  and im sure somewhere along the lines on the ship a boy and girl fell in love and were torn apart by death  its not as unrealistic as you may think  just stop and take in the horror of the sinking and the detailed account of the times and what it would have been like to be a third class person and know that you havent even a chance to live  and if you still dont like the film or appreciate what its about get over it  until you take in the whole picture you have no right to bash it  if all you think it is is some dumb chick flick get a new line  that ones already been taken,sad
i still dont see whats the big deal about this movie the endingwas the most interesting because it showed the ship sinking it looked very realistic the romance was cute but typical the beginning kind of slow and boring did it deserve 11 academy awards no maybe for best costume design and art direction and film editing but not for best director or best picture,sad
i kinda had the impression that it was only a chick flickbut boy was i wrong it truly deserved all of the hype it received what can i saytypical james cameronone of the best movies of all time,sad
rating this movie as a 10 may not possibly do total and complete justice to the superb effort it represents after all whats in a rating  just a little meaningless number behind those comfortably assigned numbers there are countless hours of hard work sleeplesness and the well coordinated effort of the numerous men and women who made it possiblei was certainly impressed not only by the special effects but the lyrical value rare in the trash land of movies surrounding us nowadays of the picture and i am actually very surprised and a bit disgusted that somebody has been able to write a totally senseless negative comment on this super a plus film walking over ideas art and lives those of the people who worked to make it more than just another movieno points of reference can be offered since the star cast is quite fresh and this version is certainly superior to the other found on this centurys filmography,sad
if you take away the special effects from this movie you still have the greatest film ever made  usually with big budget eyeball movies nothing much is top notch outside of the special effects  but personally from the moment that rose dewittbukater steps out of her car she captivates all eyes in the audience  she is the movie star of her time and she was robbed of the best actress oscar  all of the other actors around her shine also including billy zane who is an amazing villain frances fisher leonardo dicaprio and all of the other wonderful actors in this film give the greatest performances for a film full of love passion and heartache  this is the only flawless film i have ever seen  i was unable to move from my seat after this journey and that doesnt happen often is a 10 kate winslet is a star and the movie has won my heart,sad
this was a very good movie that was both entertaining and sad that had a great love story the special effects were great as was the acting 10 rated pg13 for disaster violence language nudity and sensuality,sad
this is one terrific movie  corny love story but the actors make it believable and it keeps you glued to the screen even though you know how its going to end  fantastic special effects and soundtrack  see this movie for yourself and make your own decision  but    keep the tissues handy,sad
is a stunning portrayal of the 1912 disaster that never gives up any of its emotional or nostalgic appeal  the disaster was one of the icons of the gilded age and this was the key element to this film  the cast was excellent and the special effects were awesome as wellbut none of it would have held up without thisi cannot articulate accurately how much i love this movie  if youre looking for a film that speaks to you emotionally and historically watch  you wont be disappointed,sad
thr first time i saw this amazing film i was immediately mezmerized by it i wanted to find out all i could about this movie as well as the real disaster i have always been amazed of the disaster and i think james cameron did a fine job of how the maritime disaster really happened and how it really was,sad
all the people who hate either mustve missed it in the theatres or just hate leonardo dicaprio sure hes overhyped but people forget how much of an awesome actor he is see any of his older movies esp basketball diaries or gilbert grape to see how amazing of an actor he is he does an awesome job in this movie though i more imagined christian bale in his part gloria stuart kate winslet and billy zane are fantastic as well seeing this in theatres was the best theatre experience since star wars i even saw the movie 3 times on video however it lacks the oomph that the theatre left you but it still looks and sounds incredible get the widescreen version director james cameron perfectly caught the wreck and this is one of the most visually stunning and captivating films ive ever seen sure some of the dialogue is weak but who cares this film impressed me and ill never forget it i still watch this movie from time to time,sad
absolutely mind boggling i dont think a thing in the world of going to the gents room umpteen times or stepping out to smoke a cigarette during most movies this movie had a hypnotic effect on me first saw at theater in savannah  dec 26 1997 like no other movie has ever had i absolutely could not help but love this wonderful masterpiece about the worst sea disaster in history jake elwood im sorry but i have a new favorite nothing personal i hope you understand,sad
was a great combination of music action and history but i didnt like it the first part was great but in the second one i just couldnt watch for 15 hours how people are dying otherways that movie was a great one,sad
say what you want about its made over a billion dollars worldwide and still continues to growits becoming a classic like gone with the wind still is  the acting may not have been a 10 but come on in the 90s there havent been very many critical movies unless you like watching boring independent films or limited boring release films like mrs brown or elizabeth or shakespeare in love people like to see action romance and thrills critical acclaim is fine and deserves critical acclaim it was a hell of a moviei loved it and always will,sad
i would like to say i really liked in terms of suspense and being in the grand mode of other classic long drama movies like gone with the wind the acting was good and other aspects like social class hierarchy and set design issuesprops was excellenton the other the hand the sex scene though brief was unnecessary and distracted from the romance element certainly not following the scenes of other classic older movies of a nonexplicit nature other postmodern features was the types of language used by kate winslet as rose some profanity and constant use of gods name in vain notwithstanding these problems the movie shows quite impressive what can be done with 100s of millions of poundsi think that movies that cost that much and makes a sizeable profit should have at least a proportion given to charity for the real people who are freezing to death are ill or of great need for food this will help prevent future disasters in the worldpeace and love to everyone,sad
okay ive been on both sides of the fence i saw the movie i loved the movie are you kidding i was sobbing from the moment the orchestra started playing nearer my god to thee of course my friend should not have taken me to see it in an attempt to cheer me up then i got caught up in the trend of dogging the movie oh it has an awful screenplay oh kate winslet and dicaprio cant act oh the story is so contrived oh the movie is too long oh gawd if i have to listen to celine dion sing my heart will go on one more time im going to bash my radio against the walland then i saw it again and got my head on straight okay so the love story is cheesy all love stories are cheesy otherwise they wouldnt be so goddamned interesting next time you fall in love see how intellectual you behave yes celine dion is awful but the song is gorgeous when orchestrated and probably would be if celine dion werent singing it my only problem with the special effects is that they cost too damned much but lets be realistic  if the people doing them were doing it for the love of computer animation instead of for sucking millions out of hollywood it wouldnt have all the roles are fine for the purposes they served the asshole the mean mother the lost lover    trust me its no cheesier than another great love story i can think of do you recognize this one boy meets girl at party boy has to marry girl the next day or else despite the fact that she is from the family of a sworn enemy girl agrees boy kills girls cousin oops he just violated the local rulers decree he must now be exiled girl feigns death to avoid distasteful marriage boy hears girl is dead kills himself girl hears boy is dead kills herself families reconcile all in the space of four days and yet everyone loves this story yes im talking about romeo and juliet i repeat all love stories are cheesy so why does everyone mind that this one is tooget real rent the video or order it on payperview see it without the gaggle of heckling friends you went to see it with before or if you havent seen it goodness me how can you expect the rest of us to respect your position on the movie if you havent even seen it come on dont believe the hype either way just see the movie and then keep your opinion to yourself its been a year already and there are other movies out there sheesh,sad
i first saw this movie when it was first released it completely tore my heart right out of my chest i was afraid to see it again the only part of the movie that disappointed me was leo dicaprios dialogue it just wasnt convincing for that period apart form that its a heart touching movie showing the full power of love that everybody dreams for,sad
director james cameron reportedly said he wanted a hollywood veteran to play the role of old rose whose character is aged 102 and a stillliving survivor of the at the time of an undersea search  and a veteran he found in gloria stuart hollywood star of the 1930s and 1940s and 87 years of age when the film was shot  old rose slowly tells her story and spins her way into the hearts of millions on every continent where this film has played  eleven oscars this film took home among fourteen nominations garnered and most were deserved but the greatest among the three missing statues on oscar night was gloria stuarts  without her this film was an fx extravaganza with a serious lack of credibility  di caprio and winslet simply arent clark gable  vivian leigh and probably wont grow up to approach anywhere even close to the likes of them either  nevertheless cameron wanted a film that the world would remember and he got one  that ship was as real as anything yet created out of thin air  loudest applause for him and the massive crew that made this film possible and for gloria stuart who made the story credible  top rating 5 stars of 5 ,sad
i read a night to remember when i was in high schooland remember seeing the 1953 film on television it looks hokie today  but it seemed gripping when i first saw it so i looked forward eagerly to seeing james camerons movieespecially when early reviews suggested it was pretty good i expected to see a meticulous depiction of the ship itself as well as a harrowing reenactment of the sinking what i did not expect was to be as moved by the human story several people have asked why cameron felt he had to include a fictional love story in a story about a reallife tragedy first the jackrose love story gave the moviegoer a chance to see most of this great ship while exploring the different worlds of firstclass and steerage secondly and most important of all cameron felt that if he made you care about the fate of two fictional peopleit would make the fate of the 1500 real people who died on the seem more tangible and concretei can understand if a lot of people resent leonardo dicaprio in my opinion he got too much of the credit that should have gone to kate winslet but i dont understand why people think this movie is badly written some of the lines do have a contemporary ring to them but the characters are vividly drawn and the screenplay is much better than is given credit a beautiful example of good writing by cameron occurs in the scene where rose almost jumps off the stern of the ship jack tells rose what it feels like to fall through thin ice and get immersed in freezing water not only does this serve the practical purpose of getting rose to want to come back aboard the ship it prepares the audience for what victims will feel when the ship sinks other versions of this tragedy watch the ship from a distance and makes the audience feel they are safe in the lifeboats in contrast james cameron makes the audience identify with the unlucky ones left on the ship and dying in the water and as in seven samurai because the audience recognizes and comes to know several of the passengers and crew their deaths have all the greater impact when the ship finally sinks,sad
the direction of james cameron is great and the human stories are powerful but the romance of jack and rose is too played and unoriginal  the acting by the two leads is also uninspired  but the movie is still good and far better than most disaster movies,sad
a boring traditional disasterromance the computer animations are pathetic and the characters cut out of baywatch the only notable feature was the aging actress in the lead role thats acting,sad
i saw james camerons oscar winning epic and i saw a mesmerizing piece of art unfold before my eyes  i couldnt believe how this movie just came together  the visual effects were outstanding the costumes were brilliant the cinematography was wonderful and yes believe it or not excellent actingin my opinion kate winslet made this movie and deserved her oscar nomination for wonderful performance as rose  kate winslet is truly one of the actresses for the future she has already had two oscar nominations and she is only 23  she was brilliant but it wasnt her absolute best her best is jude see it for all you kate watchers she is wonderful in this movie  if it wasnt for kate winslet this story probably wouldnt have worked leonardo dicaprio was wonderful and he shouldve had more award praise for his performance but it wasnt his best also whats eating gilbert grape and he was nominated for that  now gloria stuart was good but i thought kathy bates shouldve gotten in instead because her character stayed realall those people who sat such bad things about are crazy because whats not to love  i know everybody is tired of the song my heart will go on is a wonderful song and it fits the movie perfectly  this is a gem of a movie and when rose looke up and saw jack up there while she was going down with everybody was so pivotal because she them jumped onto the deck and saw that her life whole would be everything she is with jack not with an arranged marriage with a controlling jerk played brilliantly by billy zane remember when molly brown kathy bates asked him at the dinner table are gonna cut her meat for herthis was such a materpiece and the only drawback was why did the older rose just throw the gem into the sea it was puzzling but that still doesnt mean that this movie  gets a 10,sad
sorry but i just dont see what all the fuss is about here  handsomely designed and appointed movie terrific special effects and costumes etc but the leads are so bland and lackluster that i wasnt able to care whether they drowned or not winslet has exactly one facial expression decaprio is much too 90s to be convincing as a 1912 roustabout and neither of them made me believe they were passionately in love which makes most of their actions in the last hour look simply brainless if not suicidal  most interesting relationship in the film is actually between rose and the ships designer,sad
it ends with two young lovers riding the sinking ship as if it were a drowning bucking bronco yet the unembarrassed hyperbole of director james cameron doesnt injure  the film is all artifice but in the best way  cameron vigilantly captures the horrifying details of modern historys most infamous disaster and consistently shapes his scenes with the ideas of dread class and blind arrogance in mind  despite the rather clunky script and histrionic acting the film becomes some kind of alarmist masterpiece about an event of painful cultural humblingthis is largescale blazon as art which begs the question  can the idea of historical tragedy get across in a spectacle an inherently exhibitionist and factitious form of cinema  surface pageantry will capsize thematic ambitions without granting a final gasp  here though camerons gluttonous temperament binds itself to an extravagant action rhythm with a sharper sense of suffering and for the first time he seems to understand his characters as much as he does the machines and carnagetheres nothing enigmatic about the relationship between jack dawson leonardo dicaprio a thirdclass vagabond and rose dewitt bukater kate winslet a highsociety debutante ensnared by her snobfianc but the ripe vibrancy shared between jack and rose points toward a future that will never come for most of the passengers  the film isnt exactly tastefulcameron is all too willing to kowtow to the morbid fascination of catastrophebut it feels classy and the extraordinary special effects take on a certain elegancein fact i would argue without reservation that is the greatest visualeffects movie ever made  miraculously cameron uses those effectsand his own eye for thrilling aestheticsto magnify the youthful romance at the storys center into a contemporary romantic tragedy  the films final third in which the passengers gradually begin to realize their peril while the boat slowly sinks ranks as wideeyed spectacle that cleverly mines adolescent infatuation as a springboard for authentic terror and nightmare shock  as jack and rose cling to a wreckage rapidly being sucked under the icy waves the moment isnt quite heroic  instead their frantic stab at survival makes your stomach sink tooeric beltmann,sad
this comment will be quick but clear is a great film indeed i have loved to watch it once i dont think i will ever watch it again soon  the producer has done nothing new to this exploited enough story  it is true there were the pseudolove story with lo and kate but   it was a little to childish and it did not take me as a romance should do thats all i have to say but i really dont think it deserve more than a 7 but if you havent seen it once its a must,sad
okay it was a great movie one of the best ive ever seen i thought the plot was well done i thought the special effects and the detail of everything was amazing and i thought the movie did a phenomenal job of developing some other characters ie the string quartet during the sinking if only for their fifteen minutes of fame everything made it a full experience and i felt it was worth the five bucks to see it in fact i went to see it a second time the only weak part was that the ending took about two minutes too long but thats a minor pointit was a great movie but please the boat sank get over it,sad
for me was a particularly moving film as it had amultilayered theme to its credit on the one hand of course there was the tragedy of a great ship along with the massive loss of life involved which james cammeron managed effortlessly to be able to portray in all its sadness however it was for me more the somewhat subtle and ingenious use of the theme of young adventurous life coming into fruition then almost ruthlessly extinguished by events beyond anyones control jack and rose young lives seemed to be paralleled with that of the young life of the ship itself the fact that jack was so well portrayed by leonardo di caprio as basically a lovable little scoundrel fortunate enough to find the enigmaticyoung rose was a wonderful counterpoint to the film rose herself was shown in many touching clips through kate winslets acting to be just as vunerable in her young feelings and emotions as jack himself another thing that i feel this film achieved which makes it such a rare masterpiece is that it brought home to me a 33 year man the intangible link between youth and old age the old rose still pined for her young love many years after the tragedy of the sinking but had right from the start bravely resolved to carry on to live a full life her heart must have ached so much isnt that so like many people of today  ie carrying the burden of some loss though trying to live for tomorrow this theme i felt brought out the fact that older people do have experiences and emotive feelings well worth valuing another theme that i felt was wellaired was the vunerability of man to his own ego ie it was the captains desire to finish his career with a flourish that helped cause the tragedy to happen   the need for speed in a sense hope that my comments are echoed by others who watched this great film thanks for the timejim  289,sad
i think this is a movie for all times everything is perfect the music the actors the visual effects the storyspecially liked kate winslets performance  she should have won the oscar not helen hunt i also loved gloria stuarts role she was really convincing and deserved the oscar as wellthe biggest injustice was against leonardo di caprio one of the greatest actors of these times  im not a teen girl  and he was superb in his role as jack dawsoni also liked very much kathy batesthe final scenes are touching i think that you cant but cry as you think what happened that night specially watching those freezed dead bodies in the seaive seen the movie 9 times and dont get tired of itits definitely a masterpiece   dont miss it ,sad
let me say right off im a girl19 but i cant even pronounce leonardos last name  i finally saw like the last week it was in theaters  i kept saying naugh not now because i thought it would be a teenybopper movie with a lot of cute people in it  well yes and no  yeah theres cute people in it billy zane is the cutest p but this movie has a lot going for it  great writing seamless directing appropriate musical scores great acting bleah bleah bleah  ive wasted enough of your time i give it a 910 missing the 10 only because im so sick of that damn song,sad
many might disagree with me but i can compare with gone with the wind in terms of their being great movies both are love story movies and both are fractions of two of the most popular historical events  gone with the wind depicts the horror of war the horror of a sea disaster all caused by human lapses  is technically flawless so with gone with the windgone with the wind has already endured the test of time a classical movie will still prove its worth but surely it willmy point we should encourage and promote movies like these,sad
the score for this film and the soaring musical sequences while the leads are on the bow of the ship at dusk before the sinking will go down in history as one of the most unforgettable moments of movie making genius rent or buy the video if you havent already,sad
after seeing this flick had to read any materials i could on the subject read about 10 books and it truly is an amazing storyeffects laden it is a very quick moving 3 hour extravaganza,sad
this is a great movie the story is brilliantly written the actors especially kate winslet do a very good job and the pictures are so powerful all in all it is the most touching film ive ever seen and ive seen a lot of them by the way im a guy im 20 years old and i normally hate love stories but this is really cinema at its besti cant believe that there are people who disliked this movie how can one ignore the magic in this story to call it worst movie ever made is just ridiculous go watch godzilla or deep impact if youre looking for a movie that sucks i really loved this one and i think its a shame that some people have to spit on everything,sad
when i first saw this movie a year ago i was looking foward to an ok movienothing special but you knowwhat the hell  the theaters were packed fullall 3 showing the movie that is  when the music and the footage of the ship leaving dock first started my heart already ached because i knew the ship was the culmination of the worlds optimism  i also knew that it would sink killing 1500 people  what a lesson in human arrogance and stupidity  though the sinking of the ship was indeed sad it is the characters that make the story absolutely heartrending  the story of rose and jack two starcrossed lovers andrews guiltridden that he hasnt built a stronger ship unsinkable molly brown a mother who is saddened by what her daughter is forced to do but ultimately goes along with it the craven bruce ismay villains caledon hockely and valethenchman spicer lovejoythe list continues the technical prowess of cameron cannot be overlooked  the special effects were astounding especially when the ship starts sinking and you get the full impact of the size of the ship and the horror the passengers must have felt when they realized that the unsinkable ship was turning into a steel tomb  the music was perfect  i cant say any more  if you havent seen it youll know what i mean when you see it  and if you have seen it you already know what im talking about  and at the endwhoo boy  i didnt have nearly enough kleenex  i think my sister was the only dryeyed one there  there were times when i couldnt hear over the viewers snuffling  i saw it again last january and cried just as much well i finally got the movie a week ago and i promised myself i wouldnt cry  denied  i cried more than the first timei suppose i already knew what i was in for  if you havent seen it at this late date then by all meanssee it you dont know what youre missing  though it did have some rather corny dialogue the inertia of my roses life oh please i give it 6 of 5 stars,sad
wellwritten wellacted and just an awesome movie is what i can say about i didnt go to the movie on my bday in march 1998 to see leo i went to see it because i was curious as to what all the hoopla was about what i saw just took my breath away it was absolutely incredible how one man can have such an impact on any film and that man was james cameron there was such detail and such accuracy with the sinking of the ship including the blinking out of all the lights on board the postsinking just went through my bones like a cold chill i couldnt believe it people frozen to death people in lifeboats still calling to see if anyone is still alive and the final scene with jack in it because of this film i am studying as much of the as i can this movie will remain a classic for years to come,sad
james camersons epic romancedisaster movie  a film that made big at the box office but doesnt do too much for me  i have seen the movie several times  its half and half half romance  the other half disaster  what does make the movie set sail for me is the outstanding special effects  most worthy of an oscar as well as the set design sound and costumes  the plot behind the disaster is rather more or less a soap opera type love affair between the two young lovers leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet somewhere during the love affairi was reminded of the remake of king kong 1976  remember the love affair between jessica lange and the famous big gorilla,sad
hand it to cameron for making a film full of historical inaccuracy that would appeal to the largest of american audiences now future generations will always believe that picasso painted cubist works in 1914 and that turnofthecentury folk commonly said st and flipped the bird sure its visually appealing but the script reads like it was written on the back of cocktail napkins i havent seen such idiotic tripe since braveheart my thanks to the garbage people of america for making a success of this 200 million dollar film concerned with class struggle the liberal filmmakers are laughing all the way to the bank,sad
as a buff since the age of 5 i was very excited and impatient to see this filmthe whole of 1997 i was on pins and needles awaiting its release you cant imagine how crushing it was when it delayed from june to december  of course with that much anticipation i was worried that i might also be massively disappointedbut not only was i happy with the results i was ecstatic  this movie is simply extraordinary  it magnificently beautifully brings the back to life fulfilling ones dream of actually being able to sail on the mammoth linerbut what really drew me back again and again to see it was the radiant exquisite performance of kate winslet  she propels this movie with such grace and beauty that its difficult to take your eyes off her despite all the chaos going on around her  if the oscars were given out based on genuine excellence of a performance the statuette wouldve been hers unfortunately politics has to play a part so she was denied what was justly hers  but shell get it someday i know it,sad
yes great film i am not mentioning that man fine performances from kate not leo james cameron deserves all he gets,sad
the main reason why i watched this was simplei wanted to see how hollywood can waste close on 300 million on a film after leaving the cinema i thought they had wasted all this amount on some tripe and i said to myselfwhat could they have done to help some poverty stricked country the plot itself was one of the weakest of 1997 the leads were cardboard characters and the dialogue made me want to get up and slap them all crazy the computer generated graphics were so obvious esp when they did overhead shots of the ship sailing through the ocean polygon people anyone still however there are always good sides to every bad thing and the sinking of the ship was a feast for the eyes it was almost like you were there the details on the whole were very accurate and the costumes were gorgeous the ending was very sad and gave a human face to the tragedy but it didnt erase the first threequarters its an average film at best and a leo dicaprio trailerjames cameron ego satisfier and does not deserve all the accolades it has gathered,sad
rich girl falls in love with poor boy much to the dismay of her mother and fiance  hasnt this been done before  hasnt it been done better  hasnt it been done with dialog that is above the 3rd grade level  the last hour was very exciting but the first two were dull and predictable,sad
ive seen two times nowthe first time was at the moviesi noted a few historical errorscorny lines etcbut i was taken in by the scale of it allsecond timei watched it on video and i realized how crap it isthis movie did not deserve the money it madethere is also the small matter of the oscarsi have no idea how this movie won so many awardsrating110some of the special effects were not that bad,sad
look fabrizio look dolphins and one of them has jumped out of the waterat long last i watched this film with trepidation after hearing so many good things it started off impressively enough but when i saw the dolphins scene i thought oh no here we go  welcome to cliche worldhowever putting aside a fairly ordinary love story this film had some good acting impressive periodic detail and superb special effects unfortunately i had to use the fast forward button on my remote after the first third of the film because i knew exactly what was going to happen in the middle as with any other bog standard rich girl meets poor boy love story i couldnt wait to see how the ship was going to rest in its eternal bed under the seaand i wasnt disappointed i could feel the agony of those poor people trying desperately to cling on to life i almost cried when those bds in the life boats didnt return to rescue the people in the water and the special effects rated as the best ive seen in 1998 remember ive only just seen itconclusion i gave it an eight out of ten for special effects but took away two points for going on a wee bit too long with an uninvolving love story i dont rate this movie as one of my favourites but wasnt disappointed after watching it as i usually am with many cliched movies definitely one to see,sad
everyones seen this movie so ill omit any introduction and head straight to specific comments i thought the plot twist of handcuffing jack below deck of the sinking ship and managing to free him and still yet managing to make it back up despite the freezing water was way too much also the gallagher character and his stooge were too predictable in their badness nevertheless delivers a visual and conceptual whallop that lingers on in the memory and imagination,sad
i realize that is really the kind of movie where you love it or hate it for what it is and i must say that in all truth i side strongly with the love it categorywhen i first saw this masterpiece nearly a year ago i was in short amazed at the power director james cameron had achieved by setting up the actual disaster with a love story he was able to make me feel like i was right there on the decks of the as she sank below the atlantic surface seeing 1500 people freezing to death in the chilling ocean waters in the dark early morning of april the 15th 1912 i was simply shocked chilled mostly because of the realization that this is what happened also having known that cameron had labored so long and hard to get even the most nonessential details correct in his depiction of the ocean liners disaster helped me feel it toothere is definitely a lesson to be learned from quite a few really for one thing it is the ultimate reminder that no matter how technologically advanced we are god will always have the last word on everything perhaps the disaster was a reminder that we need to be careful what ideas we get about our power she is unsinkable god himself could not sink this ship said the character calanother lesson this one related to film if you are going to spend hundreds of millions on the making and marketing of a film at least make an honest effort to give the audience a story they can feel and be involved with recent films such as armageddon and godzilla i think have been hurt by this overwhelming realization by audiences the gross of which has hit 18 billion worldwide testifies a new hunger for movies that tell their story with really great effects in them rather than stories written around the idea of effectsi know there are many dissenters out there for this film but like it or not twenty years from now there will be a big rerelease for this wonderful epic and again the world will be caught in a craze and i will be telling my children about when first came out  just as my dad tells me now about when star wars came out he was floored as well like ninety percent of the rest of the moviegoing nation works so well because it hits so many basic levels of human feeling because it has such a strong understanding of what the devotion of love isand for those of you who call off and its success to leomania i went to see ten times in the theater i am not a big leofan and i know hes done better work than this i am 19 and im a guy going to see this in the theater not once in those ten times did the audience consist of at least 75 percent adultsa masterpiece nuff said,sad
im an american guy which i guess means that i wasnt even supposed to go see  it much less think it was goodany foreigners dont worry about itsi it was the other way around i spent 675 and went into the theater expecting a mildly good movie and i got 10 times more than that and then some to say that this was a stupid movie is well almost blasphemous by adding the love story it added life to whereby saving it from a disaster movie like so many other movies the sinking at the end was more than just a sinking it was the end of 1500 peoples lives bravo to james cameron for making such a great film although without a score there isnt enough emotion and james horner created one of the most masterful of all timethis truly is one of the greatest films of all time,sad
in no doubt from 1997 is the best film ive ever seen and will probably remain so for a long while james cameron has always been one of my favourite directors and this time hes made his finest work so far hopefully theres more to come of these top class cameron films one day in the end of april 1998 i went into the cinema to see and i had waited for months to see it i thought it would be a really great film i had great expectations because almost everyone who had seen it said i was so good and it was a thousand times better than i thought its an amazing story about the rich firstclass girl rose dewitt bukater kate winslet who falls in love with the thirdclass passenger jack dawson leonardo dicaprio who won his ticket with a lucky hand of poker and together they experience the kind of love we all want to have but seldom find ive never actually appreciated love stories on film but this film changed my opinion about what really makes a good movie its not just cool action scenes but also romantic love stories and has both of them the best parts of two totally different worlds of filmmaking combining the best special effects ever and a great love story this movie has everything great script direction acting music james horner is the best music composer of all time and a lot of other things the movie is so perfect theres almost nothing ive noticed which is wrong of course there are things that dont match the real happenings such as the flashlights from the lifeboat which never were there in reality but its not a documentary it is a film and everything does not have to be absolutely correct to make it a good film james cameron is the best,sad
tragedy as action movie entertainment bill paxtons lines at the end about not getting it could not have been more ironic there wasnt a genuine emotion in the entire film winslets performance was heroic but not even the wizard of oz could have breathed life into these straw figures not since around the world in eighty days has such a bad movie been so acclaimed,sad
this movie could have become a real disaster a love story between a rich girl and a poor boy  seen it a thousand times and it always had a happy end not so in camerons film the hits the iceberg  it could have been like watching a 50s scifi today again camerons digital domain with hollywoods most famous specialeffectsfactories on their side created one of the most spectacular movies ever some movies get all these things right but still do a very messy job  eg use plates with a made in hong kong sign on them however cameron paid attention to the details all in all the actors were really good and not only leo and kate but billy zane and co as well and the breathtaking cinematography and music combined with camerons monumental style t2 true lies the abyss gave a wonderful mix,sad
i saw in the first week it came out  i really enjoyed it  in school we were doing film music and i chose as an assignment  the role of music in the movie i am sure was the thing that added emotions and allowed to be one of the most emotive movies i have ever seen  i have given it a 10 and you will do well to do the samesend your comments to my email,sad
when i entered the theater to see the film i expected to see a romantic epic reminiscent of doctor zhivago or even the english patient unfortunately all i saw was a 200 million film about social inequality a la romeo and juliet  the plot was so thin and the characters so underdeveloped that one longs for the ship to hurry up and sink within the first hour and a half  the boat itself was not even that amazing  although the sinking scene was semiexciting it got old seeing the two characters run through hallways only to be met by a door  about half an hour could have been trimmed from the film by removing these ridiculous scenes alone it still amazes me that this film received so much recognition not to mention the amount of money it took in at the box office  the only explanation i can offer is that apparently twelveyearold girls have nothing better to do with their time and money than ogle at the mediocre acting abilities of the girlish leonardo dicaprio  the true atrocity of this film is not merely how mediocre it is but the fact that it won the best picture oscar when such films as the sweet hereafter and la confidential truly deserved it  this is not to say that i hated this film but that it was not by any means the best film of 1997,sad
i feel sorry about the families who lost their loved ones on that fateful night of april 15 1912 but this movie is a pure exploitation about the why some people think its a good film well at first this movie was good then i think this movie is overspent and waste of time because its a three hours and fourteen minutes of a ship sinking and about two lovers i did not cry in this movie because of the effects i got sick of it because of society exploit this movie too much like its a drug and i spent 650 for this garbage and the two studios spent 200 million for this crap its insane this about a rich girl who falls in love with a street punk its ridiculous and its not an extraordinary film you could recycle it to save the environment,sad
i do not understand how so many people can dislike this film it is one of the most amazing cinematic achievements to come out in years i also do not understand how people who go to see films like this only see its faults socalled bad acting script etc and not the good qualities it possesses of which there are manyi admit that i am one of the millions who have seen this film and was swept away by the raw humanity of it it is not just a romanceit is also a retelling of a tragedy that affected the entire world  2228 lives that were changed on a single night there are a couple of minuses in this film but those are nothing in comparison to the many pluses  the sweeping love story the wonderful performances the beautiful costumes the grand ship the humanity of it allis not just a cinematic achievementit has class grace and elegance it is the film of the decadeand it will no doubt change the style of hollywood filmmaking in the future this is not just a filmit is the retelling of a tragedy entertwined with a love story an overall saga that will touch your heart and last in the memory for long after you leave the theatredeserves a 10chell,sad
in some ways i can understand why some people hated this movie i agree that its overhyped and did not deserve either best picture or best actress the love story was cliched and lame dicaprios acting has seen better days check out basketball diaries and whats eating gilbert grape for a true picture of his talents though this wasnt really his fault but camerons rather badly written script and the script wellwhat can i say its really an action picture after all some important details leading to the sinking were glossed over or totally ignored such as the wireless operators role in the tragedy the californian ignoring pleas for help etc however the movie  is already quite long and in order to fit the love story in and develop the characters enough for us to care much needed to be left on the cuttingroom floor personally i dont have a problem with this documentaries and more historically realistic films about the have already been made this is meant to be a hollywood movie not a documentary or even good art cameron never leads us to believe that hes trying to make it anything more than it is and for what it is camerons is an excellent movie the only real problems i had was the underdevelopment of certain characters namely kathy bates as molly brown and victor garber as thomas andrews both these characters were far more interesting in their small roles than the two leads and its too bad cameron chose not to expand their roles even if it meant a fourhour movie i would have gladly sat the extra hour the other problem is the two leads as i already said dicaprio may have been miscast but his character was so inherently uninteresting and perfect that i doubt anyone could have done a better job he did look weird next to the voluptuous winslet however someone with a bit more meat on their bones perhaps who looked slightly older i dont know as for winslet well shes a good actress but oscar material hmmmm she seemed just a tad too um cheap and klutzy to pull off the role of a firstclass young woman with any believability a more refined and ethereal actress such as claire danes would have been a better choice also these characterss speech seemed too modern for 1912but i could be wrong here as for the sfx absolutely stunning and totally believable i really felt what it must feel like to be on a sinking ship the sequence with the band playing on as people either race about panicking or calmly succumb to their fate is extremely moving and made me cry more than anything winslet or dicaprio did this and the scene where the camera pulls back to show us thousands of people thrashing about in the freezing water chilling in more ways than one are perhaps the best in the movie horners soundtrack is moving and perfect though i could have done without the dumb and overplayed celine dion song during the closing credits best of 1997 maybe not but definitely up there with my favorites,sad
when i saw this movie i thought it was great it was the movie of my dreams ive always wanted to see what looked like below deck while it sunk mr cameron and his crew has done a great job with the special effectssome of the actors were good but im not talking about leo or kate they did an ok job not bad but not great either captain smith and the officers were made for their roleswhat i dont understand is why they had to bring in leo and kate there were so many other true stories that happened onboard but i suppose hollywood must include the ultimate love story and a bit of sex in all their movieshistorically i found it very good i didnt find a single goof when i saw it but theres always some they were beyond my knowledge ofgood movie worth seeing could be an introduction to the fascination story of the ship that were unable to sink810 two points subtraction for bringing in leo and kate,sad
im so glad to finally be able to get a sensible forum to utterly destroy this movie as it ought to be destroyed  what a horrible movie  i am utterly disgusted with the fact that this movie was even nominated for best picture  the rest of the films were outstandingly well made  the sunk and i am grateful first off this movie was way too long  and why were kate and leo even there  what purpose did they serve other than to try to humanize the movie by introducing a devastatingly unoriginal and lamely wrought love story the only purpose i could see was to lure people in and hit them with all the accustomed commercialist junk we always get nowadays  i saw the same if not a better love story in aladdin and whose idea was it to have perfect characters  leo is the perfect poor boy  billy zane is the evil suitor  kate winslet is the femme fatale none of the writers seemed to realize this and gave them what would have been classic movie parts without any grace or charm that the actors could manageably pull off i left the theater utterly disgusted and reflecting i should have seen la confidential or good will hunting again  those were films  was a waste of time and money and im glad i have convinced all that i could convince to not see it,sad
i loved this movie it was moving and caused me to sob at this unnecessary tragedys occureencei thought that both leo and kate were amazing and portrayed the characters not only efficiently but to the point where you have to remind yourself that it is just a moviei truly enjoyed it and agree with many writers when they say that all girls wish it was them kissing jack because i too wish it was me kissing him maybe not on the though,sad
i thought that was a pretty good movie i dont see why it was as big as it was but oh well i think that billy zane cal put in a very good performance his was a very intense role and i think he did better than kate or leo another thing not all women rave about leonardo those who do are mostly teenagers like myself however i like men no offense leo i think that the graphics in this movie were very good except when they were zooming out on the at sunset where the whole thing and the people looked very unrealistic sorry dont mean to bash anyones work because i know that this movie took a lot of it all in all very entertaining i enjoyed this film    810,sad
first of all i want to clear something up someone made a comment about ceramic plates dont float on waterthats right but not on salt water a lot of things that dont float on plain water floats on salt water simple things like that were carefully thought out during the making of this film to see what it would have been like inside a sinking ship well about the film it had excellent special effects except for that overhead shot of the ship when one of the crew men went up to the captain it almost got me fooled but the high swinging arms gave it awaycgi overall this film made a lot of money and a lot of people came to see it that i guess is whats important and not what critics think critics like me,sad
first lets talk about the actors kate and the old woman were in nomination for an oscar i dont think kate is a bad actress shes ok but her acting in this movie is not at the level of an oscar maybe im wrong  for the fans  but the actors of the movie dont seem to feel theirs roles acting is at the level of a bseries moviefx the specials effect are more at the level of a 60 millions budget movies than a 200 millions movie class when the camera is away from the boat computered people looks more like a matches man than real people when i look at starwars new edition georges lucas have make a really good job i have to give one point to james cameron i like when some dude fall down and hurt the propeller of thehuman tragedies many have said that is one of the greatest disasters ever it is true but the way it is shown looks more like a joke than reality if you wanna see a movie of this kind see saving private ryan or even deep impact we are not talking about 2000 deads but millionsthe best point of is costumes they are really nice,sad
yes its a beautiful love story but i feel more importantly was the vivid portrayal of the sheer terror over 2000 people experienced that dreadful night of april in 1912  the scenes of all those people running and screaming extending their lives by mere minutes by going to the highest part of the ship rather than giving in to their destiny really exemplifies the instinct of survival for as long as possible  it was a very educational movie for young people who did not learn of the tragedy yet and was also a marvelous film for people who knew about the already  you could really put yourself in their shoes and feel what it would have been like it makes you ask yourself many important questions including 1  why must we segregate people according to class etc 2  if you were a man could you have behaved like a gentleman and stayed behind 3  if you were a wife could you have left your husband on that ship and gotten into the life boat without him 4  if you were in a lifeboat and people were screaming for you to help could you have just rowed away to protect yourself 5  how would you have handled the loss of family members in such a horrible way this film will go down into history for its excellence and will continue to be viewed by millions of people forever,sad
terrible actors ok i went to see the tragedy of the ship sinking not the tragic two lovers i mean come on if i wanted to see that romeo and juliet is the thing to see i was disappointed in my opinion the the really sunk,sad
i expected to see a masterpiece given the hype related to this film  but all i got was 2 and half hours of cliche ridden dialogue and the most unconvincing romance between two leads since bill and hillary  admittedly the special effects were good as was the period recreation eg costuming set design  but overall the film failed on many levelsdid we have to get the class struggle entrenched in every frame of the film do we seriously believe that being rich is such a trial and so boring that one would prefer to go riverdancing with the third class to learn how to live did we have to see kate winslet naked what was the relevance except for the perve factor and why if you were aboard the when it was sinking would you keep getting off the lifeboat as ms winslet does with frequencyif i were billy zanes character why would i bother trying to shoot leo and kate when he was afterall on the  it was sinking for gods sakein short what could have been a good movie was hampered by appalling dialogue and atrocious plotting  it seems to me that 300 million dollars was spent on the sets costumes and special effects and the story was lifted from a number of 1930s and 1940s hollywood stories eg the rich girl meets boy from wrong side of the tracks or vice versa cant we get something a bit more sophisticated in 1998 instead of regurgitation of old plots,sad
one of the best movies i have ever seen excellent technique  excellent music and perfect handling of the known tragedy any other way it would have been boring and more of a documentary film,sad
why as good as it gets did not win for best picture over is beyond me is at best an average movie but some pretty impressive special effects the story however is not believable and nor are the characters i found it too long and lacking character development i would advise everyone to see it but dont expect it to be up to its best picture award,sad
nothing on earth could come between them exactly excellent film i gave it  12 out of  stars because there were many goofs that simply couldve been prevented leonardo dicaprio isnt the best actor but he definitely gave it his best in this film i saw it 4 times and im still not tired of it i hope they have another where jack lives,sad
i was quite disappointed to read all the negative comments regarding such a great movie paying tribute to one of the 20th centurys greatest tragedies true it was not perfect but then what in life is  above all this movie does not let us forget wht happened that fateful night in april 1912  my eightyear old son has always been fascinated by the  well before the movie came out  seeing the movie really opened his eyes  its one thing to read about the tragedy but quite another to actually see it  even if it is only a recreation  i believe that james cameron did an outstanding job bringing the plot and the actors to lifefor those of you who thought the movie was well below standards why did you bother to take the time to write about it  if you have nothing good to say then dont bother saying anything it at all  if it was not  such a good movie then why all the oscars and the excellent reviews  some people love to hate what is great it is the one movie that can bring out a whole range of emotions from a human being from happy to sad reassured to scared and then frightened  i think that kate and leo did a wonderful job  as well as the other actors and actresses it will always be a classic in my eyes,sad
i loved the plot of this movie and was happy that it got all the oscars that it did i thought the oscars were right on the money have fun watching this movie and make sure you get both of the great soundtracks,sad
this movie has everything you could possibly desire its got great sound great music great digital effects great actors great sets great scriptthe list goes on and on if you havent seen this movie then put on your shoes and run down to the video store at once and enjoy your eveningim sure you will,sad
would you people give it up already  half of you havent even seen the movie but you just like to criticize for no reason just like some of you probably did to saving private ryan fake characters  ok lets think about this how do you know they are fake  kate winslets rose could have been like any rich person on the ship and leos character you dont have any record of just like you didnt have records of some of the real people that got on the ship by mugging passengers before they got on it  so who cares if they are fake  how dumb of an excuse is that to criticize this movie waste of 200 million  yeah yeah right sure not one of you could have come even close to making this the film it is  leo sucks  now you are just full of jealousy and since leo is an overrated actor i admit that he is that since hes in the movie you have to say its horrible  well for those of you who actually think that he is like the same character he is in the man in the iron mask why dont you actually watch this movie because those of you that have said why it sucks is because of leo have obviously not seen it  his acting and many others are great in the film ok maybe not outstanding but nor were the ones in gone with the wind you just make them out to be  all special effects yeah ok here are another group of people that didnt see the movie because the special effects dont really kick in into the last half hour of the film is with all those effects that you would actually notice to criticize  they are throughout the film but they are so clear you dont realize it  so why dont most of you just give it a rest because none of you have any idea what you are talking about you just figure since is the biggest film around you should criticize it  you arent siskel and ebert so no one really cares about your closedminded opinions  some of you may feel it was overrated but just because of that dosent make it suck  i dont know one person or have seen one of your reviews that have gave such a real reason to criticize it  its only problem was the script and it wasnt a real problem  so what if it had a few bad lines  not every film is written by quentin tarantino so you cant expect a pulp fiction in every script written  so just do us all a favor either actually go and really watch the movie or shuddup,sad
i have noticed many people blasting the academy for awarding 11 oscars to  however i have not really seen anyone offering other movies that were more deserving  this is mostly because was one of if not the best movies of 1997  remember that the oscars are given for individual years and not for all time  1997 did not provide many standout movies with the exceptions of good will hunting and la confidential personally my vote for best picture would have gone to good will hunting but i cannot blame people for thinking that was the best picture of 1997 because quite frankly what else was thereanother thing that bothers me is that many people say that the storyline is horrible dialogue is bad etc  did get nominated for best screenplay  no it didnt so it doesnt make sense to me that people would complain about that since the academy obviously recognized better stories than that of  the same holds true for dicaprio and i will admit that in my mind winslet and stuart probably shouldnt have received nominations eitherperception of the movie is vital to the viewers opinion  if a person goes into looking for a love story that person is sure to be disappointed because in my opinion the love story should be viewed as secondary or complimentary to the sinking ofall in all i feel that is definitely not one of the best ever but certainly it is one of the best of 1997,sad
my  whole   family  has  seen  it  and  we  all enjoyed  it  quite  a lot i  have  seen it  11  times  and  loved  it  each  time   would  have liked  to  have  seen  more  of  the  real  people   portrayed in  longer performances  than  just  fictional   characters  cause  it  was  them that  really  lived  and  died  in  the  real   but  it  is  still an  excellent film  and i  will  watch  it  many  more  times,sad
i was looking forward to this film for quite some time  although i was not a big fan of prettyboy dicaprio i always have like james camerons work and i enjoy kate winslet being british of course  i did however expect it to be just another story nothing being new  over here in britain the hype was not that big  i am a major film freak but i only heard about the film 2 months prior to its release  so i missed all the rumours of overbudgeting angry actors and flops so on its day of release i wandered to the cinema to check out this film that i had heard about  and oh my god i have always had a morbid fascination of the ship itself belonging to the historical society for over 5 years now  but nothing prepared me for the range of emotions i felt during this film  i left the cinema with misty eyes and heart so full of despairing hope that i needed some time alone before attempting conversation with anyone what an absolutely superb account of one of the most terrifying nights of the 20th century  for the first time ever i was transported back in time to feel the passengers confusion despair heartbreak and outrage  and seeing all through the eyes of our very own kate winslet  i was so relieved when she left the confines of her restricted life to embark on a journey of love with the young jack  i was laughing with them as they outwitted the awful lovejoy as they ran through the ship  i was smiling motherly as they explored one another and rose made the decision to leave the ship with jack but it all collapsed around them i felt their startled confusion as the iceberg hit  their decision to alert the horrible cal and roses narrowminded mother only to have jack accused of stealing and taken below  but rose wouldnt leave him and doing what i would have done she left cal to rescue her beloved jack  her bravery marked she was pushed into a lifeboat descending into the black water never looking away from jack as he waited on the doomed ship above  this is where i fell apart  i couldnt believe she was going to leave him  but she jumped back on board only to be chased back down into the bowels of the ship by cal you know i think it was essentially his fault that jack died  if he hadnt chased them jack and rose couldve made it to a lifeboat i have nothing but respect for the actors who brought these people to life for the first time in my life i felt as though my heart had been touched by the sight of such unbreakable love only to have my heart ripped out well done james cameron leonardo and kate  thank you for making me realise that life is what you make it  and thank you for teaching me that there are people who let nothing on earth come between them,sad
big ship glub glubfilled with bad actors and killer graphics i think it was way overratedkate was ok but i never will like leo hes got great potential for an actor yet not that manish,sad
im sorry  was i the only girl alive who really couldnt see what all the fuss was about soppy dippy wet and that was just l dic  and the plot had me cringing in my seatthe thing isim usually a sucker for romantic tragedies but something about this one really grated  it was too polished too ohlookatmewithour3milliondollarspecialeffects to actually care about the development of the characters or the plot  ldc  kw are never given a chance to emotivate their characters and really they became so annoying by the end that i was just wanting him to die and get it over withthe bits i did find moving were the sinking scenes  the doomed mother  kids the old couple and the band who just kept playing as the ship sank however the atrocious dont let go lovedeath scene ruined any sentimental feeling that i might have been persuaded to cultivate  i really advise you not to see this film unless you cant find anything better to do with the small hours of monday morning,sad
thats to mea perfect summary of the american cinemathe breakfast of cal and rose is like the breakfast in citizen kanekane and her wifethe face of leonardo dicaprio at the bottom of the starcaise is like clark gable in gone with the wind and the irish party in third class is like the john ford moviesseeingyou can see the cinema of david wark griffith john ford or david oselznickgone with the wind producerthe only reason to critic this movie are its simple dialogues thatsometimes seem ridiculousthe rest is epicromanceadventure and a great lesson of cinemathe gone with the wind of this era people usually hate this movie because of its great successis the number one in historic top officebut is not a bad moviethe plot is simple but i think the ritm of the movie is greatis a classic love story of two youngsi think is wonderfula really masterpiece underrated byphenomenonif you like the cinema see this movie,sad
what was james cameron thinking how did this get 11 acadamy awards and why why did they pick that geek leonardo dicaprio he was an awful actor he couldnt act great even if his life depended on iti do have to admit the only part was cool is when the ship crashed and started to sink that was awsome but other than that it suckedif there is a guy out there that likes this you are gay,sad
it has now been five years since was released into theaters and broke box office records by taking in more than 500 million worldwide due largely to teenage girls the story soon became familiar to everyone poor boy leonardo dicaprio falls in love with rich girl kate winslet won eleven out of fourteen academy award nominations including best picture and best director james cameron this movie made leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet box office stars leonardo dicaprio became the biggest teen heartthrob since corey feldman while kate winslet became the hottest woman in hollywood this for me was most evident when these two kids in my sixth grade class made a wallpaper it was nonnude of her on the teachers computer however even with all the positive press this movie was getting some people felt that was not all that it had been hyped up to be those people felt that was really nothing special the acting especially that of leonardo dicaprio totally sucked and some people claimed that the best part of this whole movie was when kate winslet stripped naked before having her youth immortalized as one of the girls in jacks book even after hearing all of these negative comments about this film i did not let them have an impact on my viewing of it first i think we all have to remember that this movie is coming from james cameron the man who brought us the terminator aliens the abyss produced point break and wrote strange days terminator 2 judgment day true lies and tvs dark angel this movie made james cameron probably one of the most successful directors in hollywood even before james cameron had never ever really experienced that much success with any of his previous filmssecond look at this film for what is which is a fictional love story in a historical setting not a historical romance third this is the most expensive movie hollywood has ever made costing 200 million to make director james cameron risked his entire career as well as sinking paramount studios into bankruptcy it was a very very big gamble that fortunately for james cameron and paramount studios would pay offfourth im a guy i dont care to see leonardo dicaprio and i didnt watch this movie just to see kate winslet strip either but i watched because im a fan of james cameron and i have been since the terminator fifth i know that this is one of those movies that when there is a wide range of comments about it that it is best view it for yourself and then make your own judgment that being said ive watched at least ten times since 1998 and i still dont know whether or not i hate it or like it but i give an eight out of ten based squarely on my own viewings and not popular opinion,sad
the top grossing movie of all times and 11 academy awards winnerwhat else can you say about this movie except that at that time there were many people that watched it 3 times a dayso if you havent seen this movie make your own decisions should you watch it or noti would say that it is one of the best moviesall you people out there saying that this is terrible put your minds together and do something better than james cameron did in this movie probably deserves all its success,sad
i was skeptical when i first went to see the movie with my wife i had heard it was a chickflick and that the director had incorporated fictional characters into the real life drama i was pleasantly surprised when i left the theatre the movie delivered a compelling and factual account of the disaster intertwined with the fictional main characters jack and rose were important to the movie they really told the story of so many of the actual victims who remain unknown to this dayclose to 1500 souls went down with the ship the movie helped me to see their struggle to survive and what were the shocking effects of hitting the iceberg the tragedy at the world trade center certainly correlates with the disaster for modern times this movie has piqued my interest so much that i viewed the exhibit when it came to cleveland in 2002,sad
evidently the reputation of this blockbuster continues to nosedive like the ship and like dicaprios standing as he loses his teenybopper following he has failed to grow out of his chrysalis will he ever tom cruise is pushing 40 and still coming on like a 20 year old i feel the movie sets up quite an intriguing fictional frame quite skilfully in the first 20odd minutes not unlike king kong and then blows it the moment roses mother utters the words were all praying not to hear they say shes unsinkable mores the pity this comes just after the amusing tease of not showing rose as she alights from the cab until weve peered under her big edwardian hatfrom then on dialogue cliches anachronisms falsifications of historical fact national stereotypes and the absurdities and contrivances of the plot pile up until the films credibility is foundering long before the vessel does why do the lovers make out in a car is this a first when she could have smuggled him into her stateroom with its fourposter bed note too how in between their 1990sstyle bursts of nookie the starcrossed pair manage to be on hand for every plot development its rose who quizzes an admiring andrews about the lifeboats capacity and she and jack are snogging at the very moment of impact which is far more juddery than in reality since few passengers noticed it somehow rose wades through freezing water for minutes on end clad in her filmy dress without taking any harm i know dame winslets naturally well insulated but not even a sneezeits beyond a joke when murdoch a gallant officer is smeared as a corrupt suicide cameron had to pay 8000 to charity to make up for that bit of hokum but many of the errors are venial and some grisly enjoyment can be drawn from the spectacle of multiple death just as a little can be had from the curiously cursory contemplation of the ships luxurious appointments in the earlier scenes which experts have warranted authenticon the whole though sitting through these three hours feels like being forced to drink an enormous sickly cocktail for relief try the pure draught of icebergcold water provided by the british antidote eric amblers and roy ward bakers a night to remember which sticks to documentary reconstruction and distils more pity terror and catharsis than mr camerons 200m budget and tin ear could begin to generateps when people rave about box office as if numbers guaranteed quality tell them that inflated 1997 ticket prices are responsible for most of it tickets sold bums on seats for the great popular epics of the past such as gone with the wind were far more numerous,sad
after looking through the comments on this film i am amazed not only by the number of negative reviews but also by the number of long rants against  to have received so many votes of 10 and so many responses of dissatisfaction among the membership here suggests to me that this movie does what any great movie should do  inspire discussionat the heart of are the compelling contradictions of the human experience  the ingenuity of man balanced against his arrogance the desires of power and elitism balanced against true and sacrificial love and the continuing journey for gains both material and ethereal  these contradictions are presented in a movie that is firstrate in every area of filmmakingthe two comments i most take exception to are  that the movie is too long and that it was merely fodder for teenage girls fantasies about young leo d  first i love long movies and with todays everincreasing costs i always feel like im truly getting my moneys worth with a long movie second a quick glance at the voting breakdown among the imdb membership shows that the highest rating by group was 76 among males over 45,sad
it seems most the comments i have read either think the movie sucked or was excellent  i think it was a good movie the special effects were good and the attention to detail was good but it wasnt a particularly good storyit was dragged out about an hour too long and definitely didnt deserve the best picture oscar  overall i gave it a 710  very overrated,sad
take any cheesy love story worthy of mills and boon set it against one of the worst shipping disasters of modern times being sure to pad the story out so the film overruns by at least two hours add in some ground breaking special effects and you have yourself an oscarwinning epic 1997styleanachronisms abound rose giving the finger  i half expected her to say kiss my ass the class warfare angle is ridiculously overplayed and just in case we really dont get it no mention is made of the fact that the had classes of accommodation other than first and steerage presumably the second class passengers spent the entire time below deckswhen the truth doesnt fit the class agenda cameron simply makes it up  witness the steerage class passengers locked below decks while the toffs boarded the lifeboats and the officer who murders several passengers before turning a gun on himself a shameful fiction which did not please the real fellows living relatives cameron was forced to apologisewas condemned in some sections of the english press as an antienglish film in truth its simply a lazy movie which exploits hollywood clichs hence the englishaccented villains and twists the truth to suit its own prejudicesin summary is a dull uninspired film which does the story a disservice if this is the template that cameron is using i sincerely hope he doesnt have a 911 movie in the pipeline could scarcely have been less credible if cameron had filmed an allout action adventure with arnie in the title role and it would surely have been more entertaining,sad
there seems to be alot of bad reviews for this movie these days which i find pretty funny considering it has made more money than any other and it is tied for more oscars than any other how could this movie be getting such bad press well you could say it was all those teenage girls going back to see it over and over again which im sure accounted for at least 500 million of the 18 billion or you could say that we were all brainwashed by the greatest hype machine ever created so much hype that it even won almost ever oscar catagory on the ballot but the real reason is this movie is the ultimate big screen movie ever made this movie just isnt the same on a small screen its completely different as a matter of fact it is so different that i give it a 7 at home and a 10 at the theater if you have seen the movie in both places then you know what i am talking about,sad
watching this film is much akin to having several hundred hot needles jabbed into various areas of your body a horrendously long soppy woefully acted and clichd movie experience that send shivers down my spine when i think that i actually had to watch this trash the highest grossing film of all time what a great testament to the power of modern marketing,sad
what a disappointment this movie was  the story is completely unbelievable would any mother who loves her daughter subject her to being forced to marry a complete clod someone so despicable that he is capable of doing the things this character does in this movie  i think not,sad
its hard to be too objective about this classic and people far better than me have given far superior reviewsdetails of this movie here so i will simply sum up my opinion by saying crapwhat a waste of space and money this junk is and as for winning so many oscars,sad
all the professional reviews of this film call it a masterpiece while i am willing to admit that the film is very good in many respects especially in its historical representation of the events of the one and only voyage two things one a small personal preference and the other a glaring truth degraded this movie to the realm of very good but not greatthe first thing that turned me off to this movie was the fact that it was waaaay to long  i have a rule that i go by that movies should not break the 150 minute mark unless there is a very good reason  granted the plot is good enough to draw many viewers in for that long but i though that some of the scenes were just embroidery little morethe main reason why i didnt like this movie so much is the glaring fact that the whole rose and jack romance could never of happened in the first place  nobody is willing to acknowledge that fact  it is historical fact that first class passengers on the or any other ship of the time period would fraternize in any way  not even to say hello when walking by one another on deck  i cant get over that factfinal review  good movie fairly predictable well cast very historically accurate but flawed in two telling ways  65 out of 10,sad
i am not as much offended by this movie because of its historical inaccuracy it is true that for all the hype about how the china carpeting and furniture reproduced exactly those of the and how the ship sunk exactly in the way described by the movie and so on the plot is entirely fictitious and proud of it in itself that is not bad whats bad is how cheesy and clich this plot is and that this cheesy clich and invented story occupies 90 of the movies attention with the sinking of the ship treated as something on the side the only important people are the main couple jack and rose her fianc and her mother the remaining characters are treated with a disinterest that borders on disrespect we only get to know that the thirdclass passengers are funloving and warm and those in firstclass are stuffy snobbish and exceedingly preoccupied with dinner cutlery wow isnt that new the whole thing is so fake it was really difficult to get minimally interestedthis movie is the triumph of hollywoods latest formula followed also by armageddon and pearl harbor some action for the boys romance for the girls everybody happy though from the comments ive read here from boyfriends dragged kicking and screaming to see it maybe im wrong about everybody being happy in the case of it worked leos fans went to see the movie over and over again sending its boxoffice gains into the stratosphere truth to tell it is too much to ask of a megazillionbudget movie like this to be anything but clich it just had to be meretriciously agreeable for the largest possible number of people so anything adventurous minimally controversial or profound was out of the questionbut as i said so many people liked it so what do i know however if you are interested in seeing something really related to the watch the british movie a night to remember the special effects are not so cool and it is in black and white but it is far more accurate and infinitely more dignified,sad
first off i will comment on the movieis a very but not completely accurtate telling of how the sank so many years ago rose an early 20th century woman trapped in a world where woman didnt have many rights not even voting is about to end her life before jack stops her making a long 3 hour story short jack and rose fall in love the ship sinks and almost 100 yrs later old rose is asked to retell the story ofi really liked this movie they did have a few twists and people said the love story was predictable but really would you even call it a love story if the characters ended up hating each other the effects were awesome the scenery breathtaking the moral of human triumph over disaster clearly stated and the plot was decent done before but still decent a mustwatch movie that takes you away on a tragic voyagenow in refrence to those who say that this is the movie made famous by teeny boopersduring 2001 a remake of the planet of the apes came out it has made millions its riduculous how much money that movie made another movie came out that same summer moulin rouge very good movie unique different and while it has flaws twenty times better that planet of the apes however it didnt make as muchso how did such a horrible movie get more money theyre called young males between the ages of 21  40 they think the movie rocked and it was fantastic but most people would agree it sucked badlyin 1997 came out and guess what those young males who happen to also give really low votes in the voting demographicthought the movie was awful and claim it was all because of teeny boopers that it was popularthe next time they blame something on teeny boopers young males should start thinking about the hundreds of movies theyve made popular despite the movies being hundreds of times worse thanmy point apparently young males have worse taste than teeny boopers,sad
its strange i really liked this movie before leonardo because famous  now that hes famous and hanging out at all the local hangouts in hollywood and causing trouble its thwarted my opinion of his acting skills  i will review this movie as if i saw it without knowing about leo  ok it was great  i loved the scenes and the character portrayed by billy zane who people say i look like was perfectly evil  i have seen lots of movies which involve love but this movie happened to really capture the intensity of love that exists between kate winslet and leo  i admit the scene in the car was goofy  but the scene in the dining room was splendid  i hated the part where leo screams that hes the king of the world  movies like this and saving private ryan make us so much more interested in history  i agree that this movie was good  but heck i just love history movies  three thumbs up,sad
is a good example of triumph of substance over art or advertising budget over quality no doubt it is visually impressive the story in its broadest outline is a sure winner but where is the genuine feeling for its period characters are made to act as a modern audience might think they would have done in the early part of the last century without a sense of period this version could never be a truly great film it also suffers from utilising stereotypes excessively from a hostility to the edwardian upper classes from both america and britain and also a poor choice of actor in some of the key roles the relationship between the two principal characters is also highly improbable in that era  and rose dewitt bukaters slutish behaviour highly unlikely not to mention reprehensible for a supposedly well brought up girl,sad
let me get one thing straightjames cameron is a great directer but this is entirely uncharacteristic of his types of movies he should stick with what he made famous and that is the scifiaction genre is such a sugarcoated load of crapnot only is it painful on the eyes it is painful on the ears with that godawful song by celine dione at over 3 hours it is simply gruelling to watch leo dicaprio is a terrible actor who looked about 5 or 6 years younger than he actuall is kate winslet is talented but this talent is wasted the movie doesnt know whether it wants to be a teeniebopper chick flick or an action movie and the bizarre transition from one to another is even worse i have watched many movies that top the 3 hour mark that i have thoroughly enjoyed gladiator black hawk down terminator 2 but these movies use the length to benefit the story while simply uses it as an excuse for more explosions more soggy dialog and an excuse for winslet to get naked i am not bias to the love story genre but this just takes it to a new level of badness how it won best picture is beyond me 410 stars i admit i have seen worse,sad
although this is a good movie i would so not mark it as the best picture of the year decent acting  a running time that does not feel like 35 hours dicaprio as the lead is ok but dont look for him to ever have another monster hit he has peaked with this one the funny thing about this movie is that alot of the people who praised it at first have pretty much forgotten about it good but no where near great,sad
this is the best movie ive ever seen its very historically accurate they even used the same type of wood that was on the real i dont know why some people dont like this movie every time i read a bad comment i ask myself do these people know anything about the real or have they even seen it the actors were great as well as the special effects,sad
i am a guy i like this movie no i am not a girly guy neitherfav movies nb killers fight club die hard matrix sixth sense gia watership downand yes dont get fooled into thinking this movie is bad by these other idiots its just because all the teeny boppers liked it which means they cant like or they will be viewed as slets just say if this movie wasnt overhyped and didnt make as much money nothing bad would have been said its also not on the imdb 250 list because all the hoi polloi dont own computers or dont come to this site and cant voice their opinions like the fight club crowd here me includedi thought leo and kate were awsome and i thought the script was great it is very easy in life to bash something people put a lot of work into why dont you go try acting or writing a script or hell even getting a jobpeople here bashed the dialogue why well because like i said they are idiots listen to people in day to day talk listen to yourself as you talk to your girlfriend wife or whoever no one talks in poetry or in artsy dialogue the dialogue in this movie is accurate that is how everyday people talki think james cameron did a brilliant job and had a lot of balls for making such a costly picture i am so glad pearl harbor was a failure because while cameron was really trying to make a film the pearl harbor team  disney were just out for moneyyou cant say j cameron was out for money nothing this big had every been done and he was at risk of losing a lot of money what would you say if it had only grossed 30 million at the bo exactly shut up1010,sad
preiceburg this film is one of the most boring of all time with a cheesy romantic plot after the iceburg it gets more interesting but is still pretty dreadful i particularly hated the awful song you know which one i mean it is also inexcusable that american script writers took one of the actual crew of the and turned him into a murderer why couldnt they have made up another character if they had to have a gunwielding officer,sad
uggh  this piece of crap unashamedly pulls every heart string and bandies about the myth that was the worst shipping disaster ever  this is just not true  oh sure the sinking was a horrible tragedy but this movie in terms of human suffering beats the real event hands down,sad
technically is outstanding  it attests to camerons and crews knowledge of how to use the big screen effectively  the overwhelming size of the subject the ship that is is suited to the largest screen you can findhowever if you watch it on television the models and special effects are less dazzling and less overwhelming and you fall prey to the urge to pay attention to the plot characters and dialog which reveals just how weak a movie this really iswhere did cameron go right  he combined a harlequin romance with terminator  the first half or so of is a generic romance story which never fails to draw audiences  but to keep it from becoming a chick flick it turns into action and suspense as soon as the ship starts to sink  what other reason can we come with for the heroes to go back down into the sinking ship seemed to be the watchword for the plot after that when kate finally emerged for the last time i fully expected her to turn around and say oh wait  i left the stove on and the windows open and run back downstairs one more time  so its calculated to appeal to the widest audience imaginablegone with the wind meets die hard looking at the box office figures id say he calculated that appeal pretty wellwhere did he go wrong1 well i shouldnt go into how bad i thought most of the romance scenes were  a lot of people believed them so it seems to be a matter of taste personally i believed the romance scenes about as much as i believe that milli vanilli did their own singing  i dont know whether to attribute it to bad writing bad directing bad acting or just plain bad karma  the romance scenes feel very conflicted as if the actors were wishing for better lines or as if they were having some disagreement with the director about interpretation  you can always tell the difference between an actor who is into the part and one who is just going through the motions following orders with little understanding of his characters motives leonardos courtship of kate felt like the latter more than the former2 he got confused by his own narrative  all the scenes on board the fatal voyage are supposed to be seen through the eyes of kates character  yet we see things she couldnt possibly have known about or guessed  the narrators point of view slips back and forth between firstperson and flyonthewall but it keeps insisting that its only firstperson narrative3 so what did she tell the diving team about the fate of the jewel the whole reason that shes telling them this story is that theyre searching for a jewel in the wreck and she claims to know where it is  throughout the movie the camera is very careful to follow this jewel so that we know all about its comings and goings and can track its path through the sinking ship  in the end we know the fate of the jewel and she knows the fate of the jewel but we never know what she actually said about it  did she lie to them  no the lie would have been acted out in the flashback she was telling unless what we were seeing wasnt really a representation of her firstperson narrativesee previous paragraph  did she tell them the truth  i think its possible to avoid spoiling the plot by simply answering most definitely not  did her listeners get so engrossed by her narrative that they felt ashamed at their greed and became resolved to abandon their quest and devote their lives to more spiritual causes dont know  the movie doesnt tell us  so the one thing that provided the impetus for the whole story is abandoned and this thread is left dangling loose  dont pick at it too much it might cause the whole thing to unravelviscerally is engrossing  intellectually it falls far short of the mark it seems to be aiming at  if youve never seen it and plan to see it just accept as your mantra william hurts line from the big chillsometimes you just have to let art    flow over you,sad
this film is basically a success story which owes its popularity to marketing and special effects  the film itself suffers from dialogue which belongs in the 1940s although the actors involved do their best to make it realistic enough to be watchable  only an american produced movie about the could have an american hero and a brit villain get off the brit villain line america its way past old  in short the film is certainly watchable if only for the effects but the story behind this movie is parallel to the topic itself  opening with a blaze of glory but you know its gonna sink,sad
ill start by saying i loved this film  i thought it was beautifully done and i loved leo and kate everyone should go check out heavenly creatures by the way  but everyone has heard why this is such a good movie  i do want to say that if it werent such a popular movie it probably wouldnt be criticized nearly as much  people want to hate what is popular and theyll find ways to scrutinize this movie to death  one of the main problems seems to be that cameron brought a fictional story to the rather than one of the real ones  yes but then you can say that about most war movies or books for that matter  i dont think the real people of the were ignored at all  we got to see the different classes and ways of life in a combined story  or people say he didnt spend enough time on molly browns character but how long do you all want this movie to be  if i was going to complain about anything i might mention that the second class seems to have disappeared from the ship  but again the movie is already over three hours long i know that feeling when you seem to be the only one to know about something or someone and then it becomes household  ive always been incredibly interested in and knew all those random but real stories that all 9th grade girls now know  i have loved kate winslet since heavenly creatures was made and leo since i saw him in basketball diaries  remember when noone knew who either of them were  but this really doesnt matter my point is let something be popular without feeling abliged to stand out and hate it  just because it is mainstream doesnt mean it is bad,sad
when michael bay made pearl harbor he must have been watching this film over and over again he repeated many of its strengths and all of its weaknessesboth films are modern retakes on unforgettable historical events both feature spectacular special effects and appealing talented actors and both films are rendered mediocre by the same weaknesses a hackneyed clicheridden romance plot and the weak clunky dialogue that accompanies it add in a few twodimensional stock characters to back up our young lovers and youve got the modern hollywood version of the historical epic kurosawa and lean must be spinning in their gravesnonetheless i have to give cameron some credit he may not have made a really great film since the terminator or maybe aliens but hes never made a boring one to my knowledge entertains in spite of its weaknessesit moves along at a good clip and is wellphotographed cameron certainly captures the look of the erathe bulk of the credit for this films success however must got to the two charismatic leads dicaprio and especially winslet do an admirable job with the limited material theyre given the scene that worked best for me was when rose has to rescue jack whos been left handcuffed in a room thats rapidly sinking below the waterline after trying unsuccessfully to get men to help herthe expected course of action for a young woman of her timerose grabs and axe and sets out to rescue her lover swallowing back tears and her uncertainty we see her in that moment taking the first steps towards becoming the bold confident older woman charmingly portrayed by gloria stuart in the modernday sequences camerons very good at showing female characters finding previously untapped depths of character and strength and he successfully goes back to that well in if only hed punched up the dialogue and done justice to some of the secondary characters could have been a great film as it is its just okay 710barely,sad
until kate winslet and leo dicapprio had been the most gifted young actors of their generation both capable of quite extraordinarily profound insights into the human soul given their tender years in james camerons oscarwinning film they constitute one of the most attractive couples in movie history and so they became world superstars but as i see it they deserve their fame it is a tragic thing to see acting greatness remain more or less unsung or underrated and in kate winslet supplies a magnetic and powerful performance moreover the scenes depicting the sinking of the ship are thrilling to behold is in short a fine film which made megastars out of two magnificent young artists a compromise between artistic integrity and commercial clout,sad
is a good movie the main thing is the details and the atmosphere that it generatesit has a great musical score and cinematography is excellent too but all in all this movie is a bit overrated in my view it has loads of directorial mistakes i think it deserves oscars for music cinematography art design and plot and not more it is a pitty for oscars that it got 11 awards strange things have happened in this world,sad

i thoroughly enjoyed this movie the first time and the second time im not one that usually enjoys romance in a movie but this was different the acting cinematography writing special effects everything was excellent james cameron deserves every penny he made from this film and the film deserves every oscar it won la confidential cant hold a candle to its like comparing the mona lisa to an elvis on velveti cant believe some of the people with their negative comments about this film but i guess if some people can believe oj and bin laden are innocent anythings possible,sad
i find it hard to relate to those of you out there who hate this movie  bad acting  terrible dialogue  well were all entitled to our opinions i suppose but for me this film is a wonderful experience  its there to be enjoyed hate it if you must but youre the ones missing outis it perfect  no its a bit tricky to make a perfect movie but if youre so fussy that youre looking for all the errors in a film that you cant ignore them then again thats your problem  personally i loved it ill forgive the few and what i consider to be minor errors and look forward to owning it ,sad
my favorite film of 1997 and perhaps among my alltime greats its a tad too long but has two good elements love story and history it is the finest recreation film ever as it should be with a 280 million budget i really enjoyed the budding love between dicaprio and winslet the whole disaster thing and the sadness of it all i found this film has the most depressing scenes ever a grand ship sinking forever many people freezing in the water jack giving young rose a sad pep talk rose letting go of jack seeing all the floating corpses old rose in bed surrounded by her beloved pictures and the final meeting with her lover jack and all the passengers in the final dreamlike sequence winner of 11 academy awards and a definite tearjerker that should appeal to female viewers,sad
this movie is so over rated that it should have won an oscar for most over rated movie of all time di caprio showed that he could act in basketball diaries but this mush surely wasnt worth the money that he earned,sad
yes he was right there is one sr born every minute this movie proves that enough of those were born to carry this waste of celluloid to 16 billion dollars in gross earningswaste of celluloid no wait thats a gross exaggeration actually you could snip out all the scenes with leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet shorten the sinking scenes by 12 add some historical characters and end up with a glorious 1 12  2 hour movie because as it is this movie is a gross slap on the face of all those who lost their lives on that ship who seemingly died so that kate winslet could live her life to the fullest extentthe movie well its unwatchable completely totally unwatchable as it is that is if you are not a 15 year old girl with a crush on dicaprio for the rest of us the movie drags incredibly slowly honestly i only wanted for the thing to start sinking after the first hourotoh the sinking scenes are terrific way above average very very good but whats the use of those scenes when you have to endure the pain of 1 12 hours of romantic nonsense especially when there is absolutely no chemistry between the main charactersi have another idea steal some scenes from a night to remember cut the sinking scenes from and make a new movie that would be good but no hordes of screaming girls would attend the movie so no box office records could be made so no hollywood director would attempt to do itthat is the real tragedy,sad
in a bygone era james camerons would be considered cinematic filler not worthy of being eligible for consideration among the greatest in the medium however in 1997 the packaging of a stale love story around expensive special effects was more than enough to garner this film an undeserving rout at the academy awards in march of 1998the films main strength is the recreation of the actual sinking of the ship the cinematography and effects for doing that were first rate however all of that is undone by the story and moreover the questionable selection of the lead actors especially in the case of leonardo di caprioin summary is essentially a chick flick with some special effects thrown in to convince guys otherwise that may have worked in 1997 but four years later sorry,sad
well here we are four years later looking back at the phenomenon thatwas i was in sixth grade when it was released and i wassurrounded by hundreds of young girls seeing it seven times in a rowjust to get a long look at leo and this movie won best picture thetruth is that leonardo dicaprio is not a very good actor hes no betterthan the other teenybopper actors out there like freddie prinze jr orryan phillipe i mean look at the movie he made right after this thebeachback to the film itself its simply a love story that weve seencountless times attached to a horrible tragedy thats all why so manycritics and audiences fell for this is something ill never understandit was simply a onehit wonder just about every single person i knowwho liked that movie back when it was in theaters barely even thinkabout it anymore as for james cameron hes one of the most egotisticalpeople in hollywood when the guy shouted that he was the king of theworld at the oscars thats when i knew that he doesnt care a jotabout anything other than cash not to mention his appearance onsaturday night live when he lit his cigar with a burning hundred dollarbill he takes a horrible tragedy a film that couldve lasted about twohours or so and pastes in a formulaic cliched love story to boost itup to 314if youre one of the few people out there who still hasnt seen thisfilm i say just skip the middle section and just go to the sinking ofthe ship that is the only place where you will get any of the intensityand suspense that this film deserves i think that half of thepassengers who died on the wouldve been embarres,sad
this movie was disappointing  it lacked genuineness  yes the attention to detail regarding the recreation of the was excruciatingly correct and that i cant complain about  but at the heart of the matter the cheese ball romance between the main characters ruined this movie for mems winslet and mr dicaprios characters were too farfetched and both of their performances seemed overblown and campy  after watching the oscar acceptance speech of their illustrious director i no longer wonder why some people may think of mr cameron as a mad genius  my opinion is that hes just a megalomaniacal freak  to be fair the crowd i went with to watch this flick all cried at what were supposed to be the touching moments  so perhaps im a little too hard boiled the one bright spot i can think of was kathy bates performance as the unsinkable molly brown  she is a fantastic actress and if her performance was campy and over the top thats because it was supposed to be  she had it down in spades  overall this movie was a dry disappointing experience,sad
there were three good sides to this film the beautifully filmed sinking scene the sets and costumes and billy zanes performance add to that the tragic story of the real naturally besides this that theme song is irritating kate winslets performance sucks and her character is simply annoying and pretty cleancut di caprio isnt believable as his character looks wise that is his performance is not bad his double performance in the man in the iron mask is better much much better all in all i dont think the movie deserved all that hype and i definitely wouldnt vote for the as the best movie of all times still it was a clever idea to use a famous tragedy as an excuse for a lame attempt of a love story,sad
the worst film of the 1990s the screenplay is nonexistent and  the acting is beyond incompotent except for kate winslett are we really suppose to believe that nazi aryan race poster boy leonardo is a poor working class guy with his neat clothes and very clean blonde hair the sinking is quite amazing but two and a half hours of dreary love story is simply mindnumbing james cameron is nothing but an inflated ego and hasnt directed anything since cos he realises we all know this film is rubbish and hes talentless now that the hype is long gone we all realise how horrifically bad this overblown cliched hollywood weak excuse for a movie really is if you want to see the real best picture of 1997 see la confidential which in my opinion is the best film of the 1990s avoid like a bad cgi i mean iceberg,sad
when i first saw this film in the theater four years ago i thought i was witnessing a masterpiece in action now after the dust has settled and the hype is over i had a chance to review my review i now think what was all the hype about  in my book the film gets a solid grade b at best theres no doubt the star of this film was the special effects without that its just an average movie  the writing was corny and the acting had a lot to be desired first and foremost the woefully miscasting of leo dicaprio as the hero his looks are more like a newspaper boy than worldtraveling artist how am i am supposed to accept dicaprio as a lover when he looks as though he has yet to have his first date billy zanes acting was not much better his character was cartoonish i halfexpected zane to twirl his mustache if he had one saying curses foiled again kate winslet seemed to be the only main star that acted well and had decent lines now if james cameron with his expertise in special effects had joined in with a great documentarian such as ken burns together they could have created the greatest documentary of all time,sad
is the cinematic equivalent of a popup fairy tale book for children complete with cardboard characters and a plot that would be laughed out of junior high its story and cast of ogres and heroes would be cartoonlike but somehow manages to be more twodimensional and is so drawnout that it seems the voyage is filmed in real time its astonishing popularity i can only credit to a world wide stupidity epidemic perhaps passed on by ships ratswe start shipping water right from the start with the introduction of jack the main protagonist he is dressed in period garb but may as well have stepped out of a rap video for all the sense of 1912 he conveys he sleeps rough every night yet manages to wash his blond hair daily funny about that the rest of the crew and guests resemble nothing more than ones and zeros in the shimmering computer simulation we know the ship to bebut hark a lookout has spied something huge heaving into view  the iceberg  the real star of the movie appearing at last alas no its james camerons ego steaming toward us bent on wreaking havoc below the waterline armed with his deathly dialogue and with no way to pump out the bilge water of his drama fast enough there is no escape and we are doomed to slide beneath the cold dark waves,sad
if i had to describe my impression from this film in one word the word would be irritation james cameron made a badtasted show of one of the greatest tragedies the plot is simply stupid the lovestory of main characters is absolutely unbelievable and misplaced it would be better to set such story on a board of some fictitious ship resembling if you like meanwhile the film about itself must be as realistic as possible however if cameron failed in presenting the tragedy of the disaster he succeeded in presenting its horror visual effects are great i gave the film two stars for the sake of the only one scene  that one where the ship breaks into two pieces its really impressive on a large screen becomes worth seeing only after the ship crashes into iceberg and even then it is spoiled by absurd behaviour of main characters furthermore the casting is bad i liked only billy zane as villainous cal and victor carber as unhappy constructor mr andrews and also some insignificant passengers and members of crew  dicaprio cant act at all winslet is not very bad but the role is not for her well may be its not the worst film in the history of cinematography but one thing is certain  i will never voluntary see it again,sad
i think thatas movie watcherswe all have at least one film that we wanted to like so much that a disappointment would just be too much to handleone such film for me wasthankfully it did not let me downalthough the movie is not without its imperfectionsill talk about the great things firstnever has the ship been more masterfully recreatedi guess it took all this time to have the technology to do sothe special effects are indeed the best i have seen in any filmas for the acting billy zane really steals the show from our two heroesleo and kateas the greedyrelentless cal hockleyzanes performance is one of the better i have seen when it comes to villainsthe recreation of the ships final moments is spellbindingthe moment that touched my heart the most would have to be the nearer my god to thee sceneyou are not human if this moment does not touch you to some degreethe only complaint i have with this film is the use of humor in some questionable placesfor exampleas rose is battling to free jack from his handcuffs and rescue him from certain doomhe utters the lineill wait right herei certainly dont think one liners would be appropriate in that situationthough some may disagreeoverall this film is a great blend of fiction and real lifeand if you can sit still for three hoursi definitely recommend it,sad
unforgettable and almost unforgivable as far as me falling for this hype and that exactly what it was  hype  i remember asking god to help me forgive myself for falling for this i am going to be nice hypei gave it a 5 for this reason only the special effects were a 10  it did deserve an oscar for the effects but that is all  i remember mr dicaprio whining about not being nominated for a best actor oscar  well with due respect to the young thespian i didnt think he deserved to be nominated either  and the theme song by celine dion  i like ms dion but that song here was the twist to that song  when it was played dance music style i loved it  the original version though i wanted to hang myself the more it kept playing  well i just had to tolerate it while it was onhowever many people liked it as the movie  song of 1997 and i have to respect that  my pick was la confidential as far as best movie was concern and i thought their sound track was better  i can look on the bright side though kevin spacey won the oscar for best actor for la at least there is justice,sad
yuck  normally i can lose myself in a movie at least the first timebut i found myself picking apart this overlong bucket of drivel before i got halfway through  only a very good performance by winslett as well as a surprisingly decent dicaprio performance is keeping me from rating this movie 310because all of the other acting in this waste of celluloid is horrific  the special effects are okay the soundtrack is good well at least until celine dion opens her mouthbut this picture had about as much business as ghost in getting nominated for much less winning a best picture oscar510,sad
i agree this movie has a completely weak plot weak character development weak screenwriting weak direction when it comes to actors which is probably the most important aspect but anyway if for nothing else enjoy this film because of its technical mastery right by definition this is not a good film however you sometimes have to give in and just be ya know blown away by everything this film does right even if it misses some of the most important elements i dont know what a critic like pauline kael wrote about this film but it was either one of two things praised the craftsmanship ignored the acting etc or damned the whole film well thats fine because a movie like will always be remembered for its absolutely glorious special effects and amazing editingcinematography see the movie just to sit back and be truly entertained by hollywood grandeur 9510 technical achievement 410 most of the important stuff acting and what have you 67 okay ill give in 710 overall,sad
this movie is one of the best movies ive ever seen along with braveheart gallipoli the godfather and scarface  the film has such good actors who can change their mood from bright and happy to terrified and sad  definetly worth watching and the ending made me cry every time i watched the movie and ive watched it about three times  is a classic,sad
is ok it is the sort of film that really satisfies when it is first seen especially in the cinemas however when you watch it again or think about it the flaws are all too clearthe script is the main problem some of the lines are absolute stinkers for british viewers the two cockneys in the crows nest are dreadful to all americans out there noone in britain says bleeding christ and the acting could have been a bit better there was not much chemistry between di caprio and winslet and this makes the love story a bit on the unreal sidehowever the film is a winner on the technical front hard to believe that a director would be so keen to get a full size replica of the but cameron does and it looks impressive on screen the effects are superb as well  except the iceberg which looks like a great big blancmange so no argument about the technical oscars but come on best picture i dont think so and kathy bates was awful still 510 but winslet di caprio and cameron will all do better than this,sad
many people think this a great movie many people think it is a waste of time and money in my opinion it was okay many people think pearl harbor was a wannabe of this movie but pearl harbor had good acting in this movie the acting was poor for instance jack rose jack rose was pretty pathetic spoilers of pearl harbor in pearl harbor the girl thought rafe ben affleck died so she moved on to danny josh hartnett the love story had nothing to do with the iceberg crashing the love story was actually needed in pearl harbor also pearl harbor had to do with us history i know some of the parts are false history but  some of it is true the us didnt want to go into war but after the big bombing they had no choice the reason the japanese bombed pearl harbor was because the us cut their oil line but lets get to many parts were pointless james cameron didnt have to make the ship on the brink of perfection in other words he didnt have to make the replica look exactly like the real one it must have been hard for the actors and actresses to get along with cameron the love story was pointless though too the only thing the love story was needed for was the drawing if the drawing wasnt found would of not been discussed i cant believe people went to see this movie anyway they knew how it was going to end it was given away on the radio with the hit single my heart will go on they took certain lines from the movie and put it non singing parts the good things in this movie was the costume design that deserved an academy award hands down but i dont think it deserved best picture will get 510,sad
there are only a few things that keep afloat first fact excellent cast  mind you im not one of those leonardo dicapriofreaks  with excellent performances second fact nice ship third  and last  fact beautiful music from james horner the huge number of goofs for is famous but also annoying my best friend came over to watch this movie  she had seen it twice but said a third time cant hurt a person  and started spotting mistakes every two seconds i was surprised to find out she was right after having a close look  my face nearly touched the tvscreen  most movies james cameron made  terminator 2 aliens  are spectacular and such but all of them have lots of goofs seems that has broken a new record if you insist on knowing what exactly went wrong go to the goofs section small details i know but dont tell me its not annoying when you are watchingi hope that telling you that is filled with goofs isnt regarded as a spoiler because anyone knows it even if you didnt see so why watch it well it features the most known and biggest boat of the twentieth century its unfortunate maiden voyage a profile of some of the many passengers and probably the most beautiful soundtrack ive ever heard in my entire life id say a 810 should be enough,sad
it will be another 25 years before a picture like this connects so well with the masses  the last film to do so was the immensely popular dr zhivago just like zhivago this film has seemed to fade away as time has passed gone but not forgotten as director after director attempts to recreate james camerons masterful film  if you didnt like the love story the special effects amazed you  if you didnt like the length the sets and waredrobes amazed you  there so much well done about this film that you couldnt possibly find something worth admiring  the only film to come close to achieving pure entertainment is the empire strikes back,sad
james cameron has done a good job making one of the centuries big block bustershe has used the tragic accident as the background and mixed in a great love story about a poor kid and a rich women this is really a big budget movie and it is not hard to figure out whybecause they had to build everything new and some of the fx when the boat sinks are just amazing the plot of the movie is not very deep and the 3 hours goes by like 2 hours and 50min we must not forget that this is a big tragedy and that the love story is just fictionit is not one of my favourit movies but i have to give james camron credit for making a big budget movie like thisif you are a guy between 15 and 30 i advice you to go and pick up a die hard movie insteadbut if you are a girl or women then this is a mustpsi did actually see some boys coming crying out of the cinema,sad
okay okay weve all seen there are so many reasons that i like this movie and ill share them i have seen 5 times to date and enjoyed it every time ive read some of your comments not all of them there are 90 or so and to all those people who think this movie is  it seems to me as maybe some of the people who write here claiming worst movie ive ever seen are really just crying for attention as the guy who hated i think james cameron did a fantastic job with this but the question still remains why did everyone see this and not any of the long list of movies some people would say leonardo and i agree he does draw crowds some would argue the special effects and again these were great but the real reason is that james cameron made the movie with something in it for everyone for the ladies leo for the men kate for the sadists lotsa people being frozen for the historians an almost perfect recreation of the for the women who love a good tearjerker the tragic story of jack and rose for the music lovers a fantastic score by james horner for everyone who likes a bit of action the intense edgeofyourseat last hour there truly is a reason for absolutely everyone to see this movie for all those people who dont fit into any of the above categories youve seen it too why because youve heard about how goddamn good it is and rent it it is a perfect example of brilliant marketing my absolute congratulations go to james cameron you made everyone in the world see your movie and you reap the benifitsglen maddernps i mean no offence to anyone blah blah blah feel free to email me at maddernmindlesscom if you think im wrong or right or just plain stupid or if youre james cameron,sad
this review was made by my daughter dana york univ toronto canada a double tragedyi had initially refused to see on general principle not wanting to participate in this blatant celebration of hollywoods most devoted suckers however out of sheer boredom perhaps i finally consented to the pleas of my friends and paid the eight dollars to attend little did i know that what awaited me in that darkened room was worse than anything i could ever imagine in case youve been asleep for 2 years directed by james cameron mildly resembles a love story that supposedly took place upon that illfated oceanliner the the premise for the film is typical guy meets girl girl is from higher social class and will not succumb to guys advances finally after much personal anguish and deep thought she gives in to the overwhelming emotion and together they fight the oppressive opinions of the people around them it is by no means an original story line we have all seen this numerous times before with alternate settings what actually happens in three agonizing hours against the backdrop of that historical tragedy is the most ridiculous waste of money i have ever been victim to the characters in the story were in a word ridiculous i sat back watching in disbelief as the onedimensional personalities produced tears in my fellow viewers leonardo dicaprio that prepubescent heartthrob of seventh graders everywhere took on the role of the good guy similarly there were others to fit the roles of good girl and of course bad guy all of whom overacted to an embarrassing extent with the aid of the outrageously simple dialogue the star cast acted not unlike an elementary school drama ensemble i sat through this film in a constant state of pain as the film gradually deteriorated it has to get better i thought to myself dodging the wet tissues that were being passed through the audience unfortunately did not get better despite the films numerous attempts at evoking emotion mr dicaprios nauseating performance and ms winslets complete lack of talent were the only things that managed to raise goosebumps on my arms riding the bus on the way home i again tried to find any salvation for the film i temporarily consoled myself with thoughts of the technical aspects the special effects involving the sinking of the ship were mildly amusing however that too was quickly obliterated when i realized that most of the effects had been created using miniatures and an oversized bathtub i continue to hear people rant and rave about how great was only confirming my suspicion that the majority of the north american population are like the films heroes shallow and easily amused furthermore i was sickened as i recalled the numerous oscars that were handed out to the man responsible for this disaster mr james cameron many are convinced that he is a wonderful human being after all he refused to accept a salary for his work i believe that he did this out of shame rather than personal sacrifice naturally the fame and recognition he received as a result of this film makes all his future endeavors instant hits i cringe at the thought everyone behind the release of should retire immediately as it is an insult to the art of filmmaking and to filmgoers throughout the world its cast and the billions of dollars wasted on its production need to be studied very carefully scholars everywhere need to forever use it as an example of how to make a film void of interest originality and selfrespect,sad
the movie was a great movie the first thousand times after that the movie just seems to get longer and more boring i dont know what the big fuss was about i guess cause they found a cute guy to do the part of jack dawson,sad
engaging story about a large boat we have quite convincing evidence here that james cameron actually is king of the worldpossible spoilercontrary to her seeming sincerity rose lets go,sad
some love it some hate it  but no one remains indifferent to it  the fact that can raise such passionate raves and rants even three years after release testifies of the impact it made  as for me its in my top ten probably forever  sure the story lacks sure the dialogue was wooden at times but that movie stayed with me for weeks after i saw it for the first time  few movies have done it for me to that extent,sad
a 200m budget 2000 passengers on the 3 hours plus of film and what do we get for it two  count em two  fictitious stock romantic characters three if youre feeling generous and count cal plus a few walkons even the itself isnt much more than an extra another writerdirector could have told the same story on a real ship in half the time at a hundredth of the cost its all told as a flashback so there are no surprises in the plot and i spent most of the last twenty minutes muttering just hurry up and die will youim not saying its a bad film its merely overlong and overrated there are some very good moments especially after the begins sinking and we get to meet some other characters good special effects generally good performances i particularly liked david warner a good musical score and wonderful sets i suspect though that eventually someone will make a tighter more interesting film set on the and this one will sink without trace,sad
stop talking about how great this movie is it had a nice story good acting and good special effects this is the most overrated movie in the history of film people have forgotten the classics like godfather gone with the wind and star wars the story isnt that great because i knew exactly how it would end the acting was the same as most movies and the special effects were pretty simple compared to most big budget movies that have been released in the past ten years  out of  long live star wars,sad
i will start with some positive comments the setting of the movie was definitely incredible the final hour had some very intense moments and overall was just about enjoyable howeverwhen you get past the initial razzle dazzle of the film and actually sit and think about what you just watched it really starts hitting home how mediocre the movie really wasthe script is a prime example of where the movie falls flat to put it very bluntly it was awful the supposed witty and funny comments such as the comment about sigmund freud came across as so very tackythe plot was just as bad as the script underneath the glitz was really just a very bland love storyi guess my other big gripe was the length did it really need to be that long personally i dont think so it could have cut the film a great deal leaving a much better end resulti have to asked myself whether im being to critical considering the millionsbillions that it returned in profits personally i dont think so but apparently most of the world doesnt agree with me,sad
although is a documentary the embelished love story was all too predictable  kate winslett did not win me over nor did leonardo different stars and a better hidden story would have made this a great movie  special effects were impressive,sad
simply a dazzling movie  the special effects are top notch and i loved the story line the ending with the camera going over the pictures in the old ladys room makes my eyes water every single time  kudosdefinately a must see movie not because its popular but because its superbly written and directed,sad
the most expensive movie of all time and the most successful of all time is a marvel of spectacle yet minimal on substance camerons magnum opus has every element youd expect from a hollywood epic  romance tragedy historical grandeur lavish sets and costumes eye popping set pieces and of course sexy actors  but somehow manages to achieve great results with the smallest amount of subtlety the film begins in modern day nova scotia where a marine archaeologist paxton stumbles across some tattered drawings whilst exploring the wreck of the famous ship for a priceless diamond the drawing is that of a naked young woman who appears to be wearing the proverbial diamond of great price and when paxtons find is broadcast on tv it sparks off some memories in 101 year old rose calvert stewart it transpires that rose calvert was in fact the socialite rose dewittbukater who was supposed to have gone down with the ship some 84 years earlier of course that was not the case and camerons film gives her the opportunity to set the record straight in 1912 she was going to america to wed her thuggish fianc caloden hockley zane when in mid atlantic she decides to throw off the shackles of her upper class oppressors and jump ship in a manner of speaking then she meets her knight in shining armour jack dawson dicaprio a down on his luck travelling artist who saves her in every way a person can be saved cue nauseating plot line so they meet he shows her the ways of the world by taking her to a party in steerage class she leaves her fianc he teaches her to fly paints her in the nude they have sex the ship sinks he dies and her heart goes on  and on and on and on so essentially it is just your classic tale of boy meets girl ship meets iceberg despite all the hype and hoopla is quite a mesmerising piece of work that delivers an endless series of thumps to the heart while provide little if any food for thought although the characters are essentially black and white morally unambiguous personages and the actors thespian talents are not really challenged by the roles and the dialogue has patches is purely prosaic note when dicaprio overhears the that the ship will sink he comments this is bad  very observant the film has a great deal to compliment it the opening underwater sequences are as eye catching as anything ever committed to celluloid the vast shots of the ship in motion are breathtaking and the attention to detail of the ships interiors are flawless however hackneyed the script may be dicaprio and winslet inject their limited characters with endless charm and the romantic romp is a shamelessly enjoyable roller coaster of fun and frolics yet it is only when the ship collides with the berg that the film kicks into first gear the panic terror and heartbreak of the sinking is viscerally recreated in all its gory horror proving once and for all that james cameron is the worlds foremost director of action sequences the aftermath is equally appalling having to be seen to be believedwith a running time in excess of three hours this film could do with being a little shorter and some of the sequences featuring the two leads trapped in the bowels of the sinking ship are excessive against its predecessor the highly commendable a night to remember can hold its own primarily for its brutal depiction of the ships final hours however it has neither the historical accuracy nor the emotional depth of the former criticisms aside is the movie that will reinvent blockbusters for the 21st century and while it is about a subtle as a hole in the head  or the hull if you must   you will not be likely to see a bigger film for many years to come,sad
i just cannot stand it anymore all the people who hated this movie mention the hype as their reason lets look at the factsa there were no commercial tieins with any other popular businesses like walmart or mcdonalds which is standard for a hollywood blockbuster these days look at star warts phantom menace i was actually able to get jarjar binks bum wipe literally thats hype and it all took place before the movie came out all the hype for happened after the film was released and it came from people who had seen it and loved itb there was no money left over at the end of production for a huge ad campaign this is a fact they almost lost out the first weekend to a james bond film because of this james cameron and some of the other producers had to hit the talk show circuit in hopes of avoiding a total massacre at the box officec the stars gave him no help leonardo was so sure that the movie was going to bomb that he did no public appearances before the movie came out he only hit the talk shows in about week 3 or 4 of the films release no one had faith in this movie not the stars not the studio heads no one but james cameron himself and he was willing to put his entire future as a film maker on the line by giving back his salaryall the guys who hate that i have spoken to are just jealous of leonardo they say the movie just made money cuz girls love him well if that were true then the beach would be the second biggest film of all time wouldnt iti dont think loenardo is a great actor and i personally believe will ruin is career because hell never top it and he is so sure that he is the reason it was a success but its a great movie overall and its not stardard hollywood fluff aimed at high school kids like american pie or teenaged sex farce 2263455283 as i like to call it next week another one will come out just like it add a 1 to the end of the number dont bother to name it but a movie like comes along once in a lifetime like gone with the windlobo69,sad
the movie is not great because of the love storythe movie takes off from the ordinary movie scene during the last hour of the moviewhen the actually sinksleo and kate play their roles duly wellthe only flaws in the movie were in the beginning special effects of the birdseye view of the ship and its passengers walking to and frothe plot generated interest and kept our virgin minds ready for the climaxnow you cant call the climax of the a climaxit beats all climaxes both in length of time and the way it hits youthe special effects were flawlessthe massive really sank and all those people really died in front of your eyesno purgatoryno trial nothingjust cold merciless deaththe part that moved me most was the frozen body of a lady with a dead childin the end while leaving the hall i remember staring at the sky asking why,sad
i have only flicked through the previous ten or so comments butoverrated seems to be the most common thing said  wellmaybe it is but i have seen it three times since it was releasedand it still manages to keep me glued to the screen for all threehours  what we have here is all the elements that make a goodepic film  a good solid storyline an involving love story and adisaster  nothing new by any means but the way all the elementsinteract works beautifully and kate winslets performance isflawless  this is bound to become a classic  i wouldnt giveany awards for originality but it is an extremely wellmadefilm with plenty of suspense and emotion that kept me on the edgeof my seat throughout each time i saw it  and this is fromsomeone who cant stand leonardo dicaprio  if you want tosee a bad film take a look at kate winslets next film hideouskinky which lives up to at least the first word in its title,sad
not only depicted the actual events of the sinking james cameron also added an emotional love story that touched our hearts it made the people more real and we could actually feel the horror and sadness that the real passengers may have feltthis movie was sad touching and even a little funny i would recommend this for anyone to watch is was excellent,sad
i have read a great many of the comments posted regarding needless to say ive come face to face with platitudes of spiteful criticism the films detractors seem to be beating the same arguments into the ground length dicaprio special fx camerons ego cliched dialogue not to say that these are all valid points to a degree but arguing the films cliched machinations is essentially becoming a cliche within itself moreover i notice a steadily increasing lack of originality in the complaints words like awful and stupid and all sorts of loaded language season every dissenting word i have yet to see a concise beautifullyarticulated dissent one that can explain contempt towards the film in a meaningful intelligent manner allow me to conclude with three final points 1 to dismiss the film as an overblown love story would be a pompous arrogant thing to do a disservice to the tragedy that the fictional tale is centered around 2 james cameron may be a lot of things but he is not by any shape or form a bad director  hes a competent technocratic director not yet in the same league as spielberg and lucas but he weaves tales that emphasize human emotion above human ingenuity and he does it in a way that puts the likes of bay bruckheimer emmerich and devlin to shame and 3 is not the most overblown overrated film of all time  that title goes to larry clarks kidsof course were all entitled to our own opinion the same way the academy is entitled to theirs but id hate to think that all the negativity heaped upon the film is built upon a foundation of spite and personal distaste rather than judgment based on its artistic merits,sad
now that the hype is over this movie shows itself as the hohum affair it is  the special effects cant make up for ordinary script and acting  it may have been a tour de force to create it but the overall result is a run of the mill hollywood movie,sad
